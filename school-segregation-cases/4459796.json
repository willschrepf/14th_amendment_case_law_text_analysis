In this business dispute over the ownership of Axiom, Schaefer\n                    asserts claims against her co-owner DeLitta for breach of fiduciary\n                    duty for DeLitta’s repeated and ongoing self-dealing and\n                    usurpation of corporate assets. ...................................................................... 1\n          B.        Schaefer has already successfully sought temporary relief enjoining\n                    DeLitta’s malfeasance, enforcing those prohibitions, and placing\n                    the company in a partial receivership............................................................ 2\n          C.        Axiom is a medical consulting company that provides injury\n                    management and medical advice concerning work-related\n                    accidents. .......................................................................................................... 3\n          D.        DeLitta, Axiom’s “Medical Director,” is not a medical doctor. ................ 3\n          E.        Yet DeLitta unabashedly portrays himself, professionally and\n                    personally, as “Dr. DeLitta.”.......................................................................... 4\n          F.        DeLitta’s fake persona is effective: clients and employees believe\n                    he is a medical doctor. .................................................................................... 7\n          G.        DeLitta justifies the title because he obtained a “Ph.D.” in\n                    psychology from a diploma mill. ................................................................... 8\n          H.        The trial court correctly determined that use of the title “Dr.\n                    DeLitta” is highly misleading when used by a “medical director” of\n                    a company in a medical-related industry and that enjoining DeLitta\n                    from doing so was necessary to protect Axiom’s corporate assets\n                    pending final resolution of this lawsuit......................................................... 8\n\n\n                                                                   iii\n\fStandard of Review .............................................................................................................. 10\nSummary of Argument ........................................................................................................ 11\nArgument ............................................................................................................................... 11\n\nI.       DeLitta misleads the Court by suggesting Schaefer asserts a statutory cause of\n         action under the Occupation Code......................................................................... 11\n          A.         The trial court’s injunction is based on Schaefer’s probable right to\n                     recover on her breach of fiduciary claims—a claim DeLitta does\n                     not even challenge. ........................................................................................ 12\n          B.         Violations of the Occupations and Penal Codes are the conduct\n                     enjoined, not the cause of action asserted, and prohibiting that\n                     misconduct is necessary to preserve the status quo of Axiom as a\n                     reputable entity free from civil and criminal liability. ............................... 13\n          C.         There is ample evidence to support the trial court’s determination\n                     that DeLitta was fraudulently holding himself out as a medical\n                     doctor. ............................................................................................................. 16\n\nII.      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that DeLitta’s\n         fraudulent conduct threatened Axiom with imminent harm............................... 19\nConclusion............................................................................................................................. 23\nCertificate of Compliance .................................................................................................... 25\nCertificate of Service ............................................................................................................ 25\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    iv\n\f                                              INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\nCases\nButnaru v.

In this business dispute over the ownership of Axiom, Schaefer asserts\n       claims against her co-owner DeLitta for breach of fiduciary duty for\n       DeLitta’s repeated and ongoing self-dealing and usurpation of corporate\n       assets.\n       This is a business dispute over the ownership and management of Axiom\n\nMedical Consulting, LLC. 5 DeLitta and Schaefer partnered to form the company in\n\n1999. 6 Over a decade later, the relationship between the two owners deteriorated and,\n\nin September 2013, DeLitta started taking drastic measures to unilaterally push Schaefer\n\nout of the company and undermine her goodwill within the company.7\n\n       Schaefer sued.8 Schaefer claims, among other things, that DeLitta breached oral\n\nand written contracts, committed fraud, and breached his fiduciary duties to her and to\n\nthe company.9 Her fiduciary claims include allegations that Delitta is depriving her of\n\nher 50% ownership in Axiom and her rights as a member and manager of Axiom, and\n\nthat DeLitta is engaging in self-dealing to the detriment of Axiom, including unilaterally\n\nrefusing to implement the resolutions of the Board and misusing corporate assets for\n\nhis personal benefit.10 Schaefer also asserts a claim for negligent misrepresentation\n\nbecause DeLitta provided false information for the guidance of others.11\n\n\n\n5\n   CR125–27.\n6\n  CR400.\n7\n  CR403–04.\n8\n  CR3.\n9\n  CR409–17.\n10\n   CR413–14.\n11\n   CR414.\n                                            1\n\fB.     Schaefer has already successfully sought temporary relief enjoining\n       DeLitta’s malfeasance, enforcing those prohibitions, and placing the\n       company in a partial receivership.\n       Upon filing suit, Schaefer immediately sought and received a temporary\n\nrestraining order enjoining DeLitta from interfering with her access to and position in\n\nthe company.12 Eventually, the parties entered into an Agreed Temporary Injunction.\n\nThe Agreed Injunction prohibited the parties from undertaking certain acts, similar to\n\nthe TRO, and also obligated the parties to file a joint motion for appointment of a\n\nprovisional member to break deadlock between Schaefer and DeLitta.13\n\n       Unfortunately, the Court is intimately familiar with this litigation from this point.\n\nThis is the fifth appeal that DeLitta has filed. Four of those appeals were attempted\n\ninterlocutory appeals.14      One was a mandamus proceeding. 15               None have been\n\nsuccessful.16 And, in addition to this appeal, one other remains pending before the\n\nCourt.17\n\n       DeLitta’s intentional, willful, and repeated self-dealing and violations of the\n\ninjunction—which harm both Schaefer and Axiom—have gotten so bad that the trial\n\n\n12\n   CR405.\n13\n   Id.\n14\n   See No. 03-15-00280-CV (this appeal); No. 03-14-000425-CV (appeal of order appointing receiver);\nNo. 03-14-00426-CV (appeal of an order enforcing the terms of agreed temporary injunction); No.\n03-15-00085-CV (appeal of order refusing to dissolve agreed temporary injunction).\n15\n   No. 03-14-00423-CV (original proceeding seeking to declare agreed temporary injunction void).\n16\n   No. 03-14-00423-CV (original proceeding seeking to declare injunction void, denied on July 11,\n2014); No. 03-14-00426-CV (appeal of an order enforcing the terms of the injunction dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction on November 6, 2014); No. 03-14-000425-CV (appeal of order appointing a\nreceiver over Axiom dismissed for failure to prosecute on October 17, 2014).\n17\n   No. 03-15-00085-CV (appeal of order refusing to dissolve agreed temporary injunction).\n                                                2\n\fcourt was forced to appoint a receiver over Axiom’s finances and books and to\n\ndisqualify DeLitta’s attorneys from jointly representing Axiom and DeLitta to\n\nadequately protect Axiom’s interests.18 The case is set for trial on October 26, 2015.19\n\nC.    Axiom is a medical consulting company that provides injury management\n      and medical advice concerning work-related accidents.\n      Axiom is a medical consulting company.20            The company provides injury\n\nmanagement for work-related and personal injuries for oil and gas companies.21 Axiom\n\nadvertises that it “employs Doctors, Physician Assistants, Registered Nurses, and a\n\nspecially trained support staff to provide a full suite of medical management services,\n\nranging from work-related injury case management to a multitude of customizable exam\n\nprograms.”22 It allows employees and employers “immediate access to [a] medical\n\nprofessional 24/7 for [employment-related] injuries.”23\n\nD.    DeLitta, Axiom’s “Medical Director,” is not a medical doctor.\n      DeLitta serves as both CEO and “Medical Director” of Axiom. DeLitta,\n\nhowever, is not a medical doctor. He is a physician’s assistant. As a condition to his\n\nlicensure, DeLitta must be continuously supervised by a supervising physician and is\n\n\n\n\n18\n   CR410.\n19\n   CR635.\n20\n   2RR56.\n21\n   CR400.\n22\n   CR324.\n23\n   3RRPX2.\n                                           3\n\fprohibited from providing any medical services unless his supervising physician\n\ndelegates services for him to perform.24\n\n       A physician’s assistant is expressly prohibited from “falsely represent[ing] that\n\nthe person is a physician” or from acting “in a unprofessional or dishonorable manner\n\nthat is likely to deceive, defraud, or injure the public.”25 These prohibitions are stated\n\nin a section entitled “Conduct Related to Fraud or Misrepresentation.”26\n\nE.     Yet DeLitta unabashedly portrays himself, professionally and personally,\n       as “Dr. DeLitta.”\n       Despite these statutory prohibitions against a physician’s assistant misleading\n\nothers into believing he is a medical doctor, until recently, Axiom’s marketing materials\n\nstated that it “is a privately owned company established in 1999 by its CEO Dr. Michael\n\nJ. DeLitta” and whose “mission” is “to transform Occupational Medicine.”27\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 28\n\n\n\n\n24\n   TEX. OCC.

He maintains a similar email address: occdoc66@hotmail.com.34\n\n\n\n\n31\n   3RRPX7.\n32\n   2RR50, 56.\n33\n   CR625.\n34\n   2RR56, 58, 59-60 (occupational medicine field); 2RR50 (email).\n                                                 6\n\fF.     DeLitta’s fake persona is effective: clients and employees believe he is a\n       medical doctor.\n       These public representations by DeLitta have left the impression to those in his\n\nwork environment that DeLitta is a medical doctor. Schaefer alerted DeLitta of the\n\nfalse impression he was creating as early as 2010. 35 Since then, several former Axiom\n\nemployees have also sounded warnings about DeLitta’s misleading conduct. Ashley\n\nSantoro, a registered nurse who was employed by Axiom for over two years, expressed\n\nconcern about the issue in her resignation letter:\n\n       I am also concerned over the fact we also are told to lie to our clients\n       about Dr. Mike DeLitta. Although, he has a doctorate degree - it is not in\n       medicine. He is not a medical physician but a Physician’s Assistant. I was\n       told to never tell this to our clients and we are always to say “Dr. DeLitta”\n       when speaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does not want\n       anyone to know he is not a medical physician as he solicits himself to our\n       clients as. 36\n       Former Axiom employee Shane Enochs, also a registered nurse, offered similar\n\ntestimony at the hearing on the temporary injunction. He testified that DeLitta used\n\nthe title “Doctor” both orally and in writing in connection with his employment with\n\nAxiom. 37 Staff members regularly introduced him, both in staff meetings and in\n\npresentations to clients, as “Dr. Michael DeLitta.”38 He never corrected or clarified that\n\nhis title as “doctor” referenced a psychology degree and not a medical degree.39 Mr.\n\n\n\n35\n   3RRDX21.\n36\n   CR351–52.\n37\n   2RR29.\n38\n   2RR29.\n39\n   2RR30, 34.\n                                            7\n\fEnochs was convinced, based on his observations of how people reacted to DeLitta,\n\nthat using the title “doctor” was misleading people into falsely believing DeLitta was a\n\nmedical doctor. 40 Even Enochs was misled. He testified that he himself thought\n\nDeLitta was a medical physician his first year at Axiom.41\n\nG.     DeLitta justifies the title because he obtained a “Ph.D.” in psychology\n       from a diploma mill.\n       Although he is not a medical doctor, DeLitta does have a “Ph.D.” from Newport\n\nUniversity, a web-based “education institution.” 42 Now defunct, “Newport University\n\nwas not accredited by any higher education accreditation organization by the United\n\nState Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.” 43\n\nThe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board lists Newport University as an\n\ninstitution that issues “fraudulent or substandard degrees.”44\n\nH.     The trial court correctly determined that use of the title “Dr. DeLitta” is\n       highly misleading when used by a “medical director” of a company in a\n       medical-related industry and that enjoining DeLitta from doing so was\n       necessary to protect Axiom’s corporate assets pending final resolution of\n       this lawsuit.\n       Deeply concerned that DeLitta was holding himself out as a medical doctor and\n\nmisleading others as to his qualifications, Schaefer filed a verified application for a\n\n\n40\n   2RR30.\n41\n   2RR34.\n42\n   3RRDX1.\n43\n   3RRDX1. Newport University appears on numerous lists of institutions known informally as\n“diploma mills.” CR347–48.\n44\n   CR349–50. DeLitta tried to convince the trial court that the “Newport University” listed here is\nnot the same institution that issued his “Ph.D.,” but this Court must view the evidence most favorably\nin support of the judgment.\n                                                  8\n\ftemporary injunction on December 12, 2014.45 The application was heard on April 15,\n\n2015. 46 The Honorable Orlinda Naranjo presided over the evidentiary hearing.47\n\n       On April 22, 2015, the trial court signed a temporary injunction enjoining\n\nDeLitta from using the title “Doctor,” “Dr.,” or M.D. in any context and removing any\n\nreference to the term Dr. or M.D. from Axiom marketing materials.48 The trial court\n\nemphasized that “[b]ecause Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides\n\nmedical advice, there is a substantial likelihood that DeLitta’s use of the ‘Dr.’ title could\n\nmislead others into believing that he is a medical doctor.” 49 As to harm, the trial court\n\nfound that DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct “is causing immediate and irreparable harm to\n\nAxiom’s reputation and may subject Axiom to civil and criminal liability thereby\n\ndiminishing its value and causing damages that are not quantifiable.”50 This harm, the\n\ntrial court found, harms Axiom’s reputation, not only with its customers and employees\n\nbut also within the medical industry, and makes Axiom a party to false advertising and\n\ncomplicit in DeLitta’s wrongful conduct.”51\n\n       The temporary injunction was later amended, by agreement, to correct the trial\n\ndate.52 This appeal followed.53\n\n\n45\n   CR323–59.\n46\n   2RR1.\n47\n   Id.\n48\n   CR624–28.\n49\n   CR625.\n50\n   CR625.\n51\n   CR626.\n52\n   CR632.\n53\n   CR642–45.\n                                             9\n\f                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Whether to grant or deny an injunction is within a trial court’s discretion.

Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241 (Tex. 1985). Instead, the\n\nreviewing court must determine whether the trial court acted without reference to any\n\nguiding rules and principles, or in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. Id. That a trial\n\njudge decided the matter in a different manner than an appellate judge would does not\n\ndemonstrate an abuse of discretion.

An appellate court\n\nmust view the evidence in the manner most favorable to the trial court’s decision,\n\nindulging every reasonable inference in its favor. Pydia, Inc. v. State, 212 S.W.3d 513,\n\n516–17 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, no pet.). The trial court does not abuse its discretion\n\nif some evidence reasonably supports its decision. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 211.\n\n      To obtain a temporary injunction, the applicant must plead and prove three\n\nspecific elements: (1) a cause of action against the defendant; (2) a probable right to the\n\nrelief sought; and (3) a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim. Id. at\n\n204. A probable right of success on the merits is shown by alleging a cause of action\n\nand introducing evidence that tends to sustain it. T–N–T Motorsports, Inc. v. Hennessey\n\nMotorsports, Inc., 965 S.W.2d 18, 23–24 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet.\n                                            10\n\fdism’d).

Republic of Tex. Props., Inc., 773 S.W.2d 398, 401 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1989,\n\nno writ).\n\n                               SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n      DeLitta is not a medical doctor, but he uses the title “doctor” in a way that leads\n\nthe employees and customers of his medical consulting company to falsely believe that\n\nhe is. Materials that market the company’s occupational medical services refer to him\n\nas “Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.” So do his business cards. He opened a credit card as\n\n“Michael J. DeLitta, MD” and even owns a car with “OCC DOC” vanity plates.\n\n       DeLitta’s conduct is not just misleading; it is against the law. The trial court was\n\nreasonable to conclude that DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct is causing irreparable harm to\n\nthe Axiom Companies’ reputation and subjecting Axiom to civil and criminal liability,\n\nthereby diminishing the companies’ value and thus Schaefer’s financial interest.\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\nI.    DeLitta misleads the Court by suggesting Schaefer asserts a statutory\n      cause of action under the Occupation Code.\n      The entire premise of DeLitta’s appeal is a conjured issue with no basis in this\n\nrecord. All but two pages of DeLitta’s argument is spent attempting to convince the\n\nCourt that Schaefer has “no standing” to seek an injunction because “no private civil\n\ncause of action exists” under the Occupations and Penal Code provisions that the trial\n\n\n                                            11\n\fcourt found DeLitta was violating.54 As such, he argues, Schaefer cannot show two\n\nnecessary elements for obtaining an injunction: (1) a cause of action against the\n\ndefendant, and (2) a probable right to the relief sought.55\n\nA.     The trial court’s injunction is based on Schaefer’s probable right to recover\n       on her breach of fiduciary claims—a claim DeLitta does not even\n       challenge.\n       Schaefer did not (and need not) plead and prove a statutory “cause of action”\n\nunder the Occupations and Penal Codes. The cause of action on which Schaefer will\n\nprobably obtain relief is her claims that DeLitta breached his fiduciary duties to Axiom,\n\ncommitted fraud, and provided false information for the guidance of others. This is\n\nthe wrongful conduct that forms the basis of the trial court’s injunction. Franklin Sav.\n\nAss’n v. Reese, 756 S.W.2d 14, 16 (Tex. App.—Austin 1988, no writ) (temporary\n\ninjunction applicant need only establish probable recovery on one cause of action).\n\n       Importantly, DeLitta never challenged the assertion that Schafer will probably\n\nrecover on these claims. On appeal, too, his brief is silent as to these causes of action.\n\n       DeLitta was forced to conjure up a cause of action because Schaefer so easily\n\nmet her burden to show viable claims against him. In fact, Schaefer has already\n\nsuccessfully sought temporary relief enjoining DeLitta’s malfeasance, enforcing those\n\nprohibitions, and placing the company in a partial receivership.56 The trial court was\n\n\n54\n   Appellant’s Br. at 17.\n55\n   Appellant’s Br at 16–18 (Section 1, no cause of action under Occupations Code), 18–21 (Section 2,\nno probable recovery under Occupations and Penal Codes).\n56\n   See supra at 2 (Statement of Facts, Section B).\n                                                12\n\freasonable to conclude that Schaefer met her burden of showing a viable cause of action\n\nfor breach of fiduciary duty. See Universal Health Servs. v. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570, 576\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2000, no pet.) (applicant need not prove that she will ultimately\n\nprevail in the litigation, only that she has a cause of action for which relief may be\n\ngranted). And a civil court maintains jurisdiction to enjoin a statutory offense incident\n\nto a proper injunction. See, e.g., Featherstone v. Indep. Serv. Stations Ass’n, 10 S.W.2d 124\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 1928, writ denied).\n\nB.     Violations of the Occupations and Penal Codes are the conduct enjoined,\n       not the cause of action asserted, and prohibiting that misconduct is\n       necessary to preserve the status quo of Axiom as a reputable entity free\n       from civil and criminal liability.\n       Although the injunction was not based on a statutory cause of action, the\n\nOccupations Code and Penal Code did play a role in the trial court’s decision to enter\n\nthe injunction. Texas law does prohibit an individual from holding himself out as a\n\nmedical doctor. As a PA, DeLitta also faces regulatory action, including forfeiture of\n\nhis license. If DeLitta’s conduct continued, Axiom faced civil penalties and third-party\n\nliability. At the time the injunction was sought, Axiom had not been cited or sued for\n\nDeLitta’s egregious conduct. Thus, the injunction preserved the status quo by ensuring\n\nthat Axiom would remain free from civil and criminal liability for DeLitta’s misconduct.\n\n       DeLitta’s conduct threatened both him and Axiom of civil penalties. DeLitta is\n\na Texas-licensed physician’s assistant (“PA”). As such, he is governed by the Texas\n\nPhysician Assistant Board and Chapter 204 of the Texas Occupations Code. His license\n\n                                             13\n\fimposes a specific obligation for him to avoid confusion over this training. A PA that\n\ncommits any of the following acts can face civil and criminal liability:\n\n      •      falsely represents that the person is a physician;\n\n      •      acts in an unprofessional or dishonorable manner that is likely to deceive,\n             defraud, or\n\n      •      injure the public; -unlawfully advertises in a false, misleading, or deceptive\n             manner, as described by Section 101.201.\nTEX. OCC. CODE §§204.302(3), 302(4), and 302(8) (“Conduct Related to Fraud or\n\nMisrepresentation”).\n\n      The Occupations Code also prohibits false, misleading, or deceptive advertising\n\nby certain professionals, including PAs:\n\n      (a)    A person may not use advertising that is false, misleading, deceptive, or\n             not readily subject to verification.\n      (b)    False, misleading, or deceptive advertising or advertising not readily\n             subject to verification includes advertising that:\n             (1)    makes a material misrepresentation of fact or omits a fact necessary\n                    to make the statement as a whole not materially misleading;\n             (5)    causes confusion or misunderstanding as to the credentials,\n                    education, or licensing of a health care professional;\n             or\n             (9)    represents in the use of a professional name a title or professional\n                    identification that is expressly or commonly reserved to or used by\n                    another profession or professional.\nTEX. OCC. CODE §101.201.\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Finally, Texas makes it a crime for DeLitta to use his claimed Ph.D. (i.e., to refer\n\nto himself as a “doctor”) to promote a business or to obtain employment, compensation\n\nor other benefit in employment or in the practice of a trade. TEX. PENAL CODE §32.52.\n\n      These statutes were clearly designed to prevent the type of confusion that\n\nDeLitta is causing by calling himself a “doctor” (based on a phony Ph.D. in psychology)\n\nwhile he is engaged in a medical consulting business where he allegedly supervises\n\nnurses. But, more to the point, DeLitta’s flagrant violations of these statutes has serious\n\npotential consequences to Axiom.        The consequences range from revocation of\n\nDeLitta’s physician’s assistant license to civil penalties, enforcement actions by the\n\nTexas Attorney General, and remedies under Chapter 17 of the Texas Deceptive Trade\n\nPractices Act. Given DeLitta’s role as CEO and co-founder of Axiom, his conduct\n\nmakes the company itself a party to false advertising and complicit in DeLitta’s crime.\n\n      Enjoining DeLitta from continuing to violate these provisions was necessary to\n\nmaintain the status quo and to protect the rights and interests of Schaefer in the\n\nbusiness and the property of the Axiom Companies. The injunction prevents any\n\ndissipation or diminution of the business and the property of the Axiom Companies,\n\nwhich is the very heart of this lawsuit. It also protects the devastation to Axiom’s\n\nreputation should the industry learn that the company’s CEO and Medical Director was\n\ninvestigated, fined, or stripped of his PA license for fraud and false advertising.\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fC.        There is ample evidence to support the trial court’s determination that\n          DeLitta was fraudulently holding himself out as a medical doctor.\n          DeLitta also implies that the trial court erred in finding that his conduct does not\n\nviolate the Occupations and Penal Code provisions. 57 The trial court was not required\n\nto do so. In fact, the injunction does not even reference those statutes. And rightly so.\n\nEven if there was no statutory prohibition against an individual holding himself out to\n\nbe a medical doctor when he is not one, a trial court would be reasonable in enjoining\n\nthat misconduct as fraudulent and misleading and likely to subject a company to\n\nreputational harm and third-party liability. The fact that the Legislature has expressly\n\nlabeled this misconduct as fraudulent and misleading simply amplifies the impropriety\n\nof DeLitta’s actions.\n\n          And the evidence is overwhelming that DeLitta is misleading others into\n\nbelieving he is a medical doctor when he is not. The first sentence of the company’s\n\nonline brochure refers to DeLitta as “Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.” The brochure does not\n\ninclude the initials “Ph.D.” DeLitta maintains business cards as “Dr. Michael J.\n\nDeLitta.” Again, the cards do not include the initials “Ph.D.” But they do incorporate\n\ncaduceus, the modern symbol of medicine.\n\n          Several former Axiom employees have sounded warnings about DeLitta’s\n\nmisleading conduct. Ashley Santoro, a registered nurse who was employed by Axiom\n\nfor over two years, cited DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct in a scathing resignation letter:\n\n\n57\n     Appellant’s Br. at 17–18.\n                                               16\n\f       I am also concerned over the tact we also are told to lie to our clients\n       about Dr. Mike DeLitta. Although, he has a doctorate degree - it is not in\n       medicine. He is not a medical physician but a Physician’s Assistant. I was\n       told to never tell this to our clients and we are always to say “Dr. DeLitta”\n       when speaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does not want\n       anyone to know he [isl not a medical physician as he solicits himself to our\n       clients as. 58\n       Former Axiom employee Shane Enochs, who is also a registered nurse, testified\n\nbefore the trial court that he witnessed similar conduct from DeLitta. He testified that\n\nDeLitta used the title “Doctor” both orally and in writing in connection with his\n\nemployment with Axiom. 59 Staff members regularly introduced him, both in staff\n\nmeetings and in presentations to clients, as “Dr. Michael DeLitta.”60 He never corrected\n\nor clarified that his title as “doctor” referenced a psychology degree and not a medical\n\ndegree.61 Mr. Enochs was convinced, based on his observations of how people reacted\n\nto DeLitta, that using the title “doctor” was misleading people into falsely believing\n\nDeLitta was a medical doctor. 62 Enochs himself was misled. He testified that he worked\n\nat Axiom for over a year before he learned that DeLitta was not a medical physician. 63\n\nEnochs’ testimony supports Schaefer’s belief that Axiom’s employees and customers\n\nare unaware that DeLitta is not a medical doctor.64\n\n\n\n\n58\n   CR351–52.\n59\n   2RR29.\n60\n   2RR29.\n61\n   2RR30, 34.\n62\n   2RR30.\n63\n   2RR34.\n64\n   2RR86.\n                                            17\n\f       DeLitta has convinced himself that because he does not use the initials “M.D.”\n\nthat he is not holding himself out as a medical doctor. 65 But the record evidence shows\n\nDeLitta opened a credit card account as “Michael J. DeLitta MD.” He claims now that\n\nthis is a “personal” credit card, not a business card, issued by “mistake.”66 But the trial\n\ncourt was reasonable to dismiss this attempt to explain away damning evidence as not\n\ncredible and to infer from these credit card records that DeLitta intended to falsely\n\nportray himself as a medical doctor. DeLitta’s “OCC DOC” vanity license plates make\n\nthis inference all the more reasonable.\n\n       In any event, DeLitta’s technical distinction between a Ph.D. and M.D. might be\n\nmore persuasive if DeLitta worked in a non-medical field. But DeLitta is the CEO and\n\n“Medical Director” of medical consulting company that provides injury management\n\nfor work-related injuries in the oilfield. The company provides direct access to medical\n\nprofessionals. In this context, it was reasonable for the trial court to determine that\n\nDeLitta’s use of the title “Dr.” could mislead others into believing that he is a medical\n\ndoctor. 67 Jenkins v. Transdel Corp., No. 03-04-00033-CV, 2004 WL 1404364, at *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin June 24, 2004, no pet.) (restraints must be viewed in broader context of\n\nthe parties’ dispute). Because there is some evidence to support that finding, the trial\n\n\n\n65\n   Appellant’s Br. at 19 (arguing that none of the misleading marketing materials “state that DeLitta is\na medical doctor or M.D.”).\n66\n   Appellant’s Br. at 21.\n67\n   CR633 (injunction concluding that “[b]ecause Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides\nmedical advice, there is a substantial likelihood that DeLitta’s use of the “Dr.” title could mislead\nothers into believing that he is a medical doctor.”).\n                                                  18\n\fcourt did not abuse its discretion in making this factual determination. Butnaru, 84\n\nS.W.3d at 211.\n\nII.       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that DeLitta’s\n          fraudulent conduct threatened Axiom with imminent harm.\n          DeLitta also challenges the trial court’s determination that DeLitta must be\n\nenjoined from falsely representing himself as a medical doctor to protect the Axiom\n\nCompanies from imminent harm. Importantly, DeLitta does not dispute the fact that\n\nharm to an entity’s business reputation and goodwill is the type of harm that cannot be\n\neasily measured and thus is “irreparable” at law. See, e.g., Frequent Flyer Depot, Inc. v. Am.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d 215 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, pet. denied). He asserts\n\nonly that the threat to the Axiom Companies was nothing more than “fear and\n\napprehension of injury” that is too “speculative” to support a temporary injunction.68\n\n          The threat to Schaefer’s interest in the Axiom Companies is more than just “fear\n\nand apprehension of injury.” DeLitta himself testified that this kind of misconduct\n\nposes a real threat to a company like Axiom:\n\n          Q.     Okay. And by the way, you would agree that if the company is—\n          and this is a hypothetical—if it’s using false or misleading designations\n          and they are doing something false or misleading or against the law, that\n          that can harm the company, correct?\n          A.   Let me see if I understand your question. If the company is doing\n          something that’s illegal, would it harm the company?\n          Q.      Yes.\n\n\n\n68\n     Appellant’s Br. at 22–23.\n                                             19\n\f          A.     Of course, it would . 69\n\n\n          Yet DeLitta defiantly testified that he will not stop his fraudulent conduct:\n          Q.    Are you willing to just agree that you will not use the Doctor\n          designation in front of your name anymore?\n          A.     No, I won’t agree with that.70\n\n\n\n          A trial court must be given broad discretion to find imminent harm sufficient\n\nwhen the evidence shows the party to be enjoined intends to do an act that is illegal and\n\nfraudulent. Cf. Jim Rutherford Inv., Inc. v. Terramar Beach Cmty. Ass’n, 25 S.W.3d 845, 849\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied) (explaining that a movant seeking\n\na temporary injunction to enforce a restrictive covenant need only prove that the\n\ndefendant intends to do an act that would breach the restrictive covenant). In fact,\n\nTexas courts have held that a trial court has a duty to enjoin illegal conduct. City of\n\nHouston v. Mem’l Bend Util. Co., 331 S.W.2d 418, 422 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston 1960,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.) (emphasizing that where “a party is violating the substantive law, it\n\nbecomes the duty of the court to enjoin the violation. In such case there is no discretion\n\nto be exercised.”); Rattikin Title Co. v. Grievance Committee, 272 S.W.2d 948, 955 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 1954, no writ) (“[W]hen it is determined that the law is being\n\nviolated it is the province and the duty of the court to restrain it . . ., for no man may\n\n\n69\n     2RR77 (emphasis added).\n70\n     2RR78.\n                                               20\n\fengage in actions in violation of the statutory law.”); T&R Assocs., Inc. v. City of Amarillo,\n\n601 S.W.2d 178, 180 (Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1980, no writ) (holding that if the law\n\nis being violated, it is the duty of the court to restrain it, and a temporary injunction is\n\nan appropriate remedy).\n\n         In any event, the trial court was presented with evidence of imminent harm.\n\nAlready, DeLitta’s flagrantly misleading conduct has harmed the Axiom Companies.\n\nThe record evidence shows that a nurse resigned, in part, because DeLitta misleads\n\nothers into believing he is a medical physician as a means of soliciting clients. 71\n\nMoreover, former employee Enochs’ testimony painted a picture of DeLitta who\n\nflagrantly violated licensing rules and regulations.72 He testified that DeLitta encouraged\n\nhim to violate the law by using his medical nursing training in states where he was not\n\nlicensed.73 Enochs was terminated for refusing to violate the law in this way. 74\n\n         The trial court was reasonable to conclude that this evidence suggests a course\n\nof conduct that supports the likelihood of injury. “In making its determination of\n\nimminent harm, the trial court may determine that, when violations are shown up to or\n\nnear the date of trial, the defendant has engaged in a course of conduct and the court\n\nmay assume that it will continue, absent clear proof to the contrary.” See Operation Rescue\n\n\n\n\n71\n   CR351–52.\n72\n   2RR31 (testifying that DeLitta encouraged Enochs to practice nursing in states where he was not\nlicensed).\n73\n     2RR31.\n74\n     2RR36.\n                                               21\n\fNat’l v. Planned Parenthood of Houston, 937 S.W.2d 60, 77 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1996, writ denied). “The probability of the continuation of the prohibited\n\npractices is not subject to direct proof, and injunctive relief is proper when the trial\n\ncourt finds it justified under the rules of equity, notwithstanding a defendant’s cessation\n\nof the activity or promise to cease the activity.” Id. Moreover, a trial court may allow\n\nless stringent proof of harm when a party offers strong evidence of her probable right\n\nto relief. See Ebony Lake Healthcare Ctr. v. Texas Dep’t of Human Servs., 62 S.W.3d 867,\n\n874 (Tex. App.—Austin 2001, no pet.) (“In weighing these two elements, we apply a\n\n‘sliding scale’ under which clear evidence establishing one of the elements will result in\n\na less stringent requirement of proof of the other element.”).\n\n      DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct goes to the very core of Axiom’s reputation,\n\ncompetence and standing in the occupational medical field. The seriousness of these\n\nformer employees’ allegations (criminal and illegal conduct) evidence an immediate\n\nthreat to the Axiom Companies and its reputation within the medical community. The\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering it stopped. See R & R Res. Corp. v.\n\nEchelon Oil & Gas, L.L.C., No. 03-05-00479-CV, 2006 WL 66458, at *7 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin Jan. 10, 2006, no pet.) (evidence of exposure to liability supported trial court\n\nfinding of harm).\n\n      Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in rejecting DeLitta’s argument that\n\nSchaefer’s alleged delay in seeking an injunction is evidence that there is no threat of\n\n\n                                            22\n\finjury.75 Nurse Santoro’s scathing resignation letter, which was important evidence\n\nsupporting Schaefer’s petition for injunction, was dated June 201476—a mere six\n\nmonths before this injunction was sought—and not immediately produced. 77 The trial\n\ncourt could weigh this evidence against DeLitta’s accusations of delay to decide that the\n\ninjunction was timely sought and the harm imminent. It is not this Court’s role to\n\nreweigh the evidence presented below. Davis, 571 S.W.2d at 862. As long as some\n\nevidence supports the trial court’s decision, the Court must affirm. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d\n\nat 211.\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n        For these reasons, Appellee asks that the Court to affirm the trial court’s order.\n\nAppellee seeks any other relief to which she may be entitled.\n\n\n\n\n75\n   Appellant’s Br. at 22. DeLitta suggests, in a single line with no authority, that Schaefer waived her\nright to seek injunctive relief. Id. at 23 (“The delay . . . shows acquiescence and works as a waiver.”).\nBut DeLitta never raised this equitable defense below. See Keightley v. Republic Ins. Co., 946 S.W.2d 124,\n126 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, no writ) (waiver must be raised in trial court). And, in any event, this\nCourt should reject the argument as not properly briefed. See ERI Consulting Eng’rs, Inc. v.

J. 916\n\n\nOpinion\n\nJustice BAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn December 6, 2001, we granted Ford's motion for rehearing. We withdraw our opinion dated July 7, 2001, and substitute\nthe following in its place.\n\nIn this case, we determine whether the Texas Motor Vehicle Board has exclusive jurisdiction over a prospective car dealership\ntransferees' claims that raise an issue about how to construe the Texas Motor Vehicle Commission Code. 1 We conclude\nthe Board has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve only those claims and issues the Code governs. Moreover, we conclude that\nthis exclusive jurisdiction does not extend to the prospective transferees' claims here, and thus, they do not have to exhaust\nadministrative remedies before bringing their claims in the trial court. Instead, because of the Board's special expertise in\ninterpreting the Code, the trial court should abate the prospective transferees' tortious interference and declaratory judgment\nclaims so the Board may exercise its primary jurisdiction to *201 determine the Code construction issue raised with those\nclaims. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by entering a temporary injunction. Accordingly, we\nreverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nMartin Graf is the sole shareholder of Graf Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Inc., a dealership in Del Rio, Texas. The dealership's\nagreement with Ford provides that if Graf Ford proposes to transfer the dealership, Ford shall have a right of first refusal\nto purchase the dealership on the same terms and conditions that the proposed buyer agreed to, “regardless of whether the\nproposed buyer is qualified to be a dealer.” A Ford representative testified that this provision's purpose, and the purpose of\nsimilar provisions in other standard Ford dealership agreements, is “to be able to put into business dealers who [Ford feels] are\nqualified whenever [Ford has] the opportunity.”\n\nIn 1999, Hanan and Gil Butnaru contracted with Graf to buy the Graf dealership. They also contracted separately to buy the\nreal property upon which the dealership was located. Graf and J.M. Barton owned the property and executed that contract. Graf\ntold the Butnarus about Ford's right of first refusal. Additionally, both agreements were “expressly conditioned upon approval\nby Ford of Hanan Butnaru as a[sic] authorized sales and service dealer” and warranted that neither agreement conflicted with\nany prior agreement to which Graf or Barton were parties.\n\nIn September 1999, Graf told Ford that he intended to sell the dealership to the Butnarus. The Butnarus then filed a Prospective\nDealer Application with Ford, seeking approval as an authorized dealer. A month later, Ford informed Graf that it intended\nto exercise its right of first refusal and offered to pay the Butnarus' reasonable expenses incurred in negotiating the purchase\nand sale agreements. On the same day, Ford assigned its right of first refusal to an existing Ford dealer. Ford and Graf agreed\nthat Ford would indemnify Graf against damages arising from Ford's exercising its right of first refusal and that Graf would\ncooperate with Ford in defending any action challenging the right.\n\nAnticipating their breaching the purchase and sale agreements, the Butnarus sued Graf, Graf Ford, and Barton for breach of\nthose agreements. The Butnarus also sued Ford for tortiously interfering with the agreements. They alleged Ford tortiously\ninterfered because Ford's right of first refusal violates a Code provision that prohibits a manufacturer from denying or preventing\na dealership transfer to a qualified applicant. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 5.01B(c), 5.02(b)(8). Thus, the\nButnarus sought a declaration that Ford's right of first refusal was unenforceable and a declaration about the parties' rights and\nobligations under the agreements. Finally, the Butnarus requested a temporary injunction to prevent Ford or its assignees from\nexercising its right of first refusal during the suit. Ford opposed this request and filed a plea to the jurisdiction. Ford argued that\nthe Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a manufacturer has violated the Code's provisions. The trial court\ndenied Ford's plea and granted the injunction.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 916\n\n\nFord sought interlocutory review of the trial court's temporary injunction. See 18 S.W.3d at 762. The court of appeals first\nnoted that the Legislature did not confer any rights on prospective transferees under *202 the Code to seek relief for the\nCode violation the Butnarus allege. Then, the court of appeals held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the\nButnarus' claims, “to the extent their claims are based on violations of the [Code],” because the Code grants the Board exclusive\njurisdiction over alleged Code violations. 18 S.W.3d at 767. The court also held that the Code does not violate the Texas\nConstitution's open courts provision, which prohibits the Legislature from unreasonably abrogating well-established common-\nlaw claims. The court explained that the Code merely confers new statutory rights on motor vehicle dealers and leaves “all\nothers in the same position they previously occupied.” 18 S.W.3d at 768. Therefore, the court concluded that “the Butnarus can\nsue Ford ... for tortious interference with contract, breach of contract, and declaratory relief. They simply cannot base those\ncauses of action on [Code] violations....” 18 S.W.3d at 768. The court of appeals then remanded the claims not based on Code\nviolations and, holding that the Butnarus did not establish an inadequate legal remedy, dissolved the trial court's temporary\ninjunction. 18 S.W.3d at 769–70.\n\nThe Butnarus petitioned this Court to review the court of appeals' opinion. Typically, jurisdiction over an order granting or\ndenying a temporary injunction is final in the courts of appeals. See TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.225(b)(4). However, because the\ncourt of appeals' decision here conflicts with another court of appeals' decision, this Court has jurisdiction. See TEX. GOV'T\nCODE § 22.225(c). Specifically, the court of appeals' holding that the Code does not violate the Texas Constitution's open\ncourts provision conflicts with David McDavid Nissan, Inc. v. Subaru, Inc., 10 S.W.3d 56, 68 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1999), affirmed\nin part, reversed in part, and remanded on rehearing, 84 S.W.3d 212 (Tex.2002). In David McDavid Nissan, the court of\nappeals held that the Code abrogated the plaintiff's common-law claims without reasonably substituting another remedy and\nthus contravened the open courts provision. 10 S.W.3d at 67–68. We granted the Butnarus' petition, as well as the petition in\nDavid McDavid Nissan, to resolve this conflict.\n\nAt the time the trial courts and courts of appeals here and in David McDavid Nissan determined whether the Board had exclusive\njurisdiction, section 3.01 of the Code provided:\n\n  (a) The board has the general and original power and jurisdiction to regulate all aspects of the distribution, sale, and leasing of\n  motor vehicles and to do all things, whether specifically designated in this Act or implied herein, or necessary or convenient\n  to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction, including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.\n  In addition to the other duties placed on the board by this Act, the board shall enforce and administer the terms of Chapter\n  503, Transportation Code.\n\n  (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided by Texas law not in conflict with the terms of this Act, all aspects of the distribution\n  and sale of motor vehicles shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this Act.\n\nTEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 3.01 (Vernon Supp.1998), amended by Act of May 18, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 155,\n§ 5, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 313.\n\nIn our original opinions in this case and in David McDavid Nissan, we concluded that this provision granted the Board primary\n—not exclusive—jurisdiction over Code issues and claims. Moreover, we concluded that section 3.01(b) does not grant the\nBoard exclusive jurisdiction because, *203 by its plain language, that subsection only establishes that the Code governs this\narea of law and trumps other laws if they conflict with the Code.\n\nHowever, only weeks before we issued our opinions, the Legislature amended section 3.01(a) to provide:\n\n            (a) The board has the exclusive, original jurisdiction to regulate those aspects of the distribution, sale,\n            and leasing of motor vehicles as governed by this Act and to do all things, whether specifically designated\n            in this Act or implied herein, or necessary or convenient to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction,\n            including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

STAT. art. 4413(36), § 3.01(a) (emphasis added). The Legislature made this amendment “effective\nimmediately” after receiving the necessary votes, which occurred on May 18, 2001. See Act of May 18, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S.,\nch. 155, § 5, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 313, 317. The Legislature's amendment did not change section 3.01(b).\n\nToday, we determine (1) whether section 3.01 's current or former version applies, (2) whether the applicable provision grants\nthe Board exclusive jurisdiction and how this affects the trial court's jurisdiction here, and (3) whether the trial court abused\nits discretion by issuing a temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n                                                   II.

Retroactive application of Section 3.01\n\nToday, in David McDavid Nissan, we held that section 3.01 's current version constitutionally retroactively applied to the\npending claims a licensed motor vehicle dealer had raised against a manufacturer. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 218.\nWe explained that this jurisdictional provision is procedural and remedial and did not affect a vested right.

David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 218. We held that, unlike its former version, section 3.01(a) 's current version\nexpressly confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Board to initially determine issues or claims that the Code governs. David\nMcDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 218. We based our decision on the provision's plain language, and the Legislature's intent when\nit amended the provision to include the express exclusive jurisdiction language.

David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 227; see also TEX. CONST. art. 1, §\n13. We explained that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction over issues and claims the Code governs—all matters derived from\nthe Code and not the common law—did not abrogate any of the motor vehicle dealer's common-law rights.

ANALYSIS\n\n\n                        A. WHETHER AMENDED SECTION 3.01 RETROACTIVELY APPLIES\n\n [8] In David McDavid Nissan, we concluded that section 3.01(a), a jurisdictional provision, is a procedural and remedial\nstatute that applied retroactively because it did not affect a vested right in that case. See David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d\nat 219 (citing Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273, 114 S.Ct. 1483; Likes, 962 S.W.2d at 502; Abell, 613 S.W.2d at 260; Phil H. Pierce\nCo. v. Watkins, 114 Tex. 153, 263 S.W. 905, 907 (1924); Middleton, 185 S.W. at 560; Blonstein, 831 S.W.2d at 472; City of\nKountze, 543 S.W.2d at 874–75). However, section 3.01(a) still may not constitutionally retroactively apply in this case if it\naffects a vested right. See Baker Hughes, 12 S.W.3d at 4; Middleton, 185 S.W. at 560.\n\nThe Butnarus do not allege that section 3.01(a) affects any vested right. Instead, they contend that the Legislature did not\nexpressly make the amendment to section 3.01(a) retroactive, and therefore, we should apply the Code Construction Act to\nconclude section 3.01(a) 's current version does not retroactively apply. See TEX. GOV'T CODE §§ 311.022 (“A statute is\npresumed *205 to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.”), 311.031 (“[T]he ... amendment ... of\na statute does not affect ... the prior operation of the statute or any prior action taken under it.”).\n\nBut the Butnarus misplace their reliance on the Code Construction Act. That statute applies only to “each code enacted by the\n60th or subsequent legislature as part of the state's continuing statutory revision program.” TEX. GOV'T CODE § 311.002.\nWhen the Legislature recodifies a statute under Texas's continuing statutory revision program, the statute will indicate this.\nSee, e.g., TEX. LOCAL GOV'T CODE § 1.001 (“This code is enacted as a part of the state's continuing statutory revision\nprogram....”). And, though we refer to the Motor Vehicle Code as “the Code,” nothing in the Code's language or legislative\nhistory shows that it is part of our State's “continuing statutory revision program.” TEX. GOV'T CODE § 311.002; Robbins\nChevrolet Co. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 989 S.W.2d 865, 867 (Tex.App.-Austin 1999, pet. denied); see also Knight v. Int'l Harvester\nCredit Corp., 627 S.W.2d 382, 385 (Tex.1982).\n\nSection 3.01(a) is a jurisdictional statute that, in this case, does not alter the parties' rights or obligations or remove any remedies\nalready available. See David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 222; Likes, 962 S.W.2d at 502. This provision merely determines\nthe tribunal that must initially resolve all issues and claims the Code governs. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273, 114 S.Ct. 1483;\nDavid McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 222; City of Kountze, 543 S.W.2d at 874–75. The parties do not have a vested right in\nchoosing what tribunal will do this.

J. 916\n\n1898454; Middleton, 185 S.W. at 559; City of Kountze, 543 S.W.2d at 874–75. Accordingly, we conclude that amended section\n3.01(a) constitutionally applies retroactively in this case.\n\n\n\n               B. APPLYING SECTION 3.01'S CURRENT VERSION TO THE BUTNARUS' CLAIMS\n\n [9] Ford contends that section 3.01 's current version grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction, and thus, the Board has the sole\nauthority to make the initial determination about the alleged Code violation here. The Butnarus, on the other hand, argue that\nsection 3.01 does not oust the trial court's jurisdiction because the Board does not have authority to award damages for their\nwell-established common-law claims. Therefore, the Butnarus assert that the Board only has primary jurisdiction to decide\nwhether Ford's right of first refusal violates the Code.\n\nThe Butnarus' pleadings currently reflect four claims, the first two of which are based on Ford's allegedly violating the Code.\nFirst, the Butnarus seek a judicial declaration that Ford's right of first refusal violates the Code. Second, the Butnarus allege\nthat Ford tortiously interfered with the purchase and sale agreements by attempting to exercise its allegedly invalid right of first\nrefusal. Third, the Butnarus seek a declaration about the parties' rights and obligations under the purchase and sale agreements.\nFourth, the Butnarus claim that Graf and Barton have breached or are about to breach the purchase and sale agreements by\npermitting Ford to exercise its right of first refusal rather than requiring Ford to determine the Butnarus' eligibility under the\nCode for the dealership transfer.\n\nThe court of appeals, after analyzing section 3.01 's former version, concluded that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction; *206\nhowever, it held that the Butnarus do not have standing as prospective car dealership transferees to seek relief from the Board\nfor the Code violation they allege. The court of appeals further determined that the Butnarus' lack of standing to obtain relief\nfrom the Board did not give them a right to seek damages for the alleged Code violation in the trial court. 18 S.W.3d at 767–\n68. Accordingly, the court of appeals held that the Butnarus could maintain their breach of contract and tortious interference\nclaims; however, the Butnarus could not “base those causes of action on [Code] violations.” 18 S.W.3d at 768.\n\nAs discussed above, we disagree that section 3.01 's former version granted the Board exclusive jurisdiction. But we conclude\nthat section 3.01(a) 's current version, which applies here, grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction over issues and claims the\nCode governs. Thus, we must determine if the Butnarus' claims fall within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nBecause motor vehicle distribution and sales affects our State's economy and citizens' welfare, the Code's primary purpose is “to\ninsure a sound system of distributing and selling motor vehicles through licensing and regulating manufacturers ... and dealers\nof those vehicles.” See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 1.02. To accomplish this, the Code strictly regulates conduct by\nor between franchise dealers and manufacturers. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 4.01–.07, 5.01–.05. For example,\nthe Code establishes how a dealer must request a transfer, assignment, or sale of its franchise agreement. TEX.REV.CIV.\nSTAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B. Under that process, the Code also determines the circumstances under which a manufacturer\nmay withhold its consent to the dealer's request. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(c).\n\nSpecifically, to transfer a dealership the dealer must file a written application with the manufacturer to transfer the dealership.\nThe application must identify the prospective transferee and any pertinent agreements about the proposed transfer. See\nTEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(a)(1)-(4). The manufacturer must timely advise the dealer in writing if the\nprospective transferee is qualified or if the transferee is not acceptable. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(b). The\nCode prohibits a manufacturer from “unreasonably” withholding its consent to a dealer's transfer application if the prospective\ntransferee is “of good moral character” and otherwise meets the manufacturer's predetermined, written standards, if any, about\na transferee's business experience and financial qualifications. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(c). Further, the\nCode makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to “fail to give effect to or attempt to prevent any sale or transfer” of a dealership\n“except as provided by Section 5.01B.” TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.02(b)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              9\n\fButnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198 (2002)\n45 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 916\n\nAdditionally, the Code provides a dealer a remedy if the manufacturer “unreasonably” denies a dealer's application to transfer\nits franchise ownership. The Code's definition of “dealer” includes licensed dealers but not prospective transferees. See\nTEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 1.03(7). The dealer may file a protest with the Board. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art.\n4413(36), § 5.01B(d). The issue would be whether the prospective transferee is qualified, and the manufacturer must prove\nthe prospective transferee's inadequacy. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 5.01B(d)-(e). If the Board determines the\nprospective transferee is qualified, the Board shall enter an order reflecting this, and the manufacturer must accept the transfer.\nTEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(e).\n\n *207 [10] [11] Here, the court of appeals' analysis presumes that the Butnarus' trial court claims simply seek monetary\ndamages based on their allegation that Ford's exercising its right of first refusal and denying the dealership transfer violated\nsection 5.01B. But the Butnarus' trial court claims involve something different. The Butnarus seek relief for Ford's alleged\ntortious interference, and this claim, in turn, raises a Code construction issue. To establish their tortious interference claim, the\nButnarus must show: (1) a contract exists between Graf, Graf Ford, Barton and the Butnarus; (2) Ford willfully and intentionally\ninterfered with that contract; (3) the interference proximately caused the Butnarus damage; and (4) the Butnarus suffered actual\ndamage or loss. See Texas Beef Cattle Co. v. Green, 921 S.W.2d 203, 210 (Tex.1996); Holloway v. Skinner, 898 S.W.2d 793,\n795–96 (Tex.1995). But Ford may defeat liability by proving the affirmative defense that its conduct was privileged or justified\n—so long as that conduct was not illegal or tortious. See Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Financial Review Servs., Inc., 29 S.W.3d\n74, 80 (Tex.2000); ACS Investors, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 943 S.W.2d 426, 431 (Tex.1997); Texas Beef Cattle, 921 S.W.2d at 210.\nIt is the Butnarus' position that Ford does not have a justification defense, because rights of first refusal contravene certain Code\nprovisions and, accordingly, are void and unenforceable. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(c) (prohibiting\na manufacturer from unreasonably denying a dealership transfer); TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 1.04 (making an\nagreement to waive the Code's terms void and unenforceable). The Butnarus also request that the trial court enter a declaratory\njudgment that rights of first refusal violate the Code.\n\nWe conclude that the Butnarus' tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims fall outside the purview of the Board's\nexclusive jurisdiction. In David McDavid Nissan, we held that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction under section 3.01(a) required\nthe dealer in that case to exhaust its administrative remedies to obtain a final Board finding to support its Code-based DTPA, bad\nfaith, and oral contract claims. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 226. In concluding that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction\napplied to the dealer's Code-based DTPA and bad-faith claims, we explained that the Code provides a hybrid claims-resolution\nprocess by which a dealer or manufacturer may seek damages for certain Code violations. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d\nat 226 (discussing TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 6.06(a), (e)). Based on this process, we held that the dealer had\nto exhaust its administrative remedies under the Code to obtain supporting Board findings before a trial court could finally\nadjudicate the dealer's damages request for its Code-based claims. See David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 227. Additionally,\nin requiring the dealer to obtain a Board finding before pursuing its oral contract claims, we relied on a Code provision mandating\nthat a dealer obtain the Board's approval and a license before operating a franchise in a certain area. See David McDavid Nissan,\n84 S.W.3d at 227 (discussing TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 4.02(c), 4.06(a)-(e)).\n\nHere, however, no Code provision extends the Board's exclusive jurisdiction to resolving the Butnarus' tortious interference\nand declaratory judgment claims so that they must exhaust any administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. In fact,\nthe Code's failing to establish any procedure through which the Board may resolve a prospective transferee's claim that a\nmanufacturer unlawfully refused to *208 accept a dealer's transfer request—coupled with the Board's inability to award\nmonetary damages—demonstrate the contrary. Thus, this case is analogous to Cash America, in which we held that the plaintiff\ndid not have to exhaust administrative remedies under the Pawnshop Act because “nothing in the statutory scheme indicate[d]\nthat the Legislature intended to replace a pledgor's common-law remedies with the like-kind replacement remedy” available\nunder the statute. Cash Am., 35 S.W.3d at 18. Similarly, because the Code does not indicate the Legislature's intent to replace\nthe prospective transferees' remedies here, the Butnarus do not have to exhaust any administrative remedies before suing Ford\nfor tortious interference or declaratory relief.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 916\n\n [12] But our inquiry does not end here. Though the Legislature did not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Board to resolve\nthe Butnarus' claims, we still must decide whether the Board has primary jurisdiction to resolve the Code construction issue that\nthose claims raise. See, e.g, Cash Am., 35 S.W.3d at 18 (recognizing that, though an agency does not have exclusive jurisdiction,\nthe policies underlying the primary jurisdiction doctrine may require the agency to initially decide an issue). In David McDavid\nNissan, we explained that the primary jurisdiction doctrine requires trial courts to allow an administrative agency to initially\ndecide an issue when: (1) an agency is typically staffed with experts trained in handling the complex problems in the agency's\npurview; and (2) great benefit is derived from an agency's uniformly interpreting its laws, rules, and regulations, whereas courts\nand juries may reach different results under similar fact situations. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 221 (citing United\nStates v. Western Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. 59, 64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956); Cash Am., 35 S.W.3d at 18; Foree v.\nCrown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 431 S.W.2d 312, 316 (Tex.1968); Gregg v. Delhi–Taylor Oil Corp., 162 Tex. 26, 344 S.W.2d\n411, 413 (1961); Kavanaugh v. Underwriters Life Ins. Co., 231 S.W.2d 753, 755 (Tex.Civ.App.-Waco 1950, writ ref'd); Travis,\nComment, Primary Jurisdiction: A General Theory and Its Application to the Securities Exchange Act, 63 CAL. L.REV. 926,\n927 (1975)). We noted that, when the primary jurisdiction doctrine requires a trial court to defer to an agency to make an initial\ndetermination, the court should abate the lawsuit and suspend finally adjudicating the claim until the agency has an opportunity\nto act on the matter. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 221 (citing Central Power & Light Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n,\n17 S.W.3d 780, 787 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet. denied); Roberts Express, Inc. v. Expert Transp., Inc., 842 S.W.2d 766, 771\n(Tex.App.-Dallas 1992, no writ)).\n\nWe conclude that the primary jurisdiction doctrine applies in this case. The Butnarus' tortious interference and declaratory\njudgment claims raise a Code construction issue that is within the Board's special competence and expertise. See Cash Am.,\n35 S.W.3d at 18. As discussed above, the Legislature has specifically authorized the Board to resolve disputes between a\nmanufacturer and dealer when the dealer alleges that the manufacturer violated section 5.01B by unreasonably withholding\nconsent to transfer a dealership. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(d). The Board's expertise in construing\nsection 5.01B in these disputes, and the State's interest in a uniform interpretation of the Code, requires the trial court to abate\nthe lawsuit and suspend finally adjudicating the tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims until the Board has a\nreasonable opportunity to *209 act on the matter. See David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 228; Central Power & Light, 17\nS.W.3d at 787; Roberts Express, 842 S.W.2d at 771. Accordingly, the trial court should abate the claims pending the Board\nhaving an opportunity to exercise its primary jurisdiction to determine, at least in the first instance, whether a right of first\nrefusal violates the Code. In sum, we hold that section 3.01(a) confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Board but only over issues\nand claims the Code governs. Here, the Code does not govern the Butnarus'—as prospective transferees—tortious interference\nand declaratory judgment claims. Consequently, the Butnarus do not have to exhaust any administrative remedies before raising\nthese claims in the trial court. However, because these claims raise a Code construction issue, the primary jurisdiction doctrine\nrequires the trial court to abate the claims pending the Board having a reasonable opportunity to determine whether a right of\nfirst refusal violates the Code.\n\n\n\n                                              C. OPEN COURTS CHALLENGE\n\n [13] The Butnarus contend that if the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over all Code issues and claims, this violates our\nConstitution's open courts provision. TEX. CONST. art. 1, § 13. This provision prohibits the Legislature from abrogating well-\nestablished, common-law claims unless the reason for doing so outweighs a litigant's constitutional right of redress. See Texas\nAss'n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 448.\n\n [14] But we have already concluded that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction does not extend to the claims in this case.\nAccordingly, the Code does not abrogate any previously existing common-law rights here. The trial court has immediate\njurisdiction to adjudicate the Butnaru's common-law claims for breach of the purchase and sale agreements. And, after deferring\nto the Board so it has an opportunity to decide the Code construction issue, the trial court may finally adjudicate the tortious\ninterference and related declaratory judgment claim.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 916\n\n\n\n                                              D. TEMPORARY INJUNCTION\n\nThe trial court temporarily enjoined Ford or its assignees from exercising its right of first refusal during the suit. The court of\nappeals dissolved the temporary injunction, agreeing with Ford's contention that the Butnarus did not establish an inadequate\nlegal remedy. 18 S.W.3d at 769. In so concluding, the court of appeals noted that generally a court will not enforce contracts by\ninjunction because a suit for damages is deemed to be an adequate remedy. 18 S.W.3d at 769. The Butnarus respond twofold.\nFirst, they argue that they were not required to show an inadequate legal remedy because an alleged statutory violation relieves\na movant of that burden. See Furr v. Hall, 553 S.W.2d 666, 672 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). They assert that\ncourts have a duty to enjoin statutory violations. See Priest v. Texas Animal Health Comm'n, 780 S.W.2d 874, 876 (Tex.App.-\nDallas 1989, no writ). Second, the Butnarus argue that they have otherwise established the temporary-injunction elements.\nOn the inadequate legal remedy element, they argue that Ford's exercising its right of first refusal would deprive them of the\nopportunity to purchase two unique assets: real property and the dealership located on the property. See, e.g., Home Sav. of Am.\nv. Van Cleave Dev. Co., 737 S.W.2d 58, 59 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1987, no writ) (noting that “each and every piece of real\nestate is unique” and that “is certainly an element to be considered in deciding whether there [will be] irreparable damages”).\n\n\n\n                                                  *210 1. Statutory Violation\n\n [15] The Butnarus' misplace their reliance on Furr. See Furr, 553 S.W.2d at 672. Furr does not generally propose that an\nalleged statutory violation relieves the plaintiff's burden to show an inadequate legal remedy. Rather, the party seeking injunctive\nrelief in Furr relied on a specific statute giving the right to an injunction, and the court of appeals concluded that the statutory\nright relieved the party from proving an inadequate legal remedy. Furr, 553 S.W.2d at 672. The court relied on Republic\nInsurance Co. v. O'Donnell Motor Co., which explains:\n\n            The general rule at equity is that before injunctive relief can be obtained, it must appear that there does\n            not exist an adequate remedy at law. This limitation, however, has no application where the right to relief\n            is predicated on a statutory ground other than on the general principles of equity.\n\n289 S.W. 1064, 1066 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1926, no writ).\n\nHere, the Butnarus rely on general equitable principles, not a statutory injunctive-relief right, to enjoin Ford's conduct. Thus,\nFurr does not apply. And the Butnarus had to establish in the trial court, in addition to the other temporary-injunction elements,\nan inadequate legal remedy.\n\n\n\n                                              2. Temporary Injunction Elements\n\n [16] In the trial court, the Butnarus alleged that Ford's exercising its right of first refusal would tortiously interfere with\nthe Butnarus' contract to purchase the real property and the contract to purchase the dealership. They further contended that\ntheir right to purchase the real property and dealership would be lost if Ford exercised its right of first refusal, and, therefore,\ninjunctive relief was necessary to preserve the status quo.\n\nAt the temporary injunction hearing, the Butnarus presented the following evidence: (1) their agreement with Graf and Barton\nto purchase the real property, (2) their agreement with Graf and Graf Ford to purchase the dealership, (3) Graf Ford's agreement\nwith Ford containing the right of first refusal that allegedly violates the Code, (4) the Code provisions that allegedly prohibit\nFord's right of first refusal provision, and (5) the Butnarus' dealership application to Ford detailing their business experience\nand financial qualifications. Additionally, Hanan Butnaru testified about his agreements with Graf, Graf Ford, and Barton to\npurchase dealership and the real property in Del Rio. He stated that in planning to establish a dealership, he was only looking\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 916\n\nwithin a 100 mile radius of San Antonio, which includes Del Rio. He also explained, and the agreements entered in evidence\nshowed, that the Butnarus agreed to pay $1.2 million for the real property and only $500,000 for the dealership.\n\nBased on the Butnarus' allegations and this evidence, the trial court granted the temporary injunction. The trial court stated in\nthe order that the Butnarus would be irreparably harmed if Ford exercises its right of first refusal “in that the issues and rights\nsought to be adjudicated will become moot and [the Butnarus] will have lost the opportunity to purchase the Dealership and\nthe Real Property.”\n\nThe court of appeals, however, dissolved the temporary injunction after concluding that the Butnarus did not establish an\ninadequate legal remedy:\n\n             The Butnarus are not interested in the real property for its own resources or aesthetics. Their interest in\n             the property results solely from the fact that the dealership is located on it. Thus, their true complaint\n             relates to their inability to purchase the dealership. The uniqueness *211 of the real property is therefore\n             irrelevant to the adequacy of their legal remedy.\n\n18 S.W.3d at 769. The court of appeals' holding is predicated upon its assumptions that the real property is neither unique nor\npertinent to this dispute and that the Butnarus are only interested in purchasing the dealership.\n\n [17] [18] [19] [20] We agree with the court of appeals that, generally, a court will not enforce contractual rights by\ninjunction, because a party can rarely establish an irreparable injury and an inadequate legal remedy when damages for breach\nof contract are available. Canteen Corp., 773 S.W.2d at 401; Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Stoker, 666 S.W.2d 379, 382 (Tex.App.-\nEastland 1984, writ dism'd). But under an abuse of discretion standard, the court of appeals cannot overrule the trial court's\ndecision unless the trial court acted unreasonably or in an arbitrary manner, without reference to guiding rules or principles.\nBeaumont Bank v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226 (Tex.1991); Davis, 571 S.W.2d at 861–62. Moreover, the court of appeals\ncannot substitute its judgment for the trial court's reasonable judgment even if it would have reached a contrary conclusion.\nWalker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839–40 (Tex.1992); Beaumont Bank, 806 S.W.2d at 226. The trial court does not abuse its\ndiscretion if some evidence reasonably supports the trial court's decision. Davis, 571 S.W.2d at 862.\n\n [21] The evidence shows this is a case involving two contracts: a contract to purchase land and a contract to purchase a\nbusiness. There is some evidence that the Butnarus desired valuable land located at this specific Del Rio location. Thus, the\nevidence before the trial court supports its conclusion that this dispute is about the right to purchase real property worth at least\n$1.2 million and not just the dealership itself. See Home Sav., 737 S.W.2d at 59 (upholding temporary injunction in dispute\ninvolving land worth $1.5 million). And a trial court may grant equitable relief when a dispute involves real property. See\nBennett v. Copeland, 149 Tex. 474, 235 S.W.2d 605, 609 (1951); E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Zale Corp., 462 S.W.2d 355,\n359–60 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1970, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Burnett v. Mitchell, 158 S.W. 800, 801–02 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth\n1913, writ ref'd). Thus, the trial court's conclusion that the Butnarus do not have an adequate legal remedy was not arbitrary and\nunreasonable and was not made without reference to guiding rules and principles. And, because the trial court's determination\nwas not an abuse of discretion, the court of appeals should not have substituted its judgment for that of the trial court. Beaumont\nBank, 806 S.W.2d at 226.\n\nFord contends that the court of appeals could have also determined that the Butnarus did not establish a probable right to\nrecovery. We disagree. The trial court could reasonably conclude, based on the Butnarus' allegations and the evidence previously\ndiscussed, that the Butnarus had a probable right to recovery. See Sun Oil, 424 S.W.2d at 218 (stating that the temporary\ninjunction applicant is not required to establish that it will prevail on final trial and need only plead a cause of action and show\na probable right to the relief sought). Because this conclusion was not “so arbitrary as to exceed the bounds of reasonable\ndiscretion,” CRC–Evans Pipeline Int'l, Inc. v. Myers, 927 S.W.2d 259, 262 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ), the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a probable right to recovery.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 916\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that there is evidence to support the trial court's decision to issue the temporary injunction. See Davis,\n571 S.W.2d at 862. Thus, the *212 trial court did not abuse its discretion, and we reverse the court of appeals' order dissolving\nthe temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n                                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\nSection 3.01(a) grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction but only over the issues and claims the Code governs. Because the\nCode does not govern, or expressly authorize the Board to resolve, the Butnarus' tortious interference and declaratory judgment\nclaims, these prospective transferees need not exhaust any administrative remedies before the trial court has jurisdiction over\nthese claims. However, under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, the trial court should abate these claims to the extent that may\nbe necessary to allow the Board a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Code construction issue they raise. Finally, the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in granting the temporary injunction. Thus, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and\nremand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion on rehearing.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n84 S.W.3d 198, 45 Tex.

Mears, Dallas, for appellee.\n\nBefore McCLUNG, ROWE and BURNETT, JJ.\n\nOpinion\n\nBURNETT, Justice.\n\nCanteen Corporation, doing business as Gulliver's, appeals an adverse judgment rendered in favor of Republic of Texas\nProperties, Inc. which 1) enjoined Canteen from maintaining a vending machine operation and 2) ordered Canteen to reopen\nand operate Gulliver's restaurant in accordance with the lease agreement between Canteen and Republic. In three points of\nerror, Canteen asserts that 1) the temporary injunctive relief is void ab initio 2) the finding that Canteen breached the lease\nwas in error and 3) the mandatory injunction was granted in error. Although we disagree with points of error one and two, we\nagree with Canteen's third point of error and for the reasons discussed herein, affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the\nprohibitory portion of the injunction and reform the judgment to eliminate the portion which decrees specific performance.\n\nIn February, 1985, Canteen, as lessee, and Republic as lessor, entered into a commercial lease agreement for the lease of space\nin RepublicBank Plano Tower. The lease agreement provided in part that “lessee warrants and represents to lessor that the\nleased premises shall be used and occupied only for the purpose of a restaurant.” Approximately three years later, Canteen\nceased to operate Gulliver's as a delicatessen style restaurant and installed vending machines. These machines served hot and\ncold beverages and food.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Republic of Texas Properties, Inc., 773 S.W.2d 398 (1989)\n\n\nThe trial court found that Canteen's vending machine operation did not constitute the operation of the restaurant and, therefore,\nwas a violation of the lease agreement. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Republic and granted Republic's request\nfor injunctive relief. Specifically, the trial court enjoined Canteen from maintaining a vending machine operation in the leased\npremises and ordered *400 Canteen to reopen a restaurant in accordance with the lease agreement and in accordance with the\nGulliver's concept as utilized by Canteen at other locations in the Dallas area.\n\nIn its first point of error, Canteen maintains that the temporary injunctive relief granted by the trial court is void ab initio. A\nreview of the record reveals that although Republic requested a temporary injunction in its original petition, the injunction\nwhich issued was not a temporary injunction. Instead, it was a permanent injunction entered after a trial before the court. Thus,\nthe defects urged by Canteen such as lack of a bond, failure to set a trial date, and failure to state a reason for the temporary\ninjunction are not fatal to the injunction which was granted by the trial court. Canteen's first point of error is overruled.\n\nIn its second point of error, Canteen asserts that the trial court erroneously found that the installation of the vending machines\ndid not constitute the operation of a restaurant and, thus, was a breach of the lease agreement. In paragraph 5, the lease provides\nas follows:\n\n            Lessee warrants and represents to lessor that the leased premises shall be used and occupied only for the\n            purpose of restaurant use ...\n\nThe lease at paragraph 5(b) continues:\n\n            Lessee shall not at any time leave the leased premises vacant, but shall in good faith continuously\n            throughout the term of this lease conduct and carry on in the entire leased premises the type of business\n            for which the leased premises are leased. Lessee shall operate its business in an efficient, high class and\n            reputable manner so as to produce the maximum amount of sales from the leased premises, and shall,\n            except during reasonable periods for repairing, cleaning and decorating, keep the leased premises open to\n            the public for business with adequate personnel in attendance on all days and during all hours established\n            by lessor from time to time as store hours for the building, and during any other hours when the building\n            is generally open to the public for business ...\n\nThe lease at paragraph 5(c) continues:\n\n            Lessee understands that normal operating hours for this building are expected to be Monday through\n            Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Saturday, 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. ...\n\nThe lease at paragraph 5(e) continues:\n\n            Lessee shall not ... do anything which would tend to injure the reputation of the premises.\n\nFinally, the lease at paragraph 5(f) provides:\n\n            Exclusivity clause: Canteen Corporation shall have the exclusive right to provide manual food service in\n            the building with exception of a white tablecloth restaurant on the premises. Lessee reserves the first right\n            of refusal to install and maintain public vending machines at a location to be agreed upon in the future.\n\n\n [1] Under general contract principles, the primary concern of the courts is to give effect to the intentions of the parties as\nexpressed in the instruments. Ideal Lease Service, Inc. v. Amoco Production Co., 662 S.W.2d 951, 952–53 (Tex.1984). In the\nface of unambiguous provisions, the court must give effect to the contract as written. Id.; Sun Oil Co. v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d\n726, 728 (Tex.1981).\n\n [2] It is clear from a reading of the contract that the restaurant contemplated by the parties was not an open access, unstaffed\nvending machine operation as was installed by Canteen. In fact, paragraph 5(f) refers to vending machines as a separate type\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Republic of Texas Properties, Inc., 773 S.W.2d 398 (1989)\n\n\nof operation than that contemplated by the parties. Thus, the trial judge properly found that the vending machines were not a\nrestaurant and that the installation of the machines was a breach of the lease. Canteen's second point of error is overruled.\n\n [3] Canteen maintains, in its third point of error, that the trial court improperly granted the mandatory injunction. the injunction\nof the trial court consists of two parts: (1) a portion which prohibits Canteen from operating the vending machines *401 in\nthe lease space; and (2) a portion which orders Canteen to operate a restaurant in the leased premises in accordance with the\nGulliver's concept. It is well established that a court of equity will only order specific performance when present performance is\npossible. A court will generally not decree a party to perform a continuous series of acts which extend through a long period of\ntime and require constant supervision by the court. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. City of Marshall, 136 U.S. 385, 390–91, 10 S.Ct.\n846, 847, 34 L.Ed. 385 (1890); American Housing Resources, Inc. v. Slaughter, 597 S.W.2d 13, 15 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1980,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.); United Coin Meter Co., Inc. v. Johnson–Campbell Lumber Co., 493 S.W.2d 882, 888 (Tex.Civ.App.1973); 81\nC.J.S. Specific Performance § 75 (1977). Instead, the parties are left to their remedies at law unless the interest of the public is\ninvolved. Beckham v. Munger Oil & Cotton Co., 185 S.W. 991, 992 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1916, no writ); See Nueces Valley\nTownsite Co. v. San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf R.R. Co., 67 S.W.2d 215, 220–221 (Tex.1933).\n\n [4] In the instant case, the trial court ordered Canteen to open and operate a restaurant in the style of the Gulliver's restaurants\noperated in the Dallas area. This is not capable of present performance. Neither is the operation of a delicatessen restaurant a\nmatter of public interest which justifies deviation from the general rule against ordering ongoing activities. The portion of the\ninjunction which orders the operation of a Gulliver's is improper. Accordingly, we sustain Canteen's third point of error.\n\n [5] Generally, contractual rights are not enforced by writs of injunction, since inadequate remedy at law and irreparable injury\nare rarely shown when a suit for damages for breach of contract is available. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Stoker, 666 S.W.2d 379, 382\n(Tex.App.—Eastland 1984, writ dism'd w.o.j.). “Irreparable injury” is stated to be “an injury of such nature that the injured party\ncannot be adequately compensated therefore in damages, or that the damages which result therefrom cannot be measured by any\ncertain pecuniary standard.” Id.; see Minexa Arizona, Inc. v. Staubach, 667 S.W.2d 563, 567 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1984, no writ).\n\n [6] In the instant case, Republic presented evidence that tenants were complaining about the vending machines and that\nsome prospective tenants did not lease space in the building in part because there was no restaurant. Additionally, Republic\ndemonstrated that there was no way to prove how many prospective tenants had not approached Republic about leasing and\nhad not leased in the building because there was no restaurant. Thus, Republic demonstrated an inability to compute damages.\nThe injunction is proper as far as enjoining Canteen's vending machine operation.\n\nHowever, the injunction also commands Canteen to reopen and operate a Gulliver's-type restaurant in the nature of a decree of\nspecific performance. “Whether a court will grant an injunction the effect of which is to compel the specific performance of a\ncontract, depends, of course, upon the same principles as govern a decree of specific performance.” Beckham v. Munger Oil &\nCotton Co., 185 S.W. 991, 992 (Tex.Civ.App.—Dallas 1916, no writ).\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n773 S.W.2d 398\n\nEnd of Document                                                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Edmunds, Houston, of counsel), for appellee.\n\nOpinion\n\nBELL, Chief Justice.\n\nThe appellee is a private utility furnishing water and sanitary sewer service to residents of a defined area in the City of Houston.\nPrior to December 31, 1956, the territory served was outside the limits of the City. As a result of annexation, a part of the area\nserved by appellee bcame a part of the City of Houston. At the time of annexation appellee was charging rates for services\nrendered by it according to a rate schedule promulgated by it. These rates it continued to charge until it raised its rates effective\nJuly 1, 1959.\n\nOn January 2, 1957, the City Council of the City of Houston passed general ordinances Nos. 57–1 and 57–3, by which it, without\nnotice to appellee, fixed the rates that might be charged by a utility situated as was appellee for water and sanitary sewer service.\nThe rates so fixed were less than the rates prescribed by appellee's schedule of rates. The record here reflects that on February\n18, 1957, appellee furnished the City information as to the value of its properties, the appraisal being made by Freese, Nichols\nand Turner, the report being dated February 15, 1957. Also it furnished a statement of its income and expenses for the fiscal\nyear ending November 30, 1956. The furnishing of these statements was in an effort to comply with the above ordinances. At\nthe same time appellee for various reasons protested the passage of the ordinances and questioned their validity and the rates\nfixed thereby. The petition to the City Council contains this prayer:\n‘Wherefore, premises considered, petitioner prays that the City Council of the City of Houston pass an ordinance approving the\nrates and charges made by the petitioner in the operation of its utilities and in the furnishing of other public services (emphasis\nours) or in the alternative that said City Council conduct a public hearing concerning rates and charges made by the petitioner\nand at such hearing that said petitioner be given an opportunity to introduce evidence with reference thereto and further, that\nthe rates and charges made by petitioner be not changed until the City of Houston has taken final action after such hearing.’\n(Emphasis ours.)\n\n\nOn May 1, 1957, the City Council passed ordinance No. 57–531 by which it provided that a private utility operating without\na franchise could charge no greater rate for its service than was being charged by it on December 31, 1956. The effect of the\nordinance was to fix the maximum rate that could be charged, such maximum rate being that being charged by the utility on\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Memorial Bend Utility Co., 331 S.W.2d 418 (1960)\n32 P.U.R.3d 522\n\nDecember 31, 1956. Appellee had no notice of the passage of the ordinance before its passage. On the same day ordinances\nNos. 57–1 and 57–3 were repealed.\n\nThe facts here show that the rates being charged by appellee on May 1, 1957 were the same as those being charged by them\non December 31, 1956.\n\nNothing was done by appellee until June 3, 1959. It continued to charge the rates it had voluntarily adopted and which it, by\nits petition of February 18, 1957, expressly asked the City Council to adopt and which the City Council did effectively adopt\nby ordinance No. 57–531. On June 3, appellee wrote the City Council contending it had on February 18, 1957 asked for a\nrate hearing and stating the rates in force were not compensatory and stating it did not intend to continue to operate under the\nexisting rates. *421 They requested a rate hearing. Mr. Puig, the Company president, stated appellee had several times from\nearly 1957 orally requested a rate hearing. Just what kind of a rate hearing he does not state, nor are the times of the requests\nstated. On June 9, 1959, the City Council set a rate hearing for July 23, 1959.\n\nAppellee, without approval of the City Council, promulgated an increase in rates to be charged by it effective July 1, 1959,\nand is now charging such rates.\n\nAppellant filed this suit to enjoin appellee from charging rates in excess of those fixed by ordinance No. 57–531. The trial court\nrefused to grant the injunction.\n [1] Appellee contends the ordinance is as to it invalid because it was given no notice or hearing in connection with the ordinance\nfixing its rates and it was thus denied procedural due process. Too, it contends the rates established are not compensatory, but\noperate to confiscate its property. Further, it says the ordinance recites facts which are contrary to the established fact, that\nis, that since Decembr 31, 1956, there has been no increase in prices and expenses, whereas certainly there has been a very\nsubstantial increase in taxes. Appellee says that in any event under all circumstances the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin refusing to grant the injunction.\n\n [2] [3] We have reached the conclusion that ordinance No. 57–531 was as to appellee valid and effective to fix the maximum\nrates which appellee could charge for its services. We take it to be established law that until such time as a regulatory body\nassumes to exercise its authority to fix rates which a utility may charge, that the utility may fix its own rates, provided they\nare reasonable. 73 C.J.S. Public Utilities §§ 14 and 15, p. 1009. Such rates would be binding until such time as the regulatory\nbody assumes to exercise its authority. United Gas Corp. v. Shepherd Laundries, 144 Tex. 164, 189 S.W.2d 485. As we held on\nJanuary 14, 1960, in the case of the City of Houston v. Willow Bend Utilities, Inc., Tex.Civ.App., 331 S.W.2d 333, in case the\nregulatory body proposes to fix the rates to be charged by the utility due process of law requires that the utility be given notice\nand be given a hearing, unless the utility in some manner consents to the fixing of the particular rates which the regulatory body\nin fact fixes. We think there can be no question that if the utility consents to an order by the regulatory body fixing particular\nrates, no notice of the passage of the order need be given and no hearing need be accorded the utility. In such case the rate is\nthat of the utility and the regulatory body. It would be a rate fixed by the regulatory body with the consent of the utility.\n\n\nIn this case, on February 18, 1957, appellee expressly requested the City Council of the City of Houston to pass an ordinance\napproving the rates and charges being made by appellee. There was an alternative prayer for a rate hearing, but it was for a\nhearing to examine the rates appellee was charging and in this connection it was expressly asked that the rates appellee was\ncharging be not changed until after a hearing. On May 1, 1957, with the enactment of Ordinance No. 57–531, the City Council\ndid just what appellee had expressly requested. It adopted the rates the appellee was charging. After the request by appellee\nthat an ordinance approving these rates be passed, appellee was entitled to no notice that the Council would be as appellee\nhad requested.\n [4] [5] When the ordinance was passed, the rate fixed became the rate promulgated by law and it could not be changed\nexcept in a manner provided by law. The utility could not itself promulgate new rates until the existing rates fixed by law be\nset aside. The only way the rates could be changed would be through a hearing before the City Council. The courts could not\nintervene until appellee first exhausted its remedy before the City Council. San Antonio Transit Company v. City of San Antonio,\nTex.Civ.App., 323 S.W.2d 272, no writ hist.

Memorial Bend Utility Co., 331 S.W.2d 418 (1960)\n32 P.U.R.3d 522\n\nenforce an ordinance that appellee contends operates to confiscate its property, the courts would intervene to determine whether\nthere was in fact confiscation. Oklahoma Operating Company v. Love, 252 U.S. 331, 40 S.Ct. 338, 64 L.Ed. 596. In the case\nbefore us, a hearing was set to commence July 23, 1959. There has been no denial of a hearing. We do not mean to say that even\nthough appellee consented to the adoption of a rate that it would be estopped to assert the rate was confiscatory in a suit filed\nwithin the time prescribed by law after the passage of the ordinance adopting the rates. We merely hold procedural due process\nhas not been denied and that the ordinance not having been contested in court for over two years after it became effective on\nthe ground that the rates established were noncompensatory, appellee cannot change its rates except with the approval of the\nCity Council. San Antonio Transit Co. v. City of San Antonio, supra. Of course, even should the City Council not expressly\ndeny a hearing but should delay or prolong the hearing so its action would be tantamount to a denial of a hearing, the courts\ncould intervene upon proper proceedings being instituted. We have no such situation here.\n\n [6] [7] Appellee contends continued enforcement of the rates would confiscate its property. What we have said above we\nthink should adequately dispose of such contention. However, without going into the matter extensively, it should suffice to\nsay that the proof shows that if revenue from tap charges is included as income, then for the years ending November, 1958,\nand May 31, 1959, appellee would show a profit. Appellee argues that since tap charges are nonrecurring, the revenue derived\nfrom this service may not be considered in determining profit. It is true that nonrecurring revenue may not be considered in\nfixing a rate operative in the future. However, it seems to us but reasonable to consider such in a situation such as we have here\nwhere appellee is contending it should not be enjoined from raising rates fixed by ordinance because it has been operating at\na loss. Certainly it has been income for the period meterial to our inquiry. In determining what the future rate should be you\nhave an entirely different problem.\n\n [8] [9] We are not unaware that the inquiry of this court in a temporary injunction proceeding is whether trial court has\nabused its discretion. However, we understand the law to be that where the facts conclusively show a party is violating the\nsubstantive law it becomes the duty of the court to enjoin the violation. In such case there is no discretion to be exercised.\nIt must correctly apply the law to positively established fact. General Drivers, Warehousemen & Helpers, Local 745, et al.\nv.

Co. v.\nEgan, 126 Tex. 160, 86 S.W.2d 722.\n\n [10] [11] Too, it is the office of a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo. The status quo to be preserved is the last\nactual, peaceful, noncontested status of the parties to the controversy, which preceded the suit and which should be preserved\nuntil a final determination of the matters in controversy. Transport Company of Texas v. Robertson Transports, Inc., 152 Tex.\n551, 261 S.W.2d 549. The last actual, peaceful and noncontested status of the parties to this suit was the status created by\nordinance No. 57–531 adopting rates voluntarily used by appellee which appellee requested the Council to adopt, and the\nordinance adopting them was not contested as fixing confiscatory rates until two years after it became effective.\n\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and judgment is here rendered enjoining appellee, pending a trial on the merits, from\ncharging its customers rates in excess of those being charged by it on May 1, 1957.\n\nAll Citations\n\n331 S.W.2d 418, 32 P.U.R.3d 522\n\nEnd of Document                                                    © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Davis lot, as are all other lots in the subdivision, is\nsubject to certain restrictive covenants in its deed, including restrictions 7 and 8, as follows:\n“7. Set-Back, Front Line, Side Line and Rear Line\n\n“No structure shall be located or erected on any lot nearer to the front plot line than twenty-five (25) feet, nor nearer than five\n(5) feet to any side plot line except that the total combined setback from both sides shall in no event be less *861 than fifteen\n(15) feet, nor nearer than fifteen (15) feet to the rear plot line.\n\n“8. Architectural Control and Building Plans\n\n“For the purpose of insuring the development of the subdivision as a residential area of high standards, the Developers . . .\nreserve the right to regulate and control the buildings or structures or other improvements placed on each lot.

Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859 (1978)\n\n\naesthetic grounds, which in the sole and uncontrolled discretion of the Developers . . . shall seem sufficient. No alterations in\nthe exterior appearance of any building or structure shall be made without like approval. . . . ” 1\n\n\nThe Davises proposed to build a house on their lot to be situated twenty-five feet from the rear plot line. This placement of\nthe house on the lot will clearly comply with restriction 7. However, the developer, respondent Austin Corporation, acting\nthrough respondent David Barrow, refused to approve the Davises' plans because the proposed placement of the house on the\nlot would bar the side view from the Hueys' existing house. In its refusal of the plans the developer purports to exercise its\ngeneral authority under restriction 8 to refuse approval of a plan “on any ground, including purely aesthetic grounds, which in\nthe sole and uncontrolled discretion” of the developer shall seem sufficient.\n\nThe Hueys filed the instant lawsuit to permanently enjoin the Davises from building any structure upon their lot until the plans\ntherefor had been approved in writing by the developer. The Hueys' petition included a prayer that an immediate temporary\nrestraining order be granted and that after a hearing a temporary injunction be entered, both similarly restraining the Davises.\nThe trial court granted an immediate and Ex parte temporary restraining order. After a hearing the trial court entered an order\ndissolving the temporary restraining order and denying the temporary injunction. No findings of fact or conclusions of law\nwere requested or filed.\n\nThe Hueys appealed the denial of the temporary injunction. The court of civil appeals reversed the trial court judgment and\nrendered judgment “that the cause be remanded to the district court, with instructions to enter judgment enjoining Appellees\nDavis and wife from continuing with construction until the house and plot plans have been approved by the developer.” In\nreaching this result the court of civil appeals opinion concluded that the covenants in question were valid. The opinion discussed\nat length the authorities in Texas and other jurisdictions which uphold restrictive covenants implementing a general scheme of\ndevelopment for the common benefit of all lot owners by providing for approval of building plans by the developer. The court\nof civil appeals further examined the issue of the standard governing the developer's conduct in exercising its plan approval\nauthority and concluded that the developer's conduct is improper only if it is arbitrary or in bad faith.\n\n\n                                       THE TEMPORARY INJUNCTION REVIEW\n\n [1] The Davises contend that the court of civil appeals far exceeded the proper scope of appellate review of a temporary\ninjunction and improperly granted premature review of the entire case on its merits. We must agree. The appeal of an order\ngranting or denying a temporary injunction is an appeal from an interlocutory order, which is expressly authorized by Article\n4662, Texas Revised Civil Statutes Annotated. Accordingly, the merits of the underlying case are not presented for appellate\nreview. Appellate review of an order *862 granting or denying a temporary injunction is strictly limited to determination of\nwhether there has been a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in granting or denying the interlocutory order. State v.\nSouthwestern Bell Tel. Co., 526 S.W.2d 526 (Tex.1975); City of Spring Valley v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 484 S.W.2d 579\n(Tex.1972); State v. Cook United, Inc., 469 S.W.2d 709 (Tex.1971); Texas Foundries v. International Moulders & F. Wkrs.,\n151 Tex. 239, 248 S.W.2d 460 (1952).\n\n\nThe court of civil appeals opinion contains no indication that it confined its appellate consideration to review for abuse of\ndiscretion. To the contrary, it appears that the court of civil appeals gave full consideration to the merits of the underlying\nlawsuit. The opinion itself characterizes the case as an appeal from an order denying an injunction. The opinion makes no\nreference to the interlocutory nature of the injunction or to the abuse of discretion standard. Further, the order which the court of\ncivil appeals directed the trial court to enter upon remand fully grants the relief sought by the Hueys in their lawsuit: injunction\nof the construction until the Davises' plans are approved by the developer.\n [2] [3] The Hueys argue that the court of civil appeals opinion was clearly limited to review of the temporary injunction\nbecause that was the only issue raised before that court. However, a reading of the court of civil appeals opinion and order will\nnot support this contention. The effect of premature review of the merits accomplished by the court of civil appeals here is to\ndeny the Davises their right to trial by jury. This court will not assume that the evidence taken at a preliminary hearing will be\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859 (1978)\n\n\nthe same as the evidence developed at a full trial on the merits. Houston Belt & T. Ry. Co. v. Texas & New Orleans R. Co.,\n155 Tex. 407, 289 S.W.2d 217 (1956); Transport Co. of Texas v. Robertson Transports, 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549 (1953).\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] At a hearing upon the request for a temporary injunction the only question before the trial court is whether\nthe applicant is entitled to preservation of the status quo of the subject matter of the suit pending trial on the merits. Houston\nBelt & T. Ry. Co. v. Texas & New Orleans R. Co., supra. On appeal the reviewing court is limited in its consideration as to\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion in making the foregoing determination. The appellate court may not substitute its\njudgment for that of the trial court. Texas Foundries v. International Moulders & F. Wkrs., supra. An abuse of discretion does\nnot exist where the trial court bases its decisions on conflicting evidence. Zmotony v. Phillips, 529 S.W.2d 760 (Tex.1975).\nHere, as no findings of fact or conclusions of law were filed, 2 the trial court judgment must be upheld on any legal theory\nsupported by the record. Seaman v. Seaman, 425 S.W.2d 339 (Tex.1968).\n\n [8] The Davises assert that there are at least three legal theories which will support the trial court's implied holding that the\nHueys showed no probable right to recover. First, the trial court might have concluded that the developer had no power to modify\nthe fifteen-foot setback requirement of deed restriction 7 under the holding of Johnson v. Dick, 281 S.W.2d 171 (Tex.Civ.App.\nSan Antonio 1955, no writ). Second, the trial court could have found as a fact that the developer's action in refusing approval was\nnot reasonable under the circumstances. Third, the trial court could have found as fact that “views” were not a part of the general\nscheme of development of the subdivision and not a proper basis for the exercise of the developer's authority under restriction 8.\n\n\nThe Davises further contend that there are under the evidence at least three theories upon which the trial court could have\nconcluded that the Hueys failed to show irreparable injury. First, there was testimony *863 by Mr. Huey that the reduced value\nof his property could be compensated by money damages. Second, there was testimony that the Hueys could extend their deck\nten feet to preserve their view. Third, because the construction of the Davis house was in such early stages, the Hueys would\nsuffer little injury in the time period between the temporary injunction hearing and the final hearing on the merits. Without\nintruding upon the merits of the underlying cause of action, it may be concluded that at least some basis exists upon which\nthe trial court could have properly held that the Hueys were not entitled to a temporary injunction pending the final hearing.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the temporary injunction.\n\n\n                                                  THE BOND QUESTION\n\n [9] In addition to ordering the case remanded to the trial court with instructions to issue an injunction against construction\nuntil the plans were approved, on October 5, 1977 the court of civil appeals also entered its own injunction pendente lite for\nthe stated purpose of protecting its jurisdiction, ordering the Davises to cease all construction work on the dwelling and not to\nresume work so long as the cause remained within its jurisdiction. 556 S.W.2d 860 at 865. This injunction pendente lite was\nnot conditioned upon the posting of a bond by the Hueys to protect the Davises against loss for delay of construction should\nthe Davises eventually prevail. On October 6, 1977 the Davises filed a “Motion to Set Aside Order or, in the Alternative, to\nSet Bond” wherein the Davises complained of the court of civil appeals' failure to set bond on its own injunction. The motion\nwas overruled on the day it was filed.\n\n\nThe Davises maintain that the court of civil appeals' failure to condition its injunction pendente lite upon a bond is error.\nIn support of this argument the Davises rely upon the recent decisions of two courts of civil appeals requiring a bond upon\nthe issuance of injunctions to preserve their jurisdiction. Riverdrive Mall, Inc. v. Larwin Mortgage Investors, 515 S.W.2d 2\n(Tex.Civ.App. San Antonio 1974, writ ref'd n. r. e.); Pendleton Green Associates v. Anchor Savings Bank, 520 S.W.2d 579\n(Tex.Civ.App. Corpus Christi 1975, no writ).\n\nThe Davises also concede that the issue may be moot. The jurisdiction of the court of civil appeals terminated and the supreme\ncourt acquired exclusive jurisdiction of the case when the application for writ of error was filed. Ammex Warehouse Company\nv. Archer, 381 S.W.2d 478 (Tex.1964); Johnson v. Sovereign Camp, W. O. W., 125 Tex. 329, 83 S.W.2d 605 (1935). Therefore,\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859 (1978)\n\n\nby its terms the order of the court of civil appeals has expired. Petitioners and all respondents agree that the issue is rendered\nmoot by the expiration of the injunction pendente lite. It would appear that this court can grant no relief from an injunction\npendente lite which is no longer in existence. Therefore, we decline to comment upon the necessity of a bond in an injunction\npendente lite issued by a court of civil appeals to protect its jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                                     THE MOTION TO DISMISS\n\n [10] The Hueys have also filed in this court a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction the Davises' application for writ of\nerror on the grounds that it was not timely filed. An application for writ of error must be filed with the clerk of the court of civil\nappeals within thirty days after the overruling of the motion for rehearing in the court of civil appeals. Tex.R.Civ.P. 468. The\nDavis application was filed with the clerk of the court of civil appeals on November 14, 1977. The Hueys argue that the Davises'\n“Motion to Set Aside Order or, in the Alternative, to Set Bond,” filed and overruled on October 6, 1977, must be considered\nto operate as the Davises' only motion for rehearing in the court of civil appeals. If the Hueys were correct in this assertion,\nthe thirty-day time period expired on November 5, 1977, which was a Saturday, and the application was due to be filed by the\nfollowing Monday, November 7, 1977. Tex.R.Civ.P. 4. However, the Davises also timely filed a motion for rehearing *864\nin the court of civil appeals on October 20, 1977. The motion for rehearing was overruled November 2, 1977. It is clear from\na reading of the Davises' October 6 motion that its major thrust was to seek the setting of a bond in connection with the court\nof civil appeals injunction pendente lite. The October 6 motion will not be considered a motion for rehearing, nor will its filing\npreclude the Davises' filing of a timely motion for rehearing on October 20. Therefore, the Davis application for writ of error\nfiled on November 14, 1977 was timely filed and the jurisdiction of this court properly invoked.\n\n\nThe judgment of the court of civil appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nAll Citations\n\n571 S.W.2d 859\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Restriction 8 in its entirety provides for approval by the developer or by an architectural committee.

Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238 (1985)\n\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment for damages in a suit brought under the Jones Act and under admiralty law. The trial dealt only\nwith damages because the trial court struck the defendant's answer as a discovery abuse sanction and signed an interlocutory\ndefault judgment as to liability. The court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment, holding that the action of *240 that\ncourt was an error of law and an abuse of discretion. 689 S.W.2d 472. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and\naffirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThe issues before us are whether TEX.R.CIV.P. 215a(c), as it existed prior to the amendment effective August 1, 1984,\nauthorized the trial court to strike defendant's answer, and, if so, whether the exercise of that authority constituted an abuse\nof discretion.\n\nEdward P. Downer was a seaman aboard the vessel Four Point IV. He drowned while attempting to free a line that had fouled the\nvessel's propeller. Ida E. Downer, his widow, brought this action against Aquamarine Operators, Inc., the owner and operator\nof the vessel. The case was filed in the 151st District Court of Harris County. Both Downer and Aquamarine are residents of\nHarris County, Texas.\n\nDowner filed Notice of Intent to Take the Depositions of All Members of The Crew on June 1. The notice identified each\ncrew member, including the captain, Chester P. Dalfrey, by name only. Downer also requested depositions of the immediate\nsupervisor of Chester Dalfrey and the custodian of Edward Downer's personnel file. On June 1, Aquamarine notified Downer\nthat the crew was at sea and would not appear. Aquamarine at that time agreed to produce the requested persons on June 22. On\nJune 21, Aquamarine again notified Downer that the crew was at sea and would not appear. It agreed to produce them on July 5.\n\nDowner filed written Notice of Intent to Take Depositions of the same individuals for July 5. On that date, the requested\ndeponents did not appear, whereupon Downer filed a Motion for Sanctions. A hearing on the Motion for Sanctions was set\nfor August 22. Aquamarine made no appearance at the hearing; the trial court granted the Motion for Sanctions and signed an\nOrder Striking Aquamarine's Answer.\n\nDowner filed a Motion for Interlocutory Default Judgment to which Aquamarine responded. The response contained\nAquamarine's reasons for not producing the requested individuals for depositions and its failure to appear at the sanctions\nhearing.\n\nThe reason offered for the first two occasions was that work for the FOUR POINT IV was scarce and, when work was available,\nit was necessary to send the vessel and crew to sea rather than produce them for depositions. On the third occasion, the vessel\nwas in port at New Iberia, Louisiana, but Coast Guard regulations required a skeleton crew to be kept aboard at all times.\nAquamarine's attorney stated that he notified Downer's attorney on July 1 of the necessity to take the depositions in New Iberia.\nDowner's attorney stated that he first learned that the individuals would not appear as noticed when Aquamarine's attorney called\nhim an hour after the depositions were scheduled to commence. Both agreed that Aquamarine requested that the depositions\nbe taken in New Iberia on July 6. However, Downer's attorney stated that he could not do so because he was preferentially set\nfor trial in Houston starting at 9:00 a.m. on July 6.\n\nThe reason given by Aquamarine for not appearing at the sanctions hearing was that Hurricane Alicia had struck La Porte,\nthe residence of Mr. Ayres, Aquamarine's lead counsel, four days previously. Mr. Ayres was involved in cleaning up after the\nhurricane and mitigating the damages to his home. Also, he had a hearing set in federal court in Beaumont on the following\nday and was directing all of his available attention to that matter.\n\nTo his Motion to Reconsider the Sanctions, Mr. Ayres attached an affidavit from his secretary, which stated that she had called\nthe clerk of the court on July 7, and had advised her that Mr. Ayres had to make a docket call in Angleton on August 22. She\nunderstood the clerk to say that the sanctions hearing would be reset for September 6. In response to this motion, Downer's\nattorney advised the court by letter of his version of the circumstances leading up to the non-appearance on July 5, and the\ntime when he was first advised *241 that the named individuals would not appear. Attached to this letter to the court was\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                            3\n\fDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238 (1985)\n\n\na copy of a letter dated July 28, written by Mr. Bales, an associate of Mr. Ayres, which confirmed that the sanctions hearing\nwas set for August 22.\n\nWith the above information before it, the trial court overruled Aquamarine's Motion to Reconsider the Sanctions and to reinstate\nits answer. The court signed an order granting an interlocutory default judgment as to liability. Aquamarine filed a Motion to\nSet Aside the Default Judgment. The motion contained practically the same information as the Motion to Reconsider Sanctions\nset out above. The trial court considered this motion and overruled it. On April 16, 1984, the case was preferentially set for trial\nfor June 4, and the trial court refused to consider Aquamarine's Second Motion to Set Aside the Interlocutory Default Judgment\nand Reinstate Defendant's Pleadings.\n\nA jury trial was had in a different court, the 334th District, on the issue of damages. At the trial, Chester Dalfrey testified that\nhe was captain of the FOUR POINT IV and as such he was in complete charge of the vessel with authority over all of its\noperations. Mr. Clark Ivans testified that he was president of Aquamarine at all times pertinent to this case, and that as such,\nhe was the immediate supervisor of Chester Dalfrey.\n\n [1] We now address the issue of whether the trial court had authority under Rule 215a(c) to strike Aquamarine's answer. That\nrule stated in pertinent part:\n\n             If a party or an officer or managing agent of a party, except for good cause shown, fails to appear before\n             the officer who is to take his oral deposition ... the court in which the action is pending on motion and\n             notice may strike out all or any part of the pleading of that party or dismiss the action or proceeding or\n             any part thereof....\n\nAs noted above, Ivans testified that as president of Aquamarine he was in complete charge of all operations of the company.\nThus he was a party as contemplated by Rule 215a(c).\n\n [2] [3] The next question is whether the trial court, in refusing to grant a new trial and reinstate Aquamarine's answer,\ncould consider the evidence introduced subsequent to the original sanctions hearing. Aquamarine contends that the trial court,\nin imposing sanctions, could consider only the evidence before it at the time of the sanctions hearing, and not any evidence\nsubsequently produced. A trial court's plenary jurisdiction gives it not only the authority but the responsibility to review any\npre-trial order upon proper motion. In doing so, it is presumed that the court is familiar with the entire record of the case up\nto and including the motion to be considered. The plenary jurisdiction of the trial court in this case continued through the\nfinal judgment and overruling of Aquamarine's motion for new trial. When considering the motion for new trial, the court had\nbefore it the reasons advanced by Aquamarine for not appearing for depositions or the sanctions hearing; Downer's response to\nAquamarine's motions; and the evidence produced at the trial on damages. Thus, the court of appeals erred in holding that the\ntrial court did not have authority under Rule 215a(c) to strike Aquamarine's answer.\n\nWe now turn to the court of appeals holding that the trial court abused its discretion in striking Aquamarine's answer. The\ncourt of appeals concluded its review of the abuse of discretion issue by stating: “The facts of the case simply do not, in our\nopinion, show this to be an appropriate case to impose the ultimate sanctions of striking the pleadings and entering default\njudgment.” We interpret that statement to mean that the court of appeals disagreed with the decision of the two trial judges\nwho reviewed the matter.\n\n [4] The test for abuse of discretion is not whether, in the opinion of the reviewing court, the facts present an appropriate case\nfor the trial court's action. Rather, it is a question of whether the court acted without reference to any guiding rules and *242\nprinciples. Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, 134 Tex. 388, 133 S.W.2d 124, 126 (Tex.Comm.App.—1939, opinion adopted).\nAnother way of stating the test is whether the act was arbitrary or unreasonable. Smithson v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d\n439, 443 (Tex.1984); Landry v. Travelers Insurance Co., 458 S.W.2d 649, 651 (Tex.1970).

Strayhorn, 159 Tex. 421, 321 S.W.2d 290, 295 (Tex.1959).\n\nTo determine the trial judge's guiding rules and principles in imposing sanctions for discovery abuse, we must look to the Texas\nRules of Civil Procedure as promulgated and amended by this Court as well as the decisions of appellate courts of this State\nand of the United States. The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to discovery and sanctions for noncompliance have\nbeen amended several times, culminating in Rule 215a as it existed at the time of this case, and now embodied in Rule 215. The\nuse of sanctions by trial courts to prevent discovery abuse has developed steadily over the past several years. These changes\nreflect the continuing pattern both to broaden the discovery process and to encourage sanctions for failure to comply.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 96 S.Ct. 2778,\n49 L.Ed.2d 747 (1976) approved the use of sanctions not only to assure compliance with the discovery process but also to deter\nthose who might be tempted to abuse discovery in the absence of a deterrent.\n\nThis court and various courts of appeals have also followed this progression. See, e.g., Dyson v. Olin Corp., 692 S.W.2d 456\n(Tex.1985), (Kilgarlin, J., concurring) (unnamed witness not permitted to testify); Jarrett v. Warhola, 695 S.W.2d 8 (Tex.App.\n—Houston [14th Dist.] 1985, writ ref'd), (plaintiff's cause of action dismissed); City of Houston v. Arney, 680 S.W.2d 867\n(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, no writ) (defendant's answer struck for failure to answer interrogatories); Southern Pacific\nTransportation v. Evans, 590 S.W.2d 515 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (defendant's answer struck\nand interlocutory default judgment rendered as to liability), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 994, 101 S.Ct. 531, 66 L.Ed.2d 291 (1980).\n\nIn various speeches and law review articles, different members of this court have encouraged trial judges to use sanctions to\nthe degree necessary to assure compliance with discovery procedures and deter abuse of the process. Barrow and Henderson,\n1984 Amendments to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure Affecting Discovery, 15 ST. MARY'S L.J. 713 (1984) (presented to\nthe Texas College of the Judiciary Nov. 29, 1984); Kilgarlin and Jackson, Sanctions for Discovery Abuse Under New Rule 215,\n15 ST. MARY'S L.J. 767 (1984); Pope and McConnico, Practicing Law With the 1981 Texas Rules, 32 BAYLOR L.REV. 457\n(1981); Spears, The Rules of Civil Procedure: 1981 Changes In Pretrial Discovery, 12 ST. MARY'S L.J. 633 (1981).\n\nThe trial court in this case was free to examine the factors before it to determine whether to levy sanctions. Among these were\nthe following: (1) whether voluntarily sending the crew to sea rather than producing them for depositions as agreed on two\noccasions was in conscious disregard of this court's rules; (2) whether the contradictory statements of both attorneys indicated\nthat Aquamarine's attorney did in fact wait until one hour past the scheduled time for depositions on July 5, to advise Downer's\nattorney that he would have to fly to New Iberia and take depositions on the following day; (3) whether Aquamarine's attorney\nconsciously disregarded the sanctions hearing in preference to his personal needs and the federal court case set the following\nday; (4) whether the information contained in the secretary's affidavit as to the date of the sanctions hearing conflicted with\nthe letter from an attorney *243 in that law firm confirming that the hearing was set on August 22; and (5) the unexplained\nfailure of Aquamarine to produce for depositions on any of the occasions in question Clark Ivans, the immediate supervisor\nof Chester Dalfrey and the president of Aquamarine.\n\n [5] The record contains no indication that the trial court was capricious, arbitrary, or unreasonable. Thus, the court of appeals\nerred in holding that the trial court abused its discretion.\n\nIn determining whether to reverse and render this cause or to remand it to the court of appeals, we must look to the four points\nof error raised by Aquamarine before the court of appeals but not addressed by that court. If those points raise questions of law,\nas opposed to questions of fact, they can be addressed by this court.\n\nThe first point was that Downer's First Amended Original Petition was insufficient to support the judgment. The contention is\nthat the facts supporting the cause of action were not pleaded. TEX.R.CIV.P. 47 requires that a petition contain a short statement\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             5\n\fDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238 (1985)\n\n\nof the cause of action sufficient to give fair notice of the claim involved. Our rules do not require pleadings to contain evidence\nor factual detail. That point is overruled.\n\n [6] The second point was that the trial court improperly refused to strike a juror for cause. After the court had ruled on\nchallenges for cause, there were 26 names left on the jury list. Each party was given six jury strikes, so, after making those\nstrikes, 14 names remained on the list. The challenged juror was Number 14 and was thus a spare. There was no harm in refusing\nto dismiss him for cause.\n\n [7] The third point was that the trial court improperly refused to admit evidence of Downer's contributory negligence.\nContributory negligence is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded. Aquamarine's answer had been struck and default\njudgment rendered as to liability. Thus, defendant had no pleading to support contributory negligence, so the court did not err\nin refusing to admit the requested evidence.\n\n [8] Aquamarine's remaining point before the court of appeals was that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest\nin a Jones Act case tried to a jury. This point was not presented to the trial court and was thus waived.\n\nAquamarine's points of error presented to the court of appeals but not considered by that court concerned questions of law\nover which we have jurisdiction. There is no merit to these points so it is not necessary for this cause to be remanded to the\ncourt of appeals.\n\nThe judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n701 S.W.2d 238\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Dept. of Human Services, 62 S.W.3d 867 (2001)\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\nBEA ANN SMITH, Justice.\n\nAppellee Texas Department of Human Services (the Department) received a request for release of certain documents regarding\nappellant Ebony Lake Healthcare Center (Ebony Lake), pursuant to the Public Information Act. See Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\n§§ 552.001–552.353 (West 1994 & Supp.2001). Ebony Lake informed the Department that it considered some of the\ndocuments privileged. Accordingly, the Department requested an attorney general's opinion. The Attorney General found\nthat the documents in question were not privileged and ordered the documents released. Ebony Lake subsequently sought a\ndeclaratory judgment, asking the trial court to declare the documents subject to a confidentiality privilege; in conjunction with\nthe suit, Ebony Lake also sought a temporary injunction. The trial court denied the temporary injunction, and Ebony Lake brings\nthis interlocutory appeal from that ruling. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 51.014 (West Supp.2001). We will reverse\nthe trial court's order denying the temporary injunction and remand the cause to the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\nOn February 23, 2000, an attorney representing family members of an Ebony Lake resident sent an open records request to the\nDepartment, seeking among other items all incident reports sent by Ebony Lake to the Department. On April 6, Ebony Lake\ninformed the Department that it considered some of the documents privileged from disclosure. Based on this information, the\nDepartment requested an attorney general's opinion concerning the confidentiality of the documents. The Attorney General\ndetermined that the documents were not subject to the asserted privileges and should be disclosed.\n\nEbony Lake then filed a declaratory judgment suit, seeking a judicial determination that the documents were subject to the\nasserted privileges. In conjunction with the suit, Ebony Lake sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the release of the\ndocuments. On August 20, 2000, visiting Judge Pete Lowry granted the temporary restraining order and set the matter for a\ntemporary injunction hearing. Following the hearing, Judge Lowry granted the temporary injunction in part. 1 The order signed\nby the trial court, *870 however, failed to include a date for a trial on the merits and failed to set a bond.\n\nOn January 9, 2001, the Department and the Attorney General filed a joint motion to dissolve Judge Lowry's order, claiming\nthat it was void ab initio because it failed to set a trial date or a bond. Judge Darlene Byrne considered the motion and agreed\nthat the order was void.\n\nThereafter, the trial court granted a second temporary restraining order and held a second temporary injunction hearing. At the\nhearing, the parties and the trial court agreed to adopt all evidence and exhibits from the first temporary injunction hearing,\nand the trial court heard legal arguments. Following the hearing, the trial court denied the application for temporary injunction.\nEbony Lake requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the trial court declined to file. Ebony Lake now appeals\nthe trial court's denial of its application for temporary injunction and the trial court's ruling that the initial temporary injunction\norder was void.\n\n\n\n                                                           DISCUSSION\n\nJudge Lowry entered an order granting Ebony Lake's application for temporary injunction in part on August 28, 2000. More\nthan four months later, the Department and the Attorney General filed a joint motion to dissolve the temporary injunction,\narguing that the order was void on its face because it failed to include a date for a trial on the merits and failed to set a bond\namount. The trial court agreed and declared the order void. By its second issue, Ebony Lake claims the trial court erred in\ndeclaring the first temporary injunction order void.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Before a trial\ncourt issues a temporary injunction, the applicant must execute a bond to the adverse party and file the bond with the court clerk.\nChambers v.

Id.\n\n [2] Similarly, Rule 683 provides: “Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for\ntrial on the merits with respect to the ultimate relief sought.” Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. The requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory,\nand an order that does not comply with the rule is fatally defective and void. InterFirst Bank San Felipe, N.A. v. Paz Constr.\nCo., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986); University Interscholastic League v. Torres, 616 S.W.2d 355, 357–58 (Tex.App.—San\nAntonio 1981, no writ).\n\nFinally, both the supreme court and this Court have held that “a judgment which discloses its invalidity on its face is a nullity\nand may be disregarded anywhere at any time.” Chambers, 916 S.W.2d at 635; accord Fulton v. Finch, 162 Tex. 351, 346\nS.W.2d 823, 827 (1961). The trial court correctly applied this rule in declaring the initial temporary injunction order void. We\noverrule Ebony Lake's second issue.\n\n [3] [4] [5] [6] Having determined that the initial order granting Ebony Lake's application for a temporary injunction was\nvoid, we next consider whether the trial court erred in denying Ebony Lake's second request for a temporary injunction. In an\nappeal from an order denying a request for a temporary injunction, our review is confined to the validity of the order denying\nthe injunctive relief. Walling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex.1993); *871 Universal Health Servs. v. Thompson, 24\nS.W.3d 570, 576 (Tex.App.—Austin 2000, no pet.). The decision to grant or deny the temporary injunction lies within the\nsound discretion of the trial court; we will not disturb that decision absent a clear abuse of discretion. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d at\n576. This Court may neither substitute its judgment for that of the trial court nor consider the merits of the lawsuit. Id. Rather,\nwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, indulging every reasonable inference in its favor, and\ndetermine whether the order was so arbitrary as to exceed the bounds of reasonable discretion. Id.\n\n [7] [8] In a temporary injunction hearing, the trial court assesses whether the applicant has shown a probable right to recovery\nand a probable injury in the interim. Id. To establish a probable right to recovery, an applicant need not prove that it will\nultimately prevail in the litigation; rather, the applicant must show it has a cause of action for which it may be granted relief. Id.\nProbable right to recovery includes the element of wrongful conduct. Id. At this preliminary stage, the applicant need not prove\nthat the information subject to the Public Information Act is privileged. See Center for Econ. Justice v. American Ins. Ass'n, 39\nS.W.3d 337, 343 (Tex.App.—Austin 2001, no pet.). The applicant need only demonstrate that it is entitled to protection and\nthe status quo should be maintained until a trial on the merits commences.\n\nEbony Lake claims it established a probable right to recovery because it has a claim based on the Public Information Act. See\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001–.353. Ebony Lake further argues that it established a likelihood of success on the merits\nby presenting competent, uncontroverted evidence that the reports at issue were created by a medical peer review committee\nand are therefore confidential.\n\nThe Texas Public Information Act governs access to governmental information. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001–.353. At\nthe heart of the Act is the principle that the public is entitled to all information “collected, assembled, or maintained by a\ngovernmental body.” Holmes v. Morales, 924 S.W.2d 920, 922 (Tex.1996); accord Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.002(a)(1) (West\nSupp.2001). However, the Act provides that information is excepted from public disclosure if it is considered confidential by\neither constitutional or statutory law or by judicial decision. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 552.101 (West 1994).\n\n [9] [10] Whether information is subject to disclosure under the Public Information Act and whether an exception applies are\nlegal questions of statutory construction.

Justice, 39 S.W.3d at 347. A trial court abuses its discretion when it misapplies the law to the facts. Center for Econ.\nJustice, 39 S.W.3d at 347.\n\nEbony Lake claims on appeal that the information sought is made confidential by the medical peer review committee privilege\n(“peer review privilege”). Tex. Occ.Code Ann. § 160.007 (West 2001). The Medical Practice Act provides: “[E]ach proceeding\nor record of a medical peer review committee is confidential, and any communication made to a medical peer review committee\nis privileged.” Tex. Occ.Code Ann. § 160.007(a). Medical peer review committee is defined as\n\n            a committee of a health care entity, the governing board of a health care entity, or the medical staff\n            of a health care entity, that operates under written bylaws approved by the policy-making body or the\n            governing board of the health care entity and is authorized to evaluate the quality of medical and *872\n            health care services or the competence of physicians.\n\nId. § 151.002(a)(8) (West 2001). The Act defines medial peer review as “the evaluation of medical and health care services,\nincluding evaluation of the qualifications of professional health care practitioners and of patient care provided by those\npractitioners.” Id. § 151.002(a)(7).\n\nIn determining whether Ebony Lake established the elements necessary for temporary injunctive relief, the trial court considered\nwhether Ebony Lake had a probable right to prevail on its claim of privilege. In support of its claim to a privilege, Ebony Lake\npresented the documents at issue for in camera inspection and produced its quality assurance committee policy, along with\ntestimony from the facility administrator, Del Waggoner. The documents themselves detail three different accidents involving\nresidents at the facility. They include witnesses' observations of the incidents, along with any subsequent action taken by the\nfacility, including any actions directed toward its employees as a result of the incidents. Finally, the reports include diagnoses\nof the residents following their transport to the hospital.\n\nWaggoner testified that the incident reports were “processed” by the quality assurance committee and handled through the\ncommittee process. Waggoner also testified that at least one of the documents was created following an investigation performed\nby an “expression” of the quality assurance committee. He added that this investigation would have been conducted even if the\ncommittee had elected not to file any incident report with the Department. On cross-examination, Waggoner conceded that one\nof the reports would not have been filed with the Department if a complaint had not been lodged against the facility.\n\nIn response, appellees maintain that because Ebony Lake was required by law to file its reports with the Department, see Health\n& Safety Code Ann. § 242.122 (West 2001), the reports constitute business records, which are public information. See In re\nPack, 996 S.W.2d 4, 7 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1999, orig. proceeding.). In addition, appellees argue that Ebony Lake cannot\nsatisfy the strict requirements mandated by Jordan v. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District, 701 S.W.2d\n644 (Tex.1985), in order to assert a privilege. We will first address the applicability of Jordan to the facts of this case.\n\nAccording to appellees, Jordan mandates that in order for a party to successfully assert a privilege, the party must establish\nthat the documents at issue were (1) created with committee impetus and purpose, and (2) not “gratuitously submitted to a\ncommittee.” Id. at 648. Jordan addressed the predecessor to section 161.032 of the Health and Safety Code, or the medical\ncommittee privilege. 2 The *873 statutory definition of “medical committee” is broad in scope and encompasses a medical\npeer review committee. Memorial Hosp.—The Woodlands v. McCown, 927 S.W.2d 1, 8 (Tex.1996); Irving Healthcare Sys. v.\nBrooks, 927 S.W.2d 12, 20 (Tex.1996). In considering the scope of the privilege provided by that section, the supreme court\nnarrowly construed its applicability and held: “[T]his privilege extends to documents that have been prepared by or at the\ndirection of the committee for committee purposes. Documents which are gratuitously submitted to a committee or which have\nbeen created without committee impetus and purpose are not protected.” Jordan, 701 S.W.2d at 648.\n\nLater, in Irving and McCown, the supreme court considered the scope of the predecessor to the peer review privilege, now\ncodified in the Occupations Code, and its applicability to communications regarding the qualifications of a physician. Both\nIrving and McCown addressed a narrow set of facts in which the supreme court was asked to determine whether documents\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             6\n\fEbony Lake Healthcare Center v. Texas Dept. of Human Services, 62 S.W.3d 867 (2001)\n\n\ngenerated by a medical peer review committee in its initial credentialing process are subject to the peer review privilege. The\ncourt broadly applied the peer review privilege and held that “even a ‘gratuitous' communication to a peer review committee\nabout the qualifications of a physician or the quality of health care provided by that physician is within the scope of section\n5.06 [now section 160.006 of the Occupations Code].” Irving, 927 S.W.2d at 19; accord McCown, 927 S.W.2d at 5.\n\n [11] In this case, Ebony Lake relies on only the peer review privilege. This privilege is associated with one discreet and specific\ntype of medical committee—that which performs peer reviews. Although the peer review committee is encompassed by the\nmore broadly defined “medical committee,” the supreme court has held that the more specific sub-category of a medical peer\nreview committee enjoys broad application of the peer review privilege. Accordingly, we consider only whether Ebony Lake\nhas shown a probable right to recovery based on its assertion of a peer review privilege. Although the documents at issue were on\npre-printed forms developed by the Department, reports were appended to those forms. The reports indicate the time and location\nof the occurrences, the nature of the occurrences, post-occurrence treatment, witnesses to the occurrences, and descriptions of\nthe incidents. The documents also indicate that the actions of some of the facility's medical staff were investigated or reviewed.\nMoreover, Waggoner testified that the reports were processed by the quality assurance committee, and Ebony Lake produced a\ncopy of the policy under which the committee operates. Appellees presented no controverting evidence. Based on this evidence,\nwe conclude that Ebony Lake has satisfied its burden for purposes of a temporary injunction. Cf. In re Osteopathic Med. Ctr.,\n16 S.W.3d 881 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 2000, orig. proceeding) (holding trial court abused its discretion in ordering production\nof report documenting occurrence at facility, patient's condition before occurrence, diagnosis of condition after occurrence,\nand care and treatment received until transport to hospital); In re WHMC, 996 S.W.2d 409 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n1999, orig. proceeding) (holding trial court abused its discretion in ordering medical facility to produce documents even though\nwitness averred that documents were generated for committee purpose of improving quality of patient care).\n\n [12] [13] Ebony Lake has also demonstrated a showing of probable harm in the interim. A party proves irreparable harm\n *874 by showing an injury for which there can be no real legal measure of damages or none that can be ascertained with a\nsufficient degree of certainty. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d at 577. Ebony Lake argues that disclosure of the reports prior to the trial on\nthe merits would result in a noncompensable injury. We agree. It would be a hollow victory if, following a trial on the merits,\nthe trial court were to determine that the reports were indeed privileged, but the reports had already been disclosed.\n\nRelying on In re Pack, appellees counter that because Ebony Lake was required by law to disclose the reports to the Department,\nthey have failed to demonstrate any injury. Pack was a mandamus action, in which the second court of appeals was called\nupon to decide whether nursing home investigation reports prepared by the Texas Department of Human Services, along with a\nnursing home's responsive plans of correction, and the testimony of the Department's surveyors regarding their investigations,\nwere excluded from discovery under the peer review privilege. 996 S.W.2d at 5. The nursing home argued that the records\nwere prepared from confidential information collected from the nursing home's peer review committee, and that the Department\nwas an agent of this committee when it prepared its reports. However, in that proceeding the nursing home did not segregate\nthose documents that it claimed included confidential information for in camera inspection, as it was required to do. The court\nconcluded that because the Department and the nursing home were required by law to make the documents at issue public, the\ndocuments were discoverable. In re Pack, 996 S.W.2d at 7. The court further held, “The mere fact that the Nursing Home's peer\nreview committee may have reviewed the TDHS documents does not make them privileged.” Id.\n\n [14] In this case, the nursing home did segregate the questionable documents for in camera inspection. Furthermore, the\ndocuments were not created by the Department, as was the case in Pack, but were created by the quality assurance committee.\nWe need not decide at this juncture whether In re Pack applies to the facts of this case and renders the reports at issue subject to\ndisclosure. The facts before us, however, are sufficiently distinguishable to establish a bona fide issue that should be addressed\nat a trial on the merits. And because Ebony Lake has shown clear evidence of irreparable injury, its certainty of victory need not\nbe as stringently examined. See Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n, 72S.W.3d 23, ––––, No. 3–01–114–CV, slip\nop. at 11, 2001 WL 838883 (Tex.App.—Austin July 26, 2001, no pet. h.) (quoting Developments in the Law—Injunctions, 78\nHarv.

Texas Dept. of Human Services, 62 S.W.3d 867 (2001)\n\n\nstringent requirement of certainty of victory; greater certainty of victory should result in a less stringent requirement of proof\nof irreparable injury.” Id. In this case, the sliding scale measures in Ebony Lake's favor. Ebony Lake's first issue is sustained.\n\n\n\n                                                            CONCLUSION\n\nWe hold that the initial August 20 temporary injunction order was fatally defective and therefore void; accordingly, we overrule\nEbony Lake's second issue. We conclude, however, that Ebony Lake established a probable right to recovery and a probable\ninjury in the interim and thus satisfied the prerequisites for a temporary injunction. We therefore sustain its first issue and\nreverse the trial court's order denying the application for a temporary injunction, and remand the cause to the trial court for\nissuance of a temporary *875 injunction or for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n62 S.W.3d 867\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Judge Lowry signed three orders, which are not readily reconcilable.

Justin Lindley, Ramey & Flock, P.C., Tyler, TX, Sheral Kniffin Maloy, El Paso, TX, for Respondents.\n\nOpinion\n\nJustice GREEN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe principal question in this case is whether consideration received for the sale of a business interest is subject to equitable\nforfeiture as a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty. We hold that when a partner in a business breached his fiduciary duty by\nfraudulently inducing another partner to buy out his interest, the consideration received by the breaching party for his interest\nin the business is subject to forfeiture as a remedy for the breach, in addition to other damages that result from the tortious\nconduct. Here, the trial court ordered equitable forfeiture, but the court of appeals reversed, concluding that forfeiture was not\nan available remedy. We reverse the court of appeals' judgment in part and remand the case to that court for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                            I. Facts\n\nLarry G. Snodgrass and J. Mark Swinnea owned equal interests in two business entities, ERI Consulting Engineers, Inc., and\nMalmeba Company, Ltd., which they operated together for approximately ten years. ERI is a small consulting company that\nmanages asbestos abatement projects for contractors. It leased office space from Malmeba, a partnership that owned the building.\n\nSnodgrass and ERI purchased Swinnea's interest in ERI in 2001. ERI paid Swinnea $497,500 to redeem Swinnea's ERI stock,\nand Snodgrass transferred his half-interest in Malmeba to Swinnea. ERI agreed to employ Swinnea for six years, and Swinnea\nagreed not to compete with ERI. At the same time, ERI agreed to continue leasing from Malmeba for six *871 years. 1\n\nUnknown to Snodgrass, the wives of Swinnea and Chris Power, an ERI employee, had created a new company called Air\nQuality Associates a month before Swinnea and Snodgrass executed the buyout agreement. Air Quality Associates was created\nto perform mold abatement, but later engaged in asbestos abatement as a contractor even though neither wife had experience\nin the asbestos abatement field. Swinnea did not disclose the existence of Air Quality Associates to Snodgrass during the ERI\nbuyout negotiations. In fact, because Swinnea believed Snodgrass would “run [ERI] into the ground,” Swinnea told Power to\n“[b]e patient because we can buy this company back 50 cents on the dollar.” The trial court found that “Swinnea's placement of\nhis wife, Dawn Swinnea, and Tracy Power as principals of Air Quality Associates, Inc. was deceptive, a sham and constituted\nfraud.”\n\nAfter the buyout, Swinnea's revenue production as an ERI employee dropped 30%–50%. Snodgrass testified that although\nSwinnea's supervisory responsibilities were to cease under their agreement, Swinnea's revenue production was to remain the\nsame, if not increase. Soon thereafter, Snodgrass learned about Swinnea's relationship with Air Quality Associates from one\nof ERI's asbestos contractors, Merico, with which Air Quality Associates was competing. Because of the personal relationship\nbetween the individuals involved with ERI and Air Quality Associates, Merico told Snodgrass that Merico would no longer\nwork with ERI if ERI were to accept bids from Air Quality Associates on asbestos abatement projects. ERI had been accepting\nbids from Air Quality Associates without Snodgrass knowing of Swinnea's or Power's relationship with Air Quality Associates.\n\nPower and his wife later bought out the Swinneas' interest in Air Quality Associates. ERI subsequently worked with Air\nQuality Associates, while its work with Merico declined. Meanwhile, Swinnea and his wife formed a new company, Brady\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 683\n\nEnvironmental. The Swinneas told Snodgrass that Brady Environmental was going to clean homes and air ducts. However,\nBrady Environmental began performing asbestos abatement using the Resilient Floor Covering Institute method. Evidence\nsuggests that ERI's clients' use of this method impacted ERI's business because RFCI does not require a consultant like ERI.\nAlthough he was employed by ERI, Swinnea encouraged ERI's clients to use RFCI instead, contrary to ERI's interest and policy.\nAfter the relationship between Swinnea and ERI deteriorated, Snodgrass ultimately fired Swinnea, releasing him from his non-\ncompete obligations. Swinnea obtained a license to perform asbestos consulting work the next day and began working for Brady\nEnvironmental as a consultant. Snodgrass moved ERI out of Malmeba's building and pursued this lawsuit with ERI against\nSwinnea, Malmeba, and Brady Environmental.\n\nAfter a bench trial, the trial court found for Snodgrass and ERI on their claims for statutory fraud in a real estate and stock\ntransaction, common law fraud, breach of the non-compete clause in the contract, as well as for breach of fiduciary duty.\nIt rendered judgment awarding ERI and Snodgrass combined damages of $1,020,700, and $1 million in exemplary *872\ndamages. The non-exemplary damages awarded by the trial court consisted of both equitable forfeiture and actual damages:\nforfeiture of $437,500, a portion of the $497,500 paid to Swinnea by ERI; forfeiture of $150,000, the value of Snodgrass's one-\nhalf interest in Malmeba transferred to Swinnea; forfeiture of $133,200, constituting the sum of the lease payments from ERI to\nMalmeba after the buyout; and $300,000 as ERI's lost profits from its business relationship with Merico. The trial court found\nthat a civil conspiracy existed between Swinnea and Brady Environmental, and held Brady Environmental jointly and severally\nliable with Swinnea for the damages.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor of Swinnea because it found the evidence “legally insufficient to\nsupport the damage awards.” 236 S.W.3d 825, 832 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2007). In particular, the court of appeals found that ERI\nfailed to prove any actual damages. Id. at 841. It found that the equitable remedy of forfeiture was unavailable because there\nwas no fee paid to Swinnea to be forfeited. Id. It concluded further that ERI failed to prove that Swinnea obtained any ill-gotten\ngains subject to disgorgement. Id. It determined that the lease payments were not recoverable because the evidence that the\nlease payments were intended as consideration for the buyout was “incompetent parol evidence.” Id. at 835. Finally, the court\nof appeals concluded that there was no basis for joint liability as to Brady Environmental because there was no evidence of a\nconspiracy between Swinnea and Brady Environmental. Id. at 841–42.\n\nSwinnea does not dispute his liability for fraud, breach of contract, or breach of fiduciary duty. Rather, he disputes the damages\nthe trial court awarded. He asserts that the forfeiture award is unsupported by law. He also asserts that the lost profits award is\nunsupported by legally sufficient evidence. Brady Environmental primarily disputes whether it can be jointly liable for any of\nthe particular damages awarded by the trial court regardless of whether it later conspired in certain wrongful acts.\n\n\n\n                                                    II. Equitable Forfeiture\n\n [1] The primary question we must address is whether forfeiture of contractual consideration is available as a remedy against\nSwinnea. We have previously upheld equitable remedies for breach of fiduciary duty. E.g., Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229,\n237–45 (Tex.1999) (upholding remedy of forfeiture upon attorney's breach of fiduciary duty). In Kinzbach Tool Co. v. Corbett–\nWallace Corp., we stated the principle behind such remedies:\n\n  It is beside the point for [Defendant] to say that [Plaintiff] suffered no damages because it received full value for what it has\n  paid and agreed to pay.... It would be a dangerous precedent for us to say that unless some affirmative loss can be shown,\n  the person who has violated his fiduciary relationship with another may hold on to any secret gain or benefit he may have\n  thereby acquired. It is the law that in such instances if the fiduciary “takes any gift, gratuity, or benefit in violation of his\n  duty, or acquires any interest adverse to his principal, without a full disclosure, it is a betrayal of his trust and a breach of\n  confidence, and he must account to his principal for all he has received.”\n\n138 Tex. 565, 160 S.W.2d 509, 514 (1942) (quoting United States v. Carter, 217 U.S. 286, 306, 30 S.Ct. 515, 54 L.Ed. 769\n(1910)). We later reiterated that a fiduciary may be punished for breaching his duty: “The main purpose of forfeiture is not\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              7\n\fERI Consulting Engineers, Inc. v. Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867 (2010)\n53 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 683\n\nto compensate an injured principal.... Rather, *873 the central purpose ... is to protect relationships of trust by discouraging\nagents' disloyalty.” Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 238.\n\n [2] [3] Accordingly, courts may fashion equitable remedies such as profit disgorgement and fee forfeiture to remedy a breach\nof fiduciary duty. For instance, courts may disgorge all ill-gotten profits from a fiduciary when a fiduciary agent usurps an\nopportunity properly belonging to a principal, or competes with a principal. See, e.g., Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C.,\n73 S.W.3d 193, 200 (Tex.2002) (stating the rule that courts may disgorge any profit where “an agent diverted an opportunity\nfrom the principal or engaged in competition with the principal, [and] the agent or an entity controlled by the agent profited\nor benefitted in some way”). Similarly, even if a fiduciary does not obtain a benefit from a third party by violating his duty, a\nfiduciary may be required to forfeit the right to compensation for the fiduciary's work. See, e.g., Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 237\n(“[A] person who renders service to another in a relationship of trust may be denied compensation for his service if he breaches\nthat trust.”). The difficulty comes in categorizing the damages awarded in this case. Here, the damages awarded by the trial court\nwere not ill-gotten profits from an outside opportunity or external competition, or compensation for work done by the fiduciary.\nRather, the trial court returned a significant part of the contractual consideration paid by ERI and Snodgrass to Swinnea as part\nof the buyout agreement. The situation arises because here the contracting party, Swinnea, was a fiduciary, such that we must\nconsider whether under the circumstances an equitable remedy may cross the line from actual damages for breach of contract\nor fraud (redressing specific harm) to further, equitable return of contractual consideration.\n\nThe trial court found Swinnea liable for fraudulent inducement as to the buyout agreement, and Swinnea does not challenge this\nliability. The trial court also found that Swinnea owed fiduciary duties both to ERI and to Snodgrass. It follows that Swinnea's\nactions in fraudulently inducing the buyout agreement contracts were willful breaches of his fiduciary duty. We hold that\nwhere willful actions constituting breach of fiduciary duty also amount to fraudulent inducement, the contractual consideration\nreceived by the fiduciary is recoverable in equity regardless of whether actual damages are proven, subject to certain limiting\nprinciples set out below.\n\nThe situation in this case is akin in many respects to the fee forfeiture scenario between a principal and agent, which we discussed\nat length in Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 237–45. In that case, former clients sued their attorneys alleging breach of fiduciary duty\narising from settlement negotiations in a previous lawsuit. Id. at 232–33. We held that “a client need not prove actual damages\nin order to obtain forfeiture of an attorney's fee for the attorney's breach of fiduciary duty to the client.” Id. at 240. We repeated\nthat “the central purpose of the remedy is to protect relationships of trust from an agent's disloyalty or other misconduct.”\nId. That policy applies equally to the relationship of trust at issue here and the duties Swinnea owed to ERI and Snodgrass.\nWe cited section 469 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, which states that if “conduct [that is a breach of his duty of\nloyalty] constitutes a wilful and deliberate breach of his contract of service, he is not entitled to compensation even for properly\nperformed services for which no compensation is apportioned.” Id. at 237. We also stated:\n\n             [T]he possibility of forfeiture of compensation discourages an agent from taking *874 personal\n             advantage of his position of trust in every situation no matter the circumstances, whether the principal\n             may be injured or not. The remedy of forfeiture removes any incentive for an agent to stray from his duty\n             of loyalty based on the possibility that the principal will be unharmed or may have difficulty proving\n             the existence or amount of damages.\n\nId. at 238. The same principles apply to circumstances where a fiduciary takes advantage of his position of trust to induce a\nprincipal to enter into a contract. The remedy of forfeiture is necessary to prevent such abuses of trust, regardless of proof of\nactual damages.\n\n [4] Although forfeiture of contractual consideration may “have a punitive effect” like forfeiture of compensation, id. at 240,\nit may nevertheless be necessary to protect fiduciary relationships. As we said in the attorney-client context:\n\n             An attorney who has clearly and seriously breached his fiduciary duty to his client should not be\n             insulated from fee forfeiture by his client's ignorance of the matter. Nor should an attorney who has\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 683\n\n             deliberately engaged in professional misconduct be allowed to put his client to the choice of terminating\n             the relationship and risking that the outcome of the litigation may be adversely affected, or continuing\n             the relationship despite the misconduct.\n\nId. at 244. The same reasoning applies here: a fiduciary who breaches his duty should not be insulated from forfeiture if the\nparty whom he fraudulently induced into contract is ignorant about the fraud, or fails to suffer harm. Likewise, the innocent\nparty should not be put into a difficult choice regarding termination of the contract upon discovering the breach of duty.\n\n [5] [6] Where equitable remedies exist, however, “the remedy of forfeiture must fit the circumstances presented.” Id. at 241.\nIn Burrow, we listed several factors for consideration when fashioning a particular equitable forfeiture remedy in the context\nof attorney-client relationships:\n\n  “[T]he gravity and timing of the violation, its wilfulness, its effect on the value of the lawyer's work for the client, any other\n  threatened or actual harm to the client, and the adequacy of other remedies.” These factors are to be considered in determining\n  whether a violation is clear and serious, whether forfeiture of any fee should be required, and if so, what amount. The list\n  is not exclusive. The several factors embrace broad considerations which must be weighed together and not mechanically\n  applied. For example, the “wilfulness” factor requires consideration of the attorney's culpability generally; it does not simply\n  limit forfeiture to situations in which the attorney's breach of duty was intentional. The adequacy-of-other-remedies factor\n  does not preclude forfeiture when a client can be fully compensated by damages. Even though the main purpose of the remedy\n  is not to compensate the client, if other remedies do not afford the client full compensation for his damages, forfeiture may\n  be considered for that purpose.\n\nId. at 243–44 (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 49 (Proposed Final Draft No.\n1, 1996)). We also cited comment c to section 243 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts:\n\n             It is within the discretion of the court whether the trustee who has committed a breach of trust shall\n             receive full compensation or whether his compensation shall be reduced or denied. In the exercise of\n             the court's discretion the following factors are considered: (1) whether *875 the trustee acted in good\n             faith or not; (2) whether the breach of trust was intentional or negligent or without fault; (3) whether the\n             breach of trust related to the management of the whole trust or related only to a part of the trust property;\n             (4) whether or not the breach of trust occasioned any loss and whether if there has been a loss it has been\n             made good by the trustee; (5) whether the trustee's services were of value to the trust.\n\nId. at 243. Several of these factors are also relevant in this context. The gravity and timing of the breach of duty, the level of\nintent or fault, whether the principal received any benefit from the fiduciary despite the breach, the centrality of the breach to\nthe scope of the fiduciary relationship, and any threatened or actual harm to the principal are relevant. Likewise, the adequacy\nof other remedies—including any punitive damages award—is also relevant. Above all, the remedy must fit the circumstances\nand work to serve the ultimate goal of protecting relationships of trust.\n\nThere is no indication the trial court followed these principles in fashioning its award. Accordingly, we direct the court of\nappeals to remand the case to the trial court for consideration of these factors upon resolution of the issues remaining for the\ncourt of appeals. 2\n\n\n\n                                          III. Evidence of Contractual Consideration\n\n[7] We next consider whether the trial court properly admitted undisputed testimony offered to show that the lease agreement\nwas intended to be consideration for the buyout agreement, and thus subject to potential forfeiture under our analysis above.\nThe court of appeals concluded that such testimony was “incompetent parol evidence.” 236 S.W.3d at 835.

J. 683\n\n [8] [9] [10] The general rule for an unambiguous contract is that evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements is\ninadmissible as parol evidence. David J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447, 450 (Tex.2008) (per curiam). However, an\nexception exists for consistent collateral agreements. As we stated over half a century ago in Hubacek v. Ennis State Bank, the\nparol evidence rule “does not preclude enforcement of prior or contemporaneous agreements which are collateral to an integrated\nagreement and which are not inconsistent with and do not vary or contradict the express or implied terms or obligations thereof.”\n159 Tex. 166, 317 S.W.2d 30, 32 (1958); accord Haden, 266 S.W.3d at 451 (“Under the exception, parol evidence can be used\nto demonstrate a prior or contemporaneous agreement that is both collateral to and consistent with a binding agreement, and\nthat does not vary or contradict the agreement's express or implied terms or obligations.”). A collateral agreement between\nparties concerning the relationship of several distinct obligations between them falls within the exception. See, e.g., Hubacek,\n317 S.W.2d at 34 (“A and B in an integrated contract respectively promise to sell and to buy Blackacre for $3,000.00. A\ncontemporaneous oral agreement between them that the price shall be paid partly by discharge of a judgment which B has\nagainst A is operative.” (quoting with approval RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF CONTRACTS section 240 cmt. d (1939))). Here,\nif the parties agreed that the lease obligation was to be additional *876 consideration for the buyout, then such an agreement\nwas a consistent collateral agreement. Nothing in such an agreement would contradict the written contracts. See id. at 32 (“If ...\nthe parol evidence rule precludes enforcement of the oral agreement, it is because the agreement varies or contradicts the terms\nor obligations of the [written contracts].”). Accordingly, Swinnea's testimony conceding this fact was properly admitted under\nthis long-standing exception to the parol evidence rule. The fact that the lease agreement was consideration for the buyout\nagreement as a whole is thus established by legally sufficient evidence.\n\nTherefore, as contractual consideration, the lease payments from ERI to Malmeba are subject to forfeiture for Swinnea's breach\nof fiduciary duty. The trial court should consider whether to include them in fashioning an appropriate equitable forfeiture.\n\n\n\n                                                     IV. Lost Profit Damages\n\n[11]   We turn next to the question of actual damages. Here, where the only actual damages that the trial court awarded were\nlost profit damages, the issue is whether ERI provided legally sufficient evidence of those lost profits. 3\n\n[12]    [13]      [14]   The rule concerning adequate evidence of lost profit damages is well established:\n\n               Recovery for lost profits does not require that the loss be susceptible of exact calculation. However, the\n               injured party must do more than show that they suffered some lost profits. The amount of the loss must be\n               shown by competent evidence with reasonable certainty. What constitutes reasonably certain evidence\n               of lost profits is a fact intensive determination. As a minimum, opinions or estimates of lost profits must\n               be based on objective facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits can be ascertained.\n               Although supporting documentation may affect the weight of the evidence, it is not necessary to produce\n               in court the documents supporting the opinions or estimates.\n\nHolt Atherton Indus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Tex.1992) (citations omitted).\n\nThe trial court awarded $300,000 in lost profits “constituting the loss of income from [ERI's and Snodgrass's] business\nrelationship with Merico.” Our legal sufficiency analysis thus reviews whether competent evidence establishes this amount\nwith reasonable certainty. See id.\n\n[15]    Snodgrass testified that based on information from his in-house accountant, ERI's net profit margin on revenue from\nMerico was approximately 25%–30%. 4 As a long-time co-owner and then sole owner of ERI—a small, profitable company\n—Snodgrass was competent to testify as to ERI's estimated profit margin on the Merico account. Cf. Bowen v. Robinson, 227\nS.W.3d 86, 97 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (“Competent evidence of lost profits relating to property can be\nproved by the testimony of an expert or the owner of the property.”). Swinnea directs us to no evidence contradicting *877 this\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 683\n\ntestimony concerning ERI's profit margin. 5 ERI also introduced evidence—including dozens of detailed invoices—indicating\nthat from January 2000 through August 2001 (20 months), ERI averaged $19,833.10 in revenue per month from Merico. Later,\nfrom September 2001 through May 2004 (33 months), average revenue dropped to $1,792.59 per month. 6 Contrasting revenue\nfrom a time period immediately before the period at issue is an established method of proving revenue for a lost profit damages\ncalculation. See Tex. Instruments, Inc. v. Teletron Energy Mgmt., Inc., 877 S.W.2d 276, 279 (Tex.1994) (“It is permissible to\nshow the amount of business done by the plaintiff in a corresponding period of time not too remote, and the business during the\ntime for which recovery is sought.” (quoting Sw. Battery Corp. v. Owen, 131 Tex. 423, 115 S.W.2d 1097, 1098–99 (1938))).\nThus, ERI's method for proving its lost profits in a reasonably certain amount—establishing its lost revenue with comparative\nevidence from a recent time period, and establishing its profit margin on that revenue by competent testimony of its owner—\nwas legally adequate under Holt Atherton.\n\nHowever, ERI's method does not support a calculation yielding the amount of damages awarded by the trial court. Even assuming\na 30% profit margin on the work from Merico, Snodgrass's maximum profit margin estimate, the damages award would be only\n$178,601.05 for the 33–month period at issue when ERI's profits from Merico declined. 7 ERI's evidence thus fails to meet the\nminimum requirements for legal sufficiency that we set out in Holt Atherton regarding reasonable certainty as to the amount\nawarded by the trial court—here, $300,000. Up to this point, the court of appeals reached the same conclusions that we have.\nSee 236 S.W.3d at 838–39 (reciting the same evidence and reaching the same conclusion regarding whether such evidence is\nlegally sufficient to prove $300,000 of lost profit damages with reasonable certainty).\n\n [16] Still, while the evidence does not prove $300,000 in lost profits, ERI's evidence is legally sufficient evidence to prove\na lesser, ascertainable amount of lost profits with reasonable certainty. In this situation, such a discrepancy between two\nreasonably certain amounts will not defeat recovery by ERI. See Sw. Battery, 115 S.W.2d at 1099 (“[U]ncertainty as to the\nfact of legal damages is fatal to recovery, but uncertainty as to the amount will not defeat recovery.”); Tex. Instruments, 877\nS.W.2d at 279 (explaining that Southwest Battery and subsequent cases required reasonable certainty as to the amount of lost\nprofit damages); cf. *878 Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v. Nat'l Dev. & Research Corp., 299 S.W.3d 106, 109\n(Tex.2009) (remanding to the court of appeals where there was some evidence of damages, but not enough to support the full\namount awarded by the trial court). ERI proved lost profit damages; its entitlement to recover them survives the trial court's\nerror in awarding too much. Accordingly, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the court of appeals to consider the\npossibility for remittitur on lost profit damages. See TEX.R.APP. P. 46.3, 46.5 (providing procedures for remittitur by courts\nof appeals).\n\n [17] Swinnea argues that ERI's lost profits calculation is inadequate because it fails to apply certain credits or deduct certain\nexpenses. First, Swinnea asserts that because ERI's lost profits were on the Merico account, which were in turn lost because\nof Swinnea's involvement with Air Quality Associates, we must offset any amount that ERI gained by doing business with\nAir Quality Associates. That is, where the two accounts were mutually exclusive, loss from one must be offset by gain from\nthe other. This argument is unpersuasive in part because the exclusivity arose out of Merico's ultimatum to ERI about Air\nQuality Associates—“us or them”—not because it was otherwise impossible for ERI to pursue both business relationships\nsimultaneously. The evidence shows that Merico came to give ERI its ultimatum because of Swinnea. Merico did not object\nto ERI's work with Air Quality Associates—a competitor of Merico's in asbestos abatement—until it discovered that Swinnea\nand Power were involved with Air Quality Associates. Nothing suggests that ERI could not have profited from working both\nwith Air Quality Associates (apart from Swinnea) and Merico. 8 Accordingly, because nothing indicates that ERI could not\nwork with both companies, any profits from ERI's work with Air Quality Associates need not be offset against the lost profits\nfrom Merico caused by Swinnea's position with Air Quality Associates.\n\n [18] [19] Even assuming that Swinnea is correct that profits from Air Quality Associates must be credited against the lost\nprofits figure, he can point to no evidence to support his assertion that ERI profited from work with Air Quality Associates as\na substitute for Merico. The plaintiff bears the burden of providing evidence supporting a single complete calculation of lost\nprofits, which may often require certain credits and expenses. See Holt Atherton, 835 S.W.2d at 85 (“Recovery of lost profits\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                          11\n\fERI Consulting Engineers, Inc. v. Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867 (2010)\n53 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 683\n\nmust be predicated on one complete calculation.”). However, the defendant properly bears the burden of providing at least\nsome evidence suggesting that an otherwise complete lost profits calculation is in fact missing relevant credits. Cf. Brown v.\nAm. Transfer & Storage Co., 601 S.W.2d 931, 936 (Tex.1980) (“The right of offset is an affirmative defense. The burden of\npleading offset and of proving facts necessary to support it are on the party making the assertion.”). Were this not so, every\nfacially adequate calculation of lost profits would be susceptible to an unsubstantiated challenge that something is missing.\nThat subtle distinction is crucial here because Swinnea directs us to nothing in the record proving that ERI profited—in any\namount—from working with Air Quality Associates as a substitute for Merico in *879 asbestos abatement; and we can find\nnone. 9 Rather, he simply asserts that ERI does not dispute that it developed a mutually successful relationship with Air Quality\nAssociates. The only evidence in the record indicates that ERI continued to show an overall profit despite the decline in revenue\nfrom Merico, and that ERI worked with Air Quality Associates. No evidence shows whether any profits from working with Air\nQuality Associates contributed to ERI's overall profits, as a substitute for Merico or otherwise. 10\n\n [20] Swinnea also contests that overhead costs and other unspecified expenses were not included in ERI's evidence or\ncalculation. However, it is not necessarily the case that a company will incur increased expense or overhead, especially where—\nas evidence here suggests—a corporation was already profitable at the time damages began, and evidence supports an inference\nthat it could have performed profitable services using only its existing resources. See Tex. Instruments, 877 S.W.2d at 279\n(“[P]re-existing profit, together with other facts and circumstances, may indicate with reasonable certainty the amount of profits\nlost.” (quoting Sw. Battery, 115 S.W.2d at 1099)). This is not a manufacturing scenario, where production costs necessarily\nexist. Rather, ERI was a consulting company, which wrote plans and specifications, solicited bids for projects, and completed\nsurveys. Evidence suggests that ERI would have been able to perform all of this service work using its existing employees.\nPower, for instance, testified that he “put in whatever hours it takes to get jobs done.” Swinnea himself had begun contributing\nmuch less work to ERI, despite having been one of its most productive workers before. Had Swinnea continued to contribute at\nhis prior level, that productivity would only have helped ERI complete additional projects. Furthermore, after Snodgrass fired\nSwinnea, ERI began to work with Merico again, while still working with Air Quality Associates, without expansion to ERI's\nstaff. Accordingly, Swinnea has not met his burden to provide at least some evidence that ERI's otherwise complete lost profit\ndamages calculation was actually inadequate because of a necessary credit or additional expense.\n\n [21] Swinnea also challenges causation as to ERI's lost profit damages. However, evidence showed that at the end of October\n2001, upon concluding a series of conversations about Swinnea's involvement with Air Quality Associates, Merico specifically\nindicated that it would no longer be working with ERI because of Swinnea's involvement. 11 Swinnea himself testified *880\nthat his involvement with Air Quality Associates could harm the Merico relationship, and that a severance of ERI's relationship\nwith Merico would negatively affect ERI's revenues. This evidence is legally sufficient to establish a straightforward link\nbetween Swinnea's breach of duty and the loss of profits to ERI.\n\nIn sum, legally sufficient evidence does not exist to prove the trial court's lost profit damages award under the minimum\nrequirements of Holt Atherton. However, this insufficiency does not extend to reasonable certainty as to any amount. Rather,\ncompetent evidence exists to establish some reasonably certain amount of lost profits—just not the particular amount awarded\nby the trial court. Unlike a situation where no evidence establishes any amount of lost profit damages with reasonable certainty,\nthe situation here requires a potential reduction, not a take—nothing judgment against the plaintiff. Therefore, we reverse the\ncourt of appeals' judgment that ERI recover no lost profit damages and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.\nShould the court of appeals fail to arrive at a disposition concerning remittitur, it may remand for a new trial on lost profit\ndamages, as we might have if the evidence did not seem conducive to remittitur. See Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio\nEng'rs & Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41, 51 (Tex.1998) (“[B]ecause there is no legally sufficient evidence to support the\nentire amount of damages, but there is some evidence of the correct measure of damages, we reverse the judgment of the court\nof appeals and remand the cause for a new trial.”).\n\nTwo additional collateral issues remain: punitive damages and factual sufficiency. The trial court found clear and convincing\nevidence establishing that Swinnea willfully, maliciously, and intentionally caused injury to ERI and Snodgrass in committing\nfraud. Accordingly, exemplary damages may be recoverable. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 41.003 (providing that\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 683\n\nexemplary damages are recoverable if clear and convincing evidence shows harm from fraud or malice). Thus, upon resolution\nof the actual damages (lost profits) question, it is now proper for the courts below to consider any remaining issues concerning\nthe trial court's initial award of $1 million in punitive damages, which Swinnea has continued to contest.\n\nAs for factual sufficiency of the lost profits award, however, we observe that there may be a question of whether Swinnea\nadequately briefed the issue to the court of appeals. The Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure require adequate briefing. See\nTEX.R.APP. P. 38.1(i) (“The [Appellant's] brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with\nappropriate citations to authorities and to the record.”); accord Redmon v. Griffith, 202 S.W.3d 225, 241 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2006,\npet. denied) (“In their brief, the [cross-appellants] have not presented much in the way of cogent argument, nor have they cited\nto any authority in support of their sole issue.... We hold that the [cross-appellants] have waived their sole issue by their failure\nto adequately brief it.”); Murchison v. State, 93 S.W.3d 239, 254 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. ref'd) (holding that\nfactual sufficiency point concerning criminal trial was waived because “appellants' argument, record citations, and authorities\ndo not address” the point); Smith v. Tilton, 3 S.W.3d 77, 84 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1999, no pet.) (“Points of error asserted on appeal\nbut not briefed are waived.”). On remand, the court of appeals should consider whether Swinnea *881 adequately raised a\nfactual sufficiency challenge.\n\n\n\n                                                   V. Liability for Conspiracy\n\n [22] Having found that legally sufficient evidence established lost profit damages in some amount, and that Swinnea may\nalso be liable for punitive damages as well as forfeiture of contractual consideration, we must next address whether Brady\nEnvironmental may be jointly liable for these damages as a conspirator.\n\n [23] [24] An actionable civil conspiracy requires specific intent to agree to accomplish an unlawful purpose or a lawful\npurpose by unlawful means. Juhl v. Airington, 936 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex.1996). One of the elements of conspiracy is a meeting\nof the minds on the object or course of action. Massey v. Armco Steel Co., 652 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex.1983). Another element\nis actual damages as the proximate result of the conspiracy. Id.\n\nIn its live pleading at trial, ERI asserted that Brady Environmental conspired in Swinnea's ongoing fraudulent misrepresentations\nas well as Swinnea's ongoing breach of fiduciary duty, which among other things damaged existing ERI client relationships.\nThe trial court found that Swinnea's wrongful conduct “continued after the buy-out, including but not limited to his formation\nof Brady Environmental, Inc.” It also found that Brady Environmental “participated in and knowingly accepted the benefits\nof ... Swinnea's wrongful conduct,” and that Brady Environmental “had actual awareness of the wrongful conduct.”\n\nEven assuming those findings are true, there is no evidence that any of the damages awarded by the trial court occurred as the\nproximate result of any involvement by Brady Environmental. Moreover, no meeting of the minds between Swinnea and Brady\nEnvironmental could have occurred involving the actions causing ERI actual harm—lost profits—because Brady Environmental\ndid not yet exist, having been formed approximately six months after Swinnea left Air Quality Associates. Accordingly, Brady\nEnvironmental cannot be jointly and severally liable for any lost profit damages discussed above, or any potential punitive\ndamages that follow from them.\n\n [25] Furthermore, while Brady Environmental may have participated in the abuse of trust in Swinnea's ongoing breaches of\nfiduciary duty and Swinnea's ongoing fraudulent misrepresentations, Brady Environmental had no part in inducing the buyout\nagreement. As discussed above, the forfeiture of contractual consideration is available as an equitable remedy against a fiduciary\nwho fraudulently induces the contract, regardless of actual harm. Contractual consideration is subject to forfeiture because it was\nfraudulently bargained for by a fiduciary. Certainly the rule allowing such equitable remedies to protect relationships of trust\nencompasses the ability to fashion such remedies against those who would conspire to abuse such relationships. See Kinzbach,\n160 S.W.2d at 514 (“It is settled as the law of this State that where a third party knowingly participates in the breach of duty of\na fiduciary, such third party becomes a joint tortfeasor with the fiduciary and is liable as such.”). Yet, “the remedy of forfeiture\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              13\n\fERI Consulting Engineers, Inc. v. Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867 (2010)\n53 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 683\n\nmust fit the circumstances presented.” Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 241. The trial court's award included no equitable remedy tied to\nconduct in which Brady Environmental participated. Rather, the only equitable award—forfeiture of contractual consideration\n—arose from a transaction that occurred approximately a year before Brady Environmental existed. Under the circumstances of\nthis particular case, we believe that even if Brady Environmental *882 conspired in later breaches of fiduciary duty or fraud,\nBrady Environmental is not subject to liability for any particular equitable forfeiture amount from the return of contractual\nconsideration given in the specific transaction at issue. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment that ERI take\nnothing on its conspiracy claim against Brady Environmental.\n\n\n\n                                                            VI. Conclusion\n\nWe hold that when a fiduciary fraudulently induced a contract, such a breach of fiduciary duty may give rise to equitable\nforfeiture of contractual consideration. We therefore reverse the portion of the court of appeals' judgment that ERI take nothing\nin equity. Because trial courts are required to consider certain factors when fashioning a forfeiture remedy, which we have set\nout, we direct the court of appeals to remand the case to the trial court, in turn, for review of its forfeiture award in light of these\nprinciples. Additionally, we conclude that the court of appeals erred in excluding evidence that certain lease payments were\ncontractual consideration subject to forfeiture because testimony proving this fact was properly admitted under the consistent\ncollateral agreement exception to the parol evidence rule.\n\nWe also hold that while legally sufficient evidence does not exist to prove the lost profits awarded by the trial court, legally\nsufficient evidence does exist to prove some reasonably certain amount of lost profits. We therefore also reverse the portion of\nthe court of appeals' judgment that ERI take nothing on its claims for lost profit damages and punitive damages and remand\nthe case to the court of appeals to consider a remittitur, as well as any other remaining issues, before remanding the case to\nthe trial court.\n\nFinally, we affirm the portion of the court of appeals' judgment that ERI and Snodgrass take nothing on their civil conspiracy\nclaims against Brady Environmental because the actual damages awarded by the trial court were not caused by Brady\nEnvironmental's wrongful conduct, and the equitable forfeiture awarded by the trial court arose from a transaction too remote\nfrom Brady Environmental's involvement to support liability in equity.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n318 S.W.3d 867, 53 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 683\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      The parties dispute whether the lease agreement was intended to be consideration for the buyout. None of the documents in the buyout\n        agreement expressly addressed this, but Snodgrass testified that he and Swinnea had agreed to the lease as part of the comprehensive\n        buyout.\n2       As we discuss below, certain issues that remain as a result of our holdings in this case are properly before the court of appeals on\n        remand, precluding us from remanding the case directly to the trial court.\n3       We need not distinguish here between ERI's causes of action—common-law and statutory fraud, breach of contract, and breach of\n        fiduciary duty—because ERI's lost profit damages are recoverable for any one of those claims. See Waite Hill Servs., Inc. v. World\n        Class Metal Works, Inc., 959 S.W.2d 182, 184–85 (Tex.1998) (per curiam) (observing that lost profits are recoverable both as tort\n        and contract damages, subject to the rule precluding double recovery for a single injury).\n4       Swinnea did not raise a hearsay objection at trial.\n5       We note that Swinnea's counsel stated on cross-examination of Snodgrass that “if we looked at [ERI's] financials, we could pretty\n        well figure [the profit margin on the Merico account] out.” Indeed, Swinnea had the opportunity to attempt to negate Snodgrass's\n        testimony on profit margin with conclusive contrary evidence, if such evidence existed. Yet, Swinnea directs us to no such evidence\n        from which we could determine whether Snodgrass's estimate was mistaken.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 683\n\n6      ERI points us to testimony from another ERI employee that its revenue from Merico was $300,000–$400,000 per year, but the\n       accounting statements introduced by ERI as a trial exhibit conclusively establish otherwise. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d\n       802, 820 (Tex.2005) (“[Fact-finders] are not free to believe testimony that is conclusively negated by undisputed facts.”)\n7      At trial, ERI put on evidence that its estimated lost revenue over the 33–month period was $595,336.83. Thirty percent of this figure\n       is $178,601.05.\n8      Swinnea elsewhere points out to us that Air Quality Associates was also doing profitable mold treatment work, while Merico focused\n       on asbestos removal. This suggests that ERI might have had separate consulting opportunities with Air Quality Associates that\n       were unavailable from Merico, meaning it could have consistently worked with both without overlap, as ERI also performed mold\n       assessments. Indeed, ERI began to work with both Merico and Air Quality Associates some time after the period in question.\n9      Swinnea asserts in his brief that where “ERI chose the relationship with AQA [instead of Merico, such] conduct of itself is evidence\n       of ERI's belief that the AQA relationship was the more profitable one.” At most, this suggests that ERI might have believed that the\n       Air Quality Associates relationship would be the more profitable one, which says nothing about whether it was actually profitable.\n       Swinnea also asserts in his brief that “the AQA relationship was demonstrably ... lucrative to ERI, as the corporate financial records\n       proved.” But Swinnea does not direct us to any such financial records in the record. Further, having reviewed hundreds of ERI's\n       invoices (the majority of which were issued to Merico), as well as other financial records introduced as evidence, we could not find\n       a single piece of evidence in the record proving any profit to ERI from Air Quality Associates.\n10     Indeed, we are left to wonder further whether any such alleged profits were in turn for asbestos projects that Merico might have\n       worked on rather than for mold projects.\n11     We reiterate that Swinnea does not contest liability. The trial court entered specific findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning\n       the impropriety of Swinnea's involvement with Air Quality Associates. Thus, Swinnea's liability extends to any damage caused by\n       his involvement with Air Quality Associates.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

B. Featherstone, who operates a general garage business in the city of Dallas, and deals in oils and gasoline, brought\n *125 this suit against the Independent Service Station Association of Texas, a corporation, the Independent Service Station\nAssociation of Dallas, an unincorporated association, and C. M. Proctor, R. E. Tomlinson, and E. L. Haskins, individuals,\nwho are engaged in the same line of business as that pursued by plaintiff, to enjoin an alleged lottery scheme employed by\nthe defendants to attract business and trade from plaintiff to the injury of his property and property rights involved in said\ncompeting business.\n\nThe case, by agreement, was withdrawn from the jury and submitted to the trial judge, whose findings of fact and conclusions\nof law are, in substance, that, the defendants, other than the defendant corporation, had, for eight or nine months prior to the\ninstitution of the suit, operated, and caused to be operated in Dallas county, a scheme by which automobiles, as prizes, were\ndistributed by chance in substantially the following manner: That is to say, the Independent Service Station Association of\nDallas, a voluntary association of retail dealers, including the individuals, defendants herein, through its officers and committees,\nsold tickets to the members of the association for a money consideration used to purchase automobiles that constituted the prizes\nat the drawings. That the retail dealers composing this association, including the individual defendants, advertised to the general\npublic that purchasers of merchandise and service from them would receive a ticket for each dollar spent, entitling the holder to a\nchance to win an automobile. That, when a ticket was issued, a stub, containing a number corresponding to that on the ticket, was\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Independent Service Station Ass'n of Texas, 10 S.W.2d 124 (1928)\n\n\nretained, and, at the end of stated periods, these stubs were placed in a receptacle and a drawing therefrom was had by chance,\nand the holder of the ticket corresponding in number to that on the stub drawn won the prize and received the automobile.\n\nThe court found: That the defendants were operating this scheme at the time the temporary injunction was issued in this cause,\nand that they threatened to continue its operation. That they changed the mode of operations to this extent, they not only gave out\ntickets to customers who bought merchandise, but in some instances to individuals who were not purchasers. That defendants\nhad distributed many prizes in this manner, and had advertised a drawing for a Chrysler car to take place May 23, 1928. That\nthe admitted purpose of such scheme was to attract trade from competitors who did not participate in the scheme and to build\nup their own business.\n\nThe court found: That plaintiff was a competitor of the defendants in the sale of oil, gasoline, and in the general garage business,\nand that members of said association had opened up places of business immediately surrounding that of plaintiff, at which they\ndisplayed advertisements to the effect that customers would receive chances on automobiles by patronizing their places. That\nvarious prospective customers of plaintiff left his place without making purchases, on discovering that he did not distribute\ntickets for the automobile drawing, and that, since and during the operation of the scheme, plaintiff's business declined, he lost\nmoney, whilst the defendants' business increased and they made money as the result of the scheme.\n\nThe court concluded that the facts showed the existence of a lottery in violation of the penal statutes of the state; that every\nelement of the offense existed--that is, a prize to be distributed, by chance, to the holder of a ticket, who acquired the same\non a consideration.\n\nParagraphs 3 and 4 of the court's legal conclusions are as follows:\n“(3) I find that the plaintiff has no property rights involved in the crime committed by the defendants and each of them, and loss\nof trade and patronage by the plaintiff, caused by the defendants, does not constitute injury to property rights. In this connection,\nI find that general business, commonly known as ‘trade,’ coming from the general public in the form of patronage, is entitled\nto go into whatever channel it deems fit, and, although said scheme and device directly injures the plaintiff financially in the\noperation of his business, that same does not constitute such unfair competition that plaintiff has a legal cause to complain by\nasking an injunction.\n\n“(4) I further find that the plaintiff, M. B. Featherstone, is not entitled to equitable relief in the form of a permanent injunction\nfor the reason hereinabove stated, to wit, that his property rights are not affected as the term ‘property right’ is construed by\nthis court, and that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, to wit, protection by the criminal courts, and that the plaintiff's\nadequate remedy would be to file a criminal complaint against the defendants herein in the event he desires to do so.”\n\n\nIn harmony with the court's legal conclusions, judgment was rendered denying plaintiff the relief sought, from which this appeal\nis prosecuted.\n\nPlaintiff's contention in effect is this, that his property and property rights (that is, his business and the right to operate the\nsame without unlawful interference, invasion, or injury) were violated by the lottery scheme conducted by defendants, and\ntherefore he was entitled to the injunctive relief sought, notwithstanding the fact that the lottery constituted a violation of the\nPenal Code of the state.\n\nLottery as an offense was unknown to the common law, and only within recent times the scheme was not only tolerated,\nbut employed as a convenient method of raising revenue for governmental, religious, charitable, and educational purposes.\nExperience, however, demonstrated that the practice was demoralizing in arousing and cultivating the *126 gambling instinct\ndormant in all human nature, was widespread, casting a baneful influence over entire communities, reaching persons of all ages\nand classes, entering every fireside, preying especially upon the meager means and earnings of the poor, attracting especially\nthe simple and ignorant, and leading at last to idleness, mendicancy, moral profligacy and debauchery. In view of its malign and\ndemoralizing influence, the lottery has been outlawed in probably every state in the Union, and all propaganda, with reference\nto such enterprises, has been banished from the mails and interstate commerce, by acts of Congress.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Independent Service Station Ass'n of Texas, 10 S.W.2d 124 (1928)\n\n\n\n\nThe people of this state were so intent on outlawing the lottery, they refused to commit the subject to the discretion of the\nLegislature, but commanded, in section 47, art. 3, of the Constitution that:\n          “The Legislature shall pass laws prohibiting the establishment of lotteries and gift enterprises in this state,\n          as well as the sale of tickets in lotteries, gift enterprises or other evasions involving the lottery principle,\n          established or existing in other states.”\n\n\n\nIn obedience to this mandate of the people, the Legislature enacted the following penal statute (article 654, Penal Code):\n          “If any person shall establish a lottery or dispose of any estate, real or personal, by lottery, he shall be\n          fined not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars; or if any person shall sell, offer for\n          sale or keep for sale any ticket or part ticket in any lottery, he shall be fined not less than ten nor more\n          than fifty dollars.”\n\n\n\nIt will be observed that the lottery prohibited by this statute is not defined, but the courts of the country are in general accord\nin regard to the definition and constituent elements of the offense.\n\nA satisfactory definition is given in State v. Lipkin, 169 N. C. 265, 271, 84 S. E. 340, 342, L. R. A. 1915F, 1018, 1022, Ann.\nCas. 1917D, 137, as follows:\n          “A lottery, for all practical purposes, may be defined as any scheme for the distribution of prizes, by lot\n          or chance, by one, on paying money or giving any other thing of value to another, obtains a token, which\n          entitles him to receive a larger or smaller value or nothing, as some formula of chance may determine.”\n\n\n [1] The findings of the trial court in the case under consideration and the undisputed facts fill up to the fullest measure the\nabove definition. They are to the effect that the Independent Service Station Association of Dallas sold to its members, including\nthe individual defendants, tickets in batches of 1,000 that were distributed by the dealers to their customers, one ticket, for every\ndollar's worth of merchandise purchased, that entitled the holder to a chance to win an automobile at a drawing to be held;\nthus is revealed all the essential elements of a lottery--that is, the prize, the chance distribution of same, and the consideration\npassing from the holder of the ticket.\n\n\nAppellees, however, do not seriously contend that the scheme above outlined was not a lottery within the meaning of the\nstatute, but by appropriate cross-assignments of error challenge the correctness of the findings of the trial court, to the effect\nthat defendants were operating under a lottery scheme at the time the restraining order was issued. Their contention is that the\nundisputed facts show that this scheme had been abandoned prior to the institution of the suit, and that the scheme, under which\nthey were then operating, was a perfectly legal and permissible procedure.\n\nThey insist that, under the plan as changed, instead of giving to customers a ticket for each one dollar's worth of merchandise\npurchased, defendants and other members of the association, for the purpose of advertising their business as independent oil and\ngas dealers, and to promote good will among customers, gave tickets that entitled the holder to a chance to draw an automobile,\nthat these tickets were given indiscriminately, to whomsoever they pleased, to customers and noncustomers as well; hence this\nnew scheme was lacking in one of the essential elements necessary to constitute a lottery, to wit, the consideration.\n [2] [3] We readily agree to the correctness of the proposition that, if tickets given by defendants and other members of the\nassociation were gifts, unsupported by a consideration moving from the ticket holder, were in fact gratuities pure and simple,\nthe lottery statute was not violated, for the evident reason that a person is at liberty to give away his property, by chance, at a\ndrawing to ticket holders, or in any other manner, without violating the law. But is the case at bar of that nature? We do not\nthink so for the following reasons: The change wrought as testified to by defendants was not a change in the scheme itself, but\nmerely in the procedure or method of executing the same. Instead of giving a ticket to a customer for every dollar's worth of\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Independent Service Station Ass'n of Texas, 10 S.W.2d 124 (1928)\n\n\nmerchandise purchased, they gave tickets to whomsoever they pleased-- customers and noncustomers as well. On this point,\nC. M. Proctor, one of the defendants, testified:\n          “The purpose of this scheme is to draw business; to get all the business we can; to draw business from\n          our competitors. We have now changed our plan of operation. It was not because we were enjoined by\n          the court. We did not change our plan because of any court action. We do not intend to give any more\n          automobiles away under that plan. Our plan now is to give tickets to our various customers; to issue tickets\n          to whomsoever we see fit; if they come in to get water or gas; if we want to give them to our patrons,\n          and others. We threatened at this time to give a car away on May *127 24 (1928) by giving chances to\n          customers. * * * These tickets are to be given patrons and customers. Yes; we are going to give them to\n          our customers. * * * I take the tickets under the present plan, and, when the customers come in to buy\n          merchandise, I give them a ticket. I do not give every one a ticket. We give to those whom we see fit. We\n          give them whether they buy or not. One of the purposes is to advertise, and we give the tickets out as an\n          advertisement. Under this new plan we have a drawing, and the winning number gets the prize. That is the\n          plan we will attempt to use.”\n\n\n\n\nMr. R. E. Tomlinson, one of the defendants, after testifying that he and Messrs. Proctor and Haskins (also defendants) constituted\nthe committee that acted for the Independent Service Station Association in handling the matter of purchasing automobiles,\netc., said:\n          “Our intention is to enforce this new plan (the new plan of procedure); to make the men live up to it just\n          like they have to live up to the by-laws and constitution of the association. * * * The purpose of our entire\n          scheme is to draw business. It is an advertising proposition to take away business from others. That is the\n          whole proposition, like any other advertising, to get business. It has worked very satisfactorily. * * * I\n          haven't changed my mind that the purpose of advertising is getting good will for the independents, and that\n          a man would buy for the purpose of getting a chance. We have abandoned the other plan we had. Now\n          we have a new plan; we have a prize. The men buying the prize are members of the Independent Service\n          Station Association of Dallas. They sell tickets to the members of this association for money. They buy\n          these chance tickets from the committee for money, and the money goes into the general fund to buy the\n          prize, the car. The purpose of the scheme is to promote good will, but when the dealer pays for the tickets,\n          buys them, one of the purposes of it is to give the tickets away to the fellow that comes into the station.\n          That is one of the purposes. Then, when these dealers that buy these tickets give them away, they are all put\n          in a receptacle, and there is a drawing, and the ticket that is drawn gets the automobile. They draw seven\n          tickets. That is the scheme we intend to follow.”\n\n\n\nThis testimony fails to show any material change in the scheme as originally operated, but reveals a change simply in the plan\nof its operation. While dealers, under the new plan, distributed tickets to noncustomers as well as to customers, it seems that the\nscheme was to distribute tickets, in the main to customers, as the evidence discloses that only a few, negligible in number, were\ngiven to persons other than customers. That the giving of tickets, and the drawings and distribution of prizes, were inducements\nto patronage and unquestionably lured customers, is shown from the very satisfactory business results that followed. Patronage\nthus induced was the consideration that passed from the ticket holder for the chance received, in that the price paid, whatever it\nwas, the amount being immaterial, constituted the aggregate price for the merchandise or service and the ticket that represented\na chance to win the prize; in other words, for one undivided price both were purchased, the merchandise, or service, and ticket,\nthe ticket being as much bought as though priced separately.

We are of the opinion, therefore, that the court did not err in concluding that the facts constituted a lottery\nwithin the meaning of the law.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Independent Service Station Ass'n of Texas, 10 S.W.2d 124 (1928)\n\n\n\n\nThe court, however, denied plaintiff relief, on the idea that his property rights, as that term was construed by the court, were\nnot affected, and further that he had an adequate remedy, in that, he could institute criminal prosecutions against defendants.\n [4] When and under what circumstances will a court of equity exercise authority to prevent the commission of crimes? The\ngeneral rule is that, except as conferred by statute, courts of equity have no criminal jurisdiction, and acts or omissions will not\nbe enjoined merely on the ground that they constitute violations of penal statutes.\n\n [5] Notwithstanding this is the general rule, it is also well settled that, when necessary to protect civil or property rights, equity\nwill interfere, and the fact that the commission of a statutory offense must be enjoined, as an incident to the giving of proper\nrelief, will not deprive the court of its jurisdiction in this respect.\n\n\nAn apt statement of the law on this point was made by Judge Neill in State v. Patterson, 14 Tex. Civ. App. 465, 469, 37 S.\nW. 478, 479, as follows:\n          “It is only when property or civil rights are involved and an irreparable injury to such rights is threatened or\n          is about to be committed, for which no adequate remedy exists at law, that courts of equity will interfere by\n          injunction for the purpose of protecting such rights. The injury threatened to such rights may, if committed,\n          constitute a crime, and subject its perpetrator to punishment under the criminal law; yet, as his punishment\n          would furnish him whose property or civil rights have been irreparably injured by the acts constituting\n          the offense no compensation for such injury, courts of equity will interfere to prevent such an injury,\n          notwithstanding the commission would constitute a criminal offense, not because it would be a crime, but\n          because the injury to such rights would be irreparable. It cannot be said that such interference by a court\n          of equity is an invasion of the domain of the criminal law, for no crime has been committed where equity\n          interposes its arm for the protection of property or civil rights. In extending such protection, it may prevent\n          a crime; but, as no one has a right to commit crime, no one should be heard to complain that he is restrained\n          from its commission, when such restraint has been exercised in the jurisdiction of a court for the purpose\n          of preventing him from *128 irreparably injuring another in his property or civil rights.”\n\n\n\nThis doctrine was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in Re Debs, 158 U. S. 593, 15 S. Ct. 900, 39 L. Ed.\n1106. Also see 32 C. J. p. 277, § 440.\n\nWe do not agree with the trial judge in his legal conclusion to the effect that plaintiff has no property rights involved in the\noffense committed by defendants.\n [6] [7] We are of the opinion that plaintiff's business and his right to conduct the same constitute property that a court of\nequity will protect from unlawful interference or injury. The correctness of this proposition has been announced so often and by\nso many courts that it ought not now to be considered an open question. While it is true a dealer has no such interest in the future\ntrade, that is, in possible customers, as would justify an appeal to a court of equity, to restrain a competitor from doing what\nis perfectly legal, to advertise and attract customers to his own business, although such conduct may result in a corresponding\nloss to one engaged in a similar business, yet a competitor may ask for the restraint of acts and conduct prohibited by law, that\nunreasonably interfere with, divert patrons from, and injure his business. The correct rule on this subject was announced by\nJudge James, in Robison v. Texas Pine Land Association (Tex. Civ. App.) 40 S. W. 843, 844, in the following language:\n          “According to plaintiff's allegations, competition in trade existed between plaintiff and defendant, and it\n          was legitimate for defendant to appropriate to itself all the customers it could command, even to the extent\n          of driving plaintiff out of business, provided the means used for that purpose did not contravene any law,\n          or violate a definite legal right of the plaintiff.”\n\n\n\n\nTo the same effect, see Pierce v. Society, etc., 268 U. S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 574, 69 L. Ed. 1070, 39 A. L. R. 468.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Independent Service Station Ass'n of Texas, 10 S.W.2d 124 (1928)\n\n\n\n\nThe correctness of the proposition that one may confidently appeal to a court of equity for protection against an unlawful\ninterference with and injury to his business was affirmed in the following cases: Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U. S. 312, 42 S. Ct.\n124, 127, 66 L. Ed. 254, 27 A. L. R. 375; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578, 17 S. Ct. 427, 41 L. Ed. 835; Webb v. Cooks',\netc., Union (Tex. Civ. App.) 205 S. W. 468; Cooks' Union v. Papageorge (Tex. Civ. App.) 230 S. W. 1086; Hawks v. Yancey\n(Tex. Civ. App.) 265 S. W. 233, 238, 239; Glover v. Malloska, 238 Mich. 216, 213 N. W. 107, 52 A. L. R. 77.\n\nIn the case of Glover v. Malloska, supra, certain dealers sought to enjoin a competitor from executing a lottery scheme very\nsimilar to the one under consideration. Responding to the contention there made, that plaintiffs had no property rights involved\nthat a court of equity would protect, the court said:\n“Have plaintiffs property rights of a pecuniary nature here involved? It would astound the business world to hold that an\nestablished business is barren of property rights of a pecuniary nature. Merchants, and others engaged in business, feel that\nthey have property rights therein, and we must hold that an injury to such rights, through criminal acts, is an injury to property\nrights of a pecuniary nature.\n\n“No one should be permitted to employ criminal means in trade rivalry. The law proscribes a lottery, and those injured thereby\nin their rights of property are not required to suffer successive inflictions of pecuniary injury until a criminal prosecution is\nlaunched. Courts do not depart from the rule that equity may not interfere, except to protect property rights of a pecuniary\nnature, in enjoining criminal acts exercised by one dealer to enhance his sales to the calculated pecuniary injury of a lawabiding\ncompetitor. Defendant Malloska adopted the lottery scheme for profit, admits its employment increased his sales, and plaintiffs\nestablished the fact that such increase was directly traceable to their loss of customers.”\n\n [8] That plaintiff's business, in the case at bar, was interfered with and injured, as a direct result of the operation of the lottery\nscheme conducted by defendants, is shown by the undisputed facts and the unchallenged findings of the trial court.\n\n\nArticle 4642 (4643) (2989), R. S. 1925, authorizes the issuance of injunctions:\n          “(1) Where the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and such relief or any part thereof requires the\n          restraint of some act prejudicial to him.”\n\n\n\nIf we are correct in the conclusions announced above, plaintiff was and is entitled to have his business protected from unfair\ncompetition produced by the unlawful means employed by his competitors, and it seems that the only adequate remedy,\nappropriate and suited to the conditions with which we are dealing, is the restraint of the prejudicial acts of which plaintiff\ncomplains.\n\nPlaintiff cannot successfully combat this competition except on the plane where the contest for business has been pitched, and\nthis he cannot attempt, without himself becoming a violator of the law. The lottery scheme had been in operation eight or nine\nmonths at the time this suit was instituted, a number of drawings had taken place and prizes distributed thereunder, and, so far as\nthe record discloses, without any effort having been put forth for its suppression. The Independent Service Station Association\nof Dallas at that time had 86 members, operating 108 oil stations scattered over Dallas county, most of them located in the city\nof Dallas. In these circumstances, to invite plaintiff to seek relief from this unlawful competition by the institution of criminal\nprosecutions against the large number of individuals who are aiding and abetting the lottery, to assume the burdens and suffer\nthe loss of time that attention to the prosecutions *129 would require, is to invite him to attempt the accomplishment of an\nHerculean, if not impossible, task. If this is plaintiff's only relief from the conditions in which his business is enmeshed, the\nstatute, promising relief from prejudicial acts, is delusive, in holding out the word of promise to the ear only to disappoint the\nhope. The remedy, to be adequate, must be applied at the source of the evil, the association, the head and front of the offending,\nas well as the individual members sued, must be enjoined from further operations under the lottery scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellant owned a large tract of real property in Travis\nCounty known as Jourdan Crossing. Appellee Louis G. Reese, III, is an experienced and sophisticated real estate investor and\ndeveloper, and is the principal owner of appellee Louis G. Reese, Inc., a Texas corporation. In this opinion we will refer both\nto Reese individually and to his corporation jointly as “appellee.”\n\nThe parties agree that in the fall of 1985, appellant contracted to sell appellee the Jourdan Crossing property for some\n$45,000,000. While the parties agree on very little else, it is clear that the transaction ultimately closed.\n\nAppellee paid $10 million (borrowed from another savings and loan) as a down payment and executed a note to appellant for\nover $34 million. The market fell, development of the project stalled and appellee was unable to meet his obligations under the\n$34 million note. Appellant attempted to foreclose its deed of trust against the property, and appellee filed suit seeking both\ntemporary and permanent injunctive relief along with actual and exemplary damages and a declaratory judgment. Appellee\nbased its suit on claimed causes of action involving usury, breach of contract, real estate and common-law fraud, and conspiracy,\nas well as violations of the Federal Savings and Loan Tying Act and Savings and Loan Act.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Reese, 756 S.W.2d 14 (1988)\n\n\nThe district court granted a temporary restraining order without notice and after three days of testimony granted the temporary\ninjunction and set the injunction bond at $10,000.\n\n\n\n                                                         DISCUSSION\n\n [1] [2] In a hearing on an application for temporary injunction, the only question before the trial court is whether the applicant\nis entitled to preservation of the status quo pending a trial on the merits. The applicant need only demonstrate a probable injury\nand a probable right of recovery; he does not have to establish that he will finally prevail on the merits. Transport Co. of Texas,\net al. v. Robertson Transports, Inc., 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549 (1953). Where the pleadings and evidence present a case\nof probable injury and probable right of recovery, the trial court is clothed with broad discretion in determining whether to\nissue a temporary injunction and its order will be reversed only on a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. Davis v. Huey,\n571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.1978).\n\n [3] This is not an appeal of the cause on the merits, and we are not to be understood as holding that appellee will ultimately\nprevail on any of the alleged causes of action. To the contrary, our standard of review of a grant of a temporary injunction is\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion in finding that there was a probable injury and a probable right of recovery. An abuse\nof discretion occurs when the decision of the trial court was arbitrary or unreasonable. Landry v. Traveler's Insurance Co., 458\nS.W.2d 649 (Tex.1970). Since it is obvious that appellee would probably *16 be injured if the property were foreclosed and\nsold, the only question here is whether the trial court erred in determining there was a probable right of recovery.\n\n [4] The parties have not yet had the opportunity to present all their evidence on appellee's allegations. Until then, the probable\nright to recover is determinable only by what now appears in the record. And what now appears in the record is evidence that,\nwhile hotly disputed, if believed establishes at least one of appellee's causes of action. Point of error one is overruled.\n\nAppellant's second point of error challenges the trial court's setting of bond for the temporary injunction at $10,000. Texas\nR.Civ.P. 684 (Supp.1988) provides that in the order granting any temporary injunction, the court shall fix the amount of security\nto be given by the applicant. The rule then provides that the bond is to be conditioned “... that the applicant will abide the\ndecision ... in the cause, and that he will pay all sums of money and costs that may be adjudged against him if the ... temporary\ninjunction [is] dissolved ...” (emphasis added). The rule also provides that the discretion of the trial court in fixing the amount\nof the bond is subject to review. Neither Rule 684 nor the case law gives us much guidance in evaluating the sufficiency of\nthe bond here, but several courts have required bond amounts that, in relation to the value at stake in the action below, are\nproportionately far greater than the bond set in this case. See, e.g., Westside Airways, Inc. v. JR Aircraft Corp., 694 S.W.2d 100\n(Tex.App.1985, no writ); Lee v. Howard Broadcasting Corp., 305 S.W.2d 629 (Tex.Civ.App.1957, writ dism'd).\n\n [5] We do not believe that $10,000 adequately protects appellant in this case. The property at issue is valued at between $25\nmillion and $50 million. The debt to appellant is some $34 million, and the unpaid interest on the debt has been accruing at the\nrate of about $300,000 each month; thus, the potential loss of interest alone over the life of the injunction (which took effect\nDecember 1, 1987) already exceeds $2 million. Furthermore, should appellant eventually prevail on the merits, it might sustain\nother losses resulting from its inability to develop the property during the term of the injunction. We think the trial court abused\nits discretion in failing to set bond at an amount adequate to protect appellant, and accordingly sustain the second point of error.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the district court's order granting the temporary injunction, but remand the cause to that court with instructions to\ndetermine what amount of security (which in any event should greatly exceed $10,000) will adequately protect appellant, and\nto set bond accordingly under Tex.R.Civ.P. 684.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Pirkles are officers and owners of Frequent Flyer.\nAmerican sued appellants and other similar brokers and their principals, contending that the brokering, purchase, bartering, and\nsale of AAdvantage® rewards is improper. Among its claims against appellants are claims for tortious interference with contract,\ntortious interference with prospective relations, misappropriation, and fraud. American also asserted a breach of contract claim\nagainst Robert Pirkle. After filing suit, American sought and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting appellants from\nbuying, selling, bartering, or soliciting AAdvantage® rewards during pendency of the suit.\n\n\n\n                                                      Standard of Review\n\n [1] [2] [3] To be entitled to a temporary injunction, the applicant must plead a cause of action and further show both a\nprobable right to recover on that cause of action and a probable, imminent, and irreparable injury in the interim. Butnaru v. Ford\nMotor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002); Argyle ISD ex rel. Bd. of Trustees v. Wolf, 234 S.W.3d 229, 236 (Tex.App.-Fort\nWorth 2007, no pet.); Fox v. Tropical Warehouses, Inc., 121 S.W.3d 853, 857 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2003, no pet.). A probable\nright of recovery is shown by alleging a cause of action and presenting evidence tending to sustain it. Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at 236;\nFox, 121 S.W.3d at 857. An injury is irreparable if damages would not adequately compensate the injured party or if they cannot\nbe measured by any certain pecuniary standard. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204; Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at 236; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857.\n\n [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] In an appeal from an order granting or denying a temporary injunction, the scope of review is restricted\nto the validity of the order granting or denying relief. Walling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex.1993); Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at\n237; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857. Whether to grant or deny a request for a temporary injunction is within the trial court's discretion,\nand we will not reverse its decision absent an abuse of discretion. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204; Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at 237; Fox,\n121 S.W.3d at 857. Accordingly, when reviewing such a decision, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe trial court's order, indulging every reasonable inference in its favor, and determine whether the order was so arbitrary that it\nexceeds the bounds of reasonable discretion. Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at 237; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857. A trial court does not abuse its\ndiscretion if it bases its decision on conflicting evidence and at least some evidence in the record reasonably supports the trial\ncourt's decision. Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.1978); Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at 237; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857. When\nfindings of fact are not requested or separately filed, as in this case, we must uphold the trial court's order on any legal theory\nsupported by the record. Mabrey v.

American Airlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d 215 (2009)\n\n\ngeneral of “fare advertising guidelines” was pre-empted by the ADA. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374,\n391, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 2041, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). The Court has also held that claims brought by AAdvantage® members\nagainst American in state court alleging violations of Illinois's Consumer Fraud Act were pre-empted by section 41713(b)(1).\nAm. Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219, 226, 115 S.Ct. 817, 823–24, 130 L.Ed.2d 715 (1995).\n\n [9] Appellants allege that this suit likewise involves an attempt to regulate prices, routes, or services that is pre-empted by the\nAct. American counters that any suit brought against it attempting to apply standards to its AAdvantage® program would be\npre-empted as an attempt to place state regulations upon prices, routes, or services but that any attempt by it to enforce via state\nlaw its own standards as to prices, routes, or services, including frequent flyer mile credits, is not pre-empted as impermissible\nstate regulation. We agree with American.\n\nIn Morales, the Court considered the effect the advertising restrictions would have on airlines' fares, holding that the restrictions\nwould curtail the airlines' ability to communicate their fares to customers. Morales, 504 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 2039–40. But\nit also held that “ ‘[s]ome state actions may affect [airline fares] in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner’ to have pre-\nemptive effect.” Id. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 2040.\n\nThe Court further distinguished contract actions in Wolens, holding that the Act does not shelter airlines from suits “seeking\nrecovery solely for the airlines' alleged breach of its own self-imposed undertakings.” Wolens, 513 U.S. at 228, 115 S.Ct. at 824.\nAlthough concluding that the Act pre-empted AAdvantage® members' Illinois Consumer Fraud Act claims because mileage\ncredits are akin to “rates,” the Court nevertheless held that as to contracts affecting such mileage credits, “[m]arket efficiency\nrequires effective means to enforce private agreements.” Id. at 230, 115 S.Ct. at 824.\n\nAfter Morales and Wolens, courts have held that certain personal injury causes of actions against airlines are not pre-empted by\nthe Act. See, e.g., Hodges v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 44 F.3d 334, 340 (5th Cir.1995); Continental Airlines v. Kiefer, 920 S.W.2d\n274, 283 (Tex.1996). In explaining its decision in Kiefer, the Texas supreme court noted that, “as Wolens explains at some\nlength, claims are not [pre-empted] if they do not involve the enforcement of policy-laden state law that too closely approaches\na regulatory effect on airlines.” Kiefer, 920 S.W.2d at 283.\n\nHere, although American has brought mostly tort claims, those claims attempt to protect the vitality of its self-imposed\nobligations: those arising from the AAdvantage® program. American's invoking the benefits and protections of state law to\nprotect its own agreements does not have the same impermissible regulatory effect upon prices, routes, or services that Congress\nwas concerned with in enacting section 41713(b)(1). The Act was intended to pre-empt only those state actions having a\nregulatory effect upon the airlines rather than to preclude airlines from seeking the benefits and protections of state law to\nenforce their self-imposed standards, regulations, and contracts. See id. (“[T]he purpose of ADA preemption is not to absolve\nairlines from all liability under state law, but to prohibit state regulation of air carriers, direct or indirect. Congress' concern\n *222 was ‘that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.’ ”); see also Hodges, 44 F.3d at\n337 (“Following deregulation, the CAB's [the former Civil Aeronautics Board's] statements implementing the ADA strongly\nsupport the view that the ADA was concerned solely with economic deregulation, not with displacing state tort law.”). Indeed,\ndenying American access to state courts for such purposes would seem to have such an impermissible regulatory effect.\n\nAppellants contend that it is unfair to allow the airlines unfettered access to the state courts to enforce their own standards\nrelated to frequent flyer programs while denying access to the state courts to the states themselves and other parties attempting\nto impose standards on the airlines under state law. But the fairness of this application is not for us to decide; we must abide\nby Congress's intentions when determining whether a suit is pre-empted by the Act. See Morales, 504 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct.\nat 2036 (noting that in determining whether a suit is pre-empted under the Act, the question is one of statutory intent, and we\nmust “begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately\nexpresses the legislative purpose”).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellants claim that because American knowingly allowed their activities to continue for\nsome time, the last peaceable uncontested status is to allow appellants to continue their business.\n\n [10] [11] The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo until a trial on the merits. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d\nat 204; Wolf, 234 S.W.3d at 237; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857. “Status quo is defined as ‘the last, actual, peaceable, noncontested\nstatus which preceded the pending controversy.’ ” Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570, 577 (Tex.App.-\nAustin 2000, no pet.) (quoting Transp. Co. v. Robertson Transps., Inc., 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549, 553–54 (1953)); see\nWolf, 234 S.W.3d at 237.\n\nGeorge Pirkle testified at the temporary injunction hearing that an attorney for American called him “several times” in 2002\nabout domain names connected to Frequent Flyer's website, frequentflyerdepot.com. The attorney told George that those domain\nnames constituted trademark infringement and that American wanted them back. George told the attorney that the domain\nnames were connected to frequentflyerdepot.com, and he agreed to give them to American. Although George testified that\nthe attorney did not tell him to stop operating frequentflyerdepot.com, he also admitted that he could not recall whether they\nhad talked about Frequent Flyer's brokerage business. He also said that the lawyer never told him that American would permit\nFrequent Flyer to sell AAdvantage® miles.\n\nSince 2005, American has stopped travel on tickets sold by Frequent Flyer by freezing the accounts of AAdvantage® members\nwho American discovers have improperly sold their rewards points to a third party. But George Pirkle admitted that American\nsuccessfully discovers and *223 stops travel on Frequent Flyer's transactions only between about three and four to ten percent\nof the time. American's representative testified that these “policing” efforts are disruptive, causing operational difficulties for\nAmerican and diverting resources away from legitimate ticketing.\n\n\nWhen American deposed George Pirkle as the designated representative of Frequent Flyer, 1 he admitted that Frequent Flyer\n“brokers” AAdvantage® rewards points; in other words, Frequent Flyer buys rewards points from AAdvantage® members\nand sells those points to third parties. He agreed that American had asked Frequent Flyer to stop doing so “earlier this year\n[2008],” and he confirmed that Frequent Flyer had refused. American sought the temporary injunction hearing shortly after\ntaking appellants' depositions.\n\n\n [12] If, as American claims, appellants' activities are in violation of its agreements with AAdvantage® members, 2 the last\npeaceable, noncontested status is for appellants to refrain from selling AAdvantage® rewards points. There is no evidence that\nAmerican knew of Frequent Flyer's brokering activities in 2002 when its attorney contacted George Pirkle about the domain\nnames; as George himself testified, he bought around 136 domain names when he started. Likewise, there is no evidence that\nAmerican knew in 2005 and later that the AAdvantage® accounts it was freezing for the improper sale of rewards points were\nsold through Frequent Flyer in particular. 3 Even so, it is a reasonable inference that American could not have known the\nfull extent of Frequent Flyer's activities, considering George's testimony that Frequent Flyer transactions were “caught” only\nbetween three to ten percent of the time.\n\nAmerican moved for a temporary injunction when it learned the full extent of Frequent Flyer's activities and Frequent Flyer\nrefused to discontinue those activities even in the face of American's suit.

Accordingly, we overrule appellants' second issue.\n\n\n\n                      Enforceability of Agreement Between American and AAdvantage® Members\n\nAppellants contend in their third issue that there is no evidence that American has a binding contract with its AAdvantage®\nmembers such that appellants' actions in buying and selling, and inducing AAdvantage® members to buy and sell,\nAAdvantage® rewards points are improper as alleged by American in its tort claims.\n\n *224 To become an AAdvantage® member, a person must agree to American's online User Agreement, which contains the\nfollowing provision: “At no time may AAdvantage® mileage credit or award tickets be purchased, sold or bartered. Any such\nmileage or tickets are void if transferred for cash or other consideration.” The User Agreement also contains other provisions\nallowing American to change the terms of the AAdvantage® program, upon which appellants base their claim that the User\nAgreement lacks mutuality and is, therefore, unenforceable. Specifically, the User Agreement states that American may,\n\n            in its discretion, change the AAdvantage® program rules, regulations, travel awards, and special offers\n            at any time with or without notice.... American Airlines may make one or more of [certain enumerated]\n            changes at any time even though such changes may affect your ability to use the mileage credit or\n            awards that you have already accumulated. American Airlines reserves the right to end the AAdvantage®\n            program with six months notice. 4\n\n\nAccording to appellants, this clause shows a fatal lack of mutuality, rendering the entire agreement unenforceable.\n\n [13] [14] [15] [16] A bilateral contract is one in which there are mutual promises between two parties to the contract, each\nbeing both a promisor and a promisee. Hutchings v. Slemons, 141 Tex. 448, 174 S.W.2d 487, 489 (1943); The Colony, Tex. v.\nN. Tex. Mun. Water Dist., 272 S.W.3d 699, 725 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth, pet. filed). A bilateral contract must be based upon a\nvalid consideration, in other words, mutuality of obligation. Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401, 409 (Tex.1997); The\nColony, 272 S.W.3d at 725. Consideration may consist of either benefits or detriments to the contracting parties; it may consist\nof some right, interest, profit, or benefit that accrues to one party, or alternatively, of some forbearance, loss, or responsibility\nthat is undertaken or incurred by the other party. The Colony, 272 S.W.3d at 725; In re C & H News Co., 133 S.W.3d 642, 647\n(Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 2003, orig. proceeding). The existence of a written contract presumes consideration for its execution.\nThe Colony, 272 S.W.3d at 725; Doncaster v. Hernaiz, 161 S.W.3d 594, 603 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2005, no pet.).\n\n [17] [18] [19] A contract that lacks mutuality of obligation is illusory and void and thus unenforceable. The Colony, 272\nS.W.3d at 725; Tex. S. Univ. v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 212 S.W.3d 893, 914 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet.\ndenied). A promise is illusory when it fails to bind the promisor who retains the option of discontinuing performance without\nnotice. Light v. Centel Cellular Co. of Tex., 883 S.W.2d 642, 645 (Tex.1994); The Colony, 272 S.W.3d at 725; Rogers v.\nAlexander, 244 S.W.3d 370, 382 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2007, no pet.). But mutuality in each clause of a contract is not required when\nconsideration is given for the contract as a whole. Howell v. Murray Mortgage Co., 890 S.W.2d 78, 87 (Tex.App.-Amarillo\n1994, writ denied).\n\n [20] [21] The test for mutuality is applied and determined when enforcement is sought, not when the promises are made.\nHutchings, 174 S.W.2d at 489; Cherokee Commc'ns, Inc. v. Skinny's, Inc., 893 S.W.2d 313, 316 (Tex.App.-Eastland 1994, writ\ndenied). Accordingly, even if an illusory *225 promise renders a contract unilateral, consideration can still be established by\npart performance by the promisee.

Johnson, 209 S.W.3d 644, 650–51 (Tex.2006) (distinguishing general rule as to covenants not to compete,\nwhich, by statute, must be enforceable when entered into).\n\n [22] Here, the clause pointed to by appellants allows American to terminate the program upon notice and allows American\nto change the terms of the program with or without notice. However, that does not mean American is without obligation to its\nmembers under the User Agreements. In consideration for AAdvantage® members' purchasing paid travel on American and\nits partner airlines, and purchasing other services from specified providers, American agrees to provide rewards points to those\ncustomers. It is nonsensical for appellants to argue that no enforceable agreement exists when their entire business depends on\nthe enforceability of that agreement. In other words, if American has no obligation to issue a ticket in exchange for rewards\npoints when an AAdvantage® member fully complies with the User Agreement, appellants are ill-positioned to complain about\nthe trial court's enjoining their activities, which depend on American's complying with its obligation even when a ticket is\nobtained in violation of the applicable User Agreement. Appellants cannot have it both ways.\n\nAdditionally, as appellants point out in their brief, American's misappropriation claim “as alleged requires a showing that\n[appellants] ‘wrongfully[ ]obtained award tickets.’ ” The key word here is “obtained,” in the past tense. It is undisputed that\nAmerican has issued tickets in exchange for rewards points purchased through Frequent Flyer. With regard to those tickets,\nthen, American has performed under the applicable User Agreements. Thus, even if American's consideration was illusory when\nit entered into the applicable User Agreements, its subsequent performance under those agreements established consideration,\nrendering those agreements enforceable. See Hutchings, 174 S.W.2d at 489; Cherokee Commc'ns, 893 S.W.2d at 316.\n\nThe same holds true for tickets that American will issue in exchange for rewards points in the future. If American does not issue\nany such tickets, then the question of whether American can enforce the no-sale rule is moot. But if American does issue tickets\nin exchange for rewards points acquired through purchase or barter—then it will again have partially performed under the User\nAgreements at issue, thus establishing the necessary consideration to render those agreements enforceable. See Hutchings, 174\nS.W.2d at 489; Cherokee Commc'ns, 893 S.W.2d at 316. 5\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude and hold that American's AAdvantage® User Agreements do not fail for lack of mutuality, and\nwe overrule appellants' third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                       *226 Continuance\n\nIn their fourth issue, appellants claim that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to continue the temporary injunction\nhearing.\n\n [23] Appellants moved for a continuance both before and after the temporary injunction hearing on the ground that American\nhad refused to produce documents in response to appellants' Third Request for Production. Appellants requested these\ndocuments in conjunction with their counterclaims against American for interference with contractual and business relations,\ntortious interference with prospective relations, a declaratory judgment that appellants' actions in purchasing and selling\nAAdvantage® rewards points are not improper, violations of the Texas Free Enterprise Act, violations of the DTPA, and\ninjunctive relief. In particular, appellants claimed they needed additional discovery on their antitrust claims, their equitable\ndefenses, and whether American had an adequate remedy at law. The gist of appellants' counterclaims is that American is a\ncompetitor and is unlawfully attempting to restrict their ability to maintain a competing business.\n\nAppellants' complaint fails initially because they failed to support their written motion for continuance with an affidavit as\nrequired by rule 251. Tex.R. Civ. P. 251. Generally, when a movant fails to comply with rule 251, we presume the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion by denying a motion for continuance. Villegas v. Carter, 711 S.W.2d 624, 626 (Tex.1986); Sw.\nCountry Enters., Inc. v.

Moreover, if necessary to protect a proven legal right, a temporary injunction may issue\neven if it has the effect of restraining competition, so long as it is narrowly tailored to preserve the status quo. Sharma, 231\nS.W.3d at 428–29 (“While ordinarily a temporary injunction should operate as a corrective rather than a punitive measure, when\na choice must be made between a failure to provide adequate protection of a recognized legal right and the punitive operation\nof the writ, the latter course must be taken.”). We overrule appellants' fourth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        Proof of Injury\n\nAppellants' fifth issue complains that American failed to meet its burden to prove that it was injured.\n\nAmerican alleged that it is injured by Frequent Flyer's actions because customers who purchase void rewards points from\nappellants (because those purchases violate the no-sale rule) would likely have purchased tickets from American had they\nnot obtained the void tickets; thus, those customers likely displaced other AAdvantage® members or other paying American\ncustomers who would have purchased tickets had the seats not been occupied by travelers using the void tickets. American also\nalleged that it lost goodwill with AAdvantage® members in that those members were prevented from using their AAdvantage®\nrewards points because seats were occupied by persons using the void tickets. Appellants contend that American “offered no\nevidence of any identified passenger, actual or potential, who suffered any aspect *227 of [American's] litany of claimed\ninjuries.”\n\n [25] [26] A party proves irreparable injury for injunction purposes by proving that damages would not adequately compensate\nthe party or cannot be measured by any certain pecuniary standard. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857.\nAn injunction is not proper when the claimed injury is merely speculative, however; fear and apprehension of injury are not\nsufficient to support a temporary injunction. Jordan v. Landry's Seafood Rest., Inc., 89 S.W.3d 737, 742 (Tex.App.-Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied) (op. on reh'g).\n\n [27] American offered the testimony of Jim Balsom, Manager of AAdvantage® systems and partner support. He testified\nwithout objection that American is reluctant to challenge the veracity of AAdvantage® members' representations when booking\ntravel because “that would not engender goodwill[;] in fact, [it would] probably cost [American] significant goodwill if we were\nto do that.” Additionally, he testified that such an inquiry “[w]ould take [a] significant amount of time and add significantly\nto [American's] costs.”\n\nBalsom further testified that brokering operations such as Frequent Flyer's “cause[ ] customers to question [American's] ability\nto manage and maintain the program and deliver the benefits that we've promised to customers.” He said that when American\ndiscovers a void transaction due to Frequent Flyer's activities, its business is disrupted and it must divert resources away from\nlegitimate customers to deal with the void transactions. He also testified that freezing the AAdvantage® accounts at issue causes\nill will for the member. Balsom further stated that dealing with these types of transactions causes “operational difficulties or\nissues.”\n\nRegarding displacement, Balsom testified that when Frequent Flyer sells an AAdvantage® member's rewards points to a third\nparty, that third party displaces a customer “who would either pay cash for that ticket or ... who would redeem AAdvantage®\nmiles for the seat.” He said it also “does use resources through [American's] reservations office [and] potentially AA.com for\nother business purposes” instead of valid ticket sales.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

American Airlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d 215 (2009)\n\n\nAppellants challenge American's displacement evidence, pointing to Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by\nAMR, American's parent company, showing that, generally, between 2003 and 2007, twenty to thirty percent of seats on\nAmerican's flights were empty. It also points to statements in those reports to the effect that, with respect to the AAdvantage®\nprogram, AMR “believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the Company's load factors, its ability to manage\nfrequent flyer inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded.” According to appellants,\nabsent evidence from specific flights on which displacement occurred, American cannot overcome this evidence of empty seats\non its flights.\n\nThe SEC filings do not give information for specific flights; indeed, the vacancies in paying seats may be higher due to higher\nnumbers of business travelers paying a lower price for rewards points tickets through Frequent Flyer than paying for typical\nfull-fare seats. 6 And the isolated *228 statement that displacement is minimal is clearly in relation to the function of the\nprogram according to its guidelines; in other words, passenger displacement is minimal when the program is operating without\noutside influences.\n\nAmerican points to additional evidence as supporting the proof of injury requirement, such as the fact that it is virtually\nimpossible to police appellants' actions (when American discovers a void ticket, Frequent Flyer simply buys more miles and\nissues a new one), that American has to devote resources to investigating and policing appellants' actions that disrupt its\noperation and divert its resources from legitimate customers, and the unobjected-to evidence that American's inability to police\nactivities such as Frequent Flyer's causes AAdvantage® members to question its ability to effectively run the program.\n\n [28] Disruption to a business can be irreparable harm. Lavigne v. Holder, 186 S.W.3d 625, 629 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2006,\nno pet.); David v. Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, Inc., 630 S.W.2d 754, 757 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1982, no writ) (“This\nharm would not only disrupt the organized business dealings of Bache but would also threaten customer confidence in Bache's\nhandling of their private affairs, and probably cause Bache to lose not only customers but profits as well.”). Moreover, assigning\na dollar amount to such intangibles as a company's loss of clientele, goodwill, marketing techniques, and office stability, among\nothers, is not easy. Martin v. Linen Sys. for Hosps., Inc., 671 S.W.2d 706, 710 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, no writ).\n\nAmerican offered specific, undisputed evidence of intangible harm to its business, including the AAdvantage® program,\nresulting from appellants' actions. Balsom's testimony was not speculative and is supported by the Pirkles' own testimony\nabout Frequent Flyer's operations, specifically, its instructions to AAdvantage® members intended to conceal its activities from\nAmerican.\n\nWe conclude and hold that American presented evidence of an irreparable injury. Thus, we overrule appellants' fifth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                      Adequate Remedy\n\nIn their sixth issue, appellants claim that if American presented sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proof as to injury,\nthat same evidence shows that American has an adequate remedy in damages. Specifically, appellants claim that damages can\nbe calculated easily from AMR's SEC filings if American can provide the identity of specific displaced passengers. They also\ncontend that American cannot show lost profits because it has not made any profit since at least 2002.\n\n [29] American counters that even if damages can be assigned to displaced passengers, appellants “do not refute the evidence ...\nthat their conduct disrupts American's business ... in many ways and affects the reputation and loyalty it has developed over\nyears with its customers.”\n\n *229 [30] [31] An adequate remedy is one that is as complete, practical, and efficient to the prompt administration of\njustice as is equitable relief.

American Airlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d 215 (2009)\n\n\n\n\n [32] According to American, while the evidence appellants point to may show that some of its damages are calculable, it\ndoes not show a way to calculate damages for American's claims of loss of goodwill and other intangibles. We agree. As we\nhave already stated, the intangible types of injuries testified to by Balsom are the types of injuries to which a dollar value may\nnot easily be assigned. Martin, 671 S.W.2d at 710. A remedy is not adequate simply because some of the proven damages are\ncalculable. See Tex. Indus. Gas v. Phoenix Metallurgical Corp., 828 S.W.2d 529, 532 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, no\nwrit) (“For a legal remedy to be adequate, it must give the applicant complete, final, and equal relief.”); see also Towers v.\nGrogan, No. 01–97–00946–CV, 1998 WL 191760, at *4 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] Apr. 23, 1998, no pet.) (not designated\nfor publication) (holding that although some breach of contract damages were calculable, specific damages for which Grogan\nsought injunctive relief were intangibles, incapable of being measured by damages).\n\nWe conclude and hold that American proved that damages are not adequate to fully compensate it for its injuries. Accordingly,\nwe overrule appellants' sixth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                     Equitable Concerns\n\nAppellants' seventh issue raises equitable claims, including laches and unclean hands.\n\nAppellants first contend that American's temporary injunction claim is barred by laches because American has failed to take\naction against appellants despite knowing since 2002 the type of business Frequent Flyer was engaged in. Appellants claim\nFrequent Flyer has been prejudiced by American's inaction because the Pirkles never would have expanded the business since\n2002 had they known American objected to Frequent Flyer's conduct.\n\n [33] [34] A party asserting the defense of laches must show both an unreasonable delay by the other party in asserting its\nrights and harm resulting to it because of the delay. Rogers v. Ricane Enters. Inc., 772 S.W.2d 76, 80 (Tex.1989); In re Roxsane\nR., 249 S.W.3d 764, 771 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2008, orig. proceeding). Here, we have already discussed the lack of evidence\nthat American knew or should have known of appellants' activities when its lawyer contacted George Pirkle in 2002 about the\ndomain names. In addition, we have also pointed to the evidence that Frequent Flyer purposefully concealed its dealings from\nAmerican and instructed AAdvantage® members to do the same. Accordingly, we do not believe that the evidence shows that\nAmerican deliberately slumbered on its rights with regard to appellants' conduct.\n\nMoreover, there was evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that appellants failed to show prejudice; the\ntrial court elicited testimony from George that Frequent Flyer's expansion also had to do with increased trade in other airlines'\nfrequent flyer miles. George also testified that he had been aware of American's no-sale provision since at least 2005 because\nAmerican had stopped travel on tickets bought with rewards points sold by Frequent Flyer before that time. Accordingly, we\nconclude and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting appellants' claim of laches.\n\n [35] Appellants contend that American has unclean hands because “the evidence *230 shows that [American] is part of an\nillegal conspiracy with regard to the antitrust laws of the United States and the State of Texas.” According to appellants, the\ntemporary injunction prevents (and American's suit seeks to prevent) them from competing with American. Appellants also\nclaim that American must do equity to obtain equity and that American has failed to do so by authorizing Points.com and\nits airline partners to trade with members for AAdvantage® rewards points. This argument appears to incorporate appellants'\nantitrust and anticompetition claims. But as we have already held, an otherwise proper injunction will not be rendered improper\nby claims that such an injunction would have a preclusive effect on competition. See Sharma, 231 S.W.3d at 429. Thus, we\nconclude and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting appellants' equitable defenses.\n\nWe overrule appellants' seventh issue.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

USAir, Inc., 33 Phila.Co.Rptr. 427, 431–32 (C.P.1997).\n        But the key factor that makes this case similar to those is that the party seeking enforcement-here, American-effectively concedes\n        enforceability of the agreements by attempting to enforce them.\n6       As the United State Supreme Court noted in Morales,\n           The expenses involved in operating an airline flight are almost entirely fixed costs; they increase very little with each additional\n           passenger. The market for these flights is divided between consumers whose volume of purchases is relatively insensitive to\n           price (primarily business travelers) and consumers whose demand is very price sensitive indeed (primarily pleasure travelers).\n           Accordingly, airlines try to sell as many seats per flight as possible at higher prices to the first group, and then to fill up the flight\n           by selling seats at much lower prices to the second group (since almost all the costs are fixed, even a passenger paying far below\n           average cost is preferable to an empty seat). In order for this marketing process to work, and for it ultimately to redound to the\n           benefit of price-conscious travelers, the airlines must be able to place substantial restrictions on the availability of the lower priced\n           seats (so as to sell as many seats as possible at the higher rate), and must be able to advertise the lower fares.\n           504 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 2040.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

PATTERSON, Justice.\n\n *1 Appellant Roger W. Jenkins, one of two board members and president of appellee TransDel Corporation, owned forty-nine\npercent of the company's stock. George Hilton, TransDel's vice-president, board member, and majority stockholder, filed this\nshareholder's derivative suit, alleging that Jenkins violated his fiduciary duties by attempting to acquire TransDel's assets and\ndivert its business to All About Freight Services, Inc., Jenkins's new corporation. TransDel requested a temporary injunction\nbarring Jenkins from interfering with TransDel's business, contacting TransDel's customers, or attempting to collect any funds\nowed to TransDel.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court granted TransDel's request and enjoined Jenkins from interfering with Hilton's management\nand operation of TransDel, withholding TransDel's assets, contacting TransDel's customers, or attempting to divert TransDel's\nbusiness in any way. Jenkins was ordered to return a truck to Hilton and give him information stored in TransDel's computer.\nJenkins was allowed to contact TransDel customers that were also All About Freight customers for purposes of collecting\nbalances due to All About Freight. The trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law related to the temporary injunction.\nIn this accelerated interlocutory appeal, Jenkins contends that TransDel did not establish (1) a probable right of recovery or\n(2) interim injury without an adequate remedy at law, and that the injunction (3) does not maintain the status quo, (4) violates\nrule 683 of the rules of civil procedure, (5) is overbroad, and (6) amounts to a prior restraint on Jenkins's constitutional right\nto free speech.

In 2003, TransDel owed money to the Internal Revenue\nService and was behind in rent payments. Relations between Hilton and Jenkins soured, apparently having to do at least in part\nwith Hilton's decision as majority shareholder to fire Jenkins's wife, who was working part-time for TransDel. In late August\n2003, Jenkins prepared a letter resigning as president of TransDel and stating that he would remain only as an employee; the\nparties disagree about when Hilton saw that letter and whether he believed Jenkins was still acting as president of TransDel\nduring the fall of 2003. TransDel alleged that Jenkins developed a plan that he represented would help TransDel pay its past\ndue rent; under the plan, All About Freight would assume the lease and TransDel would sublease the premises from All About\nFreight. In September 2003, a truck belonging to TransDel was transferred into Jenkins's name. Hilton believed the transfer was\ndone to get a loan for a final balloon payment on the truck and thought that the truck still belonged to TransDel. Jenkins testified\nthat the truck was transferred to him because he took out a personal loan to provide $4,000 for the truck. He also testified that\nTransDel paid $7,300 to buy the truck and made the payments on the $4,000 loan that Jenkins took out for the remaining balance.\n\nIn October 2003, Jenkins and Hilton signed an agreement that stated that Jenkins was starting All About Freight in the same line\nof business as TransDel (“the Agreement”). The Agreement further stated that TransDel waived any fiduciary duty owed it by\nJenkins. Hilton testified that he did not read the entire document but instead relied on Jenkins's representations about what the\nAgreement entailed because he trusted Jenkins after their years of working together. Jenkins also drafted a proposal stating that\nAll About Freight was taking over TransDel's business accounts; Hilton testified that he first saw this document in November\n2003, when Jenkins left it behind in a vehicle he had driven. Jenkins then wrote a letter to TransDel's customers on letterhead\nlisting both TransDel's and All About Freight's names, signing as “President.” The letter stated that TransDel was revamping\nits structure and changing its name and asked the customers to send payments to All About Freight's post office box, while all\nother correspondence should continue to be sent to TransDel's address. Hilton discovered this when a letter was returned to\nTransDel as undeliverable. TransDel alleged that Jenkins misrepresented that his plans would help clear up TransDel's debts,\nwhen in fact Jenkins was diverting business to his new company.\n\n\n\n                                                            Discussion\n\n [1] [2] In his first issue, Jenkins contends that TransDel failed to establish a probable right to recovery, arguing that Hilton\nsigned the Agreement and therefore should be bound by its terms, which included a waiver of any fiduciary duty owed by\nJenkins to TransDel. However, although Jenkins argues that Hilton should be bound by the Agreement, there was testimony\nthat Hilton did not know the full substance and import of the document when he signed it and that he signed it in reliance on\nmisrepresentations by Jenkins and in light of a long history of working together and trusting Jenkins's word. 2 Jenkins urges\nthat the agreement is valid “as long as this Court does not hold that JENKINS' conduct of contacting TRANSDEL customers on\nbehalf of [All About Freight] does not constitute self-dealing, bad faith, an intentional adverse act, or an act made with reckless\nindifference.”However, in reviewing the grant of temporary injunctive relief, we view the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the trial court's decision. There was testimony that Hilton was misled into signing the Agreement and that Jenkins did contact\nTransDel's customers in bad faith, seeking to lure TransDel's customers to All About Freight. We make no holding on the merits\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              4\n\fJenkins v. Transdel Corp., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2004)\n2004 WL 1404364\n\nas to whether Jenkins acted wrongly. Such a decision is not before us in this appeal. Based on the record before us and viewing\nthe testimony in the light most favorable to the trial court's decision, we cannot hold it was an abuse of discretion for the trial\ncourt to find that TransDel had demonstrated a probable right of recovery. We overrule Jenkins's first issue on appeal.\n\n *3 [3] Jenkins next contends that TransDel failed to establish a probable injury in the interim with no adequate remedy by\nlaw, noting that the trial court did not in its order expressly find imminent or irreparable harm or inadequate remedy. However,\nthere was evidence that All About Freight was interfering with TransDel's business relationships and attempting to acquire\nTransDel's customers. Jenkins's letter to TransDel's customers stated that TransDel was reorganizing and changing its name\nand asked that payments be sent to All About Freight. This can be interpreted as some evidence that Jenkins was attempting to\nacquire TransDel's customers under false pretenses, and the trial court could have concluded that such behavior could result in\nimminent and irreparable harm of a kind that would not be fairly compensable following trial. See Miller Paper Co. v. Roberts\nPaper Co., 901 S.W.2d 593, 602 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 1995, no writ) (demise of existing business may constitute irreparable\nharm); Martin v. Linen Sys. for Hosps., Inc., 671 S.W.2d 706, 710 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, no writ) (difficult to\nassign dollar value to loss of clientele, goodwill, stability). Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that\nTransDel established a probable injury in the interim with no adequate remedy at law. We overrule Jenkins's second issue.\n\n [4] In his third issue, Jenkins contends that the injunction does not maintain the status quo. Status quo is the “ ‘last, actual,\npeaceable, noncontested’ “ state of affairs preceding the controversy. Universal Health, 24 S.W.3d at 577 (quoting Transport\nCo. of Tex. v. Robertson Transports, Inc., 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549, 553–54 (Tex.1953)). If one party's act changes\nthe relationship between him and another, and the other party contests that action, the status quo to be maintained is not the\nrelationship as it existed after the act, but rather is the state of things as they were before the controversy arose. Id. (quoting\nBenavides Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Guerra, 681 S.W.2d 246, 249 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.)). Jenkins asserts that\nthe last uncontested situation was in November 2003, just before Hilton realized that Jenkins was trying to acquire TransDel's\ncustomers. Up until then, Jenkins asserts, the parties were operating peaceably under the Agreement, and by that time All\nAbout Freight had already contacted and perhaps acquired some of TransDel's customers. However, as discussed earlier,\nHilton asserted that he signed the Agreement due to Jenkins's misrepresentations. The trial court could have found that the\nlast uncontested status was prior to the fall of 2003, Jenkins's purported resignation of his presidency, and his establishment\nof All About Freight. We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in making such a finding. We overrule Jenkins's\nthird issue.\n\nIn his fourth issue, Jenkins contends that the injunction violates rule 683 of the rules of civil procedure because it does not explain\nhow TransDel's right to recover will be harmed if Jenkins is not enjoined from contacting its customers and does not specify\nwhat imminent injury may occur. Jenkins argues that because he is no longer TransDel's officer or director, his competition\nviolates no fiduciary duty and cannot endanger TransDel's right to recover.\n\n *4 [5] An order granting a temporary injunction must set forth the reasons for its issuance and describe in “reasonable detail”\nthe acts to be restrained. Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. The trial court's order states that Jenkins was at all relevant times a TransDel board\nmember, diverted business to All About Freight in violation of his fiduciary duty to TransDel, and took possession of TransDel's\nproperty. Jenkins was enjoined from (1) interfering with Hilton's operation of TransDel by withholding TransDel's assets and\n(2) contacting TransDel's customers or trying to divert its business to All About Freight. Jenkins was allowed to contact All\nAbout Freight customers that are “coincidentally” TransDel customers for the purpose of collecting outstanding balances due\nAll About Freight. Jenkins was also ordered to return certain property to TransDel.\n\nRule 683 does not mandate that an order set out each and every element that must be shown by a party seeking a temporary\ninjunction . 3 Instead, it requires a trial court to set out with reasonable specificity and detail the reasons for the injunction and\nthe acts to be enjoined. See Transport Co., 261 S.W.2d at 552–53 (rule 683 does not require order to state specifically why\napplicant will probably prevail on final trial, only why probable right to recover will be endangered without injunction; enjoined\nparty may seek findings of fact and conclusions of law). This order does precisely that. The trial court explained what Jenkins\nhad done and explained what he was forbidden to do in the future. Those statements sufficiently describe the situation and how\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Transdel Corp., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2004)\n2004 WL 1404364\n\nTransDel stands to suffer injury in the absence of an injunction. We hold that the order complied with the requirements of rule\n683 and overrule Jenkins's fourth issue.\n\nFinally, in his fifth and sixth issues, Jenkins argues that the injunction is overbroad and amounts to a prior restraint on his\nconstitutional rights to free speech. Jenkins again urges that because he is no longer a TransDel director or officer, he owes\nTransDel no fiduciary duty and should have the right to seek customers for All About Freight. However, under this argument, as\nsoon as a corporate officer resigned from his company, he could use any information or asset he acquired in trust from his former\ncompany in direct competition against it and to acquire its customers and business, even using misrepresentations to do so.\n\n [6] TransDel argues that All About Freight was established and began to acquire customers under false pretenses and in\nderogation of Jenkins's fiduciary duties. Jenkins wrote to TransDel's customers that TransDel was reorganizing, including\na name change, and that all payments should in the future be sent to All About Freight. It is conceivable that TransDel's\ncustomers could be confused and believe that All About Freight was TransDel's new name, not realizing it was in fact TransDel's\ncompetitor. It is not overly restrictive to order Jenkins to refrain from trying to acquire TransDel's customers while this lawsuit\nis pending.\n\n *5 [7] Nor does this amount to an impermissible prior restraint on free speech. Commercial speech is related “solely to\nthe economic interests of the speaker and its audience.”Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S.\n557, 561, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). Because commercial speech is “more verifiable” than other speech and is\nso important to business, traditional prohibitions against prior restraint may not be applicable. Amalgamated Acme Affiliates,\nInc. v. Minton, 33 S.W.3d 387, 394 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, no pet.)(citing Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 10, 99 S.Ct. 887,\n59 L.Ed.2d 100 (1979); State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs v. Burzynski, 917 S.W.2d 365, 370 (Tex.App.-Austin 1996, writ denied)).\nCommercial communications that are deceptive, confusing, or even potentially misleading may be enjoined. Id.\n\nJenkins is enjoined from contacting TransDel's customers, other than to collect any outstanding balances due to All About\nFreight. In the context of the record here, especially considering the November 2003 letter sent to TransDel's customers\nregarding payments, we cannot hold the trial court abused its discretion in enjoining Jenkins from continuing to contact\nTransDel's customers or in otherwise interfering with TransDel's operations. We overrule Jenkins's fifth and sixth issues on\nappeal.\n\n\n\n                                                                 Conclusion\n\nWe have viewed the record in the light most favorable to the trial court's order of injunction and without evaluating the merits\nof TransDel's claims.

The lots Rutherford purchased in Section 6 were subject to deed restrictions\nrequiring, among other things, that all buildings be set back ten feet from the property side lines and that no building shall\nbe erected until the Terramar Beach Association Architectural Control Committee had approved the construction plans. It is\nuncontroverted that Rutherford knew of these restrictions and failed to follow them.\n\nOn January 10, 1998, two days prior to commencing construction, Rutherford attended a general Terramar Association meeting\nand introduced himself and his plans for development to the association. *848 Although he did not have the required\nspecifications, he told the group about his plans, and also told them he was not required to follow the deed restrictions in his\nsection because “it states in the deed restriction that 100% of the property owners on that section right there can really do\nwhatever they want to do. We can voluntarily withdraw from the ceremony.” Based on these representations, the committee\napproved Rutherford's plans for two homes (Lots 8 and 9) that violated the setback restriction; however, the committee did not\napprove the construction plans for a third home (Lot 7) that violated the restriction. Rutherford's construction of this third home\nand his proposed construction of other homes in the subdivision form the basis of this suit.\n\n\n\n                                                                II.\n\n\n                                                       Procedural History\n\nOn January 20, 1998, ten days after the association meeting, the Architectural Control Committee chairman, Gordon Hopkins,\ntold Sherman Eagleton, Rutherford's foreman, that the plans for Lot 7 would have to comply with the setback restriction. On\nFebruary 5, 1998, the association's legal counsel wrote to Rutherford, reminding him that the lots were still subject to the setback\nrequirements and that he needed approval by the Architectural Control Committee before beginning construction. Following\nthese encounters, Rutherford contacted his attorney and refused to halt construction. Therefore, on February 18, 1998, Terramar\nfiled suit in district court seeking temporary and permanent injunctions to enforce the deed restrictions. Rutherford answered,\ncounterclaiming based on wrongful injunction and asserting the affirmative defenses of waiver, laches, estoppel, and fraud.\nRutherford also sought his own injunction against Terramar to “keep it from interfering in the construction of the remaining\nresidential homes in the development.”\n\nThe district court granted Terramar's motion for temporary injunction, finding it likely that Terramar would prevail in its suit\nfor a permanent injunction. Terramar then moved for summary judgment as to all of its claims against Rutherford, Rutherford's\naffirmative defenses, Rutherford's counterclaim, and its own reasonable attorney's fees. The trial court partly granted Terramar's\nmotion, permanently enjoining Rutherford from further violations of the subdivision's deed restrictions, denying Rutherford's\ncounterclaim, and rejecting Rutherford's affirmative defenses. The trial court, however, denied Terramar's summary judgment\nmotion for recovery of attorney's fees. On appeal, Rutherford challenges the trial court's grant of Terramar's summary judgment,\nand Terramar contests the trial court's denial of its attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standards of Review\n [1] The grant or refusal of a permanent or temporary injunction is ordinarily within the trial court's sound discretion, and on\nappeal, review of the trial court's action is limited to the question of whether the action constituted a clear abuse of discretion.\nSee Priest v. Texas Animal Health Com'n, 780 S.W.2d 874, 875 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1989, no writ). However, where the facts\nconclusively show that a party is violating the substantive law, the trial court should enjoin the violation, and in such case, there\nis no discretion to be exercised. See id. at 876.\n\nThe standard of review becomes more complex when the permanent injunction is issued by the trial court's grant of a motion for\nsummary judgment. A trial court may render summary judgment only if the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nSee Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c); *849 see also Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–49 (Tex.1985). In\ndeciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary judgment, we indulge every reasonable inference\nin favor of the non-movant and resolve any doubts in his favor. See O'Bryant v. Century 21 South Central States, Inc., 899\nS.W.2d 270, 271 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, no writ). If the movant's motion and summary judgment proof facially\nestablish his right to judgment as a matter of law, then the burden shifts to the non-movant to raise fact issues precluding\nsummary judgment. See City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.1979). Moreover, if the non-\nmovant relies on an affirmative defense to defeat summary judgment, he must present summary judgment proof sufficient to\nraise a fact issue as to each element of that defense. See Brownlee v. Brownlee, 665 S.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex.1984). With both\nstandards of review in mind, we turn to the propriety of the trial court's issuance of the permanent injunction.\n\n\nB. Permanent Injunction Elements\n [2] [3] [4] On appeal, Rutherford complains the trial court erred in permanently enjoining his construction because Terramar\nhas not demonstrated his violations of the deed restrictions will cause irreparable injury. Ordinarily, injunctive relief may only\nbe granted upon a showing of (1) the existence of a wrongful act; (2) the existence of imminent harm; (3) the existence of\nirreparable injury; and (4) the absence of an adequate remedy at law. See Priest, 780 S.W.2d at 875. However, when the basis of\nthe suit is enforcement of deed restrictions, the elements differ slightly. In Munson v. Milton, the court held “a movant seeking\na temporary injunction to enforce a restrictive covenant is not required to show proof of irreparable injury.” 948 S.W.2d 813,\n815 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1997, pet. denied). Instead, the movant is only required to prove that the defendant intends to\ndo an act that would breach the restrictive covenant. See id. Although Munson involved a temporary rather than a permanent\ninjunction, we believe the rule applied in Munson also applies here. See Tien Tao Ass'n v. Kingsbridge Park Community Ass'n,\nInc., 953 S.W.2d 525, 529–530 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1997, no pet.) (holding a party must substantially violate a deed\nrestriction before the trial court may issue a permanent injunction); see also Gigowski v. Russell, 718 S.W.2d 16, 21 (Tex.App.—\nTyler 1986, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (citing Protestant Episcopal Church Council v. McKinney, 339 S.W.2d 400, 403–04 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Eastland 1960, writ ref'd) for proposition that a well-settled exception in restrictive covenant cases allows issuance of a\npermanent injunction where a distinct or substantial breach is shown without regard to damages or irreparable injury).\n\nThe deed restrictions for Section 6, at issue here, were duly recorded with the County Clerk of Galveston County in 1969. It is\nundisputed that Rutherford purchased the lots with full knowledge of the setback and prior approval of building specifications\ndeed restrictions. Because he purchased the property with knowledge of the recorded deed restrictions and then promptly\nviolated the restrictions, the additional burden should not be upon Terramar to demonstrate irreparable injury. Thus, Rutherford's\ncontention that Terramar has not demonstrated irreparable injury has no effect on our analysis. See Tien Tao, 953 S.W.2d at\n529–30; see also Munson, 948 S.W.2d at 816.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Application of Law to Facts\n [5] The trial court's issuance of a permanent injunction was proper. First, Terramar's summary judgment proof demonstrates\nRutherford substantially breached the setback and prior approval of building specifications deed restrictions. Rutherford\nadmitted he never received approval for the setback violations for Lot 7. Further, the record clearly demonstrates the home\nRutherford built on Lot 7 has side *850 setback lines seven and one-half feet from the edges of the lot, thereby violating the\nten foot setback restriction by two and one-half feet. The record also demonstrates that when asked to stop construction on Lot 7\nbecause of deed restriction violations, Rutherford did not stop. Instead, he contacted his attorney and sought his own injunction\nto enjoin Terramar from impeding his construction in the future. Moreover, Terramar submitted evidence that demonstrates\nRutherford's activities were considered substantial breaches of the deed restrictions by homeowners and board members. See\nTien Tao, 953 S.W.2d at 531 (noting association's perception of the violation as “substantial” constituted evidence of substantial\nbreach).\n\nSecond, a balance of the equities demonstrates that those favoring Terramar significantly outweigh any equities favoring\nRutherford. See Beere v. Duren, 985 S.W.2d 243, 247 (Tex.App.—Beaumont 1999, pet. denied) (citing rule from Cowling\nv. Colligan, 158 Tex. 458, 312 S.W.2d 943, 945–46 (1958) regarding the necessity of balancing the equities when enforcing\nrestrictive covenants). As discussed, Rutherford purchased the property with knowledge of the restrictions. At the meeting,\nhe represented he did not have to follow the deed restrictions. Finally, when informed his property was subject to the deed\nrestrictions, he refused to halt construction and sought an injunction to keep Terramar at bay. By contrast, Terramar consulted its\nlegal counsel following the meeting and repeatedly informed Rutherford he needed to comply with the existing deed restrictions.\nFurther, when it became apparent Rutherford would not willingly comply, Terramar instituted legal action to force him into\ncompliance with the deed restrictions. Thus, the equities of enforcing the deed restrictions favor Terramar.\n\nBased on this evidence, Terramar conclusively proved its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by permanently enjoining Rutherford from violating the Terramar Beach deed restrictions.\n\n\n\n                                                               IV.\n\n\n                                                     Affirmative Defenses\n\nOn appeal, Rutherford also challenges the trial court's grant of Terramar's motion for summary judgment based on his affirmative\ndefenses. Rutherford insists there are fact issues to be resolved concerning three of his asserted defenses: waiver, estoppel, and\nlaches. 1 Because Terramar moved for a Rule 166a(i) no-evidence summary judgment as to Rutherford's affirmative defenses,\nwe will review the trial court's grant as we would a directed verdict. See Moore v. K Mart Corp., 981 S.W.2d 266, 269 (Tex.\nApp.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied); see also Judge David Hittner and Lynne Liberato, No–Evidence Summary Judgments\nUnder the New Rule, in STATE BAR OF TEXAS PROF. DEV. PROGRAM, 20 ADVANCED CIVIL TRIAL D, D–5 (1997).\nThe trial court may not grant a no-evidence summary judgment if the respondent brings forth more than a scintilla of probative\nevidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see also Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Havner,\n953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex.1997). Less than a scintilla of evidence exists when the evidence is so weak as to do no more than\ncreate a mere surmise or suspicion of a fact. See Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc., 650 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Tex.1983). The relevant inquiry\nis whether the non-movants asserting an affirmative defense have raised a fact issue upon each element *851 of that defense\nby evidence which would be admissible upon the trial of the case. See Finkelstein v. Southampton Civic Club, 675 S.W.2d 271,\n278 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). We will begin our analysis with the affirmative defense of waiver.\n\n\nA. Waiver\n [6] [7] [8] Waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. See Finkelstein, 675 S.W.2d at 278. To establish waiver\nin a deed restrictions case, the nonconforming user must prove that violations then existing are so great as to lead the mind\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Terramar Beach..., 25 S.W.3d 845 (2000)\n\n\nof the “average man” to reasonably conclude that the restriction in question has been abandoned and its enforcement waived.\nSee New Jerusalem Baptist Church, Inc. v. City of Houston, 598 S.W.2d 666, 669 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1980).\nAmong the factors to be considered by the “average man” are the number, nature, and severity of the then existing violations,\nany prior acts of enforcement of the restriction, and whether it is still possible to realize to a substantial degree the benefits\nintended through the covenant. See id.\n\n [9] First, Rutherford argues that Terramar waived its setback deed restriction as to Lot 7 when it approved his five foot setbacks\non Lots 8 and 9. Based on his assertions, our inquiry is whether an average person could reasonably conclude that based on\nthe prior approvals, Terramar had abandoned its setback and approval restrictions. However, Rutherford admitted that although\nTerramar approved Lots 8 and 9, he knew Terramar did not approve the Lot 7 setback violation. In fact, Rutherford admitted\nhe did not submit the required specifications in order to obtain approval for Lot 7. Further, within ten days of the association\nmeeting, Rutherford was on notice that Terramar would not allow his violation of either the approval or setback restrictions\nas to Lot 7. 2\n\n[10]    Second, Rutherford claims Terramar waived its setback restriction because four other homes in Section 6 of the\nsubdivision violate the deed restrictions. 3 However, the deed restrictions in question contain a severability clause, stating “[t]he\ninvalidity, violation, abandonment or waiver of any one or more of or any part of the Restrictions shall in no wise affect or\nimpair the remaining Restrictions or parts therof which shall remain in full force and effect.” Therefore, we will not consider the\nalleged waiver of deed restrictions other than side setback violations in our analysis of the setback restriction. See Tanglewood\nHomes Ass'n v. Henke, 728 S.W.2d 39, 41–42 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Thus, the only support\nfor Rutherford's waiver argument is the evidence of one other setback violation in Section 6.\n\nIn Tanglewood, the court was faced with five violations of a certain deed restriction which the appellees, in violation of that\nrestriction, argued was abandoned. The court adverted to this court's analysis of the issue of waiver of deed restrictions in *852\nNew Jerusalem Baptist Church, 598 S.W.2d at 669. This court in New Jerusalem stated that to establish the affirmative defense\nof waiver in a deed restriction case, the non-conforming user must prove that the violations then existing are so great as to lead\nthe average man to conclude the restriction in question had been abandoned and its enforcement waived. See id. Among the\nfactors to be considered by the average man are the number, nature, and severity of the then existing violations, any prior acts\nof enforcement, and whether it is still possible to realize the benefits intended through the covenant. See id.\n\n [11] In New Jerusalem this court held that four non-conforming uses within the subdivision did not constitute abandonment\nof the restrictions. See id. Similarly, in Tanglewood, the court held that five violations of the main residence restriction were\ninsufficient in number, nature and severity to constitute a waiver of the restrictive covenant's benefits. See Tanglewood, 728\nS.W.2d at 44. Here, because Rutherford points to only one violation of the side setback restriction, we hold that one violation is\nnot so great as to lead the mind of the average man to reasonably conclude that the restriction in question had been abandoned\nand its enforcement waived. See New Jerusalem, 598 S.W.2d at 669.\n\n\nB. Estoppel\nEstoppel has been defined as follows:\n\n             the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in\n             equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract,\n             or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been\n             led thereby to change his position for the worse, and who on his part acquires some corresponding right,\n             either of property, of contract, or of remedy.\n\n\n [12] Finkelstein, 675 S.W.2d at 278. Estoppel does not apply in this case primarily because Rutherford presented no evidence\nthat he changed his position regarding the setback violations on Lot 7 based on Terramar's conduct.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              8\n\fJim Rutherford Investments, Inc. v. Terramar Beach..., 25 S.W.3d 845 (2000)\n\n\n\n\nAt the meeting, Rutherford announced he intended to begin construction on Lot 7 in two days. His plans demonstrated a violation\nof the setback restriction at the time of the meeting and at all times thereafter. Thus, Rutherford cannot demonstrate he changed\nposition in reliance on Terramar's actions when his position, the violation of the setback restrictions, never changed. Having\nfailed to present more than a scintilla of probative evidence as to each element of estoppel, Rutherford may not rely on this\naffirmative defense. We now address Rutherford's final defense, laches.\n\n\nC. Laches\n [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Laches, like waiver and estoppel, is an affirmative defense, 4 which Rutherford had the\nburden to prove. See Caldwell v. Barnes, 975 S.W.2d 535, 538 (Tex.1998); see also City of Houston v. Muse, 788 S.W.2d 419,\n422 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ). The two elements of laches are: (1) an unreasonable delay in asserting a\nlegal or equitable right; and (2) a good faith change of position by Rutherford to his detriment in reliance upon the delay. See\nMuse, 788 S.W.2d at 422. When a party takes no steps to enforce its known rights until the other party has, in good faith, so\nchanged its position that it cannot be restored to its former state, the delay becomes inequitable and may estop the assertion of\nthe right. See Id., see also Culver v. Pickens, 142 Tex. 87, 91, 176 S.W.2d 167, 170–71 (1943). As a general rule, laches does not\nbar a plaintiff's suit before the statute of limitations has run unless estoppel or “extraordinary circumstances” are present. See\nGreen v. Parrack, 974 S.W.2d 200, 204 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1998, no pet.). *853 Moreover, laches does not apply where\nthe defendant has acted in open and known hostility to a plaintiff's rights and has not been misled by the plaintiff's apparent\nacquiescence. See Muse, 788 S.W.2d at 423.\n\nHere, there are no extraordinary circumstances, and as previously discussed, no estoppel is present. Rutherford began\nconstruction on Lot 7, without the requisite approval, on January 12, 1998. Terramar's legal counsel wrote him a letter discussing\nhis compliance with the setback restriction on February 5, 1998. When Rutherford refused to halt construction or comply with\nthe restriction, Terramar filed suit on February 18, 1998. Therefore, Terramar did not unreasonably delay in asserting its legal\nright to enforce the restrictions. Thus, Rutherford has not met his burden of bringing forth more than a scintilla of probative\nevidence as to both elements of laches. Because Rutherford failed to adequately support each element of his affirmative defenses,\nthe trial court correctly granted Terramar's no-evidence summary judgment. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the trial\ncourt's judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                                V.\n\n\n                                                        Attorney's Fees\n\n [19] [20] Finally, Terramar cross-appeals the trial court's denial of attorney's fees. Terramar appeals this portion of the trial\ncourt's order asserting that reasonable attorney's fees are mandated by the property code for the prevailing party in an action\nto enforce deed restrictions. See TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 5.006(a) (Vernon 1984); see also Beere, 985 S.W.2d at 249. We\nagree with Terramar, inasmuch as the issue of whether attorney's fees are authorized in a particular case is a question of law\nto be determined by the court. See id. However, the determination of the amount to be awarded as reasonable attorney's fees is\na question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. See id. Here, the trial court should have awarded reasonable attorney's\nfees. Therefore, the trial court erred by refusing to award attorney's fees to Terramar, the prevailing party. However, the award,\nif any, must be supported by competent evidence. See id. Although Terramar claims attorney's fees in the amount of $25,000 at\nthe trial level, $10,000 at the intermediate appellate level, and $7,500 if the case is appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, section\n5.006 only authorizes the award of reasonable attorney's fees. That statute also provides the trial court with four factors to\nconsider in its determination of reasonable attorney's fees. 5 Terramar submitted evidence of all factors for the court to consider\nexcept evidence relating to the time and labor factors. Because the amount of fees is a fact question, we remand this case to\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Terramar Beach..., 25 S.W.3d 845 (2000)\n\n\nthe trial court to award Terramar reasonable attorney's fees, based on the factors outlined in section 5.006(b) of the Property\nCode. Accordingly, we sustain Terramar's cross-point on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                                    VI.\n\n\n                                                               Conclusion\n\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment permanently enjoining Rutherford from violating Terramar Beach's deed restrictions in the\nfuture. We likewise affirm the trial court's grant of Terramar's motion for a no-evidence summary judgment as to Rutherford's\naffirmative defenses of waiver, estoppel, and laches. However, we reverse the trial court's denial of attorney fees for Terramar,\nthe prevailing party in this suit to enforce deed restrictions, and remand this case to the trial court for *854 further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n25 S.W.3d 845\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      Rutherford also raised the affirmative defense of fraud at trial. However because he has not challenged the summary judgment's\n       denial of that claim on appeal, we do not reach the issue of whether he brought forth more than a scintilla of evidence on each element\n       of fraud so as to defeat Terramar's no evidence summary judgment on Rutherford's affirmative defenses.\n2      Arguably, Rutherford was on notice seven days after the meeting that the approval restriction was still in force because his foreman,\n       Sherman Eagleton, signed and returned the “Important Notice to All Terramar Property Owners and Builders Requirements to\n       Build.” This document was submitted with the application fee to the Association. The Notice states: (1) that two complete plans with\n       specifications “shall” be furnished to the Architectural Control Committee; (2) that the plans are subject to approval by the Committee;\n       (3) that violation of these requirements “shall be sufficient cause for legal process against owner, builder, and contractor;” (4) that\n       plan approval is required fifteen days prior to start of construction, and (5) that the Architectural Chairman “shall have the owner\n       to halt construction if requirements are not met.” Rutherford admitted Eagleton, as his agent, had authority to sign this agreement\n       and bind him.\n3      In support of his waiver argument, Rutherford submitted the affidavit of David Watson. Watson noted numerous deed restriction\n       violations in Sections 3, 4, 6, and the Marina, but only one setback violation in Section 6.\n4      See TEX.R. CIV. P. 94.\n5      “To determine reasonable attorney's fees, the court shall consider:\n         (1) the time and labor required;\n         (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions;\n         (3) the expertise, reputation, and ability of the attorney; and\n         (4) any other factor.”\n         TEX.

The causes of action were as follows (1) a statutory cause of action under article 21.21,\nsection 16(a), of the Texas Insurance Code, for unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance; (2) a statutory\ncause of action under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Texas Business and Commerce Code, section 17.46(a), for\nfalse, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of commerce; 2 (3) a common law cause of action for Republic's\nbreach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing owed Morish; and (4) a common law cause of action for Republic's negligence\n *127 and gross negligence in failing to settle the Keightleys' claim within policy limits.\n\nIt is undisputed in the summary judgment record that Morish was not a party to the reinsurance contract between Republic\nand National County nor any other contract with Republic. The basis for Morish's claims is Republic's alleged conduct during\nOctober 1987—October 1988 in relation to the National County policy, as that conduct is set out in the summary judgment\nrecord: with the knowledge and consent of National County, Republic assigned a claims manager to manage the Morish\nclaim and other claims against National County insureds; dealt directly with National County's defense counsel; investigated,\nevaluated, negotiated, and settled such claims; employed independent insurance adjusters and lawyers in defending the claims\nand paid attendant litigation expenses; exercised settlement authority over the claims; and established and funded a bank account\nin National County's name. The summary judgment record includes the affidavit of John W. Berkel, an attorney engaged to\ndefend Morish against the Keightleys' claim. Berkel swore that Republic “took over the duties and responsibilities with regard\nto settlement authority and claims adjusting ... prior to the time National County went into receivership;” and, that Republic paid\nBerkel's fees and expenses directly and issued drafts against a National County bank account that were signed by a Republic\nemployee.\n\nRepublic moved for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) Morish had no claim against Republic on the reinsurance\ncontract because he was not a party to it; (2) in the absence of a contractual relationship between Republic and Morish, he had\n“no standing to assert any statutory or common law causes of action against Republic,” specifically “no standing to assert any\nclaim for common law bad faith claims handling, for any violation of the DTPA or for any violation of the Insurance Code;”\nand (3) “Republic had a reasonable basis for denying any obligation” to pay the Keightleys' claims against Morish because an\ninjunction issued in the receivership proceeding prohibited such payment.\n\nThe summary judgment ordered by the trial court does not specify the ground or grounds upon which the court rendered\njudgment as a matter of law. We must therefore examine the summary judgment record, in relation to each of the causes of\naction pleaded, under the familiar rules applicable to such judgments on appeal. See Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Co.,\n690 S.W.2d 546, 548–49 (Tex.1985); Gibbs v. General Motors Corp., 450 S.W.2d 827, 828 (Tex.1970); Johnston v. American\nCometra, Inc., 837 S.W.2d 711, 714 (Tex.App.—Austin 1992, writ denied).\n\nUnder point of error one, the parties join issue on whether the judgment below is erroneous with respect to Morish's four causes\nof action, which we shall discuss in order.\n\n\n\n                                             STATUTORY CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nArticle 21.21, section 16(a), of the Insurance Code creates and authorizes a statutory cause of action in the following terms:\n\n             Any person who has sustained actual damages caused by another's engaging in an act or practice declared\n             in Section 4 of this Article to be ... unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance or in\n             any practice specifically enumerated in a subdivision of Section 17.46(b), Business & Commerce Code,\n             as an unlawful deceptive trade practice may maintain an action against the person or persons engaging\n             in such acts or practices.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 946 S.W.2d 124 (1997)\n\n\n\n\nTex.Ins.Code Ann. art. 21.21, § 16(a) (West Supp.1997) (emphasis added). Morish alleged causes of action against Republic for\n“unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance” and for a “practice specifically enumerated in a subdivision\nof Section 17.46(b)” of the Business and Commerce Code, a part of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\n [3] We conclude Republic was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law respecting Morish's cause of action for “unfair or\ndeceptive practices in the business of insurance.” Article 21.21, section 16(a), states the requisite elements for the statutory\ncause of action: (1) actual damages (2) sustained by any person and (3) caused by another's engaging *128 in an act or practice\n(4) declared unfair or deceptive in section 4 of the article. Privity of contract is not a stated element. Instead, the statute explicitly\ndefines standing in terms of any person sustaining actual damages caused by another's engaging in an unfair or deceptive act\nor practice described in article 21.21. The statutory elements are exclusive; we may not add to them the element of contractual\nprivity. See Mingus v. Wadley, 115 Tex. 551, 285 S.W. 1084, 1087 (1926). We hold erroneous and reverse this part of the\njudgment below. We sustain point of error one in that respect. 3\n\n [4] We believe Republic was entitled to judgment as a matter of law respecting Morish's cause of action based upon an alleged\nviolation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act as that statute is incorporated in article 21.21, section 16(a), of the Texas Insurance\nCode. The statutory cause of action is available only to “consumers,” a word defined as a person who acquires goods or services\n“by purchase or lease.” See Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(4) (West Supp.1997); Transport Ins. Co. v. Faircloth, 898\nS.W.2d 269, 274 (Tex.1995). Morish did not purchase or lease goods or services from Republic. May “consumer” status be\nimputed to him nevertheless because of his “relationship” to the reinsurance contract between Republic and National County?\nSee Melody Home Mfg. Co. v. Barnes, 741 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex.1987). We believe not. The reported decisions establish that\nthe qualifying “relationship” is one of intended beneficiary under a contract between others. 4 That is to say, the circumstances\nmust justify a conclusion that the contracting parties intended that the stranger have the use and benefit of the goods or services\nfurnished under the contract. See, e.g., Kitchener v. T.C. Trailers, Inc., 715 F.Supp. 798 (S.D.Tex.1988); see also Brandon\nv. American Sterilizer Co., 880 S.W.2d 488, 492 (Tex.App.—Austin 1994, no writ); Lara v. Lile, 828 S.W.2d 536, 541–42\n(Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1992, writ denied); Rodriguez v. Ed Hicks, 767 S.W.2d 187, 191 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1989,\nno writ). The reinsurance contract between Republic and National County is included in the summary judgment record. We\nfind in its terms nothing to indicate that Morish was an intended beneficiary. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not\nerr in its summary judgment respecting Morish's statutory cause of action based upon the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. We\noverrule in this respect point of error one.\n\n\n\n                                            COMMON LAW CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n [5] [6] We conclude the trial court did not err in awarding Republic judgment as a matter of law on Morish's cause of action\nfor breach of a common law duty of good faith and fair dealing. Absent privity of contract, the duty does not arise. Natividad v.\nAlexsis, Inc., 875 S.W.2d 695, 697–98 (Tex.1994). We overrule point of error one in this respect and turn to Morish's claimed\ncauses of action for negligence.\n\n [7] Morish alleged that Republic breached a duty of ordinary care in the settlement *129 of the Keightley's claims. That is,\nof course, a duty that an insurer owes an insured—a duty imputed to their insurance contract. See G.A. Stowers Furniture Co. v.\nAmerican Indem. Co., 15 S.W.2d 544, 547 (Tex.Comm'n App.1929, holding approved). Morish was not an insured under any\ncontract to which Republic was also a party as an insurer. Morish, therefore, cannot have a Stowers claim against Republic.\n\n [8] [9] There is, however, a more general rule made applicable to the case by the pleadings and the remainder of the summary\njudgment record: the law places a duty of ordinary care upon any person who voluntarily enters upon an affirmative course of\naction affecting another's interest. Otis Eng'g Corp. v. Clark, 668 S.W.2d 307, 309 (Tex.1983); Colonial Savings Ass'n v. Taylor,\n544 S.W.2d 116, 120 (Tex.1976); State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Gandy, 880 S.W.2d 129, 136 (Tex.App.—Texarkana\n1994, no writ), reversed on other grounds 925 S.W.2d 696 (Tex.1996). Morish's pleadings alleged and the summary judgment\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                   5\n\fKeightley v. Republic Ins. Co., 946 S.W.2d 124 (1997)\n\n\nrecord substantiated prima facie that Republic affirmatively undertook a particular course of action, not required by law or\ncontract, that affected Morish's interests. If the allegations are ultimately established, Republic voluntarily assumed a legal duty\nto act in such matters with ordinary care. Nothing in the summary judgment record defeats as a matter of law Morish's cause\nof action for negligence in that regard. We hold Republic was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law respecting Morish's\ncauses of action based upon allegations of negligence and gross negligence; and we sustain in this respect point of error one.\n\nIn its motion for rehearing, Republic argues against our holding on a theory that Morish's sole cause of action for negligence is\na Stowers claim—a claim we have stated Morish does not have because he was not Republic's insured. In support of Republic's\ntheory, it cites Maryland Ins. Co. v. Head Indus. Coatings & Servs., Inc., 938 S.W.2d 27 (Tex.1997). Head does not suggest\nthe theory Republic imputes to the decision. Head hold that an insured is adequately protected against his liability insurer's\nmishandling of a claim against the insured by the duties imposed upon the insurer in the insurance contract, augmented by\nthe Stowers doctrine; consequently it is unnecessary to impose upon the insurer an additional common law duty of good faith\nand fair dealing in handling such a claim. Head, 938 S.W.2d at 28–29. Both Head and Stowers deal with common law duties\narising expressly or by implication from the contract relationship of insurer and insured. See G.A. Stowers Furniture Co. v.\nAmerican Indem. Co., 15 S.W.2d 544, 547 (Tex.Comm'n App.1929). Our holding, in contrast, does not derive from such a\nrelationship. Our holding derives instead from the relationship created when one undertakes, gratuitously or for his own benefit,\nan affirmative course of action that affects the interest of another. Upon that relationship, the supreme court in Otis Engineering\nand Colonial Savings has fixed a duty in the actor to conduct his undertaking with ordinary care. We adhere to our holding that\nthe summary judgment record does not defeat, as a matter of law, the Keightley's cause of action based on such a duty.\n\n\n\n                                          REPUBLIC'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n [10] Republic contended in its motion for summary judgment that it could not pay the Keightleys' claims against Morish\nbecause Republic was legally required by the injunction order, issued in the receivership proceeding, to pay the receiver any\nsums owed by Republic under the reinsurance contract. Presumably, the defense referred to all the actions pleaded against\nRepublic. The pleadings disclose, however, that the Keightleys did not allege a cause of action to recover sums owed under\nRepublic's reinsurance contract. Instead, they sued on Morish's causes of action for consequential damages allegedly caused by\nRepublic's wrongful conduct in relation to Morish's insurance contract with National County; moreover, they alleged that such\nconduct occurred before the receivership proceeding began and before the injunction was issued. We hold Republic was not\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law, on its affirmative defense, as to Morish's common law causes of action for negligence\n *130 or gross negligence and his statutory cause of action under article 21.21, section 16(a), of the Texas Insurance Code, for\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance. We need not discuss Republic's affirmative defense in relation\nto Morish's other causes of action because we have rejected them on other grounds stated previously.\n\n\n\n                     INSUFFICIENCY OF REPUBLIC'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\nIn point of error two, the Keightleys complain that Republic's motion for summary judgment did not attack their “causes of\naction” for negligence, gross negligence, waiver, and estoppel as set out in their petition. We have previously discussed the\ncauses of action for negligence and gross negligence and need not refer to them again.\n\n [11] [12] “Waiver” and “estoppel” are not causes of action because they cannot create liability in and of themselves. See\nHruska v. First State Bank of Deanville, 747 S.W.2d 783, 785 (Tex.1988). The Keightleys did not, in their response to Republic's\nmotion for summary judgment, raise waiver and estoppel in opposition to Republic's contention that it was entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. For that reason they may not, on appeal, claim error based alone upon their pleading of waiver and estoppel.\nId. We hold accordingly and overrule point of error two.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We sever and remand to the trial court those causes of\naction for proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion. We affirm the remainder of the trial court judgment.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n946 S.W.2d 124\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      In its motion for rehearing Republic challenges for the first time in the cause the validity of the assignment, contending the supreme\n        court recently held that such assignments are void. See State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Gandy, 925 S.W.2d 696, 720 (Tex.1996).\n        An assignment of error raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing in the Court of Appeals is too late to be considered, unless\n        the error can be classified as fundamental. Lone Star Gas Co. v. Sheaner, 157 Tex. 508, 305 S.W.2d 150, 153 (1959); Washington\n        v. Walker County, 708 S.W.2d 493, 497 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1986, writ ref'd n.r.e.); Gillen v. Diadrill 624 S.W.2d 259,\n        264 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1981, writ dism'd). We may assume the error assigned is not fundamental because the holding in\n        Gandy specifically limited its retroactive effect to invalidate only those assignments to which an objection has been preserved. State\n        Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Gandy, 925 S.W.2d 696, 720 (Tex.1996). We, therefore, overrule Republic's new assignments of\n        error relating to the validity of the assignment.\n2       Section 17.46(a) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act is incorporated in article 21.21, section 16(a) of the Texas Insurance\n        Code.\n3       In its motion for rehearing, Republic contends that because article 1.14–1 § 2(b)(2) statutorily exempts the “lawful transaction of\n        reinsurance” from the definition of “business of insurance” we cannot hold Republic liable under article 21.21. See Tex.Ins.Code\n        Ann. art. 1.14–1 § 2(b)(2) (West Supp.1997). We do not find this argument persuasive. The supreme court recently analyzed this\n        provision and found that article 1.14–1(2) was enacted after article 21.21 and was not intended to alter the scope of the term “business\n        of insurance” as it was used in article 21.21. Great American Ins. Co. v. North Austin Mun. Utility District No. 1, 908 S.W.2d 415,\n        420–423 (Tex.1995). Article 1.14–1 § 2(a) does not evidence the legislature's intention to promulgate a uniform definition of acts\n        which constitute doing an insurance business; rather, they indicate concern that particular parties may escape the jurisdiction of the\n        State Board of Insurance. Id. Republic undertook to investigate, adjust, settle, and defend claims against Morish. We believe these\n        actions are encompassed by the term “business of insurance” as used in article 21.21.\n4       See, e.g., Birchfield v.

Appellees are ten women's clinics and several doctors\nwho sometimes perform abortions. Based upon the jury's findings that appellants were liable for civil conspiracy, tortious\ninterference, invasion of privacy and property rights, the judgment awarded actual and punitive damages to appellee Planned\nParenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, Inc. (“Planned Parenthood”). Appellants, Philip “Flip” Benham and Bob Jewitt,\nare referred to as “B/J,” and appellants, Operation Rescue–National, Rescue America, Dallas Rescue, Don Treshman and Keith\nTucci, are collectively referred to as “OR.” In separate briefs, B/J raise thirty-seven points of error and OR raise fifty-four\npoints, for a total of ninety-one points of error, many of which overlap. Both groups contend the permanent injunction violates\nboth the Texas and United States Constitutions. They also attack the sufficiency of the evidence to substantiate the trial court's\nfindings supporting the injunctive relief. They complain of errors in the jury instructions, in the composition of the jury, in the\namended and corrected judgments, and in the assessment of costs. In addition, OR challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the actual and punitive damages imposed against them. 1 We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                          Background\n\nAppellants sought to interfere with the activities of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics in August 1992 during\nthe Republican National Convention in Houston. *68 Don Treshman, the National Director of appellant Rescue America,\nannounced a plan for a concerted, large-scale assault on Houston abortion providers. Treshman met with leaders of Operation\nRescue–National before the GOP Convention. The groups agreed to jointly exert pressure on Planned Parenthood and other\nclinics to force them to close during the Convention. The primary tactic was conducting or sponsoring “rescues” which are\nblockades of clinics. In addition, Operation Rescue planned to promote residential pickets of physicians who worked at the\nclinics, and Rescue America was to coordinate information on these pickets. Pat Mahoney, a spokesman for Operation Rescue–\nNational, acknowledged that the two groups had a common purpose and plan and were “all working toward a common goal.”\nAppellants also announced their plan at a press conference.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n\n\nIn response, appellees and others filed suit and obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing appellants from coming\nwithin a 100–foot “buffer zone” of appellees' clinics and homes. Appellants Tucci, Benham and Jewitt, along with others who\nare not parties to this appeal, intentionally violated that part of the TRO barring demonstrations within the 100–foot zone around\nthe clinics' entrances and exits, and they were jailed. All sought habeas relief, which the Texas Supreme Court granted. The\nsupreme court held that the TRO imposing a 100–foot speech-free zone around the clinics' entrances and exits violated the\nprotestors' constitutional right to freedom of expression because there was no showing the zone was the “least restrictive” means\nof protecting the clinics from harm. Ex parte Tucci, 859 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tex.1993) (plurality opinion).\n\nAppellees then amended their pleadings, sought a permanent injunction, and Planned Parenthood later asked for actual and\npunitive damages. Following a six-week jury trial and a two-day evidentiary hearing on the particulars of the proposed injunctive\nrelief, Judge Eileen O'Neill of the 190th District Court signed a Judgment and Permanent Injunction on December 5, 1994. The\njudgment awarded the following damages to Planned Parenthood, plus pre- and post-judgment interest:\n\n  $204,585 in actual damages from Operation Rescue–National, Rescue America, Don Treshman, and Keith Tucci, jointly and\n  severally; plus punitive damages as follows: $350,000 from Operation Rescue–National; $355,000 from Rescue America;\n  $155,000 from Don Treshman; and $150,000 from Keith Tucci, for a total of $1,010,000 in punitive damages.\n\nThe judgment permanently enjoined and restrained appellants from interfering with the clinics, harassing the physicians and\ntheir family members, and demonstrating within a specific zone as to each clinic and doctor's residence. These zones range from\nfifteen feet to thirty-two feet around the entrances to the clinics and are outlined on maps attached to the injunctive order. The\ndemonstration-free zones also extend thirteen feet from the property line in front of each physician's residence. The judgment\nincorporates the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the injunctive relief.\n\nAfter entry of the judgment, the cause was transferred to the 333rd District Court, where Judge Richard Bianchi signed an\nAmended Judgment and Permanent Injunction on February 1, 1995, to correct two errors in the judgment. Subsequently, on\nJune 15, 1995, the same court entered a Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc and Permanent Injunction to include the attachment of exhibits\ninadvertently omitted from the Amended Judgment. This appeal resulted.\n\n\n\n                                                         Jury Composition\n\n [2] In their points forty-six and forty-seven, OR contend the trial court erred in refusing to strike certain jurors for cause,\nrequiring them to use all of their peremptory challenges and accept jurors they found objectionable. B/J raise the same complaints\nin their points twenty-nine and thirty.\n\n [3] To preserve error in the trial court's failure to strike objectionable jurors, the complaining party must timely bring its\ncomplaint to the trial court's attention before making its peremptory challenges. *69 Hallett v. Houston Northwest Medical\nCenter, 689 S.W.2d 888, 889–90 (Tex.1985). The objecting party must specifically inform the trial court which objectionable\njurors will remain after all peremptory strikes are made, and this notice must be given before the actual exercise of the strikes.\nId; see also Beavers v. Northrop Worldwide Aircraft Services, Inc., 821 S.W.2d 669, 673 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1991, writ\ndenied); Carpenter v. Wyatt Constr. Co., 501 S.W.2d 748, 750–51 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1973, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nIn this case, after the trial court excused several potential jurors for cause, the court overruled appellants' challenges for cause as\nto twenty-one additional venire members. The parties then made their peremptory strikes. Appellants did not object to the trial\ncourt's denial of their challenges for cause until after all parties had exercised their peremptory strikes and the jury was about to\nbe sworn. They argued that two jurors about to be impaneled were objectionable and would have been challenged peremptorily\nif they could have done so. They then listed seven jurors on whom they would have used a peremptory strike, but they failed\nto fully articulate their objection and obtain a ruling. In addition, appellants did not seek additional peremptory challenges. By\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

To find a civil conspiracy, you must find the following:\n\n  1. a combination of two or more persons,\n\n  2. who agree or have a meeting of the minds on a common purpose or course of action,\n\n  3. who have knowledge of the purpose or course of action, and\n\n  4. at least one of such persons commits at least one act to further the conspiracy.\n\n  “Unlawful” means violative of either criminal or civil law.\n\n [4] The trial court has broad discretion in submitting explanatory instructions and definitions. Wisenbarger v. Gonzales Warm\nSprings Rehab. Hosp., Inc., 789 S.W.2d 688, 692 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied). Instructions and definitions\nare proper when they are raised by the written pleadings, supported by the evidence, and they aid the jury in answering the\nquestions in the charge. TEX.R. CIV. P. 277, 278.\n\n [5] [6] To preserve error in the jury charge, a party must make the trial court aware of the complaint, timely and plainly, and\nobtain a ruling. State Dept. of Highways v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 241 (Tex.1992); TEX.R. CIV. P. 274. A party is required\nto object when the court submits an erroneous question, instruction or definition. TEX.R. CIV. P. 274; see, e.g., Spencer v.\nEagle Star Ins. Co., 876 S.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex.1994). Objections must be made before the charge is read to the jury. Missouri\nPac. R.R. Co. v. Cross, 501 S.W.2d 868, 873 (Tex.1973); TEX.R. CIV. P. 272. If a submitted instruction is erroneous, it does\nnot matter which party has the burden of proof. Religious of the Sacred Heart v. City of Houston, 836 S.W.2d 606, 613–14\n(Tex.1992). A written request is required only when a question, instruction or definition is omitted. TEX.R. CIV. P. 278.\n\n [7] Appellants contend the trial court's instruction on conspiracy is erroneous because it does not include a requirement that\nthe acts to further the conspiracy be “overt” and “unlawful.” In addition, they contend the instruction is fatally flawed because\nit failed to include a requirement that there be damages proximately resulting from the conspiracy.\n\n [8] We reject appellees' contention that appellants failed to properly preserve all of its complaints about the charge. At the\ncharge conference, appellants objected that *70 the instruction did not require an “unlawful overt act” and that there was no\nelement of damages included in the cause of action. The attorney representing Benham and Jewitt objected to the definition in\nInstruction No. 2, and tendered another definition, which was refused. The parties stipulated at trial that objections made by\none defendant were applicable to the others. Appellees contend Rescue America and Treshman have waived any complaint as\nto the conspiracy definition because their attorney did not receive a ruling. However, when an objection is made and the court\nmade no change in the charge, it is presumed that the objection was properly and timely presented and that the objection was\noverruled. Acord v. General Motors Corp., 669 S.W.2d 111, 114 (Tex.1984); TEX.R. CIV. P. 272. In addition, appellants were\nonly required to object to an erroneous instruction to preserve error; they were not required to submit a substantially correct\ninstruction. Therefore, the fact that appellants' tendered question also omitted the term “unlawful” is not fatal to preservation\nof their challenge on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In these points, appellants complain that the defective definition of conspiracy infected the jury's answers\non liability and damages in Question Nos. 1 through 4 and 6 through 10. No objections were made by any defendant to these\nquestions because of the allegedly erroneous conspiracy definition. A party cannot enlarge on appeal an objection made in the\ntrial court. Conner v. Bean, 630 S.W.2d 697, 701 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.). An objection on appeal\nthat is not the same as that urged at trial presents nothing for review. Holland v. Hayden, 901 S.W.2d 763, 765 (Tex.App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1995, writ denied). Nor can a party raise a new objection for the first time on appeal. See TEX.R.APP. P.\n52(a); TEX.R. CIV. P. 274. We overrule OR's points three through seven and B/J's points six and seven.\n\n [12] First, as to the alleged failure to include a damages element in Instruction No. 2, we note that Question No. 3 asked: “Did\nany of the Plaintiff Clinics, Plaintiff Physicians, or Intervenors suffer injury, harm, or damages that were proximately caused\nby the conspiracy?” Question No. 3 was predicated on an affirmative answer to the liability questions on conspiracy to interfere\nwith the business, privacy or property rights of appellees. Rule 277 expressly permits predication of damage questions on\naffirmative findings on liability. TEX.R. CIV. P. 277. We hold that the trial court did not err in submitting damages separately.\n\n [13] The Texas Supreme Court has repeatedly defined a civil conspiracy as “a combination by two or more persons to\naccomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means.” Firestone Steel Products Co. v. Barajas,\n927 S.W.2d 608, 614 (Tex.1996); Triplex Communications, Inc. v. Riley, 900 S.W.2d 716, 719 (Tex.1995); Massey v. Armco\nSteel Co., 652 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex.1983). The definition in this case is identical. The elements of the cause of action must be\ntaken in the context of this basic definition stating that the object to be accomplished, or the means by which it is accomplished, is\nunlawful. Triplex Communications, 900 S.W.2d at 720; Massey, 652 S.W.2d at 934. The “gist of a civil conspiracy” is the injury\nthat is intended to be caused. Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp. v. Nortex Oil & Gas Corp., 435 S.W.2d 854, 856 (Tex.1968).\n\n [14] In Massey, the Supreme Court listed the essential elements of civil conspiracy as: (1) two or more persons; (2) an object\nto be accomplished; (3) a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful, overt acts; and (5)\ndamages as the proximate result. Massey, 652 S.W.2d at 934. The instruction in this case is substantially the same, except that\nit requires the jury to find “at least one act to further the conspiracy.” When the elements submitted in this case are considered\nin the context of the basic conspiracy definition, we find no error in this slight deviation from the Massey elements. According\nto the court's instruction in this case, the jury was required to find an act furthering appellants' “unlawful *71 purpose,” or an\nact forming the “unlawful means” of accomplishing their conspiracy.\n\n [15] In addition, while not every act of protest described at trial was illegal, it was uncontroverted that one or more of appellants'\nactions were unlawful. The charge defined “unlawful” as “violative of either criminal or civil law.” Appellants admitted many\nof their actions, at the very least, violated appellees' common law rights as well as the initial injunctive order. There is also no\ndispute that the actions at issue in this case were “overt.” It was therefore established that some appellants committed overt,\nunlawful acts, and the only disputed issue was whether these acts were part of a conspiracy so that each co-conspirator is\nresponsible for all acts done by any of the conspirators. See Carroll v. Timmers Chevrolet, Inc., 592 S.W.2d 922, 926 (Tex.1979).\nSince only the disputed issues must be submitted, the trial court was not required to submit the element of an “overt, unlawful”\nact. See T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank of El Paso, 847 S.W.2d 218, 223 (Tex.1992) (holding that only disputed issues must be\nsubmitted to the jury); Employers Cas. Co. v. Block, 744 S.W.2d 940, 944 (Tex.1988) (same); Kiel v. Brinkman, 668 S.W.2d\n926, 929 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ) (holding that the trial court did not err in submitting only one of\nthree required elements when the other two were not disputed). We hold that the court's instruction, together with the damages\nquestions, sufficiently encompassed the elements of conspiracy in this case.\n\n [16] [17] When error in the charge is found, we must review the pleadings, evidence, and the entire charge to determine\nif the error is harmful. Island Recreational Dev. Corp. v. Republic of Texas Sav. Ass'n, 710 S.W.2d 551, 555 (Tex.1986). To\nreverse based on error in the charge, appellants must establish that the error amounted to such a denial of their rights as was\nreasonably calculated to cause and probably did cause rendition of an improper judgment. TEX.R.APP. P. 81(b)(1). Here, the\nevidence supporting conspiracy to commit illegal acts, as well as the commission of illegal acts, was overwhelming. 2 Based\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\non the testimony of the appellants and their admitted, illegal overt acts, the jury found appellants tortiously interfered with the\nclinics' business and violated the physicians' privacy rights. Therefore, even if we were to find that the trial court erred in its\ninstruction on the conspiracy definition, we would find the error to be harmless.\n\nIn conclusion, we find no reversible error in the court's charge on conspiracy. B/J's points of error four and five and OR's points\none and two are overruled.\n\n [18] [19] Appellants also complain about the omission of a question or instruction on imminent harm relating to the injunctive\nrelief in B/J point of error twenty-eight and OR point forty-five. The Texas Supreme Court has determined that the question\nof imminent harm is not a proper issue to submit to the jury, but instead is a question for the court to decide as a court of\nequity. State v. Texas Pet Foods, 591 S.W.2d 800, 804 (Tex.1979). Although a litigant has a right to trial by jury in an equitable\naction, only ultimate issues of fact are submitted for the jury's determination. Id. We overrule B/J point of error twenty-eight\nand OR point forty-five.\n\n\n\n                                                        Injunctive Relief\n\n [20] To be entitled to permanent injunctive relief, the plaintiffs must plead and prove a valid cause of action against the\ndefendants. See Valenzuela v. Aquino, 853 S.W.2d 512, 513 (Tex.1993) (holding that because Texas has no cause of action for\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress, the trial court improperly entered a permanent injunction *72 enjoining residential\npicketing). The plaintiffs must show that harm is imminent. Henderson v. KRTS, Inc., 822 S.W.2d 769, 773 (Tex.App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 1992, no writ). They must also establish that this imminent harm will be irreparable if the injunction is not issued.\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mustang Tractor & Equip. Co., 812 S.W.2d 663, 666 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, no writ).\n\nAppellants present a two-pronged attack on the injunctive relief granted by the trial court. First, we address their contention\nthat the evidence is insufficient to support the injunctive relief granted by the trial court. Secondly, we consider appellants'\ncontention that the permanent injunction violates both the United States and Texas Constitutions.\n\n\n\n                                                 A. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n [21] Appellants attack the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the injunctive relief and the trial court's findings and\nconclusions. In response, appellees first assert that appellants have waived every factual sufficiency point of error, and any\nobjection that damages were excessive, by failing to bring a separate point of error complaining of the trial court's overruling\nof their motion for new trial. To preserve error on factual sufficiency complaints, a party must include an objection in a motion\nfor new trial. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 324(b)(2), (b)(4); Luna v. Southern Pacific Transp. Co., 724 S.W.2d 383, 384 (Tex.1987).\nAppellees argue that appellants must complain of the overruling of a motion for new trial by point of error when the objection,\nsuch as an objection to the factual sufficiency of the evidence, is made for the first time in the motion for new trial. Appellees\ncite no case authority directly on point, relying only on O'Connor's Texas Rules * Civil Appeals (1993). We find no other\nauthority requiring such a strict interpretation of the briefing rules. We hold the filing of a motion for new trial, raising specific\npoints in the motion as to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's answers, as appellants did in this case, is effective\nto preserve error for factual sufficiency points. A separate point of error complaining of the overruling of the motion for new\ntrial is duplicitous and unnecessary.\n\n [22] When a party attacks a finding concerning an issue upon which it did not have the burden of proof, it must demonstrate\nthat there is insufficient evidence to support the adverse finding. See Hickey v. Couchman, 797 S.W.2d 103, 109–10 (Tex.App.\n—Corpus Christi 1990, writ denied). The test is whether, after examining all the evidence, the evidence supporting the finding\nis so slight, or the evidence against it so strong, that the finding is manifestly unjust and clearly wrong. Plas–Tex, Inc. v. U.S.\nSteel Corp., 772 S.W.2d 442, 445 (Tex.1989); Garza v. Alviar, 395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.1965).\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n\n\n [23] [24] The trial court's findings of fact have the same force and dignity as a jury's verdict upon jury questions and are\nreviewable for sufficiency of the evidence by the same standards as are applied in reviewing the evidence supporting the jury's\nanswers. Zieben v. Platt, 786 S.W.2d 797, 799 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no writ); City of Clute v. City of Lake\nJackson, 559 S.W.2d 391, 395 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Although the court's conclusions\nof law may not be challenged for factual insufficiency, the trial court's conclusions drawn from the facts may be reviewed to\ndetermine their correctness. Dallas County v. Sweitzer, 881 S.W.2d 757, 763 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1994, writ denied).\n\n [25] Any ultimate fact may be proven by circumstantial evidence. Transport Ins. Co. v. Faircloth, 898 S.W.2d 269, 285\n(Tex.1995). Because of its nature, proof of a conspiracy usually must be made by circumstantial evidence. King v. Acker, 725\nS.W.2d 750, 755 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ); Carr v. Hunt, 651 S.W.2d 875, 882 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1983,\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.). The jury was instructed in this case that:\n\n            A fact may be established by direct or by circumstantial evidence. A fact is established by direct evidence\n            when proved by documentary evidence or by [a] witness who saw the act done or the words spoken. A\n            fact is established by circumstantial evidence when it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other\n            facts proved.\n\n\n *73 [26] Appellants contend the evidence is insufficient to support the jury's finding that appellants conspired to violate,\nor actually violated, the doctors' privacy or property rights. They also argue the evidence is insufficient to support a finding\nof imminent harm to the doctors. In OR points of error eight through twenty-four, they assert the evidence is insufficient to\nshow that appellants will engage in the enjoined activity in the future or that there was imminent risk of harm as to physician\nappellees. B/J essentially make the same argument in points eight through twenty. In points twenty-five through thirty, OR\nchallenge each of the trial court's findings of fact supporting the permanent injunction. B/J's corresponding points are points\ntwenty-one through twenty-six. The court's findings as to the injunctive relief are as follows:\n\n  1. Defendants' conduct threatens access to plaintiff clinics by women seeking abortion and other medical services;\n\n  2. Defendants' conduct threatens the use and enjoyment of plaintiff clinics' and physicians' property rights;\n\n  3. Defendants' aggressive and harassing manner of protesting and sidewalk counseling of clinic patients increases the medical\n     risks attendant to the abortion procedure;\n\n  4. Defendants' targeted picketing of plaintiff physicians' homes threatens and interferes with plaintiff physicians' rights of\n     privacy;\n\n  5. Defendants have not abandoned their activities toward plaintiffs, but (1) remain committed to their particular protest tactics\n     and would use them again toward plaintiffs if the circumstance (such as a national media event in Houston) presented\n     itself; (2) have aided and abetted others in continuing to engage in conduct that is either tortious or in violation of plaintiffs'\n     constitutional rights; and (3) principle defendants, and those found by the jury to have acted with malice, are either locally\n     based (such as Rescue America and Don Treshman) or have recently increased their organizational presence in Texas\n     (Operation Rescue–National);\n\n  6. Despite existing injunctions imposing place and manner restrictions on defendants' protest activities targeting plaintiff\n     clinics, defendants (or those found by the jury to be acting in concert with them) have continued to engage in protest\n     activity toward some of the clinics using tactics that are harassing to patients and clinic staffs, that are violative of plaintiff\n     clinics' common law and constitutional rights, and that threaten safe, accessible abortions for women seeking medical\n     services at plaintiff clinics.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\nAppellants also attack the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's first conclusion of law in B/J point twenty-\nseven OR point thirty-one. They argue that because the findings are erroneous, the court's conclusion cannot stand because it\nis without a factual base. Conclusion of Law No. 1 states:\n\n            Absent injunctive relief, defendants are likely to continue to engage in the tortious conduct found by the\n            jury to be in violation of plaintiff clinics and physicians' common law and constitutional rights, and such\n            conduct is likely to cause plaintiff clinics and physicians irreparable harm.\n\n\nAppellants argue the evidence is insufficient to support the injunction because appellees called only three witnesses to testify at\nthe hearing on the injunctive relief, and these witnesses did not provide testimony relevant to the standard for determining the\nnecessity for and nature of constitutionally permissible injunctive relief. Our review of the record, however, reveals evidence of\nthe conspiracy to interfere with the business, property and privacy rights of appellees, which threatened imminent, irreparable\nharm.\n\nIn addition to the evidence adduced at the hearing on the injunction, ample evidence supporting the injunctive relief was provided\nat the jury trial. The record contains evidence of appellants' interference with business, privacy and property rights, which is\nrelevant to the harm element necessary for the permanent injunction. Appellees presented evidence that from early 1992 up to\n *74 and including the time of trial, appellants engaged in blockades and used aggressive “sidewalk counseling” by yelling,\nscreaming and following patients at the clinics. The jury saw numerous videotapes and photos of blockades at the clinics during\nthe Convention. At times during the Convention there were estimated to be a thousand people outside Planned Parenthood.\nJudy Reiner, Planned Parenthood's Deputy Director, Dr. Jerry Edwards, an appellee, and Larissa Lindsay, a clinic escort, all\ntestified they saw appellants and those operating at their direction attempting to or successfully impeding or preventing clinic\naccess. Reiner testified that it was obvious the protests were organized and that the large numbers of people were not appearing\nspontaneously. Reiner testified she saw Keith Tucci, the former national director of Operation Rescue, outside her clinic several\ntimes. Reiner testified the protesters were not peaceful, but instead attempted to block patients' access to the clinic. They got\nwithin inches of the patients' faces and often touched them. She told how “escorts” had to form a human circle around patients\nto get through the mobs to the entrance during large protests. She described the patients' and staff's attempts to gain access to\nthe clinics “like running a gauntlet.”\n\nReiner testified Planned Parenthood has had bomb threats, defacement of the building, thrown bottles and rocks, the locks glued\nshut, and two butyric acid attacks. She described an invasion at Planned Parenthood that occurred in 1989 or 1990 for which\nTreshman claimed credit. The protesters entered Planned Parenthood and chained their necks to cement blocks. Daniel Scott, a\nPlanned Parenthood employee, testified he fears being shot every time he leaves the building. Jesse Miller, a protester associated\nwith Rescue America, told Scott in March 1994, “This is the day you die, brother.” Reiner testified that Planned Parenthood\nand the other clinics and physicians took seriously the threats made by Tucci and Treshman and those who work under their\ndirection. She testified to the repairs made to the building and measures taken to safeguard the building, staff and patients.\n\nDon Treshman testified about the aggressive sidewalk counseling promoted by Rescue America and discussed rescues or\nblockades conducted at the plaintiff clinics. Although Treshman did not participate, his publication, Rescue America's Newsline,\nadvertised a picket at Dr. Kaminsky's house. Treshman invited Rev. Michael Bray, who advocated justifiable homicide of\nabortionists, to speak at a Rescue America conference in the summer of 1993. Treshman acknowledged that Rescue America\nwill use any methods it deems necessary to save unborn children. The jury saw the videotaped confession of Joshua Graff,\nadmitting he “interfered” with the operation of the West Loop Clinic by trying to blow it up. Treshman admitted that the\ntechnique Graff used to firebomb the West Loop Clinic was virtually identical to the one he described in detail on his hotline.\nTucci wrote to followers on Operation Rescue letterhead, “if you believe abortion is murder, act like it's murder.”\n\nMany of those engaged in protest activities, such as Tom Wieghard and Rusty Thomas, advertised themselves as members of\nOperation Rescue by wearing its T-shirts. Both told Reiner they acted on behalf of Operation Rescue. Thomas was shown on a\nvideo shouting “Murderer” at a protest. John Moloney, described as a Rescue America operative, testified that the common goal\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\nof those he worked with was to end abortion by preventing women from going inside the clinics and by preventing physicians\nfrom performing abortions. Moloney was seen at clinic protests hundreds of times and also conducted many residential pickets.\nAt these protests, Moloney was seen directing Daniel Ware, who was later arrested on weapons charges for carrying prohibited\nfirearms in his car.\n\nThe physicians testified that appellants' actions negatively affected their patients' mental and physical health and made medical\nprocedures more risky. In addition, they testified about the protests at their homes. Dr. Jerry Edwards testified his home had been\npicketed twelve or fifteen times, the picketing continued after the Republican Convention up to “last weekend.” He testified that\nprotesters bring signs, come into his *75 yard, play loud music, yell and make threats. Photographs were admitted showing the\nprotesters at his residence. He testified he and his young daughter received death threats. He testified he did not feel comfortable\nat his home and had placed it for sale. He also described protest activities at Planned Parenthood, where he worked as medical\ndirector. These activities interfered with his ability to work and caused stress to his patients. Judy Reiner of Planned Parenthood\ntestified she was present at two pickets at the homes of Drs. Edwards and Rosenfeld and saw people associated with Rescue\nAmerica. She did not see Treshman, Tucci, Benham or Jewitt, however.\n\nDr. Robert Kaminsky testified his office, Women's Medical Center of Northwest Houston, is picketed regularly. He saw\nTreshman picket there about five times. He testified James Doyle followed him in his car once. The previous Saturday his\nbusiness was significantly interfered with by picketers. He testified the activities of protestors pose a health risk to his patients.\nHis house has been picketed about two dozen times. A “Wanted” poster with a photograph of Dr. Kaminsky was used during\nthe picketing. Mrs. Kaminsky testified their home had been picketed about fifteen times, the last time on the previous Saturday.\nMrs. Kaminsky also testified she does not feel safe because the protesters follow them to work. Mrs. Kaminsky testified she saw\nseveral of Treshman's followers outside both her home and her husband's office several times. She could identify Treshman's\nfollowers because she saw them taking direction from him or from John Moloney. She saw John Moloney and James and Estelle\nPratt picket their home. She had also seen the Pratts and James Doyle with Treshman in front of their office. A videotape of\npicketing at the Kaminsky residence was introduced into evidence. On the tape, Moloney shouted at Mrs. Kaminsky, “there is\na just punishment that you deserve.... This is just a small taste of what's coming down the pike. We trust we won't have to do\nit.” She described that picket as a “huge shoving match.” She testified John Moloney grabbed her, and her teenage daughter\nwas pushed to the ground by activists in her front yard. This incident occurred shortly after Dr. David Gunn was murdered\noutside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida while a Rescue America-sponsored picket was taking place, and Mrs. Kaminsky\ntestified she feared for her husband's safety. She did not want her husband to come outside during the confrontation with the\npicketers, but he eventually helped his wife and daughter return to the house. Mrs. Kaminsky testified the event was very\nscary and upsetting. She described it as “the most terrifying thing I've ever been through.” A few days later, Treshman praised\nMoloney for the Kaminsky picket on his hotline.\n\nDr. Doug Karpen testified he had seen Treshman at clinic demonstrations and had met him at Hobby Airport, where Treshman\nand five others followed him. Treshman and Benham admitted monitoring and following Dr. Karpen in a joint effort with\nDallas Rescue for more than six weeks. Dr. Karpen practices at Aaron's Women's Clinic and at Women's Pavilion. He\ntestified protestors had tried numerous time to block access at Aaron's, including an attempted blockade during the Republican\nConvention and an actual blockade about that time, organized by Operation Rescue and Treshman. There were two attempted\nblockades at The Women's Pavilion during the Convention. Dr. Karpen's house had been picketed about three to four times,\nbut not within the past two and a half years.\n\nDr. Bernard Rosenfeld testified demonstrations occur every Saturday at the Houston Women's Clinic where he works. The\nclinic had been subjected to acts of vandalism, including acid attacks, gluing of door locks, and flooding of his clinic. Many\npatients had been accosted by protestors and had been “extremely stressed out,” making the medical procedures “much more\ndangerous.” Dr. Rosenfeld testified that his house has been picketed about six to eight times and his driveway has been blockaded\nby protesters. This activity interfered with his ability to work and terrorized his wife and children. The activists told his three\nand four-year old children, “Your daddy kills babies.” Photographs were admitted showing the protesters at his residence.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n *76 Dr. Adebayo Adesomo testified Don Treshman of Rescue America was the leader of the protesters at his office at Suburban\nWomen's Clinic during the Republican Convention. Treshman denied he was the leader of that protest, and claimed he only\nwent there to talk to the press. Dr. Adesomo admitted his house had not been picketed. He testified that he was aware that an\nanti-abortion protester who was an admitted follower of Rescue America had killed a physician working at an abortion clinic,\nand he feared the same fate could happen to anyone performing abortions.\n\nDr. Coleman died before trial, and his deposition was not taken. He worked at A–Z Women's Health Services and at the West\nLoop Clinic. The evidence was that his house had been picketed several times. Treshman admitted he “organized, conducted\nand announced” a picket at Dr. Coleman's funeral. 3\n\nThe evidence from the hearing on the injunctive relief is directed to the issue of irreparable harm and is summarized as follows.\n\nDr. Morris Taggart, a psychologist, testified about the emotional impact of picketing on patients and staff. He interviewed eight\nemployees of Planned Parenthood. He characterized the reactions of those he interviewed as those of “people having undergone\nsome kind of trauma.” The workers reported being physically jostled on arrival at the clinic, and they were yelled at with\ncries of “baby murderer.” The staff was upset and unable to work after these incidents. In Dr. Taggart's opinion, a buffer zone\nbanning “harassing speech” was necessary because of the distress to staff and patients. He testified restrictions are necessary\nmost importantly to prevent physical contact, but also to reduce the proximity of the yelling and screaming. He admitted that\non four visits to the Planned Parenthood clinic, he observed only “peaceful protests.”\n\nDr. Dale Hill, also a psychologist, interviewed three patients, three nurses, one doctor and one volunteer in January 1994. In\nher testimony, she described the encounters with protesters. The patients and staff reported being “hollered at” and “physically\ntransgressed.” Some received threats, such as, “You need to die.” She concluded protesting was harmful to patients and staff,\nand a buffer zone is necessary to protect them from psychological and emotional trauma. She observed protests at Planned\nParenthood, but never observed any violence at the protests. Her own ingress or egress was not blocked during her three trips\nto Planned Parenthood.\n\nLaura Lindsay, a Planned Parenthood employee, primarily introduced photographs and diagrams of the clinics setting forth the\nrequested buffer zone areas. She demonstrated through photographs that signs held outside the buffer zones could still be read.\nShe admitted there are numerous differences about the clinics as to the level of traffic, noise, parking, or whether the clinic is in\na residential area as opposed to downtown Houston. She acknowledged that, since the 1992 Republican Convention, Planned\nParenthood has constructed a wall higher than six feet and a private enclosed drive provides access to the entrance door.\n\nAppellants called Mary Hall Kleypass, a pro-life “sidewalk counselor.” She testified she approaches women considering\nabortion and offers literature about the “development of the baby as well as a place where she could go for help.” To be\nsuccessful, “sidewalk counseling” involves “direct interaction” with the women, using “eye contact.” She denied she uses\nintimidation or grabs anyone, but instead counsels “gently and quietly.” She testified that counseling could not be done from\nacross the street because she would be forced to yell and could not interact with the women. However, on cross-examination\nKleypass admitted she is not a party to this case, does not know most of the appellants, does not act in concert with them, and\nis not subject to the injunction.\n\n [27] The party seeking an injunction must establish the defendant “will engage in *77 the activity enjoined.” State v. Morales,\n869 S.W.2d 941, 946 (Tex.1994). Appellants argue there is no evidence of imminent harm because the spotlight of national\npolitics has moved from Houston and most of the individual defendants have left Houston. They contend that all individuals\nexcept Flip Benham, who lives in Dallas, reside out of state. According to appellants, there is no continuing threat of irreparable\nharm.\n\nWe disagree. The evidence at trial shows that appellants Treshman and Rescue America are Houston-based. Appellant Operation\nRescue has operatives here. Operation Rescue and its leaders directed and controlled the activities of sympathetic followers\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

There was evidence presented at trial that Daniel Ware, Tom Weighard, Rusty Thomas, John Byrd, C.D. Money,\nJesse Miller, and other persons in Houston act at the direction or control of appellants in harassing, threatening and interfering\nwith appellees. Tom Wieghard, a member of Operation Rescue, signed Operation Rescue's pledge “to follow the mission's\nleadership” and engage in its activities “as directed.” Weighard admitted his intention was to interfere with Planned Parenthood's\nbusiness. He admitted he supervised and instructed “anyone who was out there” in front of the clinics, including Joshua Graff,\nand that he assisted at the blockade of the A–Z Clinic. He testified he had been taught techniques for these activities by\ncoordinators for Operation Rescue–National. Jeff White, director of Operation GOP (“Guard Our Preborn”), the name given\nthe protest activities during the Convention, announced that after the Convention, Operation Rescue “had left behind a thriving\npastor-lead rescue community in Houston.”\n\nNone of the appellants testified that they were willing to stop their activities. Most expressed a clear intention to violate any court\norder that interfered with their activities. Pat Mahoney of Operation Rescue testified to holding a “Boston Tea Party” where\nhe publicly destroyed a copy of Judge O'Neill's initial TRO and said he would do the same thing again. Flip Benham, national\ndirector of Operation Rescue, testified he intended to continue his activities. He testified that Operation Rescue will “live out\nits gospel in the streets despite injunctions and court orders.” Operation Rescue literature makes it clear that “[t]he threats of\nrescues will hang over the killers' heads every day.” Treshman testified Rescue America intends to continue to blockade clinics,\n“continue to use any effective means we feel will save lives,” continue residential picketing, and “continue all activities and all\navenues that are effective in stopping the abortion Holocaust.” Bob Jewitt wrote to Operation Rescue supporters that “[t]hose\nof us included in the injunction admitted that we already had an injunction from God to rescue children no matter how the\njudge would rule.” Keith Tucci, former national director of Operation Rescue, wrote, “[n]o matter what the laws say, we are\ncommitted to keep rescuing children.” He stated in another letter “we will continue our ... direct action....” Reiner testified the\nprotests continued through her testimony at trial.\n\n [28] In making its determination of imminent harm, the trial court may determine that, when violations are shown up to or\nnear the date of trial, the defendant has engaged in a course of conduct and the court may assume that it will continue, absent\nclear proof to the contrary. Texas Pet Foods, 591 S.W.2d at 804. The probability of the continuation of the prohibited practices\nis not subject to direct proof, and injunctive relief is proper when the trial court finds it justified under the rules of equity,\nnotwithstanding a defendant's cessation of the activity or promise to cease the activity. Id. Here, there was evidence that threats\nof violence, interference, and invasion of personal and property rights continued up to and during trial. There was no “clear\nproof to the contrary.”\n\n [29] [30] Under Texas law, a violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right inflicts irreparable injury warranting injunctive\nrelief. Southwestern Newspapers Corp. v. Curtis, 584 S.W.2d 362, 368 (Tex.Civ.App.—Amarillo 1979, no writ); see also\nIranian Muslim Organization v. City of San Antonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex.1981). In addition, disruption of business\nconstitutes the type of harm for which an injunction may issue. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 812 S.W.2d at 666. *78 When faced with\nsimilar facts, this court found that violation of a clinic lessee's constitutional property rights caused irreparable harm. Right to\nLife Advocates, Inc. v. Aaron Women's Clinic, 737 S.W.2d 564, 571 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, writ denied), cert.\ndenied, 488 U.S. 824, 109 S.Ct. 71, 102 L.Ed.2d 47 (1988). When the clinic faced a continuation of picketing and harassment\nby abortion protesters, we determined that a suit for money damages for loss of business was insufficient, and the only adequate\nremedy was an injunction limiting the protests. Id.\n\n [31] In this case, when the jury inquired whether it had to determine that each appellant personally violated the physicians'\nprivacy and property rights, the court instructed that it could “consider the acts of non-defendants if those persons committed\nthe act, if any, as agents of the listed Defendants. An agent is one who consents to act on behalf of and subject to control of\nanother, the principal, who has manifested consent that the agent shall so act.” Appellants make no complaint on appeal as\nto this instruction. Therefore, we conclude that it is immaterial that each of the individual appellants were not identified as\npersonally engaging in many of the protest activities. It is not essential that each conspirator be shown to have acted in concert\nwith his co-conspirators. See Bourland v. State, 528 S.W.2d 350, 354 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Once a\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               23\n\fOperation Rescue-National v. Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\ncivil conspiracy is proven, each conspirator is responsible for the acts done by any other conspirator to further the conspiracy.\nCarroll v. Timmers Chevrolet, Inc., 592 S.W.2d 922, 926 (Tex.1979).\n\n [32] We find sufficient evidence for the jury to have concluded that the participants in the illegal protests followed the direction\nof Operation Rescue and Rescue America and their leaders. While appellants denied they organized the protests, many of\ntheir denials were impeached by their own writings and deposition testimony. The jury, as the sole judge of the credibility of\nthe witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, was free to disregard the testimony of any witness and resolve\ninconsistencies in the testimony. McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex.1986); Skrepnek v. Shearson Lehman\nBros., Inc., 889 S.W.2d 578, 579 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ).\n\nWe conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury's finding that appellants conspired to violate, and did violate, the\nprivacy and property rights of the physicians. In addition, the evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court's findings\nin granting the requested injunctive relief both as to the clinics and in favor of the physicians. The contrary evidence is not so\noverwhelming as to render the court's judgment unjust. Therefore, we also conclude that the trial court's conclusion of law in\nsupport of the necessity of the injunction is not erroneous. We overrule OR's points of error eight through thirty-one and B/\nJ's points eight through twenty-seven.\n\n\n\n                                                  B. Constitutional Complaints\n\n [33] In B/J point one and OR point forty-three, appellants contend the permanent injunction order is void because it violates\nthe right to freedom of speech guaranteed in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as construed in Madsen\nv. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 114 S.Ct. 2516, 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (1994). They also contend the injunction is\nunconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, press and association in B/J\npoint three and OR point forty-four.\n\nIn Madsen, the United States Supreme Court set forth the standard for evaluating the constitutionality of a content-neutral\ninjunction such as the one at issue here. We must determine “whether the challenged provisions of the injunction burden no\nmore speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest.” Madsen, 512 U.S. at 765, 114 S.Ct. at 2525. This\nstandard is based on the Court's earlier pronouncement that when sanctionable “conduct occurs in the context of constitutionally\nprotected activity ... ‘precision of regulation’ is demanded.” NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct.\n3409, 3427, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982).\n\n *79 [34] In B/J point two and OR point forty-two, appellants also complain the injunction violates the Texas constitution and\nis not the least restrictive means of protecting the governmental interests involved, in violation of Ex parte Tucci, 859 S.W.2d\n1 (Tex.1993) (plurality opinion). The Texas Constitution's broad command that “[e]very person shall be at liberty to speak ...\nopinions on any subject” provides greater rights of free expression than the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nDavenport v. Garcia, 834 S.W.2d 4, 10 (Tex.1992) (citing TEX. CONST. art. I, § 8). For this reason, restraints on expression\nmay be imposed only if the injunctive relief granted encompasses “the least restrictive means” of protecting against the alleged\nimminent and irreparable harm caused by the expression. Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 6.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court recognized in Tucci that constitutional protection of freedom of speech and assembly does not license\nobstruction of public ways or entrances and exits from places of business. Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 4. Without unimpaired access\nto appropriate counseling and medical facilities, women are deprived of their constitutional guarantee of choice. Id.\n\nIn Tucci, the supreme court considered only the portion of the temporary restraining orders on which the contempt convictions\nwere based and which barred:\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              24\n\fOperation Rescue-National v. Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n\n\n             Demonstrating within one-hundred (100) feet from either side of or in front of any doorway entrance\n             or exit, parking lot, parking lot entrance or exit, driveway, or driveway entrance or exit at [any of the]\n             clinic[s] or parking lots.\n\nId. at 4–5. In striking down the 100–foot speech free zone, the supreme court found the limited record before the trial court\ndid not support the ban and noted that although a map of the Planned Parenthood facility was referred to at the hearing on\nthe restraining orders, no evidence was admitted as to the different physical facilities of the various clinics. Id. at 6. Instead,\nthose seeking the restraint urged a uniform restriction for “administrative convenience.” Id. The court left open the possibility\nof a permanent injunction imposing a limited geographical ban on activity as long as any restriction is “justified by a proper\nevidentiary showing that such measures are essential to preserve the right of clinic access, and that each satisfies fully the\nstandard we have required under the Texas Constitution.” Id. The court required “specific findings supported by evidence”\nthat the speech-free zone is the least restrictive means to insure unimpeded access to clinics and guard against intimidation\nand harassment. Id.\n\n [35] While we recognize that our supreme court has held that the Texas constitution generally provides greater free speech\nrights than those provided under the federal constitution, we conclude that the standards of review for the constitutionality of\nthis injunction are essentially the same under both the United States Constitution and the Texas Constitution. Any buffer zone\ninjunction must “burden no more speech than necessary” and be the “least restrictive means” to protect unimpeded access to\nthe clinics and residences.\n\nIn Madsen, the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a state court injunction prohibiting anti-abortion\nprotestors, including Operation Rescue and “Operation Rescue America,” from demonstrating outside a health clinic in Florida.\nAmong other restrictions, the injunction prohibited the protestors, from “congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or\nentering” any portion of the public right-of-way or private property within 36 feet of the property line of the clinic to ensure\naccess to the clinic. Madsen, 512 U.S. at 768, 114 S.Ct. at 2526. In upholding this part of the injunction, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that the state court had “few other options to protect access,” and the Court gave deference to the state court's\nfamiliarity with the facts and the background of the dispute between the parties, even in light of its heightened review. Id. at\n769, 114 S.Ct. at 2527. The Court considered the fact that an earlier, more narrow injunction failed to accomplish its purpose,\nbut stopped short of setting any requirement for a similar failure of a narrow restriction as a prerequisite for injunctions in future\ncases. Id. The Court concluded that “the 36–foot buffer zone around the clinic *80 entrances and driveway burdens no more\nspeech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake.” Id.\n\n [36] The Supreme Court in Madsen also identified numerous significant government interests protected by the injunction,\nincluding: a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical or counseling services in connection with her pregnancy; ensuring public\nsafety and order; promoting the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks; protecting the property rights of citizens;\nand protecting residential and medical privacy. Madsen, 512 U.S. at 767–68, 114 S.Ct. at 2526. The Court found that these\ngovernmental interests were sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to protect them. Id.\n\nHere, the same significant governmental interests exist, and almost identical interests are listed in the trial court's conclusions\nof law. We hold that the governmental interests in this case are sufficiently significant to justify and demand injunctive relief.\nWe now must evaluate the terms of the injunction to determine if they contain the least restrictive means of protection and are\ntailored to burden no more speech than necessary.\n\nIn Madsen, the United States Supreme Court upheld a complete buffer zone to protect access to the abortion clinic at issue. The\nonly provision of the clinic buffer zone that the Court struck down was that portion which extended onto the private property\nof adjoining landowners at the sides of the clinic. 4 The zones at issue here do not extend onto private property other than\nthe property on which their clinics or homes are situated. Each of the distance restrictions in the buffer zones in this case are\nnarrower than the 36–foot zone upheld in Madsen.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              25\n\fOperation Rescue-National v. Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\nThe trial court in this case conducted an evidentiary hearing in addition to the jury trial. Appellants agreed to stipulate to maps,\nphotographs and written descriptions of the proposed buffer zones that were introduced in evidence. Photographic evidence\ndemonstrated that appellants could still be seen outside the prohibited zones. Each zone has been specifically tailored to the\ngeography of the particular clinic. The width and breadth of each zone varies widely depending on the physical characteristics\nand location of each clinic. The zones range from fifteen to thirty-two feet, depending upon the particular requirements for\nadequate clinic access.\n\nFor example, there was testimony that patients were required to cross two streets from the parking lot to the Planned Parenthood\nentrance. Narrow corridors were provided across these streets to enable patients to cross the streets without fear of unwanted\ninterference. At the A–Z Women's Clinic, which is located in a high-rise office building, the prohibited zone is fifteen feet from\nthe driveways leading to the clinic's private parking lots, leaving one lane of traffic open for cars to enter and exit. Appellants\ncan still be seen and heard at these locations. The West Loop Clinic has one of the largest buffer zones, thirty-one feet. It is\njustified due to the physical lay-out of the clinic which fails to provide any separation between appellants and arriving patients.\nIn addition, the West Loop Clinic has been the target of repeated and dangerous acts of protest, including butyric acid attacks\nand fire-bombing.\n\nWe believe that the injunction satisfies the Texas Supreme Court's concern that distances not be imposed based solely upon\n“administrative convenience.” Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 6. We find that the evidence established that these zones are the least\nrestrictive means and are “essential to preserve the right of clinic access” as required by Tucci. See Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 7.\nIn addition, we find the injunction satisfies Madsen's requirement for “precision of regulation” to insure that the injunction\nburdens no more speech than necessary. Madsen, 512 U.S. at 767, 114 S.Ct. at 2525–26.\n\n [37] Appellants also argue, as part of B/J's points one through three, that the injunction on picketing near the clinics and\nphysicians' residences is overbroad. OR *81 raise essentially the same argument under their point of error forty-four. They\ncontend that the injunction improperly bans all speech included within the term “demonstrating” within the buffer zones. This\nargument is unpersuasive because the United States Supreme Court upheld a complete ban on “demonstrating” within a 36–\nfoot “speech-free” zone in Madsen. Id. at 768–69, 114 S.Ct. at 2526–27.\n\n [38] Appellants also contend the ban on residential picketing is unconstitutional. The injunction banned all “picketing,\npatrolling, or demonstrating within ... zone[s] along the entire ... street edge of [each physician's] property extending 13 feet\nfrom the property line” into the street where the residence is located.\n\nAppellants maintain that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101\nL.Ed.2d 420 (1988) controls the constitutionality of the ban on protests at the physicians' residences. The Court traditionally\nsubjects restrictions on public issue picketing to careful scrutiny. The restrictions must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant\ngovernment interest and must leave open ample alternative channels of communication. Id. at 482, 108 S.Ct. at 2501. In Frisby,\nthe Court upheld an ordinance banning picketing in residential neighborhoods, finding anti-abortion protestors had ample\nalternative means to proselytize their views. Id. at 484, 108 S.Ct. at 2502. The Court construed the ban narrowly as prohibiting\nfocused picketing taking place in front of a particular residence. Id. at 483, 108 S.Ct. at 2501–02.\n\n [39] [40] The Court also found the restriction served a significant government interest: the protection of residential privacy.\nId. A restriction is narrowly tailored if it eliminates no more than the exact source of the “evil” it seeks to remedy. Id. at 485, 108\nS.Ct. at 2502–03. The Court found that focused picketing inherently and offensively intrudes on residential privacy. Id. at 486,\n108 S.Ct. at 2503. The First Amendment permits the government to prohibit offensive speech as intrusive when the “captive”\naudience cannot avoid the objectionable speech. Id. at 487, 108 S.Ct. at 2503–04. The Court concluded that a complete ban on\ntargeted picketing is narrowly tailored to eliminate the “evil” of an unwelcome visitor at the home. Id.\n\n [41] The Supreme Court applies a “somewhat more stringent application of First Amendment principles” when evaluating an\ninjunctive order than it does when a content-neutral, generally applicable statute is reviewed, as was the case in Frisby. Madsen,\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              26\n\fOperation Rescue-National v. Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n512 U.S. at 765, 114 S.Ct. at 2524. Consequently, the injunction must satisfy the review announced in Madsen, that is, it must\nburden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest. Id. at 765, 114 S.Ct. at 2525.\n\nThe injunction in Madsen prohibited picketing and demonstrating within 300 feet of the residences of clinic staff. Id. at 774,\n114 S.Ct. at 2529. In striking down this provision, the Court found a 300–foot zone would ban general marching through the\nneighborhood or even a walking route in front of an entire block of houses, instead of a prohibition on “focused picketing\ntaking place solely in front of a particular residence” that the Court had approved in Frisby. Id. at 775, 114 S.Ct. at 2530. The\ncourt recognized that a “limitation on time, duration of picketing, and number of pickets outside a smaller zone could have\naccomplished the desired result.” Id.\n\nThe more narrow restriction proposed by the U.S. Supreme Court is precisely what the trial court imposed in this case. This\ninjunction prohibits protests in a small zone in front of each doctor's residence. There are time limits within each 24–hour period\nand limits on sound amplification within 100 feet of the residences. In Madsen, the Supreme Court approved even broader\nlimitations on sound amplification near the residences of clinic staff. Id. at 774, 114 S.Ct. at 2529. Appellants complain that\nthe buffer zone impermissibly prohibits them from passing through the neighborhood. However, the zone is only thirteen feet\ndeep, and protestors have ample access to picket through the neighborhood, so long as they do not “focus” on the area in front\nof a particular doctor's residence. The thirteen-foot zone is necessary to permit the doctors' families to have *82 access to their\ndriveways, and it leaves one lane of traffic open for alternate channels of communication by appellants or others.\n\nWe hold the injunction on protests at the doctors' residences satisfies the criteria set forth in Frisby as well as Madsen, and\nis therefore constitutional.\n\n [42] [43] Appellants also contend the trial court made no specific factual findings supporting the injunctive relief. They\nargue the court instead made mere conclusions that appellants conduct “threatened” the access and use of the clinics. Appellants\nfailed to preserve this complaint for our review. In any cause tried without a jury, any party may request the court to state in\nwriting its findings of fact and conclusions of law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 296. When part of a cause is decided by a jury and part by\nthe court, the party appealing the court-decided issue should request findings of fact and conclusions of law. Heafner & Assocs.\nv. Koecher, 851 S.W.2d 309, 313 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, no writ); Shenandoah Assocs. v. J & K Properties,\nInc., 741 S.W.2d 470, 484 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied).\n\n [44] [45] [46] [47] The findings in this case satisfy the general requirements for injunctions. Rule 683 governs injunctions,\nand provides in relevant part:\n\n            Every order granting an injunction ... shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms;\n            shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts\n            sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants,\n            employees, and attorneys, and upon those in active concert or participation with them who receive actual\n            notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.\n\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 683. The requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed. InterFirst Bank San Felipe,\nN.A. v. Paz Constr. Co., 715 S.W.2d 640, 641 (Tex.1986). Findings of fact are not required to challenge the validity of an\ninjunctive order that fails to state a reason for its issuance. Courtlandt Place Historical Found. v. Doerner, 768 S.W.2d 924,\n926 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ). While every order granting an injunction must set forth the reasons for\nits issuance in the order itself, if the enjoined party wishes additional, detailed findings, the party may make a request under\nthe rules of procedure governing findings of fact generally. Transport Co. v. Robertson Transports, Inc., 152 Tex. 551, 261\nS.W.2d 549, 553 (1953). Where a party fails to request additional or amended findings after the court files its original findings,\nthe party waives the right to complain on appeal that the findings were not full and complete or that the court failed to enter\nadditional findings of fact.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n [48] [49] [50] Here, the trial court's injunctive order adequately stated the specific reasons for its issuance. If additional\nfindings were needed, appellants should have requested them. By failing to request additional findings, appellants have waived\nany right to complain about omitted or incorrect findings. 5 See Dallas Morning News Co. v. Board of Trustees Dallas ISD,\n861 S.W.2d 532, 538 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1993, writ denied). Without a request, omitted findings will be presumed in support\nof the judgment. James Holmes Enters., Inc. v. John Bankston Constr. & Equip. Rental, Inc., 664 S.W.2d 832, 834 (Tex.App.\n—Beaumont 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nThe court recited appellants' specific conduct which justified the injunctive relief. The court found that appellants continued\ntheir protest activity despite existing injunctions imposing place and manner restrictions, and concluded that absent injunctive\nrelief, defendants were likely to continue to engage in their tortious conduct. In fact, appellants have brazenly ignored the\nprevious orders of judges in several states. The court determined that narrowly tailored injunctive relief was required to protect\nseveral significant governmental interests, which are substantially *83 the same as those identified in Madsen. The court\ndetailed the specific, narrowly tailored zone around each clinic's entrance. Each zone was a “[m]eans of protecting unfettered\ningress and egress from the clinic, ensuring that [appellants] do not block traffic.” Madsen, 512 U.S. at 769, 114 S.Ct. at 2526.\nThese zones, by their very descriptions, demonstrate that they are designed to limit no more than the very evil of “in-your-\nface” harassment shown by the evidence at trial and to permit adequate access to the clinics. We hold that the court's findings\nare adequate and correct.\n\nIn conclusion, we find that the permanent injunction violates neither the federal nor state constitution. B/J points one through\nthree, and OR points forty-two through forty-four are overruled.\n\n\n\n                                                        Actual Damages\n\n [51] In points of error thirty-two through thirty-six, OR attack the actual damages. They first argue the evidence is insufficient\nto support causation and foreseeability. They contend that it is not known who committed the acts of vandalism which\nnecessitated repairs to the clinic. In point of error thirty-six, OR argues the damages are excessive. They contend the other\ncosts on which damages were based are associated with increased security measures, and are not properly recompensable as\nitems of damages.\n\n [52] [53] In an action for interference with business relations, a plaintiff may recover “[s]uch damages ... as are a natural and\nproximate consequence of the interference.” Gonzalez v. Gutierrez, 694 S.W.2d 384, 390 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1985, no\nwrit). For civil conspiracy, a Texas plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages that “naturally flow from the civil conspiracy.”\nFenslage v. Dawkins, 629 F.2d 1107, 1110 (5th Cir.1980) (citing Great Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Chapa, 377 S.W.2d 632, 635\n(Tex.1964)).\n\nReiner testified to the following costs of repairs, alterations, and safety measures at Planned Parenthood: (1) construction costs\ntotalling $109,467, which included: $30,812 for a security system; $5,030 for a halon fire suppression system; $42,650 for a\nmore sophisticated sprinkler system; $1,149 for extra fencing; $7,658 for guard services during construction; $3,896 for bullet\nresistant glass windows; $485 for covering the air conditioning lines; $403 for repairs to the vandalized air conditioning lines;\n$17,384 for upgrade of the fire alarm system; (2) $33,468 for an additional security guard during the Republican Convention;\n(3) $21,650 in damages caused by a butyric acid attack; and (4) costs for an escort program totalling approximately $40,000.\nThese sums total $204,585, the amount of actual damages awarded by the jury.\n\nIn addition to evidence of appellants' conduct already cited, Reiner testified appellants were responsible for the damages at\nPlanned Parenthood, which required repairs and alterations to the building. By way of example, Reiner testified she heard\nTreshman describe over his hot line how to conduct a butyric acid attack. Her clinic was then the target of just such an acid\nattack. Roof and floor tiles were “permeated with a horrible stench” and had to be replaced.

She stated that “these four defendants [against whom\ndamages were awarded] clearly have conspired to initiate additional costs through their very actions and deeds and their own\nstatements.” This testimony was uncontradicted.\n\nPlanned Parenthood sought reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses it incurred as a result of appellants' illegal protest\nactivity. The evidence previously recited demonstrates that appellants acted intentionally to shut down the clinics and to keep\npatients away. It was foreseeable that Planned Parenthood would be forced to respond to the threats and acts of vandalism with\nappropriate security measures. Appellants cite to no evidence in the record that Planned Parenthood's expenses were excessive\nor unnecessary. Judy Reiner testified these changes were essential to continued clinic operation. We conclude that the evidence\nin the record is factually sufficient to support the actual *84 damages awarded by the jury. We overrule OR's points of error\nthirty-two through thirty-six.\n\n\n\n                                                     Punitive Damages\n\n [54] In points of error thirty-seven and thirty-nine, OR assert the punitive damages awarded are erroneous because the jury\ndid not award specific actual damages caused by appellants' conduct in maliciously engaging in a conspiracy to interfere with\nPlanned Parenthood's business. OR argue that a reasonable proportionality between actual and punitive damages cannot be\nshown as required by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nActual damages were based on affirmative answers to either Question No. 6, in which the jury found appellants wrongfully\ninterfered with the ability of the clinics to provide medical services, or Question No. 3 on proximate cause of damages from\nthe conspiracy. In answer to Question No. 1, on which Question No. 3 was predicated, the jury found appellants engaged in\na conspiracy to interfere with the clinics' business. Question No. 4, which asked whether OR acted with malice, was limited\nto malice as to the conspiracy.\n\nAppellants correctly cite the general rule there must be a finding of actual damages in tort to uphold an award of punitive\ndamages. See Bellefonte Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Brown, 704 S.W.2d 742, 745 (Tex.1986). Here, the jury awarded actual\ndamages in tort, but awarded punitive damages based only on conspiracy.\n\nOR did not object to the charge on the basis that the damages could result from the conspiracy or wrongful interference with\nthe clinics. It raised no objection to Questions Nos. 7–10, the damages questions, which were predicated on an affirmative\nanswer to either a conspiracy finding or a finding of wrongful interference. Therefore, OR has waived any error in this regard.\nCosgrove v. Grimes, 774 S.W.2d 662, 665–66 (Tex.1989) (holding the defendant waived error by failing to object to defective\ndamages submission); TEX.R. CIV. P. 274. We overrule points of error thirty-seven and thirty-nine.\n\n [55] [56] [57] In point thirty-eight OR contest the factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting punitive damages. In\nconsidering the propriety of an award of punitive damages, we must apply the review enunciated in Transportation Ins. Co. v.\nMoriel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 30 (Tex.1994). The Texas Supreme Court requires that when we conduct a factual sufficiency review\nof a punitive damages award, we must detail the relevant evidence in our opinion as to why the evidence supports or does\nnot support the punitive damages in light of the factors in Alamo Nat. Bank v. Kraus, 616 S.W.2d 908, 910 (Tex.1981). Id. at\n31. These factors are: (1) the nature of the wrong; (2) the character of the conduct involved; (3) the degree of culpability of\nthe wrongdoer; (4) the situation and sensibilities of the parties concerned; and (5) the extent to which such conduct offends\na public sense of justice and propriety. Kraus, 616 S.W.2d at 910. Exemplary damages must be reasonably proportioned to\nactual damages. Id. The Supreme Court acknowledged in Kraus, however, that there is no set ratio between actual and punitive\ndamages. Id.\n\nThe amount of actual damages awarded was $204,585 and the total amount of punitive damages were $1,010,000. Similar ratios\nare routinely approved by courts of this state. It is significant that the amounts found against the individual defendants were\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\nsubstantially less than those against the organizations. It is also significant that the jury awarded $5,000 additional punitive\ndamages, over and above the amount originally requested, against Rescue America, and its leader Don Treshman, for whom\nthere was abundant evidence of involvement in organizing the protests and encouraging acts of vandalism. The evidence already\ndiscussed shows that the organizers acted intentionally and with malice. They were unconcerned about the consequences so\nlong as their goal of stopping abortion was achieved. The evidence of appellants' conduct in this case, such as firebombing,\nacid attacks, and death threats, is so egregious as to be highly offensive and repugnant to law abiding citizens.\n\nWe conclude that the evidence supporting the jury's award of punitive damages is factually *85 sufficient. OR's point of error\nthirty-eight is overruled.\n\n [58] In point of error forty, OR challenge the award of punitive damages because two of the jurors voting for punitive damages\ndid not join in the verdict on actual damages. Only ten of the twelve jurors voted to award actual damages.\n\nRule 292 provides that the same ten members of an original jury of twelve may render a verdict. TEX.R. CIV. P. 292; Palmer\nWell Servs., Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 776 S.W.2d 575, 576 (Tex.1989). There is a split of authority as to whether the same ten\njurors who found liability in the first phase of the trial must agree upon the amount of punitive damages in the second phase of\na bifurcated trial. The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals determined that they did not, finding Rule 292 does not apply. Greater\nHouston Transportation Co. v. Zrubeck, 850 S.W.2d 579, 588 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ denied). Recently, the\nAmarillo Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion. See Hyman Farm Serv., Inc. v. Earth Oil & Gas, Inc., 920 S.W.2d\n452 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1996, no writ). In Hyman, the court rejected what it called “dicta” in Zrubeck, and held that Rule\n292 requires the same ten or more jurors to concur in all answers necessary to a judgment, including the answer to the amount\nof punitive damages awarded, if any, in a bifurcated trial. Id. at 457–58.\n\n [59] We need not decide whether Rule 292 applies because appellants made no objection before the verdict to the two\ndissenting jurors' participation in the punitive damages deliberations. In fact, appellants demanded the two jurors' participation.\nThus, they have waived any complaint. TEX.R.APP. P. 52(a). Moreover, the punitive damages verdict was unanimous.\nTherefore, the same ten jurors that voted to award actual damages found punitives. In the event it was error for the other two\njurors to join in the verdict, it is clearly harmless. We overrule point of error forty.\n\n [60] In point of error forty-one, OR challenge Planned Parenthood's amendment of its damages request after the jury verdict\nbut before rendition of judgment. The jury awarded $5,000 additional punitive damages, above the amount requested, against\nTreshman and Rescue America. Planned Parenthood requested a pre-judgment trial amendment, which the court granted. The\ntrial court then incorporated the amended amounts in its judgment. OR contend the amendment operated to their surprise and\nprejudice, and that it was violative of Rule 47.\n\n [61] [62] Rule 47 requires a pleading setting forth a claim for relief to give fair notice of the claim involved and to state that\nthe damages sought are within the jurisdictional limits of the court. TEX.R. CIV. P. 47. A pleading is sufficient when it gives\nfair and adequate notice of the facts upon which the pleader basis its claim. Roark v. Allen, 633 S.W.2d 804, 810 (Tex.1982).\nThe purpose of Rule 47 is to give the opposing party information sufficient to enable him to prepare a defense. Id.\n\n [63] The trial court has no discretion to deny a trial amendment unless appellants demonstrate surprise. Chapin & Chapin,\nInc. v. Texas Sand & Gravel Co., 844 S.W.2d 664, 665 (Tex.1992); Greenhalgh v. Service Lloyds Ins. Co., 787 S.W.2d 938,\n939 (Tex.1990); TEX.R. CIV. P. 63 (requiring leave to amend to be granted absent a showing of surprise); TEX.R. CIV. P.\n66 (requiring the court to freely allow amendment in absence of showing of prejudice). Appellants failed to show they were\nsurprised by the amendment. We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the pre-judgment amendment to\nappellees' pleadings. OR point of error forty-one is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The jury did not find that appellants\nviolated the rights of Dr. Richard Cunningham, Dr. Howard Novick, or two businesses adjoining Planned Parenthood, Brian G.\nMartinez, D.D.S., and O'Connor & Co., d/b/a Adkins Architectural Antiques. The court recited in *86 the judgment, however,\nthe jury's answers to each question as to each plaintiff and intervenor. Appellants cite no authority that the trial court's failure\nto include “take-nothing” provisions is reversible error. Unsupported points of error are waived. See Trenholm v. Ratcliff, 646\nS.W.2d 927, 934 (Tex.1983). We overrule OR point of error forty-eight and B/J point of error thirty-one.\n\n [66] In OR's points forty-nine and fifty and B/J's points thirty-two and thirty-three, appellants argue that the trial court\nerroneously amended its judgment. Appellees requested the court to correct two matters they deemed “clerical errors.” The\ntwo changes were: (1) to correct the parenthetical numerical in the award of punitive damages to $355,000 to coincide with\nthe wording; and (2) to change the enforcement paragraph in the injunction by adding “any officer, agent, servant, employee,\nattorney, or person acting in active concert with defendant, who has actual notice of the order.” OR assert that this second\nchange is not a clerical error. OR concede that the transferee court had plenary jurisdiction over the judgment by virtue of\nappellants' timely filed motion for new trial, but argue the court could not correct a “judicial error” in the enforcement paragraph\nof the judgment.\n\n [67] “Clerical errors” are mistakes or omissions that prevent the judgment as entered from reflecting the judgment as rendered.\nThe trial court may correct clerical mistakes even if it has lost plenary jurisdiction. Andrews v. Koch, 702 S.W.2d 584, 585\n(Tex.1986); TEX.R. CIV. P. 316, 329b(h).\n\nFirst, we note that the injunctive order section of the judgment provides that: “defendants, their officers, directors, agents,\nrepresentatives, employees, attorneys, and all persons acting in concert with or participating with, by or through them are\nenjoined and restrained from the following:....” Thus, we find that addition of the same language to the enforcement paragraph\nwas necessary and proper to correct a clerical error. In addition, we note that Rule 683 contemplates the injunctive order being\nbinding upon “parties, their officers, agents, servants, employes, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or\nparticipation with them who receive actual notice of the order.” See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. Therefore, the correction to comply\nwith the terms of the rule was properly made. We find no error in the correction in the amended judgment of this clerical error\nand overrule OR's points forty-nine and fifty and B/J's points thirty-two and thirty-three.\n\n [68] In OR point of error fifty-one and B/J point thirty-four, they argue the trial court had no authority to enter the judgment\nnunc pro tunc to correct the amended judgment. Appellants' motion for new trial was overruled on February 10, 1995. The trial\ncourt entered a judgment nunc pro tunc on June 15, 1995 to include attachment of exhibits describing the buffer zones. These\nexhibits were referred to in the original judgment, and were attached to that judgment. When the judgment was first amended,\nthe exhibits were inadvertently omitted. Failure to attach the exhibits to the judgment is a clerical error, not a judicial error.\nTherefore, the trial court could properly enter a judgment nunc pro tunc after expiration of it plenary power. TEX.R. CIV. P.\n316, 329b(h). We overrule OR point of error fifty-one and B/J point of error thirty-four.\n\n\n\n                                                              Costs\n\nAppellants complain about the trial court's allocation of costs in OR's points of error fifty-two through fifty-four and B/J\npoints thirty-five through thirty-seven. On May 23, 1995, the court ordered the district clerk to issue a new cost bill reflecting\n“previously taxed costs” of $15,057.75 and adding “retaxed additional costs” of $15,087.82.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n [69] [70] The successful party shall recover costs from its adversary. TEX.R. CIV. P. 131. A “successful party” is one\nwho obtains a judgment of a competent court vindicating a civil claim of right. Perez v. Baker Packers, 694 S.W.2d 138, 143\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Allocation of costs is a matter for the trial court's discretion and cannot\nbe overturned absent a showing of abuse. Hill v. Robinson, 592 S.W.2d 376, 378 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1979, writ ref'd n.r.e.);\n *87 Coleman v. Donaho, 559 S.W.2d 860, 864 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1977, writ dism'd).\n\n [71] [72] A court may not adjudge costs other than as provided by Rule 131 unless good cause is shown. Dover Elevator Co.\nv. Servellon, 876 S.W.2d 166, 169 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1993, no writ); Contemporary Health Management, Inc. v. Palacios, 832\nS.W.2d 743, 745 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, no writ); TEX.R. CIV. P. 141. In the absence of an explanation for\nassessing costs contrary to the rule, the trial court abuses its discretion. See Guerra v. Perez & Assoc., 885 S.W.2d 531, 533–34\n(Tex.App.—El Paso 1994, no writ); Dover Elevator Co. v. Servellon, 812 S.W.2d 366, 367 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, no writ).\n\n [73] A motion to adjudge costs involves an assessment by the court as to who shall pay the costs, while a motion to retax\ncosts involves the question of the amount of costs assessed. Reaugh v. McCollum Exploration Co., 140 Tex. 322, 167 S.W.2d\n727, 728 (1943); City of Ingleside v. Stewart, 554 S.W.2d 939, 948 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). A\nmotion to retax costs is one to correct the ministerial act of the clerk of the court in tabulating costs. Wood v. Wood, 159 Tex.\n350, 320 S.W.2d 807, 813 (1959).\n\n [74] In OR point fifty-two and B/J point thirty-five, appellants complain that the court failed to reduce the costs awarded against\nthem by a proportionate amount for the two plaintiffs against whom all defendants were successful and the eight plaintiffs against\nwhom one of the defendants was successful. We are cited to no authority requiring the trial court to make this proportionate\nreduction in costs. Moreover, rather than retaxing of costs, this proportionate reduction is an allocation or adjudication of costs,\nwhich was required to be made within the trial court's plenary power. Where the complaint is made of the ruling of a court in\nadjudging costs against the wrong party, the error is inherent in the judgment and must be properly assigned, just as any other\nalleged error. Reaugh, 167 S.W.2d at 728.\n\n [75] [76] In OR point fifty-three and B/J point thirty-six, appellants argue the court was without jurisdiction to retax costs\nbecause more that thirty days had elapsed since appellants' motion for new trial was overruled. Because taxing of costs, as\ndistinguished from the adjudication of costs, is merely a ministerial duty of the clerk, an error may be corrected upon the injured\nparty's motion, even after the case has been disposed of on appeal, as long as the request is made before the mandate issues\nand the costs are paid. Hartzell Propeller, Inc. v. Alexander, 517 S.W.2d 455, 456 (Tex.Civ.App.—Texarkana 1974, no writ).\nWe find the trial court had authority to retax costs.\n\n[77]     In OR point fifty-four and B/J point thirty-seven, appellants contend the retaxed costs are in error.\n\nThe Civil Practice and Remedies Code Provides in relevant part:\n\n  A judge of any court may include in any order or judgment all costs, including the following:\n\n       (1) fees of the clerk and service fees due the county;\n\n       (2) fees of the court reporter for the original of stenographic transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the suit;\n\n       (3) masters, interpreters, and guardians ad litem appointed pursuant to these rules and state statutes; and\n\n       (4) such other costs and fees as may be permitted by these rules and state statutes.\n\nTEX.

Most of these expenditures, such as rental of\nthe television and video recorder, were specifically ordered by the trial court. The trial court also ordered appellees to provide\nappellants with copies of the videotapes they intended to show at trial. It was also the trial court who ordered the unknown\nDoe defendants to be served because they would be bound by the injunction as appellants' agents. The affidavit from Neal\nManne, appellees' counsel, substantiates that the trial court ordered these expenses and that they were reasonably and necessarily\nincurred in the prosecution of the suit. In addition, the affidavit from Judy Reiner states that the fees were reasonable and\nnecessary to prosecute the suit. Deposition expenses are properly chargeable as court costs. Wallace v. Briggs, 162 Tex. 485,\n348 S.W.2d 523, 527 (1961); Shenandoah Assocs. v. J & K Properties, Inc., 741 S.W.2d 470, 487 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1987,\nwrit denied). Subpoena and citation fees are recoverable as court costs. Shenandoah, 741 S.W.2d at 487. The affidavits attached\nto appellees' motion support a determination by the trial court that the transcript from the temporary injunction hearing was\n“necessarily obtained for use at trial,” in accordance with TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 31.007(b)(2).\n\nAttached to the trial court's order retaxing costs are the original itemization from the district clerk and an amended itemization\nwith numerous items deleted from the original list. According to appellees' motion, the redacted items were for costs incurred\nby plaintiffs other than appellees. From this itemization, it appears that appellees have not been awarded costs for plaintiffs that\ndid not recover. The court's order also reflects that a hearing was conducted on appellees' motion to retax costs. We have no\nrecord of the hearing, and in the absence of a record, we cannot determine the basis for the court's order. It is appellants' burden\nto furnish a sufficient record to demonstrate error. TEX.R.APP. P. 50(d).\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in permitting appellees, the prevailing parties, to recover their costs. We overrule OR's points\nof error fifty-two through fifty-four and B/J's points of error thirty-five through thirty-seven.\n\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\nAMIDEI, Justice, dissenting.\nI respectfully dissent from the court's majority opinion.\n\nThe portion of the judgment awarding a permanent injunction is void and should be reversed and rendered for one or more\nof the reasons as follows:\n\n1. The trial court did not make a finding there was a threat of imminent harm. The trial court must make such finding to support\na permanent injunction. Frey v. DeCordova Bend Estates, 632 S.W.2d 877, 881 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1982), affirmed, 647\nS.W.2d 246 (Tex.1983); Isuani v. Manske–Sheffield, 805 S.W.2d 602, 605 (Tex.App.—Beaumont 1991, writ denied); Green v.\nUnauthorized Practice of Law Committee, 883 S.W.2d 293 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1994, no writ) (a prevailing, successful petitioner\nfor injunctive relief must demonstrate the following grounds: (1) the existence of a wrongful act; (2) the existence of imminent\nharm; (3) the existence of irreparable injury; and (4) the absence of an adequate and realistically complete remedy.); Univ.\nInterscholastic League v.

Warren Petroleum Co.,\n814 S.W.2d 526, 529 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist] 1991, writ denied).\n\nThe trial court merely made the following conclusion of law:\n\n  “1. Absent injunctive relief, defendants are likely to continue to engage in the tortious conduct found by the jury to be in\n  violation of Plaintiff clinics and physicians' common law and constitutional rights, and such conduct is likely to cause plaintiff\n  clinics and physician irreparable harm.” (Emphasis added)\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\n\n\nThere is no language in such conclusion which directly stated or implied there was at the time of trial a threat of imminent\nharm. The Republican National Convention had long since been over as well as the picketing activities the subject of this action.\nThere *89 was no threat of imminent harm, and the trial court found none. For this reason alone the injunctive portion of the\njudgment should be held void and reversed and rendered in favor of the appellants.\n\nThe question regarding “imminent harm” cannot be deemed because the appellants submitted jury question and instruction no.\n4 to the court asking whether the appellees were subject to imminent harm. The court refused such question and instruction.\n\n2. There was no irreparable harm notwithstanding the finding in the above stated conclusion no. 1. Injunctive relief is not proper\nwhen an adequate remedy at law, i.e. a claim for damages, was available. Id. at 530; Mitchison v. Houston I.S.D., 803 S.W.2d\n769 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist] 1991, writ denied) (a party demonstrates irreparable harm when he shows that an award\nof damages a month later will not provide adequate compensation). To state it is likely there will be harm in the future is not to\nsay it is an imminent threat. Further, the appellees recovered a jury verdict in the amount of $1,214,585 not including personal\ninjuries against the appellants. If this type award is not adequate, then it was the will of the jury, which could have made it\nmore. I believe the award is more than adequate under the circumstances. If there are any damages in the future, which is\nunlikely, another jury will be available to make the appellees whole. Damages awarded by the jury far exceeded any out of\npocket expenses of the appellees.\n\n3. The trial court failed to state reasons for its issuance pursuant to Rule 683 Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 683 requires\nthe court in every order granting an injunction to set forth the reason for its issuance. Further, the reasons shall be specific in\nterms and shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or document, the act or acts sought to be\nrestrained. Rule 683 Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nThe trial court made the following findings:\n\n  1. Defendants' conduct threatens access to plaintiff clinics by women seeking abortion and other medical services; [in Point\n     of Error 25]\n\n  2. Defendants' conduct threatens the use and enjoyment of plaintiff clinics' and physicians' property rights; [in Point of Error\n     26]\n\n  3. Defendants' aggressive and harassing manner of protesting and sidewalk counseling of clinic patients increases the risk\n     attendant to the abortion procedure; [in Point of Error 27]\n\n  4. Defendants' targeted picketing of plaintiff physicians' homes threatens and interferes with plaintiff physicians' right of\n     privacy [;] [in Point of Error 28]\n\n  5. Defendants have not abandoned their activities toward plaintiffs, but (1) remain committed to their particular protest tactics\n     and would use them again toward plaintiffs if the circumstances (such as a national media event in Houston) presented\n     itself; (2) have aided and abetted others in continuing to engage in conduct that is either tortious or in violation of plaintiffs'\n     constitutional rights; and (3) principle (sic) defendants, and those found by the jury to have acted with malice, are either\n     locally based (such as Rescue America and Don Treshman) or have recently increased their organizational presence in\n     Texas (Operation Rescue—National[;] [in Point of Error 29])\n\n  6. Despite existing injunctions imposing place and manner restrictions on defendants' protect activities targeting plaintiff\n     clinics, defendants (or those found by the jury to be acting in concert with them) have continued to engage in protest\n     activity toward some of the clinics using tactics that are harassing to patients and clinic staffs, that is violative of clinics'\n     common law and constitutional rights, and that threatens safe, accessible abortions for women seeking medical services\n     at plaintiff clinics.

Planned Parenthood of Houston..., 937 S.W.2d 60 (1996)\n\n\nThese findings are conclusions and do not state the act or acts sought to be restrained. They do not state facts which they\ncould even be tested. This is important because the court was stating reasons to enjoin twenty- *90 eight different parties. The\ndiffering operative facts as to all such parties, including where located, militate against the sweep treatment the court displayed\nfor permanent injunction purposes. The Court failed to state what conduct the appellants were protesting or what they did.\n\nThe trial court must state these reasons without any request of the parties. The Court was not required to make findings of fact\nand conclusions of law as this was a jury case. Rule 296 Texas Rules Civil Procedure specifically provides that findings may\nbe requested in any case tried “without an jury.” Therefore, the reasons for injunction could not be waived for not asking for\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law as suggested by the majority.\n\n4. The Permanent Injunction is unconstitutionally overbroad. The Permanent Injunction portion of the judgment provides in\nSection E that appellants are prohibited from “demonstrating” within described zones that circumvent nine facilities belonging\nto appellees. “Demonstrating” was defined as “oral or other expression that publicly displays, manifests, or expresses one's\nfeelings or opinions ... and expressly includes ‘sidewalk counseling.’ ” These zones also extend from the edges of the properties\ninto any adjoining public streets, approximately to the center line of the respective streets adjoining each of the facilities.\nThe zones are shown on plats of each facility attached as exhibits to the judgment. The Planned Parenthood facility also has\ntwo protected corridors, fifteen feet wide, extending from two parking lots across the public streets to the facility. The widest\nzone is thirty-two feet (Women's Medical Center of N.W. Houston) and the narrowest zone is fifteen feet (AAA Concerned\nWomen's Center). Similarly, Section I of the judgment provides restrictions pertaining to the five physician appellees prohibiting\n“congregating, picketing, patrolling, or demonstrating” within thirteen foot zones extending from their respective property lines\ninto the adjoining streets.\n\nThe record does not show any evidence that “such measures are essential to preserve the right of clinic access, and that each\nsatisfies fully the standard we have required under the Texas Constitution” as required by Ex Parte Tucci, 859 S.W.2d 1, 7\n(Tex.1993). Tucci held: “Unless such a restriction is proved to be the least restrictive means of guarding against an irreparable\nand imminent injury, it is an impermissible infringement on our state constitutional right of free expression.” Id.\n\nIn Tucci, Rev. Keith Tucci, and six other abortion protestors, had been held in contempt for violating a temporary restraining\norder previously entered in these proceedings. The parties, four of whom are appellants in this appeal, brought original habeas\ncorpus proceeding in the Texas Supreme Court asserting they had been confined for expression which is protected under article\nI, section 8 of the Texas Constitution (freedom of expression). The temporary restraining order, in part, barred demonstrating\nwithin one hundred (100) feet of any of the nine clinics, appellees in this appeal. The relators in Tucci did not attack any\nof the other provisions of the restraining orders but challenged only the one-hundred foot limitation as unconstitutional. The\nconfinement of relators was premised solely on their having disregarded portions of the one-hundred foot limitation. The other\nprovisions of the restraining orders were clearly directed to protecting against the specific injuries alleged by the women, clinics\nand businesses and access by injunctive relief that barred:\n\n             [t]respassing on, physically invading, entering without consent, damaging, sitting in, blocking, impeding\n             or obstructing access to, ingress into or egress from any part of the Planned Parenthood 1 facility ...,\n             including the entrances and exits, the parking lots ..., and any of the clinic's or parking lots' entrances\n             and driveways.\n\n\nAdditionally, the temporary restraining orders contained four independent provisions to guard against intimidation and\nharassment that prohibited:\n\n  Demonstrating within twenty-five (25) feet of any person seeking access to or leaving the clinic, its parking lots, or\n  intervenors' businesses or parking lots, or in any way *91 impeding such person's entrance to or exit from the clinic, parking\n  lots or businesses;\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Tucci mandates\nthat such restrictions must be justified by a proper evidentiary showing that such measures are essential to preserve the rights\nof clinic access and that such restrictions are the least intrusive as to individual liberties. Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 7.\n\nThe judgment contains provisions clearly directed to protecting against the specific injuries alleged by the women and clinics.\nInjunctive relief bars:\n\n  A. Entering without consent upon or damaging any part of the premises, facilities and parking lots of [the nine clinics].\n\n  B. Blocking or attempting to block, barricade, or in any other manner obstruct the entrances to, or the premises of [the nine\n    clinics].\n\n  C. Inhibiting, impeding, obstructing or interfering with, or attempting to inhibit, impede, or obstruct or interfere with the free\n    and unmolested ingress and egress of persons (either pedestrian or vehicular) to and from the facilities and parking lots\n    and the streets and sidewalks adjacent to the facilities and parking lots of [the nine clinics].\n\n  D. Touching, physically abusing, intimidating, or harassing any individual attempting to enter or exit the facilities or parking\n    lots of [the nine clinics].\n\nSection E, as written in the judgment, concerning “demonstrating” violates Article I, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution, as\nset out in this opinion. However, the above restrictions A through D would be the least restrictive means to protect against the\nintimidation and harassment complained of. Sections A through D are the least restrictive means that are essential to preserve\nthe right of clinic access or if there is evidence to prove that demonstration-free zones would be the least restrictive means to\nprotect a woman's right to have an abortion as set out in Tucci at 7.\n\nFor the same reasons, the restrictions in Sections F through H, that pertain to the residences of the physicians specifically\nprovide for injunctive relief that would protect the physicians against the conduct complained of. These restrictions are:\n\n  F. Trespassing on, sitting in, blocking or impeding plaintiff physicians, their family members and their guests or invitees\n     from access to, ingress into or egress from any part of plaintiff physicians' residences.\n\n  G. Inhibiting, impeding or attempting to impede or inhibit the free ingress or egress of any person to the streets that provide\n    access to the streets on which the plaintiff physicians' residences are located;\n\n  H. Harassing, threatening, assaulting, or physically abusing plaintiff physicians, their family members, guests or invitees.\n\nHowever, Section I of the judgment providing for the 13 foot zone is likewise void under Tucci as there was no evidence\nintroduced at the trial or at the hearing on the *92 injunction that would prove that such a zone would be the least restrictive\nmeans to prevent the harm complained of.

Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988). In Frisby, abortion protestors brought suit seeking\nto enjoin the enforcement of a municipal ordinance prohibiting picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any\nindividual. The Court found that the ordinance did not ban all picketing in residential areas, but only prohibited focused picketing\ntaking place solely in front of particular residences. The ordinance served a significant government interest of protecting\nresidential privacy. An important aspect of such privacy is the protection of unwilling listeners within their homes from the\nintrusion of objectionable or unwanted speech. The ordinance is “narrowly tailored” to serve that governmental interest, since\nit targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of “evil” it seeks to remedy: offensive and disturbing picketing focused\non a “captive” home audience. It does not prohibit more generally directed means of public communication that may not be\ncompletely banned. Id. 487 U.S. at 487–89, 108 S.Ct. at 2504. Although injunctive relief is available to prevent picketing, similar\nto the picketing in Frisby, Tucci mandates an evidentiary hearing to prove that a buffer zone, such as is the case here, is the least\nrestrictive means of preventing this harm. Section I could read: “Congregating, picketing, patrolling, or demonstrating in front\nof the [physician's] residence” if the court finds this is the least restrictive means of preventing the harm. Id; see also Ex Parte\nPierce, 161 Tex. 524, 342 S.W.2d 424, 427 (1961) (Constitutional protection of the right to free speech and free assembly does\nnot license interference with and obstruction of public ways or entrances to and exists from places of business by picketing).\n\nFurther, I would reverse and remand the damages portion (including punitive) of the judgment for the following reasons:\n\nThe appellants' complaint that the trial court refused to include in the charge a complete definition of the essential elements\nof an actionable civil conspiracy as requested has merit. Omitted over objection were the essential elements: (1) one or more\novert acts, and (2) damages resulting from the conspiracy. Massey v. Armco Steel Company, 652 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex.1983);\nMetzger v. Sebek, 892 S.W.2d 20 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1994, writ denied). The essential elements are:\n\n             The plaintiff in a civil conspiracy action must show the following elements: (1) two or more persons; (2)\n             an object to be accomplished; (3) a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more\n             unlawful, overt acts; and (5) damages as the proximate result. Massey, 652 S.W.2d at 934; Bernstein v.\n             Portland Sav. and Loan Ass'n, 850 S.W.2d 694, 705 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ denied) The\n             “unlawful, overt acts” must be acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. Massey, 652 S.W.2d at 934.\n\nIn Massey the court held plaintiffs had not alleged a cause of action for conspiracy because of failure to allege an unlawful\novert act. Harmful error resulted from such omission because the definition of conspiracy was the basis of appellees' causes\nof action. The first two questions to establish liability on the appellants and questions 3 through 9 establishing damages use\nthe term “conspiracy.” It is obvious it was harmful to appellants because a $1,214,585 judgment was rendered against them.\nThis judgment does not include damages for personal injuries, and seems excessive for what was involved. The jury could very\nwell have decided the case differently had the omitted elements been included by the trial judge. The error, in light of the entire\nrecord, was reasonably calculated to and probably did cause the rendition of an improper judgment. Reinhart v.

Because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the\nsupplemental temporary injunction order.\n\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\nAt the supplemental temporary injunction hearing, the court admitted evidence of a printed copy of West's Web site, testimony\nfrom an investigator employed by the Consumer Protection and Public Health Division of the Texas Attorney General's office,\nand documents from Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge provided in response to the State's civil investigative demand. The\ninvestigator's testimony and the Web site evidence revealed that West used an Austin radio commercial, a recorded telephone\nmessage (identified as a “phone overview”), and a Web site to advertise meetings at a local hotel about a “banking opportunity”\nthat would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal debt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles,\nloans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before December 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank.\nWest's “www.bankopp.com ” Web site also stated that “David [West] found a Bank that is willing to give individuals loans to\npay off their debts. Then the Bank is willing to turn around and forgive that loan so it doesn't have to be paid off.” It asserted that\n“two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking and Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The\nsite claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,” the “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the\nproject to take place this once. While the system intended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage\nof this, it was never intended that regular every day people would gain access to it.”\n\nThe site further claimed that the unnamed bank had agreed to pay off $100 million in debt and that “[the] project is about David\n[West]'s looking for others to add their debt to the pile David started.” The idea was to accumulate $100 million in debt for\nthe bank to “fractionalize then forgive” so that “the bank can make money and the folks with David can get out of debt.” The\nsite claimed that, after “David told his 10 closest friends about the project,” word spread quickly throughout Louisiana and\nMississippi. The site also explained that West accelerated its marketing of the project following Hurricane Katrina:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These Open Meetings will have hundreds of people in attendance and are expected to\n             help reach[ ] the goal of $100 Million in debt before Thanksgiving. This would leave plenty of time for\n             the bank to pay before December 31st (the bank only needs 10 business days).\n\n\nAs a signal of their “commitment to be involved with the project,” the site asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of\n$5,000 to a bank account in Panama, or to the “Del Sur International Holdings” account with Hibernia National Bank in Baton\nRouge. According to the site, after the money was submitted, the bank would perform a financial analysis and might contact\nthe participant to discuss any issues: “[T]he bank will analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are\nconcerns.” Also after wiring their $5,000 “commitment/deposit money,” the site stated that participants would receive *516\na document “guarantee[ing] that the loan that [they] are signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\nVisitors to the Web site were not informed that the Del Sur International Holdings account, to which the $5,000 wire transfers\nwere directed, was the sole proprietorship of David West.\n\nThe State filed suit under the Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §§\n17.46(a)-(b), .47 (West Supp.2005) ( “DTPA”) against David West, Roxana Suadi West, 1 Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/\na www.bankopp.com, seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief based on the debt elimination “service for sale to consumers.”\nThe State obtained a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction against West, preventing any further marketing in\nTexas of the “banking opportunity.” 2\n\nAfter learning that David West attempted to withdraw all funds from the Baton Rouge account to which the participants' $5,000\nwire transfers had been directed, 3 the State obtained a supplemental restraining order, freezing the funds in the Hibernia\nbank account. The State also sought to convert the supplemental restraining order into a supplemental temporary injunction,\nmaintaining the freeze on the account. Following a hearing on October 25, 2005, the district court entered an order preventing\nDavid West, Roxana Suadi West, Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/a www.bankopp.com from accessing the Hibernia bank\naccount.\n\nSpecifically, the order enjoined them (and those associated with them) from\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from Account # [ ], held at Hibernia National Bank; and\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from any other financial institution and/or account into which Defendants have placed or caused\n     to be placed, funds from consumers to participate in Defendants' “bank opportunity.”\n\nThe order also set the case for trial.\n\nWest appeals only from the district court's October 25 supplemental temporary injunction order that froze the assets in the\nHibernia bank account. It asserts that the district court abused its discretion by entering the supplemental temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance. We consider each of these assertions.\n\n\n\n                                                        DISCUSSION\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 212 S.W.3d 513 (2006)\n\n\n [1] [2] [3] The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo of the litigation's subject matter pending\ntrial on the merits. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex.2002). Because the decision to grant or deny a *517\ntemporary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we will not disturb that decision absent a clear abuse\nof discretion. Id. at 204. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, indulging every reasonable\ninference in its favor. Brammer v. K.B. Home Lone Star, L.P., 114 S.W.3d 101, 105–06 (Tex.App.-Austin 2003, no pet.). This\nCourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court unless its action was so arbitrary that it exceeded the bounds\nof reasonable discretion. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. The trial court does not abuse its discretion if some evidence reasonably\nsupports its decision. Id. at 211.\n\n\nProbable right to recovery\n [4] In its first issue, West argues that the district court erred in granting the temporary injunction because the State did not\ndemonstrate a probable right to recovery. West asserts that the transaction at issue is a loan of money, which is neither a “good”\nnor a “service” under the DTPA. See Riverside Nat'l Bank v. Lewis, 603 S.W.2d 169, 174 (Tex.1980); see also Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(1), (2) (West 2002). West argues that the DTPA applies to transactions in which the borrower's\nobjective is to purchase or lease goods or services, but the DTPA is inapplicable if a borrower's objective is merely an attempt\nto acquire money. See La Sara Grain Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Mercedes, 673 S.W.2d 558, 566–67 (Tex.1984); Megason v.\nRed River Employees Fed. Credit Union, 868 S.W.2d 871, 872 (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1993, no writ).\n\nThe State responds that West's “banking opportunity” is not a “loan” because it specifies that repayment is unnecessary. Cf.\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 301.002(a)(10) (West Supp.2005) (defining “loan” as “an advance of money that is made to or on behalf\nof an obligor, the principal amount of which the obligor has an obligation to pay the creditor”). Alternatively, the State argues\nthat West is offering a loan forgiveness service.\n\nThe district court's finding of a probable right to recovery under the DTPA is supported by the evidence that West's Web site,\noffers a service—specifically, the elimination of debt—in exchange for $5,000. According to the site, after the money was\nsubmitted, “the bank [would] analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are concerns.” The site also\ninformed the public that, after wiring $5,000, participants would receive a document “guarantee [ing] that the loan that [they]\nare signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\n\n“Services” are defined in the DTPA as “work, labor, or service purchased or leased for use, including services furnished in\nconnection with the sale or repair of goods.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(2). The State's suit complains that West's\nservice violates the DTPA because it (1) fails to disclose the factual basis for its representations that David West has found a\nbank willing to give individuals “loans” to pay their debts without expectation of repayment and (2) encourages consumers to\nwire $5,000 to an account that is not identified as belonging to David West.\n\nThe debt elimination opportunity that West offered is similar to the function of a “credit services organization,” defined in the\nfinance code as\n\n  a person who provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, for the payment of valuable consideration, any of\n  the following services with respect to the extension of consumer credit by others:\n\n  (A) improving a consumer's credit history or rating;\n\n  (B) obtaining an extension of consumer credit for a consumer; or\n\n   *518 (C) providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to Paragraph (A) or (B).\n\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 393.001 (West 1998). A credit services organization is prohibited from making false or misleading\nrepresentations in the offer or sale of its services, including any unfounded guarantees to “erase bad credit” or to obtain an\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

State, 212 S.W.3d 513 (2006)\n\n\nextension of consumer credit “regardless of credit history.” Id. § 393.304 (West 1998). A violation of chapter 393 is actionable\nunder the DTPA. Id. § 393.504 (West 1998).\n\nOne company was held to have been a credit services organization based on its:\n\n  • television commercials “targeting consumers with debt problems and urging them to contact [the company] for relief from\n     these woes;”\n\n  • printed materials informing a debtor that it could assist in obtaining and repairing credit; and\n\n  • Web site, which stated that the company could provide advice or assistance to “empower debtors [to] make an informed\n    decision on how to manage, service or liquidate their debts.”\n\nIn re Zuniga, 332 B.R. 760, 786 (Bankr.S.D.Tex., 2005) (applying Texas law). These activities parallel West's “banking\nopportunity”—advertised on the radio, in a telephone message, and on the Web—offering debt elimination, for $5,000 as\nspecified on the Web site, to any “U.S. Citizen” for any type of debt through a “loan” that would not require repayment. The\nservice West promoted on its Web site included financial analysis, by which “the bank [would] analyze each project member's\ndebt and provide feedback if there are concerns.”\n\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the State demonstrated a probable right to\nrecovery under the DTPA. We overrule West's first issue.\n\n\nProbable injury\n [5] In its second issue, West argues that the district court erred in granting the temporary injunction because the State did not\ndemonstrate a probable injury prior to final trial on the merits. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204. Probable injury includes elements\nof imminent harm, irreparable harm, and lack of an adequate remedy at law. Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson, 24\nS.W.3d 570, 577 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, no pet.) (citing Surko Enters., Inc. v. Borg–Warner Acceptance Corp., 782 S.W.2d\n223, 225 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ)).\n\nWest argues that the State did not produce any competent evidence that money in the Hibernia bank account in Louisiana\nbelonged to any Texas consumer or that West would dissipate the funds from the account. The State contends that the common\nlaw requirements for a temporary injunction—including balancing of the equities, proof of irreparable harm or injury, and lack\nof an adequate remedy at law—are inapplicable when the State is seeking statutorily-authorized injunctive relief. See Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.47(a). Section 17.47 of the DTPA states that\n\n             whenever the consumer protection division has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has\n             engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice declared to be unlawful by this subchapter, and\n             that proceedings would be in the public interest, the division may bring an action in the name of the\n             state against the person to restrain by temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, or permanent\n             injunction the use of such method, act, or practice.\n\nId. The Texas Supreme Court has ruled that “when it is determined that [a] statute is being violated, it is within the province\nof the district court to restrain it.” State *519 v. Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d 800, 805 (Tex.1979) (affirming award of\npermanent injunctive relief based on threatened violation of environmental statutes). The court observed that the doctrine of\nbalancing the equities had no application to statutorily-authorized injunctive relief. Id.\n\nTexas courts have likewise held that when an applicant relies upon a statutory source for injunctive relief, such as the DTPA,\nthe statute's express language supersedes the common law injunctive relief elements such as imminent harm or irreparable\ninjury and lack of an adequate remedy at law. See, e.g., Shields v. State, 27 S.W.3d 267, 273 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, no pet.)\n(State need not prove likelihood of future violations because injunctive relief available under Securities Act for past acts alone);\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Brazoria\nCounty, 497 S.W.2d 614, 619 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist] 1973, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (State need not prove irreparable injury\nto be entitled to injunction under Open Beach Act); see also Household Retail Servs., Inc. v. State, No. 04–00–00734–CV,\n2001 Tex.App. LEXIS 5893, at *9, 2001 WL 984779, at *3, (Tex.App.-San Antonio Aug.29, 2001, no pet.) (holding that when\nlegislature authorized attorney general to seek injunctions on behalf of multiple consumers, it determined that past or threatened\nDTPA violation coupled with public need constituted sufficient “irreparable risk of harm” to support entry of injunction).\n\n [6] Accordingly, the State argues that, to be entitled to a temporary injunction under the DTPA, it need only demonstrate to\nthe court its reason to believe that (1) any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice\ndeclared to be unlawful by the DTPA, and (2) that proceedings would be in the public interest. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code\nAnn. § 17.47(a). The fact that a person has ceased its unlawful conduct will not affect the State's entitlement to injunctive relief.\nId. Furthermore, the DTPA authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary to compensate\nidentifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by\nmeans of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d) (emphasis added).\n\nAt the October 25 hearing on the supplemental temporary injunction, the State introduced evidence of West's\n“www.bankopp.com ” Web site, promoting a “banking opportunity” that would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal\ndebt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles, loans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before\nDecember 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank. The site contained repeated assertions that participants will not\nrepay the bank because the “loans” will be forgiven. It claimed that “two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking\nand Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The site also claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,”\nthe “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the project to take place this once. While the system\nintended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage of this, it was never intended that regular every\nday people would gain access to it.” The site also asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of $5,000—as a signal of their\n“commitment *520 to be involved with the project”—to a bank account in Panama, or to an account with Hibernia National\nBank in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe State also introduced into evidence documents that the Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge, Louisiana provided in\nresponse to the State's civil investigative demand. The documents included a commercial new account information card for\nDel Sur International Holdings and its “sole proprietorship resolution certificate,” along with a copy of a Louisiana driver's\nlicense issued to David Jason West. These documents show that David West opened a free small business checking account\nwith $100 cash at Hibernia on August 8, 2005, under the business name of Del Sur International Holdings. He is the sole owner\nand signatory on the account. The account number assigned to the Del Sur International Holdings checking account matches\nthe account number on the Web site to which the participants' $5,000 wire transfers had been directed. The Web site does not\ndisclose that the $5,000 transfers of participants' “commitment money” were deposited into an account owned by David West.\n\nBased on this evidence, the district court determined that West “may be violating the DTPA” and that the State's action “was\nin the public interest.” Indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the court's order as we must, we conclude that there is\nsufficient evidence to support the court's findings in accordance with section 17.47(a). Thus, we overrule West's second issue.\n\n\nSpecificity of order under rule 683\n [7] [8] In its third issue, West claims that the district court's temporary injunction violated rule 683 because it did not state\nthe reasons for its order with specificity. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. West argues that the district court's order does not specifically\nstate the reasons why injury will be suffered if the interlocutory relief is not ordered. West also faults the order for its failure to\nstate why the identified probable injury is an irreparable one for which the State has no adequate legal remedy. Under Rule 683\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              7\n\fDavid Jason West and Pydia, Inc. v. State, 212 S.W.3d 513 (2006)\n\n\n\n\n  [e]very order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific\n  in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought\n  to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys,\n  and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service\n  or otherwise.\n\n  Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the\n  ultimate relief sought. The appeal of a temporary injunction shall constitute no cause for delay of the trial.\n\nTex.R. Civ. P. 683.\n\nThe State responds that West waived its complaint about the specificity of the court's order by failing to object when the court\ninquired about its agreement to the form of the order. Because we conclude that the order was sufficiently specific under rule\n683, we need not address the waiver issue. 4\n\n *521 Relying on rule 693, the State responds that “the principles, practice and procedure governing courts of equity shall\ngovern proceedings in injunctions when the same are not in conflict with these rules or the provisions of the statutes.” Tex.R.\nCiv. P. 693 (emphasis added); see also Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d at 805 (“When it is determined that the statute is\nbeing violated, it is within the province of the district court to restrain it .... [t]he doctrine of balancing the equities has no\napplication to this statutorily authorized injunctive relief.”).\n\nThe State reiterates that section 17.47(a) of the DTPA authorizes the State's consumer protection division to bring an action\nfor injunctive relief when “it has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in\nany act or practice declared to be unlawful by [the DTPA], and that proceedings would be in the public interest.” Tex. Bus. &\nCom.Code Ann. § 17.47(a). The DTPA also authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary\nto compensate identifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been\nacquired by means of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d). The State contends that the order is proper because it contains\nthe essential findings that “Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer\nProtection Act,” and that “this action is in the public interest.”\n\nThe court found that the freeze was necessary to prevent West from dissipating funds in the account to which the participants'\nwire transfers had been directed:\n\n            [U]nless Defendants are immediately restrained from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate\n            funds obtained from consumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices\n            Act, before a full trial can be held on the merits of the State's claims. To the extent required by law,\n            Plaintiff [State] has proved that continued violation of these laws will continue to cause Plaintiff and the\n            general public to suffer irreparable harm.\n\nWe conclude that this order complied with the statutory prerequisites under section 17.47(a) of the DTPA by finding that\n“Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act,” and that\n“this action is in the public interest.” The order also satisfied the specificity requirement of rule 683 by finding that, “unless\nDefendants are immediately restrained *522 from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate funds obtained from\nconsumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, before a full trial can be held on the\nmerits of the State's claims.” Accordingly, we overrule West's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

PATTERSON, Justice.\n\n*1 This is an accelerated appeal from an order granting a temporary injunction. R & R Resources Corporation is the operator\nand a working interest 1 owner of three oil and gas wells—the Ullrich, Goebel Brothers, and Toennis—located in Fayette\nCounty. Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Tex–El Oil and Gas, Inc., and BairTex Energy, Inc. are also working interest owners.\nR & R Resources appeals a temporary injunction entered against it that prevents it from opposing the designation of Leexus\nOil & Gas, L.L.P. as the new operator of the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells. R & R Resources challenges the trial court's\norder as an abuse of discretion, arguing that the order violated the rules of equity and that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex did not\ndemonstrate standing to seek injunctive relief, a probable right of recovery, or irreparable injury. R & R Resources's reply brief\nadded two issues: (i) that R & R Resources was denied an opportunity to be heard at a subsequent status hearing on September\n9, 2005, and (ii) that the trial court's order was impermissibly speculative. Because we find that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by granting the temporary injunction, we affirm the trial court's order.\n\n\n\n                                                        BACKGROUND\n\nEchelon, Tex–El, and BairTex are in the business of purchasing and selling interests in oil and gas producing properties. As\npart of this business, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex purchased certain working interests in the Ullrich, Goebel Brothers, and\nToennis oil and gas wells. 2 The parties operate the wells under two identical joint operating agreements, the 1989 American\nAssociation of Petroleum Landmen Form 610 Model Form Operating Agreements. These forms are agreements between oil and\ngas lease owners and interest holders for the exploration and development of oil and gas within the “contract area” described in\nthe agreements. The agreements in this case designate R & R Resources as the “Operator,” that conducts, directs, and controls\noperations in the contract area. All other parties to the agreements—Echelon, Tex–El, 3 and BairTex—are designated as “Non–\nOperators.”\n\nThe parties conducted business through their respective corporate presidents: Frederick Doutel, Jr. of R & R Resources, Roger\nSlayton of Tex–El, Randal Snider of Echelon, and Warren Bair of BairTex. On November 14, 2003, after Slayton complained\nto Doutel about R & R Resources's operations and accounting procedures concerning the wells, Doutel sent an e-mail offering\nto arrange for Slayton to “take over operations on [the] Goebel, Ullrich and/or Toennis” wells “th[at] afternoon.” Later that\nday, Doutel sent another e-mail to Slayton stating, “Sorry, we'll do it December 1st. You will be the operator.”\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              4\n\fR & R Resources Corp. v. Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2006)\n2006 WL 66458\n\n\nShortly afterward, Slayton sought to audit R & R Resources's books and requested that, at the completion of the audit, the\nparties sign the Texas Railroad Commission's P–4 forms that would change the operator to Echelon. 4 On November 24, 2003,\nDoutel wrote a letter to Slayton, copied to Snider and Bair, stating that R & R Resources would convey operations of the Ullrich\nand Toennis wells but would retain operation of the Goebel Brothers well. His letter also stated that R & R Resources was\n“working up a letter agreement regarding conditions for operator transfer,” including a requirement that the new operator use\nparticular vendors. Tex–El, Echelon, and BairTex audited R & R Resources's books in December 2003, but afterward Doutel\ndid not sign the P–4 forms.\n\n *2 Unsuccessful in its attempts to have R & R Resources transfer operation of the wells, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex retained\ncounsel. Their attorney wrote to Doutel on April 30, 2004, advising that his clients, who were “majority interest” owners in\nthe three wells, had voted to remove R & R Resources as operator for “good cause” pursuant to the joint operating agreements'\nterms. The letter proceeded to list the ways in which R & R Resources had “failed and refused to act as a reasonably prudent\noperator.”Counsel's letter also demanded that R & R Resources: (i) relinquish operation of the wells to a new operator to be\ndesignated by Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex, and (ii) pay a refund owed to them. Doutel's May 28 response letter denied the\nrequest to relinquish operation of the wells and stated that he had instructed his accountant to remit the funds due to Echelon,\nTex–El, and BairTex within ten days. 5 Doutel's response did not address the other allegations in counsel's letter. Bill Jaehne of\nLeexus Oil & Gas also called Doutel to ask whether he would turn the operations over to Leexus, but Doutel refused.\n\nAlmost four months after sending its demand letter, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex (collectively, the “Non–Operators”)\nrequested the Texas Railroad Commission's approval of single-signature P–4 forms designating Leexus Oil & Gas, L.L.P. as\nthe new operator of the three wells. The request explained that, although R & R Resources had been removed as operator under\nthe terms of the joint operating agreements because of its “operational and/or billing discrepancies,” R & R Resources refused\nto cease operations and transfer the P–4s to another operator. The Commission requested a response from R & R Resources in\nsupport of R & R Resources's good faith claim to operate the leases. It noted that R & R Resources was not required to refute\nLeexus's good faith claim but only to substantiate R & R Resources's own good faith claim to operate the wells.\n\nOn November 19, 2004, after R & R Resources responded with copies of the wells' leases and operating agreements, the\nCommission informed the parties that “[w]hether Leexus is entitled to become the designated operator of the subject leases\nappears to turn on the question of whether the owners of a majority of the working interest in the leases had the right to remove R\n& R Resources as operator.”The Commission stated that it lacked jurisdiction to construe the terms of the operating agreements,\ndetermine what constituted “good cause” for removal under the agreements, and otherwise determine the parties' contractual\nrights. Accordingly, it deferred these determinations to the courts and declined to process the single-signature P–4s.\n\nThe Non–Operators filed suit against R & R Resources on May 18, 2005, and sought a temporary injunction. On July 1, 2005,\nafter a two-day hearing held on June 15 and 17, the trial court entered an order preventing R & R Resources from opposing\nthe designation of Leexus as the operator of the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease. 6 In summary, the order enjoined\nR & R Resources from\n\n\n   *3 • refusing to join in the immediate execution and delivery of proper joint form P–4s designating Leexus as the operator\n    for and of the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease;\n\n       • interfering, opposing, preventing or refusing to cooperate with Plaintiffs' and/or Leexus's efforts to file and obtain\n          approval from the Texas Railroad Commission of joint form P–4s designating Leexus (for Commission purposes) as\n          the operator of the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease;\n\n       • further operating or performing operations on the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease following the Commission's\n          approval of the joint form P–4s;\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

When R & R Resources\n      did not comply with the injunction, the Non–Operators sought this Court's emergency enforcement of the order pending\n      resolution of R & R Resources's interlocutory appeal. We granted the motion.\nAfter R & R Resources did not comply with our order enforcing the trial court's temporary injunction, the Non–Operators filed\na motion for contempt, and R & R Resources filed a motion for reconsideration of our order based on an in camera inspection\nof documents that the trial court was to begin on or about November 4, 2005. We have not received any order that the court\nmay have entered during or subsequent to the pretrial hearing on October 12, 2005.

SeeTex.R.App. P. 29.4(b); In re Sheshtawy, 154 S.W.3d 114, 124–125 (Tex.2004). We have not received\nthe trial court's findings and recommendations.

Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2006)\n2006 WL 66458\n\n [1] In its first issue, R & R Resources contends that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex lacked standing to request the temporary\ninjunction because they lack any direct ownership in the wells at issue. R & R Resources quotes language in the joint operating\nagreements that permits removal of the operator “by the affirmative vote of Non–Operators owning a majority interest.”But\nthe testimony at the temporary injunction hearing revealed that, although Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex sold portions of the\nworking interests that they had purchased, they also reserved portions of those oil and gas interests for themselves.\n\nAdditionally, Slayton and Bair testified that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex owned a majority of the working interest in the\nwells through participation or subscription agreements with their respective investors that had delegated decision-making and\nvoting authority over their interests to Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex. Slayton testified that Tex–El and its investors own 20%\nof the working interest in the Ullrich well and 15% of the working interest in the Goebel Brothers well. The parties, including\nR & R Resources, stipulated to the testimony concerning BairTex's and Echelon's interests in the wells. 7 With regard to the\nUllrich well, the parties stipulated to the testimony that BairTex and its investors own 12.40% of the working interest while\nEchelon and its investors own 36.20% of the working interest. The parties further stipulated to the testimony that, with regard\nto the Goebel Brothers well, BairTex and its investors own 10% of the working interest while Echelon and its investors own\n37% of the working interest. The parties also stipulated to the testimony that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex—along with their\ninvestors who purchased a portion of the working interests—collectively owned 69% of the total working interest in the Ullrich\nwell and 62% of the total working interest in the Goebel Brothers well.\n\n *5 [2] R & R Resources next contends that it had a statutory right to determine the identities of Echelon's, Tex–El's,\nand BairTex's investors and obtain their opinions on the lawsuit. SeeTex. Nat. Res.Code Ann. § 91.141(b) (West 2001). Its\nunderstanding of section 91.141 of the natural resources code entitles “any stockholder, or shareholder, or royalty owner in\nan oil well ” to inspect the records of any owners and operators of oil and gas wells. But that section of the code states that\n“[t]he books shall be kept open for inspection of the commission or any accredited representative of the commission and any\nstockholder, shareholder, or royalty owner in the business.” Id. (emphasis added). This statute requires Echelon, Tex–El, and\nBairTex each to keep its books open for its own stockholders, shareholders, and royalty interest owners. R & R Resources does\nnot cite any authority for its contention that the books must be opened to “any stockholder, or shareholder, or royalty owner\nin an oil well,” other than its interpretation of excerpts from section 91.141 of the natural resources code. We do not find its\nargument under section 91.141 persuasive.\n\n [3] R & R Resources's reliance on a contractual right to disclosure under the joint operating agreements is similarly misplaced.\nIt asserts that paragraph V.B.2 of the joint operating agreements entitles it to determine whether Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex\nconducted a valid vote or polling of their investors prior to removal of the operator. Paragraph V.B.2 of the agreements states\nthat the successor operator shall be selected by the affirmative vote of two or more parties owning a majority interest. As\npreviously noted, there was testimony at the hearing that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex owned a majority of the working interest\nin the wells through participation or subscription agreements with their respective investors and that each of these agreements\ndelegated decision-making and voting authority over their interests to Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex.\n\nThe trial court found that “Plaintiffs [Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex] own or, by virtue of written agreements with their\nrespective investors, exclusively control (including all voting and decision making rights) a majority of the working interest” in\nthe Ullrich and Goebel Brothers leases. The court further found that in April 2004, plaintiffs notified R & R Resources of their\naffirmative vote to remove R & R Resources as operator of the three leases. Because there was some evidence adduced at the\nhearing that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex have direct ownership in the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells, that their interests\ncombined with those of their investors constituted a majority, and that they affirmatively voted to remove R & Resources as\noperator, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in determining that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex had standing to\nrequest a temporary injunction. We overrule R & R Resources's first issue.\n\n\nProbable, Imminent, and Irreparable Injury\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2006)\n2006 WL 66458\n\n *6 [4] In its second issue, R & R Resources argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding “irreparable injury”\nbecause Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex did not establish that they would sustain imminent, irreparable injury without the entry\nof a temporary injunction. R & R Resources also argues that the Non–Operators have an adequate legal remedy in the form of\na contractual suit for damages. Probable injury includes elements of imminent harm, irreparable harm, and lack of an adequate\nremedy at law for damages.Telephone Equip. Network, Inc. v. TA/Westchase Place, Ltd., 80 S.W.3d 601, 607 (Tex.App.-\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.). An injury is irreparable if the injured party cannot be adequately compensated in damages\nor if the damages cannot be measured by any certain pecuniary standard. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204.An adequate legal remedy\nis one that is as complete, practical, and efficient to the prompt administration of justice as is equitable relief.Universal Health\nServs., 24 S.W.3d at 577.\n\nR & R Resources argues that the wells at issue have produced oil and gas in paying quantities under its operatorship, that it\nhas made proportional distributions of this income each month, and that the audit of its financial records did not reveal any\nunpaid invoices, pollution, loss of acreage, liens, or claims against the wells. But Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex introduced\nevidence that R & R Resources was billing them for expenses incurred at least two months earlier, or expenses incurred in the\nsame month as the billing, that their revenues were reduced by the amount of these untimely billings, and that R & R Resources\ndelayed paying the expenses for several months despite its ability to pay them. There was evidence that the Goebel Brothers\nrefund was not paid until seventeen months after the well was drilled, $100,000 of the Goebel Brothers well expenses were\nunpaid for ten months, revenue checks to some owners were dated weeks before they were mailed, and the audit of R & R\nResources raised questions about whether certain bills were paid at all.\n\nMark Jaehne of Leexus testified that, although he received checks for his override interest from Doutel in three or four weeks\nfrom the time the check was “cut,” Doutel was further behind because Doutel's check represented payment for the preceding\nmonth's production; it was not an advance payment. Jaehne explained that if Tex–On, an oil and gas gatherer, typically wired\npayment to Doutel on the 20th, but Doutel did not write a check to the interest owner until the 5th of the next month and did\nnot mail it until three or four weeks after the date on that check, the interest owner would not be paid for production until sixty\nto seventy-five days after Doutel received payment. Jaehne also testified that he had a conversation with Tex–On about being\npaid directly, but Doutel would not allow Tex–On to make such direct payments.\n\nJaehne further testified that continual late payments may cause vendors to refuse to extend credit, charge higher prices, or refuse\nto provide services. He testified that R & R Resources's operational charges were excessive; that the price it received from\nthe sale of salvage was too low; that it failed to install continuous chemical treating systems, the lack of which can corrode\nequipment and affect production; and that it failed to adequately determine the need for replacement materials and equipment.\nAdditionally, Snider testified that Leexus could do a better job, had more experience, more personnel, and a better location.\n\n *7 Slayton characterized Doutel's demeanor as, “I'm going to do it the way I'm going to do it and you can like it or dislike\nit.”Slayton also testified that an investor on the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells resolved never to invest with Slayton again\nbecause the “operational bills were too high,” and that vendors complained about the way their bills had been handled by R &\nR Resources. Doutel testified that he was “not concerned about what vendors think.”\n\n [5] Ongoing and continuing harm resulting from an operator's refusal to relinquish operations is at least one basis for finding\nirreparable injury in support of a temporary injunction. See Tri–Star Petroleum Co. v. Tipperary Corp., 101 S.W.3d 583, 591\n(Tex.App.-El Paso 2003, pet. denied). Moreover, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex made claims for cloud on title and injury to\nreal property, which do not require a showing that an adequate legal remedy is lacking to support an award of injunctive relief.\nSeeTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 65.011(4)-(5) (West 1997). The trial court's order found that Echelon, Tex–El, and\nBairTex would suffer injury for which there was no adequate remedy at law, noting that R & R Resources's improper accounting\nand operational practices\n\n            have caused and will continue to cause loss and/or delay of revenue; payment of excessive and/or\n            unnecessary lease/well expenses; late payment of lease/well expenses; exposure to lease/well creditors\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2006)\n2006 WL 66458\n\n            for non or late payment; the loss, interruption, and/or delay in production of valuable minerals; and the\n            injury and/or damage to the well bores and/or equipment and materials located on the leases/wells.\n\nThe trial court also determined that the above damages would continue to occur so long as R & R Resources was operating the\nlease and that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex and their respective investors lacked an adequate legal remedy absent the issuance\nof the temporary injunction. The trial court was within its discretion to make such determinations based on the evidence before\nit. Furthermore, the court could have issued the temporary injunction without finding a lack of adequate legal remedy based on\nsection 65.011(4)-(5) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. See id.\n\n [6] R & R Resources also argues that, although the operations for the three wells at issue have been conducted under the terms\nof the joint operating agreements for the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells, the court granted a temporary injunction as to only\ntwo of the three wells. Although the temporary injunction was inapplicable to the Toennis well, the record shows that, of the\nthree wells in the underlying suit, the Toennis is the only well that is not expressly covered by a joint operating agreement.\nThe court heard Benny Jaehne of Leexus testify that, because the Toennis does not have any operating agreement, if R & R\nResources did not want to pay another bill it “would not be bound to anything.”The trial court's findings state that, while the\nparties did not execute a joint operating agreement for the Toennis lease, R & R Resources argued without objection that the\nterms of the agreements for the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers leases applied to the Toennis lease by implication. Indulging every\nreasonable inference in favor of the court's order, we may infer that the trial court declined to include the Toennis well within\nthe temporary injunction because it is not expressly covered by either of the two joint operating agreements. We overrule R\n& R Resources's second issue.\n\n\nProbable Right to the Relief Sought\n *8 [7] In its third issue, R & R Resources urges that the trial court abused its discretion in finding a “probable right of\nrecovery” because Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex did not obtain a finding of R & R Resources's gross negligence, willful\nmisconduct, material breach, or total inability to perform. A probable right of success on the merits is shown by alleging a cause\nof action and presenting evidence that tends to sustain it. Telephone Equip. Network, Inc., 80 S.W.3d at 607.The temporary\ninjunction applicant is not required to establish that it will prevail on final trial. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d 198, 211.\n\nThe relevant provisions in the joint operating agreements are found in the first two sections of article V.B.:\n\n  1. Resignation or Removal of Operator: Operator may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to Non–Operators.\n     If Operator terminates its legal existence, no longer owns an interest hereunder in the Contract Area, or is no longer\n     capable of serving as Operator, Operator shall be deemed to have resigned without any action by Non–Operators, except\n     the selection of a successor. Operator may be removed only for good cause by the affirmative vote of Non–Operators\n     owning a majority interest based on ownership as shown on Exhibit “A” 8 remaining after excluding the voting interest\n     of Operator; such vote shall not be deemed effective until a written notice has been delivered to the Operator by a Non–\n     Operator detailing the alleged default and Operator has failed to cure the default within thirty (30) days from its receipt of\n     the notice or, if the default concerns an operation then being conducted, within forty-eight (48) hours of its receipt of the\n     notice. For purposes hereof, “good cause” shall mean not only gross negligence or willful misconduct but also the material\n     breach of or inability to perform its obligations under this agreement.\n\n\n\n     Subject to Article VII.D.1, 9 such resignation or removal shall not become effective until 7:00 o'clock A.M. on the first\n     day of the calendar month following the expiration of ninety (90) days after the giving of notice of resignation by Operator\n     or action by the Non–Operators to remove Operator, unless a successor Operator has been selected and assumes the duties\n     of Operator at an earlier date. Operator, after effective date of resignation or removal, shall be bound by the terms hereof\n     as a Non–Operator. A change of a corporate name or structure of Operator or transfer of Operator's interest to any single\n     subsidiary, parent or successor corporation shall not be the basis for removal of Operator.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Selection of Successor Operator: Upon the resignation or removal of Operator under any provision of this agreement, a\n      successor Operator shall be selected by the parties. The successor Operator shall be selected from the parties owning an\n      interest in the Contract Area at the time such successor Operator is selected. The successor Operator shall be selected by\n      the affirmative vote of two (2) or more parties owning a majority interest based on ownership as shown on Exhibit “A”;\n      provided, however, if an Operator which has been removed or is deemed to have resigned fails to vote or votes only to\n      succeed itself, the successor Operator shall be selected by the affirmative vote of the party or parties owning a majority\n      interest based on ownership as shown on Exhibit “A” remaining after excluding the voting interest of the Operator that was\n      removed or resigned. The former Operator shall promptly deliver to the successor Operator all records and data relating\n      to the operations conducted by the former Operator to the extent such records and data are not already in the possession\n      of the successor operator. Any cost of obtaining or copying the former Operator's records and data shall be charged to\n      the joint account.\n    *9 The trial court found that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex had shown a probable right of recovery because (i) Echelon,\n      Tex–El, and BairTex—who were non-operators owning a majority working interest under the joint operating agreements\n      —affirmatively voted to remove R & R Resources as operator and to select Leexus as operator; (ii) R & R Resources's\n      improper accounting and operation practices—which were a material breach of the standards of operation and/or inability\n      to meet the standards of operation and a material failure or inability to perform obligations under the joint operating\n      agreements—constituted “good cause” for its removal as operator; and (iii) R & R Resources violated article V.B.1–2 of\n      the joint operating agreements by refusing to relinquish its operator status and transfer operations to Leexus after Leexus\n      was selected and appointed as successor operator of all the wells.\nEchelon, Tex–El, and BairTex's petition alleged that Leexus had a right to be the successor operator based on a majority vote.\nThe evidence included a letter that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex's counsel wrote to Doutel on April 30, 2004, advising that\nhis clients had voted to remove R & R Resources as operator for “good cause” pursuant to the joint operating agreements'\nterms. The letter listed the ways in which R & R Resources had “failed and refused to act as a reasonably prudent operator”\nand demanded that R & R Resources relinquish operation of the wells. Doutel's May 28 response letter denied the request to\nrelinquish operation of the wells.\n\nR & R Resources urges that the trial court should have applied a gross negligence standard. But the first paragraph of article\nV.B. in the joint operating agreements clarifies that good cause for an operator's removal “shall mean not only gross negligence\nor willful misconduct but also the material breach of or inability to perform its obligations under this agreement.”Furthermore,\nR & R Resources does not cite any authority supporting application of an exculpatory clause that concerns the manner in which\nan operator conducts drilling operations, as in article V.A. of these joint operating agreements, to equitable claims that do not\ninvolve R & R Resources's “liability” for damages, or to claims for damages that are not based on drilling operations. See\nAbraxas Petroleum Corp. v. Hornburg, 20 S.W.3d 741, 759 (Tex.App.-El Paso 2000, no pet.); see also Cone v. Fagadau Energy\nCorp., 68 S.W.3d 147, 155 (Tex.App.-Eastland 2001, pet. denied).\n\nR & R Resources's alternative argument that the evidence in the record fails to support its removal as operator for “failing or\nrefusing to carry out its duties” is not persuasive. Failure to make prompt adjustments to an operating account and improperly\nassessed charges—similar to the allegations in this case—have been bases for finding that an operator “failed or refused to\ncarry out its duties,” which would support the entry of a temporary injunction. See Tri–Star Petroleum Co., 101 S.W.3d at 589–\n90.Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in finding that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex established a probable right of recovery in support of their request for\ntemporary injunction. We overrule R & R Resources's third issue.\n\n\nViolations of Equity\n *10 [8] In its final issue, R & R Resources claims that the trial court's temporary injunction violated the rules of equity\nbecause Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex materially breached the notice and removal provisions of the joint operating agreements\nand thus did not have “clean hands” when they sought equitable relief. The evidence adduced at the hearing does not support\nthis contention. On April 30, 2004, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex gave R & R Resources formal notice of the ways in which it\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2006)\n2006 WL 66458\n\nhad “failed and refused to act as a reasonably prudent operator.”Doutel's May 28 response letter did not address the majority of\nthe other allegations in counsel's letter. Almost four months after sending its demand letter, the Non–Operators requested the\nassistance of the Texas Railroad Commission via single-signature P–4s. That request was denied on November 19, 2004. The\nNon–Operators did not seek an injunction against R & R Resources until May 18, 2005, when they filed suit. R & R Resources's\nargument that it did not have thirty days to cure the Non–Operators' complaints is not persuasive. Similarly, its arguments that it\ndid not have written notice of the accounting discrepancies or receive a copy of the audit prior to the lawsuit are not persuasive\nbecause they are not prerequisites to filing suit under the terms of the joint operating agreements.\n\n [9] R & R Resources's final argument is that the trial court's temporary injunction violated the rules of equity because\nthe temporary relief requested was identical to the permanent relief requested. It claims that the Non–Operators' temporary\ninjunction effectively accomplished the entire purpose of their lawsuit and made the court's order a ruling on the merits of\nwhether R & R Resources should be removed as operator. A ruling on temporary injunctive relief may not be used to obtain an\nadvance ruling on the merits. See Iranian Muslim Org. v. City of San Antonio, 615 S.W.2d 202, 208 (Tex.1981). But Echelon,\nTex–El, and BairTex did not receive all the relief requested in their motion for temporary injunction or in their petition. The\ntemporary injunction does not cover the Toennis well. Additionally, the petition makes claims for damages based on breach\nof contract and cloud on the title. Thus, the trial court did not grant relief identical to that which the Non–Operators sought\nin their lawsuit by issuing the temporary injunction concerning the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells. We overrule R & R\nResources's fourth issue.\n\n\nOpportunity to be Heard at Subsequent Status Hearing\n [10] In its fifth issue, R & R Resources urges that it was denied an opportunity to be heard at a subsequent status hearing\non September 5, 2005. R & R Resources argues that it should have been able to present additional evidence on the issues of\nauthority and irreparable injury. The court had previously scheduled the status hearing to determine whether its temporary\ninjunction order was being followed, not as a continuation of the two-day temporary injunction hearing held in June. We have\nfound that the court had some evidence to support its findings on the issue of authority—as noted in the earlier discussion of\nthe Non–Operators' standing to seek the temporary injunction—and irreparable injury. We also note that the court agreed to\nconduct an in camera inspection on November 4, 2005, to address the issue of Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex's authority, thus R\n& R Resources had an additional opportunity to raise this issue with the trial court. We overrule R & R Resources's fifth issue.\n\n\nImpermissibly Speculative Order\n *11 R & R Resources's sixth issue argues that the trial court's order was impermissibly speculative because it did not make\nfindings of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of R & R Resources and that its findings on irreparable injury\nare not supported by the evidence. We previously noted that article V.B.1 in these joint operating agreements states that “good\ncause” for an operator's removal includes the operator's “material breach of or inability to perform its obligations under th[e]\nagreement[s]” and found that the trial court had some evidence to support its finding that R & R Resources “failed or refused to\ncarry out its duties” to support the entry of a temporary injunction. We also found that ongoing and continuing harm resulting\nfrom an operator's refusal to relinquish operations is at least one basis for finding irreparable injury in support of a temporary\ninjunction. We overrule R & R Resources's sixth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nBased on the record before us, R & R Resources has not shown that the district court acted outside the bounds of reasonable\ndiscretion by granting the temporary injunction. Accordingly, we affirm the court's order.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Grievance Committee of State Bar of Tex., 272 S.W.2d 948 (1954)\n\n\n\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n *950 [1] We shall premise our opinion in this case by pointing out that both the appellant and appellee seem to be of the\nopinion that certain individuals who are lawyers, engaged in the practice of law as such (and the agents, servants and employees\nof such lawyers), are affected by the order appealed from. The appeal has been taken by the corporation, Rattikin Title Company,\nand it and it alone is the appellant in the case before us. Therefore, of necessity we must disregard even the question of whether\nany other person, firm or corporation had the right of appeal, for only the Title Company appealed. Certainly the temporary\ninjunction is operative to restrain the attorneys, agents, servants and employees of the party enjoined under provisions of Article\n4661, R.C.S., but this would not restrain the same attorneys, etc., from performing the enjoined acts for other persons if they\nwould be legitimately performed by such other persons as their attorneys, agents or employees. We confine ourselves to the\nspecific order of the court below as same applies to the Title Company, and to the findings and conclusions of the trial judge\nrelating to and purporting to support the order's entry. Of course, we resort to the records of the pleadings and the evidence as\nnecessary to determine the propriety of such findings and conclusions and order.\n\n\nThe specific order of the court reads as follows:\n\n‘It Is Therefore Ordered that a temporary injunction be issued to continue in force and effect until this case is finally disposed of\non its merits, enjoining and restraining the Rattikin Title Company, a corporation, and any officer, director, employee, attorney\nor stockholder thereof, from preparing any legal instrument which is not for execution by Rattikin Title Company or by a person\nor persons employed by it and to which neither the Rattikin Title Company nor the Kansas City Title Insurance Company is a\nparty and in which these companies neither have nor acquire any interest in the subject matter of the instruments; and restraining\nand enjoining any officer, director, employee, attorney or stockholder of the Rattikin Title Company from giving advice, whether\noral or written, to persons who are not employees of said title companies, as to the purpose and legal effect of instruments to\nwhich neither the Rattikin Title Company nor Kansas City Title Insurance Company is a party; and such temporary injunction\nshall be binding upon all persons having notice thereof in active concert or participation with the defendant, Rattikin Title\nCompany. However, it is not intended by this order that any Notary Public who may be employed by Rattikin Title Company\nshall refrain from complying with the provisions of Article 6605, R.C.S. of Texas, in regard to taking the acknowledgment of\na married woman privily and apart from her husband.\n\n‘All relief prayed for by way of temporary injunction, which is not hereby granted, is denied.’\n\nIt is clear from the record that the appellant Title Company was the agent for the Kansas City Title Insurance Company, by\nwhich Insurance Company all the titles approved by the Title Company were insured. The Title Company was left free by\nthe order of temporary injunction to do everything for its principal, the Insurance Company it was enjoined from doing as to\nthird persons. It was also left free to do the same things for its own employees. The record reflects that the Title Company\nhad attorneys employed as its servants rather than as attorneys are ordinarily employed to perform legal services for clients.\nBy the provisions of the order of temporary injunction its attorney-employees were left free to prepare legal instruments as a\npart of any transaction to which the Title Company itself was a party, or to which the Insurance Company for which it was the\nagent was a party, or to which one of its employees was a party. Such attorney-employees were left free to make statements\nand representations regarding the purpose and effect of legal instruments (prepared by them or not) to persons they did not or\ncould not represent and to whom they owed no duty, in connection with transactions to which either the Title Company or its\nprincipal, the named Insurance Company, was a party.\n\n *951 These same attorney-employees, as well as others in the employ of the Title Company, were, as the result of the court's\norder, enjoined from preparing legal instruments which would become a part of any transaction where such privity would not\nexist. They were likewise enjoined from making statements or giving advice as to the purpose or effect of any such character\nof instrument to any person, firm or corporation other than their employer and the Insurance Company for which it was agent\nin or in connection with any transaction to which neither such employer nor said principal were privy parties.\n [2] It was the contention of the appellee that the appellant was doing and performing the very things which it was enjoined from\ndoing by the temporary injunction order. Reference to the record before us satisfies us that the Grievance Committee's petition\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Grievance Committee of State Bar of Tex., 272 S.W.2d 948 (1954)\n\n\nalleged a cause of action, and that there was evidence of sufficient probative force to entitle the court below to determine that\nsuch things, alleged by the petition to constitute the unlawful practice of law by the Title Company, were being done. Appellee\nsought their enjoinder as constituting the unlawful practice of law. The Texas State Bar Act, in part at least, is statutory. See\nArticle 320a-1, R.C.S. of Texas. The Rules of the State Bar of Texas, enacted as provided by Section 4 of said Article, are to\nbe found in Vernon's Annotated Texas Civil Statutes immediately following the Article. These Rules have the same force and\nlegal effect upon the matters to which they relate as the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure have to the matters to which they relate.\nBy such Rules of the State Bar of Texas ‘all persons not members of the State Bar are hereby prohibited from practicing law in\nthis State.’ The members in question are those attorneys licensed to practice law by the Supreme Court of Texas. There is no\nquestion but what the appellant Title Company is not, nor could it be, such a ‘person.’ Article XII of such Rules provides for an\nagency of the State Bar, to-wit: the Grievance Committee (which is the appellee herein and which was the plaintiff-petitioner\nin the court below) to prosecute appropriate suits against persons, firms and corporations other than the members of the State\nBar for the purpose of suppressing, prohibiting or preventing the unauthorized practice of law by such others.\n\n\nThe ‘practice of law’ is not defined by any statute presently in effect. This has been true since the repeal in 1949 of Article\n430a of Vernon's Annotated Penal Code. Even when that Article was in effect, however, it was held that it was within the\npower and authority of the judicial branch of the government to determine what services and what acts constitute the practice\nof law. Grievance Committee of State Bar of Texas, Twenty-first Congressional Dist. v. Dean, Tex.Civ.App., Austin 1945,\n190 S.W.2d 126.\n\nIt has been held that ‘conveyancing’, ‘preparation of legal instruments of all kinds', and ‘all advice to clients' involve the practice\nof law. Stewart Abstract Co. v. Judicial Commission of Jefferson County, Tex.Civ.App., Beaumont 1939, 131 S.W.2d 686; In\nre Duncan, 1909, 83 S.C. 186, 65 S.E. 210, 24 L.R.A., N.S., 750.\n [3] [4] As to the ‘preparation of legal instruments', those acts of any person in drawing deeds, notes, mortgages and releases\nrelating to the property rights of others, when performed for a consideration, constitute the practice of law,-and those who\ngive advice for a consideration to interested parties as to the purpose and legal effect of an instrument drawn by them for such\ninterested parties practice law. See Hexter Title & Abstract Co. v. Grievance Committee, Fifth Congressional Dist., State Bar\nof Texas, 1944, 142 Tex. 506, 179 S.W.2d 946, 157 A.L.R. 268, affirming Bar Ass'n of Dallas v. Hexter Title & Abstract Co.,\n175 S.W.2d 108, the Fort Worth Court of Civil Appeals.\n\n [5] When a corporation furnishes legal services to others and collects fees or receives profits therefor, directly or indirectly,\nsuch constitutes the practice of law, the performance of which may be enjoined. Stewart Abstract Co. v. Judicial Commission\n *952 of Jefferson County, supra. See also the cases cited at page 952 of 179 S.W.2d of the opinion in the Hexter Title &\nAbstract Co. v. Grievance Committee, Etc., case, supra.\n\n [6] [7] It is thus clear that the Title Company has, perforce the temporary injunction order, been enjoined from doing specific\nthings which our courts have declared to constitute the practice of law. Such things, when done by a party such as the Title\nCompany, are illegal acts. If the pleadings alleged the present commission of such acts or a future intent on the part of the Title\nCompany to commit such acts unless it is restrained from so doing, the Grievance Committee was entitled to a hearing upon its\napplication for a temporary injunction. As applied to the instant controversy, if upon that hearing the evidence introduced by\nit showed that such illegal acts are occurring or will occur in the absence of restraint, then the record shows that the Grievance\nCommittee has demonstrated the existence of a probable right on the part of the organization for which it acts, the State Bar, to\nhave an injunction writ issue, and a probable injury to that body should injunction writ be withheld.\n\n\nThe question of whether the very acts enjoined constitute the unlawful practice of law is not new in Texas. It is settled law that\nthese acts constitute such unlawful practice when performed by an incorporated ‘Title and Abstract Company.’ In the case of\nHexter Title & Abstract Co. v. Grievance Committee, Etc., supra, Chief Justice Alexander had a case which bore directly upon\nthe question posed in the present instance. The Hexter Company was incorporated for the identical purposes that the Rattikin\nTitle Company was incorporated (to-wit: to make, compile and own abstracts of title to lands and liens of all character on any\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Grievance Committee of State Bar of Tex., 272 S.W.2d 948 (1954)\n\n\nproperty, or any other abstracts of record in this State, or county thereof, required by law), and the Hexter Company had a\ntitle insurance company for which it was agent, just as does the Rattikin Title Company in the Kansas City Title Insurance\nCompany. In the Hexter case, however, there was no third ingredient, to-wit: a law firm which purported to do all the things\nwhich constituted the practice of law. In the instant case this ingredient has been added in the law firm of Rattikin and Spiller,\nattorneys. In the Hexter case, all those acts constituting the practice of law (and which the authorities have held to constitute such\npractice) were done and performed by the Hexter Company through attorneys solely employed by it in its legal department. The\nHexter Company defended that very similar suit on the theory, in part, that its acts through its agents who were also attorneys\ndid not constitute the practice of law because there was no charge made for their services. The Supreme Court readily perceived\nand held that the work of such agent-attorneys was paid for by the Hexter Company's customers through the consideration paid\nthe Hexter Company for other express services. In the present instance, the Title Company attempted to refrain from performing\nsuch acts, channeling their performance into the hands of attorneys, particularly Rattikin and Spiller. Messrs. Rattikin and\nSpiller are attorneys, and their association together is as a law firm which purports to do all of such things for clients which were\nheld by the Hexter case to constitute the unlawful practice of law by the Title Company. These things the law firm performs for\nspecific charges as attorney's fees. Certain of the very acts the Title Company was enjoined from performing,-the preparation\nof the instruments for conveyancing and for mortgaging and in the curing of titles,-were acts such Title Company contends it\ndid not perform. It contends that the independent firm of Rattikin and Spiller performed such acts. But the record reflects that\nmany of such acts were frequently and more or less continuously performed by the Title Company.\n\nAnother theory upon which the Hexter Company sought to defend the suit against it was based upon the premise that it, the\nHexter Company, was a party to the negotiation and consummation of a particular transaction, culmination of which was its\n *953 issuance of a title insurance policy,-and if such a transaction be not properly considered as one and indivisible, then the\ntransaction to which it was a party, to-wit: the examination of title to determine that it was one which it would insure with the\ninsurance company for which it was the agent,-and the act of effectuating such title insurance, necessarily entailed the action\nof its attorney-employees in the preparation of the instruments of conveyance, etc., and in the curing of title defects, and in\nthe supervision and direction of the acts involved in conveyancing, mortgaging, etc. The Supreme Court held, in effect, that\nin the issuance of a title policy, to which the title company would be a party or be acting for a party, the seller would not be a\nparty to that transaction though he paid the premium therefor, and that in the conveyance of real estate to a buyer by a seller,\nthe title company would not be a party to that transaction for it neither had nor acquired any interest in the property by reason\nthereof. In his opinion, Judge Alexander pointed out by analogy to circumstances theorized in certain extremes the legal as well\nas practical necessity of considering certain facets of the involved negotiation and consummation of modern day real estate\nconveyancing and financing, etc., as several and distinct transactions-not necessarily incident to one another or inclusive one of\nthe other. The reasoning of the opinion readily discloses that as to a mortgage of the property the seller is not necessarily a party\nto the mortgage transaction, especially where there was no mortgage on the property prior to the title conveyance,-nor would\nthe buyer or seller necessarily be a party to a mortgagee's title policy issued only to protect the mortgagee. The Supreme Court\nheld that it would only be as to transactions in which the Hexter Company was in privity as a party that the company's attorney-\nemployees or other agents could prepare instruments whereby it either had or acquired an interest in property by reason thereof,\nand could make statement as to the purpose and effect of such instruments to third persons. In the present instance, there is no\ndirectly advanced defense by the Rattikin Title Company based upon this same defensive theory, though the ‘thread’ containing\nthis thought on its part runs through all its argument as contained in its brief.\n\nIn the Hexter case, the title company frankly did the things constituting the practice of law, seeking primarily to justify the\nperformance of these things by refraining (as it believed) from making any charge therefor, and in the alternative, to justify\ntheir performance by contending that it was a party to the single transaction involved, or all of the several transactions involved.\nHere the Rattikin Title Company has sought to refrain from doing these things as a corporation, acting as it must through its\nagents, servants, etc.,-and instead has sought to cast the responsibility for the performance of such acts upon attorneys who are\nnot acting as its employees. In most instances it sought to cast such responsibility upon the law firm of Rattikin and Spiller.\nThe question thus resolved is whether the Title Company actually has refrained from such actions or whether it is doing them\ndespite any intent not to. As we have stated, the record demonstrates that it has done them and is doing them. In the main, it\nappears that such action was inadvertent, but it also appears that some acts were intentionally performed through a mistaken\nopinion as to what constitutes the practice of law. The principal instances where the latter appears seem to be those in which\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Grievance Committee of State Bar of Tex., 272 S.W.2d 948 (1954)\n\n\nlegal instruments are in, or might be in, such form as satisfies the Title Company, in so far as the issuance of a title insurance\npolicy would be concerned, but where the mortgage loan company requires additional provisions to be incorporated in the\ninstruments as conditions precedent to the making of its loans.\n\nA certain difficulty, unavoidable under the system of operation of the law business of Rattikin and Spiller and title business of\nRattikin Title Company, was encountered in the maintenance of separate and distinct operations as between the Title Company\nand the law firm. Both members of the law firm were administrators of the business of *954 the Title Company. One of them\nwas its chief executive. The law firm had numerous employees who were also employees of the Title Company, and many of\nthese worked indiscriminately among and alongside the numberous employees of the Title Company alone, as well as among\nand alongside the numerous employees of the law firm alone. Adding to the difficulty was the fact that each of the members\nof the law firm, as administrators of the business of the Title Company, conducted the affairs of the Title Company from the\nsame desk from which he conducted the business of the law firm. The public was misled, as well as even the clients of the law\nfirm and the customers of the Title Company. In the record we see instances where the Title Company is frequently directed\nto do certain things which could only be properly done by an attorney, and we have no doubt but what members of the law\nfirm (and its exclusive employees) were directed to do things properly done only by the Title Company. There is no doubt what\nin the case of any similar interrelated activity of a sizeable law firm with a title company of a size comparable to that of the\nRattikin Title Company, with any lengthy period of such intermingling of personnel one would always discover that certain\nof the exclusive employees of the Title Company would find themselves doing legal work for the clients of the law firm, and\nseveral of those exclusively employed by the law firm would find themselves performing work for the Title Company.\n [8] In the present instance, such interrelated activity by intermingled personnel resulted, as disclosed by the record, in the\nRattikin Title Company (though its employees) performing acts which constituted the practice of law, to-wit: preparing legal\ninstruments for persons and corporations other than itself and its principal in transactions whereby it neither had nor acquired any\ninterest in the subject matter of the transaction,-and also resulted in it (through its employees) giving advice or making statements\nto persons other than its principal and its employees as to the purpose and effect of legal instruments in transactions to which\nneither the Title Company nor its principal was a party. These very acts on the part of the Title Company's employees constituted\nthe unauthorized and illegal practice of law by the Title Company, and the trial court properly enjoined their continuance. The\nTitle Company indirectly profited by such acts in the same manner that the Title Company profited in the Hexter case. That the\nTitle Company might have committed or performed such acts inadvertently or unintentionally or through mistake constitutes\nno defense. It matters not why the acts were being done. That is not a matter for our inquiry and in this instance, at least, excuse\nfor the commission of such acts is not before us.\n\n\nIndeed, so long as the system of commingling the employees of the law firm with those of the Title Company shall persist,\nand so long as the system of doing business for both firms through individuals serving both (from the same ‘side of the table’)\nshall persist, we readily perceive how-in view of the record's disclosure as to the volume of business handled by both the Title\nCompany and law firm-at least some of the acts constituting the unauthorized practice of law will again, in time, be performed\nor committed by the Title Company even should it in good faith do all things possible to prevent such. If such acts should\nrecur, in view of any subsisting order enjoining them, their performance would be imprudent conduct on the part of the Title\nCompany, to say the least, and, to paraphrase Justice Holmes, should the Title Company walk too near the line that divides\nprudent from imprudent conduct, it takes the risk, and if it oversteps the line, it must bear the consequences with fortitude.\n\nBesides its points of error which are disposed of by what we have said above, the appellant Title Company has assigned\nadditional points wherein it contends that there was no urgent necessity for granting the temporary injunction and that since its\ngranting virtually accomplished the object of the suit, it should not have been granted. The Title Company contends that the\nmain objective of the Grievance Committee is to prevent the lawyers who work part time for *955 the Title Company from\nworking part time for the law firm of Rattikin and Spiller. We do not view this as the Grievance Committee's objective, but\nwhether it is or not, such was not enjoined by the court's order.\n\nAs to the urgent necessity warranting the granting of a temporary injunction, the Title Company states, ‘The rule for which\nwe are now contending, namely that important and new questions of law should not be answered in a hearing on a temporary\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

International M. & F. Workers\n(151 Tex. 239), 248 S.W.2d 460, 464, as follows: * * *.’ Thereafter follows the statement of the Supreme Court in that case\nto the effect that new and important law questions should reach the appellate courts for final determination in cases tried on\ntheir merits rather than in instances of temporary injunction.\n [9] [10] [11] It is our opinion that the law is ‘clear and positive’ as to the illegality of the acts enjoined. Such is demonstrated\nby the authorities, including the Hexter case. It is also our opinion that the facts proved upon the temporary injunction hearing\nwere sufficient to entitle the trial judge to believe and decide that there was a continuing violation of the substantive law.\nThe order of temporary injunction commands, in effect, that the Title Company ‘cease its unlawful action and desist from any\nresumption pending a trial of the merits of the case.’ We recognize that in the hearing upon an application for a temporary\ninjunction the only question before the trial court is the right of the applicant to a preservation of the status quo of the subject\nmatter of the suit pending a final trial of the case on its merits.

But in an injunction case wherein the very\nacts sought to be enjoined are acts which prima facie constitute the violation of expressed law, the status quo could never be a\ncondition of affairs where the respondent would be permitted to continue the acts constituting that violation. In such instances,\nthe status quo to be preserved by temporary injunction is the last, actual, peaceable, noncontested status which preceded the\npending controversy, and when it is determined that the law is being violated it is the province and the duty of the court to\nrestrain it.

And in such instances, if the preservation of the status quo should accomplish the objective of the suit this is\nnevertheless as it should be, for no man may engage in actions in violation of the staturory law, or of a rule of law having\nsimilar force and authority. Gifford v. State, supra.\n\n\nBy a cross-point upon the appeal, the Grievance Committee contends that the trial court erred in refusing to enjoin the Title\nCompany from acting as the attorney for mortgage loan companies to the extent of determining that certain legal instruments\nare in proper form before delivering over the money lent by them to other parties (contingent upon and in connection with\npending purchase transactions) and held by the Title Company as an escrow agent.\n [12] [13] [14] The cross-point presents a question of law not heretofore determined and not patently illegal. The right the\nGrievance Committee contends for will admit of doubt. The trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, could therefore not be\nsaid to have abused that discretion in refusing to stay such action on the part of the Title Company in the order which he did enter\nupon temporary injunction proceedings. See 43 C.J.S., Injunctions, s 19, sub. (c), p. 434. We have no function on this appeal\nother than to determine whether or not the trial judge clearly abused his discretion. *956 Texas Foundries v. International\nMoulders & Foundry Workers' Union, 1952, 151 Tex. 239, 248 S.W.2d 460. But for such abuse his action will not be disturbed\non appeal. Transport Co. of Texas v.

City Atty., Amarillo, for appellee.\n\nOpinion\n\nREYNOLDS, Chief Justice.\n\nT & R Associates, Inc., d/b/a Scarlett O'Hara's, complains of a temporary injunction, issued on the application of the City of\nAmarillo and to maintain the status quo pending a final hearing, restraining T & R Associates, Inc., from operating a lounge in\nviolation of zoning and building code ordinances of the City. Inasmuch as T & R Associates, Inc., has stipulated its violations\nof the ordinances, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the temporary injunction to maintain the status\nquo. Affirmed.\n\nT & R Associates, Inc., operated a lounge known as Scarlett O'Hara's in Space 15-A, Sunset Center, an area of the City of\nAmarillo zoned as “General Retail.” Alleging that the lounge operated in violation of zoning and building code ordinances, the\nCity instituted this litigation. By its action, the City sought a temporary injunction, to be made permanent after a final hearing,\ndirecting T & R Associates, Inc., to cease and desist the lounge operation until and unless the ordinances were complied with\nby (a) obtaining a Special Use Permit and (b) providing two properly constructed and approved exits on the premises.\n\nResponding, T & R Associates, Inc., pleaded, among other matters, that the City was estopped to seek, and was barred by\nlaches, waiver, ratification and the clean hands doctrine from seeking, the equitable injunctive relief. T & R Associates, Inc.,\nthen pleaded for, together with other relief, a temporary injunction which, in essence, would restrain the City from impeding\nor terminating the operation of the lounge.\n\nHearing the temporary injunction evidence, the trial court found, inter alia, that:\n\n(1) The operation of the lounge in a general retail zoning district without a Special Use Permit is a violation of the zoning\nlaws of the City;\n\n(2) The lounge is operated without having a minimum of two properly constructed and approved exits in violation of the Uniform\nBuilding Code adopted by the City; and\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

City of Amarillo, 601 S.W.2d 178 (1980)\n\n\n(3) In order to maintain the status quo pending final hearing on the merits of the cause, a temporary injunction should be ordered\neffective until a final hearing.\n\nAccordingly and until a final hearing, the court's order temporarily enjoined T & R Associates, Inc., from operation of a lounge\non the premises without (1) having first obtained a Special Use Permit required by the City's ordinance, and (2) a minimum of\ntwo properly constructed and approved exits required by the City's ordinance. The execution of the order requiring a minimum\nof two exits was stayed for a period of forty days to allow T & R Associates, Inc., to comply with the Uniform Building Code.\n\nT & R Associates, Inc., perfected an appeal. During the time allowed for preparation of the appellate record, the court reporter's\nnotes and transcription of the evidence heard by the trial court were stolen. The parties elected to proceed on appeal with a\nwritten “Stipulation of Evidence,” the effect of which is an agreement to some facts established by, but a disagreement about\nother portions of, the evidence adduced in the trial court. Nevertheless, by the following numbered stipulations, the parties\nagree the uncontroverted evidence was that:\n\n  4. T AND R ASSOCIATES, INC., operates a tavern or a lounge at Space 15-A, Sunset Center, as those words are defined\n  in Chapter 26-11 of the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n  5. The operation of a tavern or a lounge in a General Retail zoning district is prohibited by the provisions of Chapter 26 of\n  the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n   *180 11. The exit doors to Space 15-A are not in compliance with Chapter 5 of the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n  12. RON TWITTY testified that T AND R agreed to bring its exit doors into compliance with the Municipal Code if it is\n  allowed to continue operating as a tavern in Space 15-A;\n\n  13. T AND R ASSOCIATES, INC., has, on two occasions, made application to THE CITY OF AMARILLO for a specific\n  use permit for the operation of the lounge at the premises in question as provided by s 26-22 of the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n  16. THE CITY OF AMARILLO City Commission has denied each application for a Specific Use Permit filed by T AND\n  R ASSOCIATES, INC.\n\nIn pursuing its appeal, T & R Associates, Inc., has drafted twelve points of error, two of which have five subpoints, directed\nto its basic contentions that it was, and the City was not, entitled to temporary injunctive relief, and that the injunction order\nupset the status quo between the parties. By its points, as well as by its live trial pleadings, T & R Associates, Inc., does not\nquestion the validity of the City's ordinances; instead, it claims the City is estopped, barred and lacks clean hands to enforce\nthe ordinances against T & R Associates, Inc.\n\n [1] The grounds interposed by T & R Associates, Inc., to escape the force of the ordinances it admittedly violated may\nnot be entertained. These grounds embrace matters which go to the merits of the underlying litigation, and undertaking their\ndetermination would be to give full consideration to the merits of the entire lawsuit, thereby denying a conventional trial on\nthe merits. In an appeal from an interlocutory order granting or denying a temporary injunction, the merits of the entire suit\nneither are presented for appellate review nor may be considered by the appellate court. Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 861-62\n(Tex.1978).\n\n [2] More properly in this situation, the roles of the courts are otherwise defined. The trial court only questions whether there\nis an entitlement to the preservation of the status quo of the subject matter of the suit pending trial on the merits. The appellate\ncourt is strictly limited to the determination whether there has been a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in granting or\ndenying the interlocutory injunctive order. Davis v. Huey, supra, at 861-62.\n\n [3] [4] The status quo to be preserved by temporary injunction is “the last, actual, peaceable, noncontested status which\npreceded the pending controversy.” Transport Co. of Texas v. Robertson Transports, 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549, 553-54\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In this action, the status quo to be preserved is the status which existed before T & R Associates, Inc., began operation\nof its lounge in admitted violation of the City's ordinances, City of Corpus Christi v. Lone Star Fish & Oyster Co., 335 S.W.2d\n621, 624 (Tex.Civ.App. San Antonio 1960, no writ), and not the state of affairs which would permit a continuing violation of\nthe law. Wesware, Incorporated v. State, 488 S.W.2d 844, 850 (Tex.Civ.App. Austin 1972, no writ); Rattikin Title Company\nv. Grievance Committee, 272 S.W.2d 948, 955 (Tex.Civ.App. Fort Worth 1954, no writ).\n\n [5] Indeed, if the law is being violated, it is the duty of the court to restrain it. Houston Compressed Steel Corp. v. State, 456\nS.W.2d 768, 773 (Tex.Civ.App. Houston (1st Dist.) 1970, no writ); Rattikin Title Company v. Grievance Committee, supra,\nat 955. And a temporary injunction is an appropriate remedy. Gifford v. State, 229 S.W.2d 949, 952 (Tex.Civ.App. El Paso\n1950, no writ).\n\n [6] There is no abuse of discretion if, as here, the court applies the law to conceded or undisputed facts. Accord, Camp v.\nShannon, 162 Tex. 515, 348 S.W.2d 517, 519 (1961). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the\ntemporary injunction. It follows that the points of error advanced by T & R Associates, Inc., must be overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n601 S.W.2d 178\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The 234th District Court, Harris County, Tony Lindsay, J., granted\ntemporary injunction. Appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals, Taft, J., held that: (1) record demonstrated probability of success\non merits of claims for trade secret protection and that former employees misappropriated trade secrets, which thus supported\ntemporary injunction; (2) potential damage to employer's business from misappropriation of trade secrets could not be easily\ncalculated, which thus rendered damages inadequate and also supported temporary injunction; but (3) temporary injunction\ngranted by trial court was overbroad and would be reformed to limit only former employees' disclosure and use of trade secrets.\n\nAffirmed as reformed.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (22)\n\n\n [1]    Injunction       Preservation of status quo\n        Sole issue before trial court in temporary injunction hearing is whether applicant may preserve status quo, pending\n        trial on merits.\n\n        3 Cases that cite this headnote\n\n\n [2]    Appeal and Error         Injunction\n        Appeal and Error         Refusing injunction\n        Review of grant or denial of temporary injunction is limited to determining whether trial court clearly abused its\n        discretion in entering interlocutory order.\n\n        3 Cases that cite this headnote\n\n\n [3]    Appeal and Error         Injunction\n        Appeal and Error         Refusing injunction\n        On review of grant or denial of temporary injunction, reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of trial\n        court, but will only determine whether trial court's action was so arbitrary as to exceed bounds of reasonable discretion.\n\n        2 Cases that cite this headnote\n\n\n [4]    Appeal and Error         Injunction\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Smith, Jr., retired Justice, Court of Appeals, First District of Texas at Houston, sitting by\nassignment.\n\n\n                                                         OPINION\n\nTAFT, Justice.\n\nThis is an interlocutory appeal 1 from the grant of a temporary injunction against appellants, T–N–T Motorsports, Inc., Roy\nTerpstra, and Joe Terpstra. We address: (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion in enjoining former employees from\nusing information regarding, or working on, three types of motor vehicles they had worked on for their former employer; and\n(2) whether the temporary injunction is overbroad. We reform, and affirm the temporary injunction as reformed.\n\n\n\n                                                            Facts\n\nIn 1991, John Hennessey founded Hennessey Motorsports, Inc. (appellee), which specializes in high performance upgrades for\na variety of vehicles, including the Dodge Viper Roadster and Dodge Viper GTS coupe. By May 1993, appellee had designed\nits first custom performance and enhancement package for a Dodge Viper. 2 In late August 1993, appellee hired Roy Terpstra\nto assist in meeting the increased demand for the Venom upgrades and to perform research and development. In April 1994,\nappellee hired Joe Terpstra to again meet increased demand for its products.\n\nIn 1996, the Terpstras incorporated their part-time body shop as T–N–T Motorsports, Inc. Prior to T–N–T's incorporation, the\nTerpstras worked for T–N–T as well as for appellee, with appellee's knowledge. During this time period and with appellee's\nconsent, T–N–T manufactured and designed products that it sold to appellee for use in connection with the Venom upgrades.\nAlso with appellee's knowledge, T–N–T performed engine modifications for customers other than appellee's, although not on\nVipers.\n\nOn May 20 1997, the Terpstras terminated their employment without notice to appellee, and began full-time employment with\nT–N–T. On May 30, 1997, Roy Terpstra attended a Viper Club meeting in Florida at which he distributed T–N–T business\ncards and T–N–T brochures advertising the availability of high grade performance upgrades for Vipers. Roy Terpstra told a\nprivate investigator hired by appellee that the T–N–T upgrades were identical to the Venom upgrades, that he had learned how\nto create these packages as an employee of appellee, and that he offered the same upgrades as appellee but at a better price.\nHe said at least three of appellee's customers had already moved their *21 business to T–N–T. He also told the investigator\nthat appellee was his only competitor.\n\nIn addition to using the same products and vendors, T–N–T also planned to perform the same tests and have an identical warranty\non its cars as appellee, and use the same type of equipment that appellee used. T–N–T intended to use a similar name for its\npackages (“Serpent” instead of “Venom”).\n\nIn June 1997, appellee sued appellants and successfully obtained temporary injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hennessey Motorsports, Inc., 965 S.W.2d 18 (1998)\n\n\n\n\n                                                      Standard of Review\n\n [1] The sole issue before a trial court in a temporary injunction hearing is whether the applicant may preserve the status quo,\npending trial on the merits. Davis v. Huey, 571 S.W.2d 859, 862 (Tex.1978); Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. Kingston\nInv. Corp., 819 S.W.2d 607, 610 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1991, no writ).\n\n [2] [3] [4] [5] We limit our review of the grant or denial of a temporary injunction to determining whether the trial\ncourt clearly abused its discretion in entering the interlocutory order. Rugen v. Interactive Bus. Sys., Inc., 864 S.W.2d 548, 551\n(Tex.App.—Dallas 1993, no writ); Manufacturers Hanover, 819 S.W.2d at 610. We will not substitute our judgment for that\nof the trial court, but will only determine whether the court's action was so arbitrary as to exceed the bounds of reasonable\ndiscretion. Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 551. We draw all legitimate inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial\ncourt's order. Id. Because an appeal of an order granting or denying a temporary injunction is an appeal from an interlocutory\norder, the merits of the applicant's case are not presented for appellate review. Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 551; Manufacturers\nHanover, 819 S.W.2d at 610.\n\n\n\n                                                       Abuse of Discretion\n\nIn points of error one through five, appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's findings that\nappellee demonstrated (1) substantial probability of success on the merits, (2) probable injury in the interim, (3) substantial\nrisk of imminent harm, (4) substantial risk of irreparable injury, and (5) absence of any adequate remedy at law. In point\nof error six, appellants complain the court erred as a matter of law in determining that appellee met the requisite elements\nof preliminary injunctive relief. In points of error seven through 12, appellants challenge the trial court's findings regarding\nappellee's confidential information, and assert no identifiable “trade secrets” exist that might be subject to misappropriation.\n\nThe basis of appellee's underlying suit is that, by virtue of their employment with appellee, the Terpstras acquired confidential\ninformation, 3 which they then used to compete directly with appellee. Appellee sued appellants alleging misappropriation\nand conversion of confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, breach of confidential relationship,\ntortious interference with prospective relations, civil conspiracy, fraud or fraudulent concealment, and negligence or negligent\nmisrepresentation.\n\nAppellants' concerns are for their right to earn a livelihood in their area of expertise in competition with their former employer.\nAppellants invoke the free enterprise system as a basis for limiting the general right of former employees to wide-open\ncompetition with former employers only where employers have obtained: (1) covenants not to compete; or (2) confidentiality\nagreements. See MPI Inc. v. Dupre, 596 S.W.2d 251, 254 (Tex.Civ.App.—Fort Worth 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.). We deal here\nwith a third exception to the general rule, which is one designed to protect the trade secrets of a former employer in the absence\nof a confidentiality agreement.\n\n\nA. Trade Secrets\n [6] [7] [8] Certain duties, apart from any written contract, arise upon the formation of *22 an employment relationship.\nMiller Paper Co. v. Roberts Paper Co., 901 S.W.2d 593, 600 (Tex.App.—Amarillo 1995, no writ). One of those duties forbids\nan employee from using confidential or proprietary information acquired during the relationship in a manner adverse to the\nemployer. Id. This obligation survives termination of employment. Id. Although this duty does not bar use of general knowledge,\nskill, and experience, it prevents the former employee's use of confidential information or trade secrets acquired during the\ncourse of employment. Id. at 600–601; American Precision Vibrator Co. v. National Air Vibrator Co., 764 S.W.2d 274, 278\n(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, no writ).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hennessey Motorsports, Inc., 965 S.W.2d 18 (1998)\n\n\n [9] When a claim of improper disclosure or use of trade secrets arises from a confidential relationship, the injured party is not\nrequired to rely upon an express agreement that the offending party will hold the trade secret in confidence. Gonzales v. Zamora,\n791 S.W.2d 258, 265 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1990, no writ). However, the employer must show that the information was,\nin fact, a trade secret. American Precision, 764 S.W.2d at 279.\n\n [10] [11] [12] [13] A trade secret may consist of any formula, pattern, device, or compilation of information that is used\nin one's business, and which gives one an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\nComputer Assoc. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 918 S.W.2d 453, 455 (Tex.1996); Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 548. “A trade secret may be\na device or process which is patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or process which is clearly anticipated in the\nprior art or one which is merely a mechanical improvement that a good mechanic can make.” K & G Oil Tool & Serv. Co. v. G\n& G Fishing Tool Serv., 158 Tex. 594, 314 S.W.2d 782, 789 (1958). When money and time are invested in the development of a\nprocedure or device that is based on an idea which is not new to a particular industry, and when that certain procedure or device\nis not generally known, trade secret protection will exist. K & G Oil Tool, 314 S.W.2d at 785; Gonzales, 791 S.W.2d at 264.\nFurther, when an effort is made to keep material important to a particular business from competitors, trade secret protection is\nwarranted. Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 552; Gonzales, 791 S.W.2d at 265. Items such as customer lists, pricing information, client\ninformation, customer preferences, buyer contacts, market strategies, blueprints, and drawings have been shown to be trade\nsecrets. Miller Paper, 901 S.W.2d at 601; American Precision, 764 S.W.2d at 278.\n\n [14] The word “secret” implies that the information is not generally known or readily available. Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 552;\nGonzales, 791 S.W.2d at 264. Courts have refused to give trade secret protection when the material or procedure sought to be\nprotected has been publicly disclosed. Gonzales, 791 S.W.2d at 264. The mere fact that knowledge of a product may be acquired\nthrough inspection, experimentation, and analysis does not preclude protection from those who would secure that knowledge\nby unfair means. K & G Oil Tool, 314 S.W.2d at 788; Weed Eater, Inc. v. Dowling, 562 S.W.2d 898, 901 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1978, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nAppellants assert that they are merely utilizing general knowledge and expertise acquired through years of experience within\nthe automotive industry, both prior to and during their tenure with appellee. They also contend that a lack of secrecy prevents\nappellee's alleged confidential information from being trade secrets. They assert that the specifications of the performance\nupgrades and the identities of appellee's customers and vendors are available to the public, and are common knowledge through\npublication of various magazine articles about appellee's upgrades and via appellee's Internet website. However, Roy Terpstra\nadmitted John Hennessey told him the information he learned on behalf of appellee about designing, modifying, and building\nthe Venom upgrades was proprietary.\n\nThe idea of upgrading the performance of any vehicle is not a new idea. However, the specific means by which appellee upgrades\nthe performance of the Vipers is not common knowledge. Hennessey explained that through years of trial and error, appellee\n *23 builds the “fastest normally aspirated 4 Vipers.” He knows which components work and which do not. Appellee spent a\nsubstantial amount of time and money developing the upgrade packages that would fit the exact needs of its clientele. Hennessey\ntestified that the component parts used by appellee in its upgrade packages are confidential. Many components are not available\nand need to be built from the ground up. Although materials for these parts are purchased from outside vendors, most parts\nare then modified to fit together and work in concert with all the other components to achieve the desired horsepower, so that\nthe car performs reliably and is cost efficient and profitable. Even appellee's customers are not told the exact specifications of\nthe work done on their vehicles.\n\nHennessey testified it has taken him four years to compile a list of vendors he considers capable of providing the materials and\nservice he needs, who have the best prices, and who are the most reliable. Although retail prices are public, the overall cost\nof the Venom upgrades, the cost of items sold separately, the cost of components and sub-assemblies, and the cost of labor\nassociated with assembling and process development is not public.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hennessey Motorsports, Inc., 965 S.W.2d 18 (1998)\n\n\n [15] Contrary to appellants' assertions, the specifics of the Venom upgrades, appellee's customer and vendor information,\nand appellee's pricing are not known to the general public. The magazine articles and appellee's website do not reveal how the\nvarious parts are assembled, or explain the process of designing or modifying the various parts that go into a Venom upgrade.\nThere is no access to this information except through appellee.\n\nHennessey testified that only certain people within the company have access to and were trained to use its computer systems.\nComputers containing certain information are located in a locked room separate from employees. Access to the customer\ndatabase requires a password. Appellee's customer database contains information such as names, addresses, and telephone\nnumbers, the types of vehicles they own, whether other upgrades have been done on the vehicle, birthdays, and e-mail addresses.\nHennessey testified that some customers even leave instructions not to tell their wives how much money was spent on the\nupgrades. Although appellee purchases a list of new vehicle buyers from an outside source, this information is contained in a\nseparate database from its customer list. The customer list has been compiled over a four-year period, and appellee does not\nsell it to outsiders.\n\nAppellee's shop is a large, non-air-conditioned airplane hangar. Hennessey stated the shop is at a remote location because he\ndoes not want off-the-street customers wandering in. The airport has a secured access gate from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. that\nrequires a code for entry. Non-employees are allowed in the shop area only after they have checked in with the office. Cylinder\nheads and specific components are kept in a separate area from the shop.\n\nThe record indicates the information about the specifics of the Venom upgrades, appellee's customers, and its vendors is\nconfidential and intended to be kept a secret. The court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellee had shown a\nprobability of success in proving that its confidential information deserved trade secret protection.\n\n\nB. Temporary Injunction\n [16] At the preliminary hearing, the applicant is not required to prove it will prevail at final trial. Sun Oil Co. v. Whitaker,\n424 S.W.2d 216, 218 (Tex.1968). To be entitled to a temporary injunction, an applicant must plead a cause of action, show\na probable right to recover on that cause of action, and show a probable injury in the interim. Sun Oil, 424 S.W.2d at 218;\nManufacturers Hanover, 819 S.W.2d at 610. The applicant also must show that no adequate legal remedy exists. Manufacturers\nHanover, 819 S.W.2d at 610.\n\n [17] [18] [19] A probable right of success on the merits is shown by alleging a cause of *24 action and presenting evidence\nthat tends to sustain it. Miller Paper Co., 901 S.W.2d at 597. Probable injury includes elements of imminent harm, irreparable\ninjury, and no adequate remedy at law for damages. Surko Enters., Inc. v. Borg–Warner Acceptance Corp., 782 S.W.2d 223,\n225 (Tex.App.—Houston 1989, no writ). A legal remedy is inadequate if damages are difficult to calculate or their award may\ncome too late. Miller Paper, 901 S.W.2d at 597.\n\n [20] Prior to leaving appellee's employ, Roy Terpstra was the director of Viper operations, and he admitted this was a position\nof trust. He performed specialized performance upgrades on vehicles, and designed, developed, tested, and assembled parts\nfor the Venom upgrades. He worked with Hennessey in strategizing product development. He admitted that both T–N–T and\nappellee were in the business of custom high performance upgrades.\n\nAlthough he had the knowledge to build the same various upgrades done by appellee for other vehicles prior to his employment\nwith appellee, Roy Terpstra had never designed, modified, or built certain parts specifically for the Viper. It was while employed\nby appellee that he learned about Viper upgrades. He located vendors who could fabricate, modify, or supply parts for the\nupgrades for different types of vehicles, and he knew who were the best and most reliable. He also learned how to increase the\nhorsepower of a vehicle, such as the Viper, because of the research and development done at appellee's shop. He admitted that\nthe Venom upgrades took time and money to develop, and it was appellee who paid for product development.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Hennessey Motorsports, Inc., 965 S.W.2d 18 (1998)\n\n\nThe Terpstras did not, and were not required to, sign any agreement not to compete or confidentiality agreement. But a\nformer employee may not use, for his own advantage and to the detriment of his former employer, confidential information\nor trade secrets acquired by or imparted to him in the course of his employment. Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 551. “Injunctive relief\nis recognized as a proper remedy to protect confidential information and trade secrets.” Id. The record supports the court's\nconclusion that appellee demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims against appellants.\n\nThe record indicates that appellants possess appellee's confidential information and are in a position to use it to compete directly\nwith appellee. Under these circumstances, it is likely appellants will use the information to appellee's detriment. The record\nsupports the court's conclusion that use of this information by appellants to perform services on the two types of Dodge Vipers\nor the Mitsubishi 3000 GT poses an inherent threat to the disclosure or use of appellee's trade secrets.\n\n [21] Appellants argue that any damages suffered by appellee are compensable through money damages, and, therefore,\nappellee has not demonstrated that no adequate remedy at law exists. Injunctive relief is proper to prevent a party, which has\nappropriated another's trade secrets, from gaining an unfair market advantage. The only effective relief available to appellee is\nto restrain appellants' use of its trade secrets and confidential information pending trial. At the time of the injunction hearing,\nappellee had over 20 Vipers in its shop. Hennessey stated that if the Venom upgrades could be obtained anywhere, there would\nbe no reason for people to send their Vipers to appellee. He testified that if the confidential information was distributed, appellee\nwould lose its advantage. He estimated that appellee's gross sales for 1997 would drop from approximately $4 million to about\n$2 million. He also said the loss of good will was immeasurable. The potential damage to appellee's business cannot be easily\ncalculated; therefore, a legal remedy is inadequate.\n\nWe hold that appellee satisfied its burden so that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the temporary injunction\nagainst appellants. Accordingly, we overrule points of error one through 12.\n\n\n\n                                                    Injunction Overbreadth\n\nIn point of error thirteen, appellants contend the court granted relief that was not specifically sought by appellee. Specifically,\nappellants assert the decretal paragraphs of the injunction make no mention of the confidential information as defined by the\ncourt. *25 In point of error fourteen, appellants contend the court granted broader relief than was necessary. Appellants argue\nthat the injunction is not limited to appellee's alleged trade secrets or confidential information. Instead, appellants assert, the\ninjunction restrains not only them, but other nondisclosed and nonascertainable entities from disclosing, using, selling, or testing\nany information related to the two types of Dodge Vipers or the Mitsubishi 3000 GT. Appellants also contend the injunction\nprevents them and various other parties from working on or providing any type of service for Dodge Viper GTS, Dodge Viper\nRoadster, or Mitsubishi 3000 GT vehicles. Appellants assert that, read literally, the injunction would prevent former customers\nof appellants from even changing the oil or rotating the tires on their own cars.\n\nRule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\n\n  Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in\n  terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be\n  restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and\n  upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service\n  or otherwise.\n\n  Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the\n  ultimate relief sought.

The pertinent portion of the order restrains appellants from:\n\n  1. directly or indirectly disclosing, using, selling or testing, for any purpose, (or imparting to any other person, firm,\n  corporation or other entity) any information relating to the Dodge Viper GTS, Dodge Viper Roadster or Mitsubishi 3000\n  GT motor vehicles; and\n\n  2. working on, designing, repairing, installing, testing, soliciting, contacting, accepting any business from and/or providing\n  any types of services on any Dodge Viper GTS, Dodge Viper Roadster or Mitsubishi 3000 GT motor vehicles, regardless\n  of model year, except that Defendants may finish the work they were doing on the remaining Dodge Vipers owned by Ken\n  Addington and Joe Bob Shirley.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n [22] We agree with appellants that the temporary injunction is overbroad. We may modify an overbroad injunction. See\nSan Augustine Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Woods, 521 S.W.2d 130, 133 (Tex.Civ.App.—Tyler 1975, no writ). Accordingly, we sustain\nappellants' thirteenth and fourteenth points of error and *26 grant appellants their alternative relief. We order that the above\nportion of the temporary injunction be reformed to limit disclosure and use of trade secrets, as follows:\n\n  1. directly or indirectly disclosing, using, selling or testing, for any purpose, (or imparting to any other person, firm,\n  corporation or other entity) any Hennessey Trade Secret information relating to the Dodge Viper GTS, Dodge Viper Roadster\n  or Mitsubishi 3000 GT motor vehicles; and\n\n  2. working on, designing, repairing, installing, testing, soliciting, contacting, accepting any business from and/or providing\n  any types of services using Hennessey Trade Secret informationon any Dodge Viper GTS, Dodge Viper Roadster or\n  Mitsubishi 3000 GT motor vehicles, regardless of model year, except that Defendants may finish the work they were doing\n  on the remaining Dodge Vipers owned by Ken Addington and Joe Bob Shirley.\n\n(Emphasis on language ordered to be added.)\n\n\n\n                                                           Conclusion\n\nWe reform the order of the trial court granting a temporary injunction against appellants and affirm the order as reformed.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Certain corporate investors contracted with a group\nof Austin gynecologists and obstetricians to open a unique medical facility housing a hospital, clinic, and doctors' offices, all\ndedicated to women's health care needs. Appellants are “the Investors” who owned and operated the facility; appellees are\n“the Doctors” who located their offices in the facility and sent their patients to its hospital. When the facility continued to lose\nmoney, the Investors decided to close the hospital. The Doctors responded by suing for breach of contract and fraud and seeking\na temporary injunction to prevent the Investors from closing the hospital pending a trial on the merits, which is scheduled for\nAugust 7, 2000. The trial court granted the Doctors' application for a temporary injunction. In eight points of error, the Investors\nbring this consolidated, interlocutory appeal challenging both the order granting the injunction and a subsequent order denying\ntheir motion to dissolve the injunction. 1 We will affirm both orders.\n\n\n\n                                                        BACKGROUND\n\nIn 1995, the Investors 2 approached Margaret Thompson and Linda Litzinger, doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology,\nwith the concept of a multi-service women's health care center to be known as Renaissance Women's Center of Austin (the\nCenter). The two-story facility would offer a women's hospital on the first floor and physicians' offices and a clinic on the\nsecond floor. Thompson and Litzinger decided to commit to the project and on October 11, 1995, entered into a lease and\nletter agreement (the Agreement) with the Investors memorializing their commitment *575 to the contemplated Center. 3 The\nAgreement provides in relevant part:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In late 1999, the Investors decided to close the hospital. Upon learning of\nthe Investors' intention, the Doctors filed a lawsuit on December 10, pleading breach of contract and fraud. The Doctors claimed\nin part that the Investors had breached paragraph five of the Agreement by failing to use reasonable efforts throughout the term\nof the lease to certify the Center as a hospital approved by all insurance companies and health maintenance organizations for\nwhich the Doctors are approved providers. The Doctors also sought a temporary and a permanent injunction to prevent the\nclosing of the Center. In their request for a temporary injunction, the Doctors claimed that they “have and are suffering harm\nand irreparable harm as a result of the actions of [the Investors]” and sought to enjoin the Investors “from closing the hospital,\nselling the hospital, reducing the hospital staff or nurses, or reducing the quality of women's health care services” during the\npendency of the suit.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court granted the temporary injunction. In support of its decision, the court made the following\nfindings: (1) the Doctors have a probable right of recovery; (2) the Doctors will suffer imminent, irreparable harm in the absence\nof the injunction; (3) the Doctors have no adequate remedy at law for their interim damages, and their financial damages will\nbe immeasurable; and (4) the balance of hardships and the public interest favors an injunction maintaining the status quo. Until\njudgment is rendered in the pending suit, the Investors are enjoined from closing the hospital or changing its status from the\nwomen's health care hospital that was in operation as of the date the Doctors filed their petition. The trial court further ordered the\nInvestors to “continue to use reasonable efforts to obtain, and maintain in full force and effect ... written agreements certifying\nthe hospital *576 ... as an approved hospital by all health care insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, health\ncare plans or other health care benefit providers for which [the Doctors] are approved providers.” Having lost at the hearing,\nthe Investors filed a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction based on fundamental error and changed circumstances. The\ntrial court denied the motion. The Investors now appeal both the trial-court order granting the temporary injunction and the\norder refusing to dissolve it.\n\n\n\n                                                           DISCUSSION\n\nStandard of Review\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial on the merits. See\nWalling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex.1993). In an appeal from an order granting or denying a request for a temporary\ninjunction, appellate review is confined to the validity of the order that grants or denies the injunctive relief. See id. The decision\nto grant or deny the injunction lies within the sound discretion of the court, and we will not reverse that decision absent a clear\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This Court may neither substitute its judgment for that of the trial court nor consider the merits of the\nlawsuit. See id.; Texas Indus. Gas v. Phoenix Metallurgical Corp., 828 S.W.2d 529, 532 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992,\nno writ). Rather, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, indulging every reasonable inference\nin its favor, and determine whether the order was so arbitrary as to exceed the bounds of reasonable discretion. See CRC–Evans\nPipeline Int'l, Inc. v. Myers, 927 S.W.2d 259, 262 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ). We cannot reverse a trial\ncourt's order if the trial court was presented with conflicting evidence and the record includes evidence that reasonably supports\nthe trial court's decision. See id.\n\nAn applicant requesting a temporary injunction is not required to establish that she will prevail at trial. See Walling, 863 S.W.2d\nat 58. The applicant's burden is to establish a probable right of recovery following a trial on the merits and a probable injury in\nthe interim, warranting preservation of the status quo pending the trial. See id. at 57.\n\n\nMandatory or Prohibitive Injunction\n [6] As a preliminary matter, the Investors argue that although the temporary injunction is couched in terms of prohibiting them\nfrom closing the hospital, the order is really mandatory in nature because it requires the Investors to seek funding to keep the\nhospital open. A mandatory injunction, urge the Investors, should be denied unless the right to relief is clear and compelling and\na case of extreme necessity or hardship is presented. See Rhodia, Inc. v. Harris County, 470 S.W.2d 415, 419 (Tex.Civ.App.\n—Houston [1st Dist.] 1971, no writ).\n\n [7] A mandatory injunction requires conduct from a party, whereas a prohibitive injunction forbids conduct. See LeFaucheur\nv. Williams, 807 S.W.2d 20, 22 (Tex.App.—Austin 1991, no writ). The primary function of the trial court's order here is to forbid\nthe Investors from closing the hospital or changing its status. The order does not include any provisions mandating the Investors\nto seek funding for the hospital, nor did the Doctors request such relief. If the effect of the order implies that the Investors must\nseek funding, this implication is only incidental to the order's primary function of preventing the Investors from closing the\nhospital, and we will not presume such an order is mandatory. See Woodward v. Smith, 253 S.W. 847, 853 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nAustin 1923, no writ). We hold that the trial court's temporary injunction is prohibitive; its ordering provisions are preventive\nin nature and necessary for the preservation of the status quo.\n\n\nPreserving the Status Quo\n [8] [9] The Investors further contend that because the order requires that they *577 take some affirmative action, it disturbs\nthe status quo. Status quo is defined as “the last, actual, peaceable, noncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.”\nTransport Co. v. Robertson Transports, Inc., 152 Tex. 551, 261 S.W.2d 549, 553–54 (1953) (internal quotations omitted). “If\nan act of one party alters the relationship between that party and another, and the latter contests the action, the status quo cannot\nbe the relationship as it exists after the action.” Benavides Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Guerra, 681 S.W.2d 246, 249 (Tex.App.—San\nAntonio 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.). If it were otherwise, the granting of an injunction would be rendered impossible. See id.\n\nWe hold that the trial court's temporary injunction preserves the status quo by ordering that operations continue as they existed\nprior to the Investors' attempt to close the hospital. It was the Investors' decision to close the hospital that altered the parties'\nrelationship. This dispute arises from the attempted closing. Therefore, the status quo is the relationship of the Investors and\nthe Doctors as it existed prior to the Investors' decision to close the hospital.\n\n\nProbable Right to Recovery, Irreparable Harm, Adequate Remedy, Balancing Equities\nIn their second, third, and fourth points of error, the Investors complain that the court abused its discretion in granting the\ntemporary injunction because the Doctors failed to prove a probable right of recovery, irreparable harm, and the absence of an\nadequate remedy at law. In their fifth point of error, the Investors complain that the trial court erred in balancing the equities\nin favor of the temporary injunction.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570 (2000)\n\n\n [10] [11] [12] [13] To establish a probable right to recovery, the Doctors must have a cause of action for which they may\nbe granted relief. See Walling, 863 S.W.2d at 58; Surko Enter., Inc. v. Borg–Warner Acceptance Corp., 782 S.W.2d 223, 225\n(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ) (probable right to recovery includes element of wrongful conduct). Irreparable\nharm is an element of the probable injury requirement that the Doctors must satisfy in order to obtain a temporary injunction.\nSee Surko Enter., 782 S.W.2d at 225 (probable injury includes elements of imminent harm, irreparable injury, and no adequate\nremedy at law). To demonstrate probable injury or harm, an applicant must show an injury for which there can be no real legal\nmeasure of damages or none that can be determined with a sufficient degree of certainty, i.e., a noncompensable injury. See\nTexas Indus. Gas, 828 S.W.2d at 533; Martin v. Linen Sys. for Hosps., Inc., 671 S.W.2d 706, 710 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 1984, no writ) (examples of noncompensable injuries include company's loss of clientele, goodwill, marketing techniques,\nand office stability). An adequate remedy at law is one that is as complete, practical, and efficient to the prompt administration\nof justice as is equitable relief. See Texas Indus. Gas, 828 S.W.2d at 532; Surko Enter., 782 S.W.2d at 225 (quoting Ballenger\nv. Ballenger, 694 S.W.2d 72, 76 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1985, no writ)).\n\nThe record before us does not include specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therefore, we will uphold the trial court's\njudgment on any legal theory supported by the record, indulging all reasonable presumptions in favor of there having been\nsufficient evidence to sustain the trial court's judgment. See Martin, 671 S.W.2d at 708–09.\n\n\n [14] Here, the wrongful conduct alleged was a breach of contract. 5 This claim rests on the Investors' alleged failure *578\nto use reasonable efforts to maintain written agreements with insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. The\nevidence adduced in support of the wrongful conduct included the 1995 Agreement. Based on the Doctors' cause of action for\nbreach of contract and the evidence adduced to sustain it, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the\nDoctors had a probable right to recovery. 6\n\n [15] [16] The Doctors also adduced evidence of irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The Doctors'\nburden was to show that an award of damages would be inadequate for the harm suffered; they were not required to show that\nan award of damages would be wholly ineffectual. See Walling, 863 S.W.2d at 58 (“Simply because the applicant ... asks only\nfor damages as ultimate relief does not guarantee that damages are completely adequate as a remedy.”); Roland Mach. Co. v.\nDresser Indus., Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 386 (7th Cir.1984). An award of damages may be deficient if the nature of the Doctors'\nlosses makes damages difficult to calculate. See Roland Mach. Co., 749 F.2d at 386. The trial court's order reflects that if the\nhospital were to close or change its status from a women's health care hospital, the Doctors would be unable “to provide to their\npregnant mothers the care that they now receive and expect [or] to ensure the utmost safety of those mothers upon the delivery\nof their babies.” One of the witnesses, Dr. Thompson, noted two instances where the ability of the Doctors to rush the patients\ndownstairs to the hospital within minutes possibly saved the lives of the babies being delivered. The Doctors also provided\nsome evidence that other area facilities may not have the capacity to accommodate all of the Center's patients. 7 This evidence\nwas sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the Doctors would likely suffer irreparable injury and that the nature of the\nDoctors' and their patients' losses would make damages incapable of calculation.\n\n[17]    [18] The Investors also complain that the district court erred in considering Universal Health Services' financial status in\nbalancing the hardships and concluding that the equities weighed in favor of granting the temporary injunction. 8 In considering\nan application for a temporary injunction, a trial court “balances the equities of the parties and the resulting conveniences and\nhardships.” Surko Enter., 782 S.W.2d at 225. The trial court here balanced the hardship to the Doctors, as well as the public\ninterest of the patients and their babies, against the hardship to the Investors in maintaining the status quo until August 7, the\ndate set for the trial. In doing so, the court noted that over 1000 babies were scheduled to be delivered during the eight months\nbefore the trial. The court also acknowledged some evidence that other area facilities may not be adequately equipped to handle\n *579 the delivery and care of all of those babies. The trial court based its decision to maintain the status quo on the health\nrisks involved if the hospital were closed. Indeed, the court's order states, “Maintaining the status quo of the hospital as the\nRenaissance Women's Center as a women's hospital will ensure that the quality of care these mothers and their babies expect\nto receive will not be compromised. The equities are balanced in favor of the [Doctors] because of the risks involved in closing\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

While there were no doubt equities on both sides, we cannot say the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in balancing them in favor of the Doctors and their patients.\n\nApplying the appropriate standard of review and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, as\nwe must, we hold that appellants have not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the temporary injunction.\nOur holding is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in attempting to preserve the status quo until August 7,\nthe scheduled date of the trial. We note that if the Doctors had lost on the motion for a temporary injunction, the Investors\nhad closed the hospital, and the trial court later determined that the Investors had breached the terms of the Agreement, the\nremedy of compelling the Investors to comply for a while longer with the reasonable efforts mandated in the Agreement would\nno longer be viable. While the Investors may have presented conflicting evidence in support of their claim that they should not\nbe required to continue operating the hospital or that they have used reasonable efforts in accordance with the Agreement, we\nwill not address the merits of the Investors' defenses on this interlocutory appeal.\n\n\nSpecificity of the Temporary Injunction\n [19] [20] In its first and sixth points of error, the Investors argue that the trial court erred in granting an open-ended, over-\nbroad injunction requiring the Investors to continue operations without specifying how the operations should be funded. The\nlaw in Texas regarding the specificity of temporary injunctions is that they must be\n\n             as definite, clear and precise as possible and when practicable [they] should inform the defendant of the\n             acts he is restrained from doing, without calling on him for inferences or conclusions about which persons\n             might well differ and without leaving anything for further hearing. But obviously the injunction must be\n             in broad enough terms to prevent repetition of the evil sought to be stopped, whether the repetition be in\n             form identical to that employed prior to the injunction or (what is far more likely) in somewhat different\n             form calculated to circumvent the injunction as written.\n\nSan Antonio Bar Ass'n v. Guardian Abstract & Title Co., 156 Tex. 7, 291 S.W.2d 697, 702 (1956) (internal quotations and\ncitations omitted).\n\nThe order before us enjoins the Investors “from closing the hospital at the Renaissance Women's Center, [or] changing the\nstatus of the hospital from the women's health care hospital that was in operation as of December 10, 1999, the date of the\nfiling of Plaintiff's Original Petition, until judgment in this cause is rendered by this Court.” The Investors are in the business\nof running hospitals and have been running this Center for almost three years. The trial court was not required to examine the\nspecific details associated with running the hospital prior to December 10 in order to spell out what is necessary to maintain the\nstatus quo. A temporary injunction should not be greatly concerned with “rights of the defendants that are asserted largely in the\nabstract. Otherwise, it would probably take longer to write the decree than it would to try the case and the injunction might well\nbecome unintelligible and self-destructive.” Id.; see Wesware, Inc. v. State of Texas, 488 S.W.2d 844, 849 (Tex.Civ.App.—\nAustin 1972, no writ). We overrule the Investors' *580 complaints that the order is unworkable because it does not sufficiently\nspell out the details of compliance.\n\n\nReopening the Case\n [21] [22] In their seventh point of error, the Investors complain that the trial court erred in refusing to reopen the hearing on the\napplication for a temporary injunction to allow more thorough exploration of the capacity of existing facilities to accommodate\nthe Center's potentially displaced patients and their babies. Rule 270 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides: “When it\nclearly appears to be necessary to the due administration of justice, the court may permit additional evidence to be offered at\nany time....” Tex.R. Civ. P. 270. “The decision to re-open a case to admit additional evidence is within the trial court's sound\ndiscretion.” Turner v. Lone Star Indus., Inc., 733 S.W.2d 242, 245 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.). We\nwill not overturn a trial court's decision absent a clear abuse of discretion. See id.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                             10\n\fUniversal Health Services, Inc. v. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570 (2000)\n\n\n [23] The record before us reflects that the Investors produced Brian Blessing, a hospital administrator for the Center, as a\nwitness. Blessing provided testimony indicating that Southwest Seton would have the capacity to accommodate between 800\nand 1400 deliveries per year, thereby refuting the Doctors' evidence of insufficient capacity in the area hospitals. It was within\nthe trial court's discretion to determine whether additional evidence regarding capacity was necessary to the due administration\nof justice. The court was under no duty to allow the Investors another opportunity to litigate the same issue prior to the trial on\nthe merits. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the evidence. The Investors' seventh\npoint of error is overruled.\n\n\nChanged Circumstances and Fundamental Error\n [24] [25] [26] In their final point of error, the Investors insist that the court erred in denying their motion to dissolve the\ntemporary injunction in light of newly discovered evidence, changed circumstances, and fundamental error. A determination\nof whether to dissolve a temporary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not overrule its\ndetermination absent an abuse of discretion. See Tober v. Turner of Texas, Inc., 668 S.W.2d 831, 834 (Tex.App.—Austin 1984,\nno writ). A trial court may modify a temporary injunction because of fundamental error or changed circumstances but has no\nduty to reconsider the grant of a temporary injunction if the movant fails to present new evidence showing fundamental error or\nchanged conditions. See Henke v. Peoples State Bank, 6 S.W.3d 717, 721 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1999, pet. dism'd w.o.j.).\nThe purpose of the motion to dissolve is “to provide a means to show that changed circumstances or changes in the law require\nthe modification or dissolution of the injunction; the purpose is not to give an unsuccessful party an opportunity to relitigate\nthe propriety of the original grant.” Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 836.\n\n [27] [28] Fundamental error exists when “the record shows the court lacked jurisdiction or that the public interest is directly\nand adversely affected as that interest is declared in the statutes or the Constitution of Texas.” Pirtle v. Gregory, 629 S.W.2d\n919, 920 (Tex.1982). “Changed circumstances are conditions that altered the status quo existing after the temporary injunction\nwas granted or that made the temporary injunction unnecessary or improper.” Henke, 6 S.W.3d at 721.\n\n [29] The Investors argue that the trial court should have granted the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction because\nof new evidence they presented. The new evidence consisted of testimony from Laraine McIntyre, the Director of Women's\nHealth Services for St. David's Hospital. McIntyre testified that St. David's Hospital has sufficient capacity to deliver the babies\nscheduled to be born at the Center *581 prior to the August 7 trial on the merits. This evidence, however, is not evidence\nof changed circumstances or of fundamental error. The Investors did not demonstrate how this evidence altered the status\nquo. Instead, McIntyre's testimony was merely additional conflicting evidence regarding the capacity of other hospitals to\naccommodate the Center's patients. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to dissolve when it was\npresented with additional conflicting evidence.\n\nThe Investors also argue that since the granting of the temporary injunction, the hospital's operating losses have increased. In\ntheir motion to dissolve, the Investors contend that the trial court did not clearly provide in its order how they should continue to\nfund the hospital operations. However, prior to the granting of the temporary injunction, the trial court was made aware of the\nhospital's operating losses. Upon balancing the equities, the trial court determined that a temporary injunction was necessary\nto preserve the status quo pending a trial on the merits. The Investors did not provide any new evidence of conditions that\naltered the status quo or revealed fundamental error. As we stated in Tober, the trial court has no duty to reconsider the validity\nof its original grant of the temporary injunction absent such new evidence. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835. We overrule the\nInvestors' final point of error.\n\n\n\n                                                         CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thompson, 24 S.W.3d 570 (2000)\n\n\nHaving overruled all of the Investors' points of error and determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting\nthe Doctors' application for a temporary injunction or in denying the Investors' motion to dissolve the temporary injunction,\nwe affirm both trial-court orders.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n24 S.W.3d 570\n\n\nFootnotes\n1      A party may appeal from a district court's interlocutory order granting a temporary injunction or overruling a motion to dissolve a\n        temporary injunction. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(4) (West Supp.2000).\n2       Initially, Renaissance Centers for Women, Inc., an Oklahoma based corporation, approached the Doctors with the concept for a\n        women's health care facility. That corporation was subsequently acquired by another corporation, RCW of Edmond, Inc. (RCW).\n        RCW then created a limited partnership, Renaissance Women's Center of Austin, L.P., for the purpose of developing the proposed\n        facility in Austin. After the facility was completed, a limited liability corporation, Renaissance Women's Center in Austin, L.L.C.,\n        was formed to own and operate the first floor hospital. The limited partnership retained ownership of the second floor doctors' offices.\n        For the sake of convenience, we refer to all of these entities collectively as the Investors.\n3       Although Thompson and Litzinger were the only two doctors involved at this stage of the Center's development, the 1995 letter\n        agreement and all subsequent agreements were binding on any of the physicians employed by them, including all the doctor appellees.\n4       The parties subsequently entered into a Second Agreement and a Second Modification and Ratification of Lease Agreement. The\n        primary purpose of these agreements was to reflect subsequent name changes of the parties and to affirm their respective interests and\n        obligations. The Second Modification and Ratification of Lease Agreement also acknowledged the Investors' satisfaction of certain\n        obligations under the 1995 Agreement.\n5       The Investors also argue that injunctions are not appropriate remedies for breach of contract claims because money damages are\n        sufficient to compensate for these claims. The supreme court addressed this issue in Walling v. Metcalfe, 863 S.W.2d 56, 58\n        (Tex.1993), in which it held that a trial court may grant a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo even though the cause of\n        action is for damages resulting from breach of contract and does not request equitable relief.\n6       Our decision on this point is not a reflection on the merits of the case. We merely examine the evidence through the filter of an abuse\n        of discretion standard in upholding the trial court's decision.\n7       The Investors claim that because subsequent evidence conclusively disproved the Doctors' evidence of lack of capacity in area\n        hospitals, the court erroneously relied on lack of capacity as a basis for the temporary injunction. However, the Investors did not\n        produce the subsequent evidence regarding existing hospital capacity during the hearing on the application for a temporary injunction.\n        They presented the evidence at the hearing on the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction. As we discuss later, the trial court was\n        under no duty to revisit the validity of its order granting the temporary injunction absent changed circumstances or fundamental error.\n8       Universal Health Services, along with other shareholders, incorporated RCW of Edmond, Inc. (RCW). RCW currently manages the\n        hospital on the first floor of the Center. The Investors argue that because Universal is only one investor in the hospital, owns neither\n        the land nor the building that houses the Center, and was not a party to any of the agreements, the court should not have considered\n        Universal's balance sheets in balancing the equities.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Absolutely, it has been misleading, yes.\n\n        21       Q.     Did Mr. DeLitta ever clarify the situation by\n\n        22   saying, I really have a psychology degree from an\n\n        23   unlicensed university?         Did he ever clarify that?\n\n        24       A.     I never heard clarification regarding his\n\n02:39   25   license or status or whether or not he is a doctor.\n\f                          Christopher Enochs - April 15, 2015\n                           Direct Examination by Mr. Taylor\n                                                                               34\n\n02:41   1    the laws pertaining to limiting themselves to the\n\n        2    license.     And he has some personal knowledge that, in\n\n        3    fact, he encouraged this particular witness to violate\n\n        4    his own license.       It shows a pattern.\n\n02:41   5                       THE COURT:    Then let's just ask that\n\n        6    question.\n\n        7                       MR. TAYLOR:   Okay.\n\n        8                       THE COURT:    Lay the predicate.\n\n        9                       MR. TAYLOR:   Okay.\n\n02:42   10       Q.      (BY MR. TAYLOR) You're licensed, correct?\n\n        11       A.      I am licensed.\n\n        12       Q.      What state are you licensed in?\n\n        13       A.      I'm licensed in eleven states.      I think I'm\n\n        14   actually licensed in nine states currently.           I have to\n\n02:42   15   check on the currently, but I'm licensed in Oklahoma.\n\n        16       Q.      Was there ever a time when Mr. DeLitta\n\n        17   encouraged you to perform nursing services in states in\n\n        18   which you were not licensed?\n\n        19       A.      Yes.\n\n02:42   20       Q.      And would that be a violation of the law?\n\n        21       A.      Absolutely it would be.\n\n        22       Q.      Was there a time when you thought that Mr.\n\n        23   DeLitta was a medical doctor?\n\n        24       A.      From almost the first year I worked there, I\n\n02:42   25   thought Mr. DeLitta was a physician as he was the\n\f                         Christopher Enochs - April 15, 2015\n                          Direct Examination by Mr. Taylor\n                                                                             35\n\n02:42   1    medical director.    And as of now, speaking with other\n\n        2    nurses in the past, I know that that has been not just\n\n        3    my opinion.\n\n        4                    MR.

TAYLOR:   Your Honor, this is not\n\n        8    offered for the truth of the perception within the\n\n        9    company.    We know he's not really a doctor.      It's\n\n02:42   10   offered for the perception that he's created by using\n\n        11   this designation.\n\n        12                   MR. HERMAN:   It doesn't make any\n\n        13   difference.    It doesn't clean it up for being hearsay.\n\n        14                   MR. TAYLOR:   It certainly does.     It's not\n\n02:43   15   offered for the truth.\n\n        16                   THE COURT:    Well, let's not argue, please.\n\n        17   Let's not argue with each other.       Let the Court -- I'm\n\n        18   going to hear your objection.      I will hear a response\n\n        19   and then I will make a ruling.\n\n02:43   20                   I'll sustain the objection as to the last\n\n        21   part.    Limit it to your opinion.\n\n        22       Q.     (BY MR. TAYLOR) Okay.     Did you observe at any\n\n        23   time Mr. DeLitta trying to clarify his status and what\n\n        24   his actual license was?\n\n02:43   25       A.

It's\n\n        4    hearsay.\n\n02:44   5                       MR. TAYLOR:    This is not hearsay, Judge.\n\n        6    It's not offered for the truth.          The truth would be that\n\n        7    he wasn't really a doctor.         It's offered to show a\n\n        8    pattern and a practice and an illusion that's been\n\n        9    created within the company.          That's strictly it.    It's\n\n02:44   10   not offered for the truth.\n\n        11                      THE COURT:     The Court will allow it for\n\n        12   that limited purpose.\n\n        13                      THE WITNESS:    Can you repeat the question?\n\n        14       Q.      (BY MR. TAYLOR) Yes.\n\n02:44   15                      Have people told you to refer to him as\n\n        16   Dr. DeLitta within the company?\n\n        17       A.      I personally have never been told to refer to\n\n        18   him as Dr. DeLitta, no.\n\n        19       Q.      All right.

I can tell that you that that's not my\n\n03:00   20   signature.\n\n        21        Q.   Have you ever sent an e-mail where the\n\n        22   signature block stated \"Dr. Michael J.

What did you do for Arco Pipeline?\n\n        21       A.      It depends on what time -- what year in\n\n        22   question.     For the most part, I oversaw the medical\n\n        23   department and the medical services.

When I was at the refinery, they would actually\n\n        4    come to the medical department.     We had an on-site\n\n03:12   5    occupational clinic at the refinery, and I would\n\n        6    actually see the patients and I would examine them,\n\n        7    diagnose them, and ultimately treat them.\n\n        8                     As I progressed in my career and became\n\n        9    the medical director and I moved to another division, I\n\n03:12   10   then oversaw the programs.\n\n        11                    So if an injured employee -- if an injury\n\n        12   occurred and they were in another state, I would\n\n        13   telephonically assess them, determine medical needs, and\n\n        14   direct them to medical facilities, if their injury\n\n03:13   15   warranted.\n\n        16       Q.

Now, where did you get your Physician's\n\n03:13   20   Assistant degree?\n\n        21       A.   I went to U.C.L.A., Charles Drew Medical School\n\n        22   in Los Angeles.\n\n        23       Q.   Okay.     Did you get an undergraduate degree?\n\n        24       A.

(BY MR. TAYLOR) If you will remember the\n\n03:35   5    seminar where you couldn't remember speaking, it was in\n\n        6    Houston at the Oceanic Hotel.        You said you don't\n\n        7    remember presenting there?\n\n        8        A.   Correct.\n\n        9        Q.   Do you recall having been introduced as\n\n03:36   10   Dr. DeLitta before?\n\n        11       A.   At that seminar?\n\n        12       Q.   Or any seminar.     Have you ever been introduced\n\n        13   as Dr. DeLitta?\n\n        14       A.   I can't answer that.        I don't recall.\n\n03:36   15       Q.   Okay.     And by the way, you would agree that if\n\n        16   the company is -- and this is a hypothetical -- if it's\n\n        17   using false or misleading designations and they are\n\n        18   doing something false or misleading or against the law,\n\n        19   that that can harm the company, correct?\n\n03:36   20       A.   Let me see if I understand your question.        If\n\n        21   the company is doing something that's illegal, would it\n\n        22   harm the company?\n\n        23       Q.   Yes.\n\n        24       A.   Of course, it would.\n\n03:36   25       Q.   Okay.     And what's the problem with you just\n\f                         Michael J.

I don't call myself Doctor.\n\n        3        Q.     I will take up all the designations.   I won't\n\n        4    refer to myself as Doctor, and I will call myself a\n\n03:37   5    physician's assistant?\n\n        6                    You do call yourself Doctor.   You refer to\n\n        7    yourself as Dr. DeLitta?\n\n        8        A.     No, I don't.\n\n        9        Q.     Well, the evidence here is, we have seen it in\n\n03:37   10   the marketing brochures, we've seen it on business\n\n        11   cards.\n\n        12                   We have seen it on other documentation\n\n        13   that you do, in fact, have, in the past, as recent as\n\n        14   2012, referred to yourself as Dr. DeLitta?\n\n03:37   15       A.     As recent as 2012, so from 2012 on I have not.\n\n        16       Q.     Are you willing to just agree that you will not\n\n        17   use the Doctor designation in front of your name\n\n        18   anymore?\n\n        19       A.     No, I won't agree with that.\n\n03:37   20       Q.     And so in order --\n\n        21       A.     I don't use it, but I won't agree to it\n\n        22   anyways.\n\n        23       Q.     Well, you do use it.   You put yourself down as\n\n        24   Dr. Michael DeLitta and sometimes you will put the Ph.D\n\n03:37   25   after it, correct?\n\f                             Nancy Schaefer - April 15, 2015\n                             Direct Examination by Mr. Herman\n                                                                           86\n\n04:03   1    about the growth of the company and the prosperity of\n\n        2    the company and so forth, right?\n\n        3        A.    Yes.\n\n        4        Q.    You disagree with what he said?\n\n04:03   5        A.    No.\n\n        6        Q.    Okay.     And can you point to any customer that\n\n        7    ever complained about anyone referring to Mr. DeLitta as\n\n        8    Doctor?\n\n        9        A.    I don't believe that they complained about it,\n\n04:04   10   but I don't think that they understand that he's not a\n\n        11   medical doctor.\n\n        12       Q.    Okay.     Well, has anybody threatened to sue you\n\n        13   or to otherwise impose some harm on the company?\n\n        14       A.    Not to my knowledge.\n\n04:04   15       Q.    And as a 50 percent owner, you participate in\n\n        16   the management meetings on a regular basis, do you not?\n\n        17       A.    No, I do not.\n\n        18       Q.    You participate in the weekly meetings with the\n\n        19   temporary receiver, do you not?\n\n04:04   20       A.    No, sir, I don't.\n\n        21       Q.    Who does that on your behalf?\n\n        22       A.    Carol Striker.\n\n        23       Q.    Okay.     And it's Ms. Striker that suggested that\n\n        24   a way for you to gain some leverage in this lawsuit\n\n04:04   25   would be to you raise this very issue about DeLitta\n\f                            Nancy Schaefer - April 15, 2015\n                            Direct Examination by Mr. Herman\n                                                                           91\n\n04:11   1    any court anywhere for the relief you are seeking here\n\n        2    today, did you?\n\n        3        A.      That's correct.\n\n        4        Q.      And you can't point to any specific injury to\n\n04:11   5    the company, can you?\n\n        6        A.      I think it's a total misrepresentation of\n\n        7    himself to the company.\n\n        8        Q.      All right.   Well, let me put it to you this --\n\n        9    let me ask you this way.\n\n04:11   10                    What you are concerned about, I take it,\n\n        11   or what you're fearful of is that something will happen,\n\n        12   right?\n\n        13       A.      I had received a resignation letter from a\n\n        14   nurse that she had submitted to Axiom.      And it was by\n\n04:11   15   request that we get the documents without getting a copy\n\n        16   of that.     In that letter, she was very concerned that\n\n        17   Michael is misrepresenting himself as Dr. DeLitta to\n\n        18   clients.\n\n        19       Q.      Didn't ask you that.\n\n04:11   20       A.      And that was a concern to me.\n\n        21       Q.      I did not ask you that.   I'm asking you, what\n\n        22   your testimony is, is that you're fearful that some\n\n        23   injury might have occurred to the company?        Is that what\n\n        24   you fear?\n\n04:12   25       A.      I think the fear is already there in that the\n\f                                                                                  Defendant's\n\nJanus University\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJ a n u s University, formerly known a s, Newport U n iv ersity is a private, distance\neducation institution located in Newport Beach, California.111121 It w as founded in 1976 and w as\nlicensed by the former State of California Bureau of Private Postsecondarv and Vocational\nEducation.

Plaintiff and DeLitta disagreed about whether Axiom needed to purchase a building as\n\nopposed to leasing larger space and if a purchase was made, which building would be purchased.\n\nDeLitta wanted to purchase a building located at 4840 West Panther Creek Drive, The Woodlands,\n\nTexas (\"Panther Creek Building\"). Plaintiff suggested leasing a building located at 110 Cypress\n\nStation Drive, Houston, Texas 77090 (\"Cypress Court\"). After much discussion, DeLitta decided\n\nto purchase the Panther Creek Building himself through a solely owned company that he would\n\nform for the single purpose of purchasing the Panther Creek Building (\"DeLCom Properties\").\n\nPlaintiff and DeLitta agreed that if DeL Com Properties purchased the building, Axiom would lease\n\nspace from it in the Panther Creek Building.\n\n24.    On or about August 8, 2013, without Plaintiff's consent and before forming DeLCom\n\nProperties and closing on the Panther Creek Building, DeLitta executed a lease on behalf of both\n\nDeLCom Properties and Axiom Medical with terms that were very favorable to DeLCom\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED PETITION, ORIGINAL\nTHIRD-PARTY PETITION, AND JURY DEMAND- Page 6\n\n\n                                                                                                      125\n\fProperties (DeLitta's solely owned company) acting as the landlord and very unfavorable to\n\nAxiom Medical, the purported tenant (the \"Panther Creek Lease\").\n\n25.    A few days later, DeLitta formed DeLCom Properties on or about August 13, 2013.\n\n26.    On or about August 26, 2013, DeLCom executed a promissory note to Wells Fargo, N.A.\n\nfor the principal sum of $4,720,000.00 for the purchase of the Panther Creek Building. Axiom\n\nMedical, Axiom Properties, DeLitta and Plaintiff executed guaranties. In an effort to fund the\n\ndown payment for the purchase of the Panther Creek Building, Plaintiff and DeLitta each agreed to\n\ntake a $590,000.00 distribution.     Plaintiff then agreed to lend her $590,000.00 to DeLCom\n\nProperties and DeLCom Properties agreed to pay it back through a second note guaranteed by\n\nDeLitta. A true and correct copy of the Wells Fargo promissory note, the settlement statement, the\n\nguaranties, and the second note and guaranty are attached as Exhibits \"B-1 through B-7\"\n\nrespectively, and are incorporated by reference.\n\n27.    On or about September 23, 2013, Plaintiff received correspondence from Nicole Beck, HR\n\nSpecialist for Axiom Medical regarding maintenance items to address due to Plaintiff's leaving\n\nAxiom Medical's employment (\"Exit Letter\"). This was the first time Plaintiff had heard anything\n\nabout her \"leaving\" Axiom Medical. A true and correct of the Exit Letter is attached as Exhibit\n\n\"C-1\" and incorporated by reference.\n\n28.    Shortly after Plaintiff received the Exit Letter, DeLitta sent an email to all Axiom\n\nemployees that purported to terminate Plaintiff as Executive Vice President and misrepresented or\n\nsought to usurp (or both) Plaintiff's role or participation in the continued operation and control of\n\nAxiom (\"Termination Email\"). A true and correct of the Termination Email is attached as Exhibit\n\n\"C-2\" and incorporated by reference. More specifically, Mr. DeLitta stated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED PETITION, ORIGINAL\nTHIRD-PARTY PETITION, AND JURY DEMAND- Page 7\n\n\n                                                                                                        126\n\f       As President & CEO, I have a responsibility to make sure that Axiom remains a\n       viable company and that all of its employees are happy. In order to do this, some\n       changes will need to be made.\n\n       Effectively immediately, Nancy Schaefer is no longer Executive Vice President.\n       She will still be co-owner but will have no input or involvement with the day-to-\n       day activities with nursing or Axiom as a whole. Processes are in place to acquire\n       Nancy's share of the company as we move forward.\n\n       Some of you may receive calls from her while others may want to reach out to her.\n       There is to be no communication with Nancy from a business perspective. If she\n       calls you or you call her, you may talk about anything other than Axiom. If she\n       requests information or documentation from you, you are to refer her to Nicole\n       Beck in HR. Any disregard of this will result in disciplinary action.\n\n29.    DeLitta's actions have created an atmosphere of fear and distrust between the two members\n\nand undermined Plaintiff's longstanding and cherished business relationship with the Nursing\n\nStaff. The damage to the relationship between Plaintiff and Axiom's employees- and hence, her\n\nability to protect her investment and interest in Axiom - is immediate and irreparable and is\n\nincapable of being accurately measured or legally compensated.           The damage to Plaintiff's\n\nbusiness relationship with the Nursing Staff is continued and ongoing.\n\n30.    DeLitta has improperly attempted to engineer a hostile take-over of Axiom through his\n\nunilateral and oppressive attempt to deprive Plaintiff of all rights of management or control of\n\nAxiom, including those rights vested in Plaintiff under the Operating Agreement. The Operating\n\nAgreement contains no provisions that would permit DeLitta to deprive Plaintiff of her role as a\n\nmanager without her input or consent, much less unilaterally. Both the fact that DeLitta has\n\nusurped or attempted to usurp all of Plaintiff's control of Axiom, and the manner and means by\n\nwhich he has endeavored to do so, has caused and continues to cause Plaintiffharm.\n\n31.    In addition, DeLitta has deposited, or caused to be deposited, checks payable to Axiom into\n\nhis own personal account on more than one occasion.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED PETITION, ORIGINAL\nTHIRD-PARTY PETITION, AND JURY DEMAND- Page 8\n\n\n                                                                                                     127\n\f                                                                       12/12/2014 4:22:34 PM\n                                                                              Amalia Rodriguez-Mendoza\n                                                                                            District Clerk\n                                                                                            Travis County\n                                       CAUSE NO. 0-1-GN-13-003516                        D-1-GN-13-003516\n\nNANCY SCHAEFER,                                        §    IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n                                                       §\n         Plaintiff,                                    §\n                                                       §\nvs.                                                    §\n                                                       §\nMICHAEL J.

DeLitta (\"DeLitta\"), enjoining him from holding himself out as a medical doctor, using\n\nthe title \"Dr.,\" and otherwise misleading others as to his qualifications.   DeLitta's conduct is\n\nagainst the law, is causing irreparable harm to Axiom Medical Consulting LLC's reputation, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    323\n\f subjects Axiom to third-party liability, thereby diminishing its value. Michael DeLitta is not a\n\n medical doctor and does not even have a Ph.D. from an accredited university. He is passing\n\n himself off as a medical doctor by pretehding· ti;'at his Ph.D. degree from a discredited \"diploma\n\n mill\" entitles him to call himself \"Dr.\" DeLitta. This is a sham, a fraud on the public, a violation of\n\nMr. DeLitta's obligations under the Physician's Assistant Licensing Act, and a violation of a\n\nspecific criminal statute.\n\n                                   I.       FACTS AND ARGUMENT\n\n 1.      Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\") provides medical consulting services.                  It\n\nadvertises that it \"employs Doctors, Physician Assistants, Registered Nurses, and a specially\n\ntrained support staff to provide a full suite of medical management services, ranging from work-\n\nrelated injury case management to a multitude of customizable exam programs.\" See\n\nhttp://www.axiomllc.com/about/company. Defendant DeLitta is one of the founders of Axiom and\n\nis the current CEO and presumably a licensed Physician's Assistant.                   See Exhibit 1, Axiom\n\nbrochure. The first sentence of the company's online brochure refers to DeLitta as \"Dr. Michael J.\n\nDeLitta.\" !d. (emphasis added). This is a sham.\n\n        A.       \"Dr.\" DeLitta's Fake Ph.D.\n\n2.      DeLitta is not a medical doctor and has never attended medical school. Yet DeLitta\n\nroutinely refers to himself as a \"doctor\" and uses the titles \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\" in the course of\n\nhis work for Axiom. Exhibit 2, Affidavit of Andrea Ruffen.                   Because Axiom is a medical\n\nconsulting company and provides medical advice, there is an substantial likelihood that DeLitta's\n\nuse of the \"Dr.\" title could mislead others into believing that he is a medical doctor. In fact, as\n\nshown below, that is exactly what is happening.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 2\n\n                                                                                                             324\n\f  3.       DeLitta purportedly has a \"Ph.D.\" in psychology from \"Newport University.\" 1 However,\n\n  Newport University is not accredited by any accreditation agency recognized by the U.S.\n\n  Department of Education.          See http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation!Search.aspx.           Furthermore, the\n\n  Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board lists Newport University as an institution that issues\n\n  \"fraudulent or substandard degrees.\" See http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/index.cfm?objectid=\n\n' EF4C3C3B-EB44-4381-6673F760B3946FBB, attached hereto as Exhibit 4. The misuse of this\n\n  fraudulent degree is more than just an exhibition ofDeLitta's vanity or insecurity. Texas makes\n\n  it a crime for DeLitta to use his claimed Ph.D. (i.e., to refer to himself as a \"doctor\") to promote\n\n  a business or to obtain employment, compensation or other benefit in employment or in the\n\n  practice of a trade. TEX.     PENAL    CODE §32.52. DeLitta's Ph.D. \"degree\" in psychology is not\n\n  even what it purports to be, much less a proper basis for him to pass himself off as a medical\n\n  doctor. On these grounds alone, DeLitta should be enjoined from using the title \"Doctor\" or\n\n  \"Dr.\" in any form while employed by Axiom. His actions are hurting the company and subject it\n\n  to liability and a diminished reputation.\n\n          B.       Stretching the Truth Even Further- \"Paging Dr. DeLitta\"\n\n 4.       DeLitta is a Texas-licensed physician's assistant (\"P A\"). As such, he is governed by the\n\n Texas Physician Assistant Board and Chapter 204 of the Texas Occupations Code. His license\n\n imposes a specific obligation for him to avoid confusion over this training. In Texas, a PA that\n\n commits any of the following acts can face civil and criminal liability:\n\n          -falsely represents that the person is a physician;\n\n          - acts in an unprofessional or dishonorable manner that is likely to deceive, defraud, or\n          injure the public;\n\n          1\n              DeLitta also claims to have a \"masters degree\" in Psychology from Newport University. Newport\n  University appears on numerous lists of institutions known informally as \"diploma mills.\"                  See\n. http://www.geteducated.com/fake-diplomas/250-non-accredited-college-newport-intemational-university-forced-to-\n  close, attached hereto as Exhibit 3.\n\n\n Plaintiff's Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta -Page 3\n\n                                                                                                                   325\n\f         -unlawfully advertises in a false, misleading, or deceptive manner, as described by\n         Section 101.201.\n\n TEX. Occ. CODE §§ 204.302(3), 302(4), and 302(8) (\"Conduct Related to Fraud or\n\n Misrepresentation\").\n\n         Section 101.201 ofthe Texas Occupations Code is also applicable to PAs and provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n         Sec. 101.201. FALSE. MISLEADING. OR DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING.\n\n         (a) A person may not use advertising that is false, misleading, deceptive, or not readily\n         subject to verification.\n\n         (b) False, misleading, or deceptive advertising or advertising not readily subject to\n         verification includes advertising that:\n\n                  (1) makes a material misrepresentation offact or omits a fact necessary to make\n                  the statement as a whole not materially misleading;\n\n                  (5) causes confusion or misunderstanding as to the credentials, education, or\n                  licensing ofa health care professional;\n\n                  or\n\n                  (9) represents in the use ofa profossional name a title or professional\n                  identification that is expressly or commonly reserved to or used by another\n                  profossion or professional.\n\nThese statutes were clearly designed to prevent the type of confusion that DeLitta is causing by\n\ncalling himself a \"doctor'' (based on a phony Ph.D. in psychology) while he is engaged in a\n\nmedical consulting business where he allegedly supervises nurses.\n\n5.      At least three former Axiom employees have sounded warnings about DeLitta's misleading\n\nconduct. Ashley Santoro, a registered nurse who was employed by Axiom for over two years,\n\nexpressed concern about this issue in her resignation letter:\n\n        \"I am also concerned over the tact we also are told to lie to our clients about Dr. Mike\n        Delitta. Although, he has a doctorate degree - it is not in medicine. He is not a medical\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 4\n\n                                                                                                      326\n\f          phvsician but a Physician 1s Assistant. I was told to never tell this to our clients and we are\n          always to say ''Dr. DeLitta\" when speaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does\n          not want anyone to !mow he [isl not a medical physician as he solicits himsel[to our clients\n          as.\n\nExhibit 5, Santoro resignation letter.         Former Axiom employee Andrea Ruffen, who worked\n\n closely with DeLitta for seven years, testified by affidavit that she thought DeLitta was a medical\n\ndoctor during the entire time she was employed at Axiom. Exhibit 2, Affidavit of Andrea Ruffen,\n\n~ 4.   Ruffen further testified that:\n\n          a.    DeLitta uses the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in writing, including in\n                e-mails and letters to Axiom employees and Axiom customers and that relate to\n                medical advice or medical issues;\n\n         b.    DeLitta introduces himself as \"Doctor Delitta\" or \"Dr. Delitta\", particularly in\n               medical contexts where the only reasonable impression is that he is a medical\n               doctor;\n\n         c.    DeLitta answers and responds to the title \"Doctor\" when the circumstances make it\n               obvious that the person addressing him believes that he is a medical doctor, and that\n               DeLitta never corrects or clarifies the misunderstanding;\n\n         d.    DeLitta provides medical advice to Axiom employees;\n\n         e.    DeLitta has discussed his experience in \"medical school\";\n\n         f.    DeLitta portrays himself as a \"doctor\" who supervises the nurses that Axiom\n               employs; and\n\n         g.    that the majority of people that DeLitta interacts with and to whom DeLitta has\n               presented himself as a \"doctor\" are misled into believing that he is a medical doctor.\n\nExhibit 2, at~ 5. Finally, former Axiom employee Shane Enochs, who is also a registered nurse,\n\ntestified that he witnessed similar conduct from DeLitta. Exhibit 6, Affidavit of Shane Enochs.\n\n6.       Having gotten away with this charade for so long, DeLitta is self-delusional. Since 2008,\n\nhe has been using a vanity license plate for his vehicle that reads \"OCC DOC,\" which refers to\n\nbeing an Occupational Doctor. He is clearly misleading the public by presenting himself as a\n\n\n\n\nPlaintif:fs Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J.

The Fraud Must Be Corrected\n\n7.                    All of this conduct violates the above-referenced subsections of the Texas Occupations\n\nCode and criminal statutes, with serious potential consequences to Axiom. The consequences\n\nrange from revocation of DeLitta's physician's assistant license, to civil penalties, enforcement\n\nactions by the Texas Attorney General, and remedies under Chapter 17 of the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practices Act. Given DeLitta's role as CEO and co-founder of Axiom, his conduct causes\n\ninunediate and irreparable damage to Axiom's reputation, not only with its customers and\n\nemployees but also within the medical industry, and makes it a party to false advertising and\n\ncomplicit in DeLitta's crime. Plaintiff's request to enjoin DeLitta from holding himself out as a\n\nmedical doctor is absolutely necessary to ensure that Axiom does not continue to violate the Texas\n\nstatutes enacted to protect the safety and welfare of the public, whose injury is also immediate and\n\nirreparable because it cannot be quantified.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Application for Temporary and Pennanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 6\n\n                                                                                                                                                 328\n\f         D.     Defendant Must be Removed as President, CEO and Medical Director\n\n8.       If Defendant is allowed to continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer, President and\n\nMedical Director of Axiom, Axiom will suffer irreparable harm to its reputation and client base.\n\nDefendant's fraudulent conduct goes to the very core of Axiom's reputation, competence and\n\nstanding in the occupational medical field. Mr. DeLitta therefore should be removed and replaced\n\nby a person with bonafide credentials.\n\nIII.     REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY INJUNCTION AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n9.      Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 7 the same as if set forth\n\nherein verbatim.\n\n10.     Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, or otherwise, for the harm or damage which will\n\noccur to the operation of Axiom, unless DeLitta is restrained from continuing to utilize the\n\nbusiness to perpetuate a fraud on the public. Axiom's relationship with its clients will suffer harm\n\nthat cannot be easily measured in damages.\n\n11.     The issuance of requested relief will return the parties to the status quo prior to Plaintiffs\n\nouster. Prior to the lawsuit being filed, Plaintiff had counseled Defendant not to use the .. Dr.\"\n\ndesignation.     However, since her ouster, Defendant has obviously disregarded the law and\n\ncontinues to misrepresent himself.\n\n        E.       Irreparable Harm and No Adequate Remedy at Law\n\n12.     It is essential that DeLitta be restrained and enjoined as prayed for because:\n\n        a.     Such restraint is necessary to maintain the status quo and to protect the rights and\n               interests of Plaintiff in the business and the property of the Axiom Companies;\n\n        b.     Such restraint is necessary to maintain the status quo to prevent any dissipation or\n               diminution ofthe business and the property of the Axiom Companies; and\n\n        c.     Such restraint is necessary to maintain the status quo to prevent any further\n               irreparable damage to Plaintiffs business relationship with the nursing staff.\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 7\n\n                                                                                                         329\n\f         d.     Such restraint is necessary to protect the public interest.\n\n 13.     All conditions precedent to the filing of Plaintiffs application and the damages herein\n\nrequested have been performed or have occurred.\n\n                                       II. PRAYERFORRELIEF\n\n         Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter a Temporary Injunction prohibiting\n\nDeLitta from: (1) using the title \"Doctor\", \"Dr.\", \"M.D.\" or otherwise misleading people into\n\nbelieving that he is a medical doctor while performing any duties or functions for Axiom; (2)\n\nremoving any reference to the term \"Dr.\" or \"M.D.\" from Axiom marketing material including\n\nits website; (3) advising Axiom employees and staff to refer to him as \"Dr.\"; and (4) prohibiting\n\nhim from continuing to be listed on Axiom credit cards and bank statements as \"Dr.\"\n\n         In addition, Defendant should be removed as President, Chief Executive Officer and\n\nMedical Director of Axiom.\n\n         Upon final trial, this Court should enter an order permanently enjoining DeLitta as\n\nset forth above.\n\n                                                    Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                    TAYLOR DUNHAM AND RODRIGUEZ LLP\n\n\n\n\n                                                            dtaylor@taylordunham.com\n\n                                                            Of Counsel Stacey Reese\n                                                            State BarNo. 24056188\n                                                            stacey@reeselawpractice. com\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J.

I was an employee of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC C'Axiom\") for\n    approximately seven years.\n\n             3.      During the time that I was employed by Axiom, I worked closely with Michael J.\n    Delitta (\"Delitta~') and interacted with him on an almost daily basis.\n\n           4.       Throughout my entire period of employment with Axiom, it was my belief and\n    understanding that DeHtta was a medical doctor. This belief was based on Delitta •s words and\n    conduct that I observed.\n\n           5.     Some of Deiitta's words and conduct that caused rne to believe that he was a\n    medical doctor included:\n\n                      a. His use of the title \"Doctor'' and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in wTiting, including\n                         in e-mails and letters he sent to Aximn employees and Axiom customers and\n                         that related to medical advice or medical issues;\n                      b. His introducing himself as '\"Doctor Delitta\" or \"Dr. Delitta\", particularly in\n                         medical contexts where the only reasonable impression was that he was a\n                         medical doctor;\n                      c. Witnessing him answer to and respond to tbe title \"Doctor\" when the\n                         circumstances made it obvious that the person addressing him bdieved ti:lat he\n                         was a medical doctor, and never witnessing him correct or clarify the\n                         misunderstanding;\n                      d. His providing medical advice to myself and other Axiom employees;\n                      e.      discussing his experience in \"medical school\"' in conversation with me;\n                      [ His portrayal of himself as a \"doctor\" who supervises the nurses that Axiom\n                         employs.\n\n    cmscay '\\vnn vl::hua aifO. ·w::u.l m:e oppotu.:un1.y to uDscrVtf h11s HiU::ra0'\\I6ftB ~~·1hr n'l.iflffi't:\\tsl un.TlHt:l\n    people, including non-Axiom parties and Axiom customers. Based on my observations, I\n    that the majority of people that Delitta interacts \\Vith and to whom Delitta has presented himself\n    as a ''doctor\" are misled     believing that he is a medical doctor. The potential fix confusion is\n    particularly high because Axiom is in the medical consulting industry, employs nurses, and\n    provides :medical advice to its customers.\n\n             7.

As a registered nurse the nurse not only has\n the right but an obligation and responsibility to make sure she/he is working legaliy in the state they are\n asked to practice in by Axiom as a nurse. 1have also never worked for a company who is so fearful of\n anyone knowing what the company policies are In regards to the nurses job duties, expectations, and\n internal workings in regards to the nurses job. Especially, when the nurse is only trying to see if what\n she/he is doing ls legal in regards to their nursing license.\n\nAxiom solk!ts itself to companies in states where no nurses are licensed in and accepts dlent case\nmanagement in these states by falsely representing Axiom as having nurses licensed in these states.\nAxiom also instructs the nurse case managers to not reveal to this to their dients, even when the nurse\ngets a case in a state they are not licensed in and are not legally suppose to be practking in. Axiom also\nis forcing, coercing, bullying, and intimidating the nurses into taking these cases by threatening their\nemployment with Axiom by declining to accept cases in states they knowing are not licensed ln. The\nTeam Leaders and Supervisors assigning these cases to nurses not licensed in these states also have\nvicarious liablilty In assigning these cases by knowing first hand aH nurses state licensure status prior to\nassigning these cases and also support the bul!ylng, threatening, and intimidating behavior by enforcing\nthis on the nurses they supervise,\n\nl have requested a copy of the written legal opinion which we were told was done by Jon Neff, Axiom's\nAttorney, along with other nurse.s in regards to the fl ndlngs of the nurses concerns with taking cases in\nstates in which we are r1ot legally licensed in. l have requested this from Pam Tilly, Director of Nursing,\nDara Sievers, Vice-President, Emily Lopez, Compliance Officer, and Nicole Beck, Human Resource,· all\nwho have declined to submit this: opinion which l was told was done, but no one is allowed to see it. I\nwas also declined the request to see the current policy which l was assured Axiom hsd one in place by\nDara Sievers, Vh:e·President, and Nicole Sed; Human Resource, whlch! felt r could work off of until the\nnew policy came into place, The only thing the nurses have been allowed to see is a new guideline by\nAxiom in case assignments with no true opinion and a question and answer sheet which had no attorney\nname attached to it.\n\n In our team meeting this week Emily Lope!, CompHance Officer, Pam Tilly, Director of Nursing, and Mike\n Detitta, President, stated Jim Puente, National Council of State Board of Nursing, assisted Axiom's\nattorneys in the new guidelines. Mike, Emily, and Pam also personally stated and assured the nurses In\nour meeting that lt was okay for the nurses to take cases and act as a practicing nurse In those states in\nwhich she/he Is not !lcensed in and wcs also legally okay. Emily also stated the nurse would be in mona\nlegal trouble for refusing a case in which someone could be really hurt in and used the Goorl Samaritan\nexample and that Jim Puente himself discussed tl;is with her and approved. Emily also told our team\nmembers to call him ·which ! did and he corrected me on this. He not only stated Axiom\nmisrepresented his name, title, and position but also assured he did not assist with Axiom's new\nguidelines ami dld not approve that mJrses can practice !n states they are not legally licensed in, When\nAxiom's attorney called Jim Puente they declined to release the client name they were representing l:>ut\nwanted to discuss only dlscipHnary actions. Axiom's attorneys only cl!scussed with Jim Puente if there\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        00003098\n\n                                                                                                   EXHIBIT 5\n                                                                                                                   351\n\f was documentation of nurses being punished for practicing in states in which they were not licensed ln.\n As he told your attorneys (and how convenient for Axiom) that documentation (if any}   wm not be easily\n found due the nurses do not go to a court of law but have to stand before the Individual nursing board\n ofthe state they have violated or thelr home state nursing board whom disdp!ines them and\n them of their license. The information would have to come for each individual state's nursing board.\n\n! am also concerned r:rver the fact we also are told to lie to our clients about Dr. Mike Delltta. Although,\nhe has a doctorate degree- it is not in medicine. He is not a medical physician but a Physician's\nAssistant. 1was told to never tell this to our clients and we are always to say \"Dr. Delitta\" when\nspeaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does not want anyone to know he not a medical\nphysician as he solicits himself to our clients as. Given Mr. Mike Delitta and Amy Hamilton, Physician\nAssistant, are not licensed io all these states we are asked to practice in ! wonder about the legal liability\nof both of them also. Antt who Is the actual acting physician for our company who is signing off and\noverseeing every Axiom chart/file? Is he/she license ln all these states? I seriously doubt it.\n\n For a company who had a survey donB at the end of last year which showed the employees felt there\nwas lack of communication, dishonesty, and they did not trust the company I would say ! can truly see\nwhy< l also feel since Nancy Schaffer's absence this company has taken a very sharp spiral downward\nand it saddens me I worked so hard for a company who has no disregard for the nurses licenses and\nliveHhooct\n\n! will return your computer, printer, manual, and equipment within the next few days and l obviously do\nnot need an exlt Interview,\n\n! also request this resignation letter go into my personal and human resource file at .Axiom, I also\nrequest a copy of this letter go into the following individuals persona! and humiUl resource file at Axiom:\nMike Delitt:a, President, Nancy Schaffer, Co·Owner, Dara Sievers:, Vice·President, Pam Tilly, Director of\nNursing, Nicole Seck, Human Resource, Emily Lopez, compliance Officer, Shelly Dace, Team Leader, Usa\nHal!, 5L:pervisor, and Jen Brady, Supervisor,\n\nPlease do not contact me further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAshley Santoro\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                 352\n\fCAUSE NO.

The facts stated in this Affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true\nand correct\n\n       2.     I was an employee of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\") for\napproximately 4 years.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               EXHIBIT 6         353\n\f        3.      During the time that I was employed by Axiom, I worked closely with Michael J.\nDelitta (\"Delitta\") and interacted with him on a regular basis.\n\n       4.      Throughout approximately the first year of my employment with Axiom, it was\nmy belief and understanding that DeHtta was a medical doctor. This belief was based on Delitta's\nwords and conduct that I observed.\n\n       5.     Some of Delitta's words and conduct that caused me to believe that he was a\nmedical doctor included:\n\n              a.      His use of the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and\n                      in writing, including in e-mails and letters he sent to Axiom\n                      employees and Axiom customers and that related to\n                      medical advice or medical issues;\n\n              b.      His introducing himself as \"Doctor Delitta\" or \"Dr.\n                      Delitta\", particularly in medical contexts where the only\n                      reasonable impression was that he was a medical doctor:\n\n              c.      Witnessing him ansv;er to and respond to the title \"Doctor\"\n                      when the circumstances made it obvious that the person\n                      addressing him believed that he was a medical doctor, and\n                      never witnessing him correct or clarify the\n                      misunderstanding;\n\n              d.      His providing medical advice to myself and other Axiom\n                      employees;\n\n              e.      His portrayal of himself as a \"doctor\" and the \"Medical\n                      Director\" who supervises the nurses that Axiom employs.\n\n        6.     During the approximately four years that I was employed by Axiom, I worked\nwith Delitta and had the oppottunity to observe his interactions with numerous other people,\nincluding non-Axiom parties and Axiom customers. Based on my observations, I believe that the\nmajority of people that Delitta interacts with and to whom Delitta has presented himself as a\n\"doctor\" are misled into believing that he is a medical doctor. The potential for confusion is\nparticularly high because Axiom is in the medical consulting industry, employs nurses, and\nprovides medical advice to its customers.\n\n      7.        I also observed Dara Wheeler, Vice President, provide instructions to other\nAxiom staff that Delitta should be addressed as \"Dr, Oelitta\".\n\n       8.

An unsigned copy of the Operating Agreement was filed originally because an executed copy\n\nof the signature page to the Operating Agreement could not be located. The parties have treated and\n\ncontinue to treat the Operating Agreement as an effective agreement (e.g., Plaintiff filed suit in Travis\n\nCounty; Defendants did not contest venue and thereby waived any venue challenge; and DeLitta\n\nmade an offer to buy Plaintiff's shares pursuant to the terms in the Operating Agreement). The\n\nOperating Agreement is effective because Schaefer and DeLitta consented to the form, terms and\n\nprovisions of the agreement and approved the agreement in all respects by signing the agreement\n\nand the Written Consent and have also sufficiently ratified the Operating Agreement and Written\n\nConsent as both has treated them as operative and relied on them in good faith.\n\n                                            IV.     FACTS\n\nA.      Creation of Axiom Medical and Establishment of 50/50 Ownership from Inception\n\n15.     In 1999, DeLitta contacted Plaintiff about starting a company that would be owned 50/50\n\nbetween Plaintiff and DeLitta and provide injury management for work-related and personal injuries\n\nfor oil and gas companies. In reliance on DeLitta's agreement that he and Plaintiff would own the\n\nnew company 50/50 and/or be \"equal partners,\" Plaintiff accepted DeLitta's offer. Over the course\n\nof 1999 and 2000, Plaintiff and DeLitta formalized their business plan that included DeLitta handling\n\nall the company's operations and Plaintiff managing the nursing staff. As part ofDeLitta's duty to\n\nhandle the operations of the business, DeLitta formed Axiom Medical in October 1999.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 4\n\n\n                                                                                                            400\n\f24.    On or about August 8, 2013, without Plaintiff's consent and before forming DeLCom\n\nProperties and closing on the Panther Creek Building, DeLitta executed a lease on behalf of both\n\nDeLCom Properties and Axiom Medical with terms that were very favorable to DeLCom Properties\n\n(DeLitta's solely owned company) acting as the landlord and very unfavorable to Axiom Medical,\n\nthe purported tenant (the \"Panther Creek Lease\").\n\n25.    A few days later, DeLitta formed DeLCom Properties on or about August 13, 2013.\n\n26.    On or about August 26,2013, DeLCom executed a promissory note to Wells Fargo, N.A. for\n\nthe principal sum of$4,720,000.00 for the purchase of the Panther Creek Building. Axiom Medical,\n\nAxiom Properties, DeLitta and Plaintiff executed guaranties. In an effort to fund the down payment\n\nfor the purchase of the Panther Creek Building, Plaintiff and DeLitta each agreed to take a\n\n$590,000.00 distribution. Plaintiff then agreed to lend her $590,000.00 to DeLCom Properties and\n\nDeLCom Properties agreed to pay it back through a second note guaranteed by DeLitta. A true and\n\ncorrect copy of the Wells Fargo promissory note, the settlement statement, the guaranties, and the\n\nsecond note and guaranty are attached as Exhibits \"B-1 through B-7\" respectively, and are\n\nincorporated by reference.\n\n27.    On or about September 23, 2013, Plaintiff received correspondence from Nicole Beck, HR\n\nSpecialist for Axiom Medical regarding maintenance items to address due to Plaintiff's leaving\n\nAxiom Medical's employment (\"Exit Letter\"). This was the first time Plaintiffhad heard anything\n\nabout her \"leaving\" Axiom Medical. A true and correct of the Exit Letter is attached as Exhibit \"C-\n\n1\" and incorporated by reference.\n\n28.    Shortly after Plaintiff received the Exit Letter, DeLitta sent an email to all Axiom employees\n\nthat purported to terminate Plaintiff as Executive Vice President and misrepresented or sought to\n\nusurp (or both) Plaintiff's role or participation in the continued operation and control of Axiom\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 7\n\n\n                                                                                                        403\n\f(\"Termination Email\"). A true and correct of the Termination Email is attached as Exhibit \"C-2\"\n\nand incorporated by reference. More specifically, Mr. DeLitta stated as follows:\n\n       As President & CEO, I have a responsibility to make sure that Axiom remains a\n       viable company and that all of its employees are happy. In order to do this, some\n       changes will need to be made.\n\n       Effectively immediately, Nancy Schaefer is no longer Executive Vice President. She\n       will still be co-owner but will have no input or involvement with the day-to-day\n       activities with nursing or Axiom as a whole. Processes are in place to acquire\n       Nancy's share of the company as we move forward.\n\n       Some of you may receive calls from her while others may want to reach out to her.\n       There is to be no communication with Nancy from a business perspective. If she\n       calls you or you call her, you may talk about anything other than Axiom. If she\n       requests information or documentation from you, you are to refer her to Nicole Beck\n       in HR. Any disregard of this will result in disciplinary action.\n\n29.    DeLitta's actions have robbed Plaintiff of her goodwill, created an atmosphere of fear and\n\ndistrust between the two members, and undermined Plaintiff's longstanding and cherished business\n\nrelationship with the Nursing Staff. The damage to the relationship between Plaintiff and Axiom's\n\nemployees - and hence, her ability to protect her investment and interest in Axiom - is immediate\n\nand irreparable and is incapable of being accurately measured or legally compensated. The damage\n\nto Plaintiff's business relationship with the Nursing Staff is continued and ongoing.\n\n30.    DeLitta has improperly attempted to engineer a hostile take-over of Axiom through his\n\nunilateral and oppressive attempt to deprive Plaintiff of all rights of management or control of\n\nAxiom, including those rights vested in Plaintiff under the Operating Agreement. The Operating\n\nAgreement contains no provisions that would permit DeLitta to deprive Plaintiff of her role as a\n\nmanager without her input or consent, much less unilaterally. Both the fact that DeLitta has usurped\n\nor attempted to usurp all ofPlaintiff's control of Axiom, and the manner and means by which he has\n\nendeavored to do so, has caused and continues to cause Plaintiffharm.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 8\n\n\n                                                                                                       404\n\f31.    DeLitta has deposited, or caused to be deposited, checks payable to Axiom into his own\n\npersonal account on more than one occasion. Additionally, DeLitta has used company funds to pay\n\nfor personal litigation expenses.\n\nC.     Plaintiff Obtains a Temporary Restraining Order and Temporary Injunction\n\n32.    After learning that DeLitta had executed the Panther Creek Lease without her consent and\n\nafter receiving both the Exit Letter and Termination Email, on October 9, 2013, Plaintiff filed her\n\noriginal petition and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining Defendants from interfering\n\nwith Plaintiff's access to Axiom's offices, books, records, and employees, from transferring\n\ncompany assets, and from interfering with Plaintiff reinstating herself as Executive Vice President,\n\namong other things. A copy of the Temporary Restraining Order is attached as Exhibit \"D\" and\n\nincorporated by reference.\n\n33.    Plaintiff and Defendants entered into an Agreed Temporary Injunction dated October 29,\n\n2013 (under similar, additional and revised conditions as those imposed by Temporary Restraining\n\nOrder), and the Court appointed a Provisional Voting Member to break ties at the Axiom Medical\n\nboard level. A copy of the Agreed Temporary Injunction and the Order appointing the Provisional\n\nMember is attached as Exhibit \"E-1\" through \"E-2\", respectively, and are incorporated by\n\nreference. One of the most significant disagreements sought to be resolved at that time was the\n\ndispute over DeLitta's pre-litigation execution of the Panther Creek Lease that contained grossly\n\none-sided terms to the benefit of DeLCom Properties and to the detriment of Axiom Medical, the\n\nterms and execution of which constitute self-dealing and defective corporate approval.\n\n34.    After the Provisional Member was appointed, Axiom, with DeLitta's approval, retained the\n\nHouston law firm of Andrews Kurth, LLP to review the alleged Panther Creek Lease. That review\n\nindicated that the alleged Panther Creek Lease was fraught with egregious terms and conditions for\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 9\n\n\n                                                                                                       405\n\fany percentage of her 50% ownership in Axiom Medical interests to the Trust and or agree to the\n\ncompany valuation recited in the Sale Agreement. A copy of the Sale Agreement is attached as\n\nExhibit \"G\" and is incorporated by reference. Further, upon information and belief, the Trust is a\n\nsham- a mere instrument created and/or controlled by DeLitta to deprive Plaintiff of her ownership\n\ninterests. Through these actions, DeLitta and the Trustee have deprived Plaintiff of her interest in\n\nAxiom with and for no payment or consideration to Plaintiff.\n\n43.    Amazingly, Defendants have now abandoned that claim and executed a document stipulating\n\nthat the Trust and Danielle Seger have no interest in Axiom. As result of the stipulation, Plaintiff\n\nhas dropped her claims against the Trust.\n\nE.     DeLitta's Continued Self-Dealing and Violations of the Agreed Temporary Injunction\n       Caused the Court to Appoint a Receiver and Disqualify Counsel from Jointly\n       Representing Axiom and DeLitta\n\n44.    DeLitta has used and continues to use corporate assets for his own personal benefit and\n\ncontinues to violate the Agreed Temporary Injunction in the following ways:\n\n           o used company funds to pay rent without authorization;\n\n           o used company credit cards for personal expenses for himself and for his family;\n\n           o caused unauthorized, self-serving, undocumented and fraudulent accounting entries\n             to be made to his benefit;\n\n           o backdated a fraudulent software license;\n\n           o provided inaccurate financial information to Axiom's board;\n\n           o used company funds to pay for personal litigation expenses;\n\n           o made payments for leasehold improvements and design work for DeLCom\n             Properties' office building without authority;\n\n           o granted raises and changes in employee compensation without authority;\n\n           o delayed payments to Plaintiff while timely paying himself;\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 13\n\n\n                                                                                                       409\n\f            o   delayed or hindered Plaintiff's access to records;\n\n            o   utilized his control over the finances of Axiom by refusing to take certain actions\n                or refusing to pay for certain items when there was a disagreement about an action\n                to be taken by the members; and\n\n            o   threatened Mr. Compton if he exercised his duties as the provisional member.\n\n45.     DeLitta's intentional, willful, and repeated self-dealing and violations of the injunction\n\nharm both Schaefer and Axiom. DeLitta's conduct has gotten so bad that the Court was forced to\n\nappoint a receiver over Axiom's finances and books and disqualify Ms. De Ford and Mr. Drucker's\n\nfirms from jointly representing Axiom and DeLitta to adequately protect Axiom's interests.            In\n\naddition, upon information and belief Defendant DeLitta has apparently used the designation of\n\n\"PhD\" which degree was issued by an unaccredited university and as such Mr. DeLitta should be\n\nenjoined from using such designation.\n\n                                   V.      CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nA.      Count One- Request For Declaratory Judgment\n\n46.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n47.    A present, justiciable controversy exists, the outcome of which may determine the rights\n\nof the parties and the outcome of this litigation. In particular, the ownership of 50% of the member\n\ninterest in Axiom Medical and the validity of the Panther Creek Lease are in dispute. Pursuant to\n\nTEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE §37.001, et seq., Plaintiff requests a declaratory judgment declaring\n\nthe rights of the parties under and in connection with, among other things, writings constituting a\n\ncontract or affected by statute or a contract, whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected\n\nthereby. More specifically, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that:\n\n        a. Plaintiffhas been the owner of 50% ofthe member interest of Axiom Medical since its\n\n            inception or at least prior to June 29, 2005;\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 14\n\n\n                                                                                                            410\n\f        b. the purported transfer of 99% of non-voting membership interests to DeLitta and\n\n            subsequently to the Trust is invalid, voidable and/or void and/or was procured by fraud\n\n            and all documents purporting to transfer same are set aside;\n\n        c. the alleged Panther Creek Lease is void and of no further force and effect; and\n\n        d. Axiom Medical (not DeLitta) owns the DeLCom Software and/or DeLCom Program.\n\n        e. In the alternative, if Axiom Medical does not own the DeLCom Software and/or\n\n            DeLCom Program, it has a perpetual free license to use it.\n\n48.     Pursuant to TEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE §37.009, Plaintiff is entitled to recover an award\n\nof costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees as are equitable and just.\n\nB.      Count Two - Breach Of Operating Agreement by DeLitta\n\n49.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n50.     The Operating Agreement is a valid and enforceable agreement.\n\n51.     DeLitta breached the Operating Agreement.\n\n52.     As a result, Plaintiff has been damaged m an amount m excess of the mm1mum\n\njurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\nC.      Count Three -Breach of Oral Agreement by DeLitta\n\n53.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n54.     DeLitta promised and orally agreed that Plaintiff was 50% owner of Axiom Medical.\n\n55.     DeLitta breached that oral agreement and as a result, Plaintiff suffered damages.\n\nD.      Count Four - Common Law Fraud By DeLitta\n\n56.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n57.     If Plaintiff is not a 50% owner of all membership interests in Axiom Medical, then DeLitta\n\nmade false material misrepresentations to Plaintiff when he told her and acted as if she was a 50%\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 15\n\n\n                                                                                                      411\n\fowner in Axiom Medical and treated her as such. DeLitta knew the misrepresentations were false\n\nwhen he made them or he made them recklessly with the intent that Plaintiff would act on them.\n\nPlaintiff relied on DeLitta's misrepresentations that she was a 50% owner in all interests to her\n\nown detriment and injury.\n\n58.    DeLitta also committed fraud when he made false material misrepresentations about the\n\nSale Agreement inducing Plaintiff to sign it by telling Plaintiff that she was merely consenting to\n\nthe transfer ofhis 50% of the shares to the Trust when in fact the Sale Agreement and the Purchase\n\nAgreement purported to convey 99% of the membership interest in Axiom Medical to the Trust.\n\nDeLitta knew the misrepresentations were false when he made them or he made them recklessly\n\nwith the intent that Plaintiff would act on them. Plaintiff relied on DeLitta's misrepresentations to\n\nher own detriment and injury.\n\n59.    DeLitta committed fraud by nondisclosure when he concealed from or failed to disclose to\n\nPlaintiff the material facts that he had executed the Regulations of Axiom Medical purporting to\n\ngive himself 100% ownership of Axiom Medical and a Purchase Agreement purporting to sell\n\n99% ofhis alleged ownership interest (50% of which belonged to Plaintiff) in Axiom Medical to\n\nthe Trust. DeLitta knew Plaintiff was ignorant of these facts and did not have an equal opportunity\n\nto discover them. DeLitta was deliberately silent when he had a duty to speak and by failing to\n\ndisclose the facts, he intended to induce Plaintiff to sign the Sale Agreement. Plaintiff relied on\n\nDeLitta's non-disclosure to her detriment and injury.\n\n60.    Because they were procured by fraud, the Axiom Medical Regulations, the Sale Agreement\n\nand the Purchase Agreement should be given no force or effect and should be declared void and\n\nvoidable.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 16\n\n\n                                                                                                        412\n\f61.    DeLitta committed fraud by nondisclosure when he concealed from or failed to disclose to\n\nPlaintiff that Axiom Medical did not own the DeLCom Software and/or Program. DeLitta knew\n\nPlaintiff was ignorant of these facts and did not have an equal opportunity to discover them.\n\nDeLitta was deliberately silent when he had a duty to speak and by failing to disclose the facts, he\n\nintended to induce Plaintiff to take some action or refrain from acting. Plaintiff relied on DeLitta' s\n\nnon-disclosure to her detriment and injury.\n\n62.    Plaintiff's reliance on DeLitta's misrepresentations, nondisclosures and/or omissions was\n\nforeseeable and was the proximate cause of damages to Plaintiff.\n\nE.      Count Five - Breach of Fiduciary Duties By DeLitta\n\n63.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n64.    DeLitta established a personal fiduciary duty to Plaintiff prior to the formation of Axiom\n\nMedical.\n\n65.    DeLitta breached his fiduciary duty to Plaintiffby depriving her of her 50% ownership in\n\nAxiom Medical and as her rights as a Member and Manager of Axiom. DeLitta's breach resulted\n\nin injury to Plaintiff and benefit to DeLitta.\n\n66.    DeLitta owes Axiom fiduciary duties including the duty to refrain from self-dealing.\n\n67.    DeLitta's unilateral refusal to implement the resolutions of the Board and the Board-\n\napproved Panther Creek Proposed Lease, coupled with his unauthorized and unapproved dictate to\n\nAxiom that it will return to and pursue the prior Panther Creek Lease, constitutes self dealing and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty, such that the alleged Panther Creek Lease should be declared void,\n\nvoidable, and of no further force and effect.\n\n68.    DeLitta's actions misusing Axiom's corporate credit cards for his personal use and for the\n\npersonal use of his family members and causing entries to be made on Axiom's books creating\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 17\n\n\n                                                                                                          413\n\fpayables to himself when such payables were never made in the past and in the absence of an\n\nassignment agreement assigning Axiom Medical's rights in the software to DeLitta constitutes a\n\nbreach ofDeLitta's fiduciary duty to refrain from self-dealing.\n\n69.      DeLitta has breached his fiduciary duty by using corporate assets for his own personal\n\nbenefit when he caused Axiom to pay for personal litigation expenses in this lawsuit.\n\nF.       Count Six -Negligent Misrepresentation by DeLitta\n\n70.      The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n71.      DeLitta made a representation to Plaintiff and provided false information for the guidance\n\nof others. DeLitta did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating\n\nthe information. Plaintiffjustifiably relied on the representation and the representation proximately\n\ncaused Plaintiff's injuries.\n\nG.       Count Seven - Conversion By DeLitta\n\n72.      The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n73.      Plaintiff owns 50% of the interests in Axiom Medical. DeLitta attempted to transfer\n\nPlaintiff's membership interest to the Trust. As a result, Plaintiff suffered injury and has been\n\ndamaged in an amount in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n74.      Axiom Medical owns the DeLCom Software and/or Program. DeLitta attempt to transfer\n\nthis asset to himself without consent of Axiom Medical or Plaintiff. As a result, Plaintiff suffered\n\ninjury and has been damages in an amount in excess of the minimal jurisdictional limits of this\n\nCourt.\n\n75.      Plaintiff would further show that the conduct of DeLitta is the type of conduct for which\n\nPlaintiff is entitled to punitive and/or exemplary damages. Plaintiff hereby requests the trier of fact\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 18\n\n\n                                                                                                          414\n\fto award Plaintiff punitive and/or exemplary damages in an amount of two times her actual\n\ndamages.\n\nI.      Count Eight- Shareholder Oppression by DeLitta\n\n76.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n77.     DeLitta has, in his conduct described above, usurped and deprived (or has sought and\n\npurported to usurp and deprive) Plaintiff of her rights as a Member and Manager of Axiom including\n\nAxiom Medical, and has oppressed her as a Member. DeLitta's conduct was without color of\n\ncorporate authority, and was also intentional and malicious. Plaintiff seeks recovery ofher monetary\n\ndamages in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court, and punitive and exemplary\n\ndamages as permitted by Texas law.\n\nJ.      Count Nine- Constructive Trust\n\n78.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n79.     To the extent the Trust was the recipient or transferee of any of Plaintiff's interest in Axiom\n\nMedical, the transfer was intended to hinder, delay and defraud Plaintiff, and was or constituted a\n\ntransfer in exchange for which there was no consideration or no fair value to Plaintiff. This\n\ntransaction was, though known to Mr. DeLitta, concealed from Plaintiff and was not known by her\n\nuntil DeLitta filed a motion to implead the Trustee as a necessary party. Plaintiff's interest in\n\nAxiom Medical arose prior to any such transfer, and the transfer to the Trust was an insider\n\ntransaction, and was not made in good faith as to Plaintiff. Pursuant to TEX. Bus. & COMM. CODE\n\n§ 24.001, et seq., the above transfer, if not void or subject or subservient to the interests ofPlaintiff,\n\nis avoidable. Plaintiff is entitled to, and hereby prays for, all such remedies, at law or in equity as are\n\nprovided under Texas law, including TEX. Bus. & COMM. CODE § 24.008, costs and reasonable\n\nattorneys fees as are equitable and just under TEX. Bus. & COMM. CODE§ 24.013, and the imposition\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 19\n\n\n                                                                                                              415\n\fof an equitable lien or constructive trust on the 50% member interest. In the alternative, Plaintiff\n\nprays for damages and such other equitable relief as may be proven at trial.\n\nJ.     Count Ten -Injunctive Relief From All Defendants\n\n80.    The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n81.    Plaintiff incorporates by reference as if fully set out herein Plaintiff's first, second and third\n\nverified applications for temporary restraining order, temporary injunction and permanent\n\ninjunction, Plaintiff's verification filed on Dec. 15, 2014, and Plaintiff's Verified Application for\n\nTemporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta from Misrepresenting Himself\n\nas a Medical Doctor filed December 12, 2014.\n\n82.    Plaintiff seeks to obtain a permanent injunction in this matter consistent with its claims in\n\nthis lawsuit and the Agreed Temporary Injunction.\n\n83.    Plaintiff has demonstrated a viable cause of action against Defendants; Plaintiff has\n\ndemonstrated a probable right to the relief sought; and Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable\n\nimminent and irreparable injury in the interim for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\n84.    If Defendants' conducts is not permanently enjoined, Plaintiff will continue to suffer an\n\nimmediate and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law to her business\n\nrelationships with Axiom employees, an immediate and irreparable injury to her ownership interests\n\nin Axiom, and an immediate and irreparable injury in her ability to manage Axiom including without\n\nlimitation her ability to create, implement and review company policies, hire and fire employees, set\n\nemployee compensation, and train employees.\n\nK.     Count Eleven- Alternative Request for Corporate Judicial Remedies\n\n85.    The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 20\n\n\n                                                                                                            416\n\f86.    Plaintiff seeks enforcement of the provisions of the Operating Agreement to appoint a\n\nreceiver to rehabilitate, sell and/or seek dissolution of Axiom Medical pursuant to section 64.001 of\n\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and/or sections 11.314, 11.402, 11.403, 11.404, and/or\n\n11.405 of the Texas Business Organizations Code. Notwithstanding the appointment of a Provisional\n\nMember and a Receiver, DeLitta continues to refuse to follow the vote by Axiom's Board including\n\nthe Provisional Member and continues to violate the Agreed Temporary Injunction. Given DeLitta's\n\ncontinual refusal to follow the Board's votes and violations of the Agreed Temporary Injunction, a\n\nreceiver should be given the power to sell the company and/or dissolve it as a perpetual deadlock\n\namong the members is not feasible.\n\nL.     Count Twelve-Unjust Enrichment\n\n87.    The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n88.    After receiving the benefit ofPlaintiff's goodwill in the industry, DeLitta: (a) ousted Plaintiff\n\nfrom Axiom Medical; (b) sought to deprive her of her membership interests; (c) created an\n\natmosphere of fear and distrust between the two members; and (d) undermined Plaintiff's\n\nlongstanding and cherished business relationship with the Nursing Staff.\n\n89.    DeLitta received the benefit of Plaintiff's goodwill by fraud, duress, or the taking of an\n\nundue advantage. DeLitta wrongfully secured or passively received this benefit and it would be\n\nunconscionable for him to retain it.\n\n                             VI.       CONDITIONS PRECEDENT\n\n90.

DeLitta (\"DeLitta\") from Misrepresenting\n\nHimself as a Medical Doctor.\n\n        After having reviewed the pleadings on file, after having heard the arguments of counsel\n\nand testimony from witnesses, the Court finds that Plaintiff's verified application for temporary\n\ninjunction should be granted.\n\nThe Court finds that:\n\nI.      DeLitta is not a medical doctor.\n\n2.      DeLitta serves as President and CEO of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\").\n\n3.    Axiom provides medical consulting services and advertises that it \"employs Doctors,\n\nPhysician Assistants, Registered Nurses, an a specially trained staff to provide a full suite of\n\n\n\n\n                        Case# D-1-GN-13-003516\n\n                        1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n                        003993332\n                                                                                                    624\n\f                                       DC           BK15113 PG976\n\n\n\n\nmedical management services, ranging from work-related injury case management to a multitude\n\nof customizable exam programs.\"\n\n4.    DeLitta is a licensed physician assistant.\n\n5.    DeLitta has a Ph.D in Psychology from Newport University.\n\n6.    Axiom's company brochures and website to refer to DeLitta as \"Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.\"\n\n7.    DeLitta has referred to himself as a \"doctor\" and uses the titles \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\" in the\n\ncourse of his work for Axiom.\n\n8.    DeLitta has a license plate that reads \"OCC DOC\" which refers to being an Occupational\n\nDoctor.\n\n9.    DeLitta has had a credit card with the term \"M.D.\" after his name.\n\n10.   DeLitta uses the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in writing, including in e-mails\n\nand letters to Axiom employees and Axiom customers.\n\nII.   DeLitta answers and responds to the title \"Doctor\" when the circumstances make it obvious\n\nthat the person addressing him believes that he is a medical doctor, and that DeLitta never\n\ncorrects or clarifies the misunderstanding.\n\n12.   Because Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides medical advice, there is a\n\nsubstantial likelihood that DeLitta's use of the \"Dr.\" title could mislead others into believing that\n\nhe is a medical doctor.\n\n13.   DeLitta's conduct is causing immediate and irreparable harm to Axiom's reputation and may\n\nsubject Axiom to civil and criminal liability thereby diminishing its value and causing damages\n\nthat are not quantifiable.\n\n14.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a viable cause of action against DeLitta.\n\n15.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable right to the relief sought.\n\n\nTemporary Injunction Enjoining Michael J. DeLitta\nFrom Misrepresenting Himself as Medical Doctor\n\n\n                                                                                                        625\n\f                                        DC              BK15113 PG977\n\n\n\n\n16.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable immediate and irreparable injury in the interim that cannot\n\nbe compensated by money damages for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\n17.   If DeLitta's conduct is not enjoined, his conduct will cause immediate and irreparable injury to\n\nAxiom's reputation, not only with its customers and employees but also within the medical industry,\n\nand makes it a party to false advertising and complicit in DeLitta' s wrongful conduct.\n\n        IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, that Defendant MICHAEL J.

DeLitta (\"DeLitta\") from Misrepresenting\n\nHimself as a Medical Doctor.\n\n        After having reviewed the pleadings on file, after having heard the arguments of counsel\n\nand testimony from witnesses, the Court finds that Plaintiff's verified application for temporary\n\ninjunction should be granted.\n\nThe Court finds that:\n\n1.      DeLitta is not a medical doctor.\n\n2.      DeLitta serves as President and CEO of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\").\n\n3.    Axiom provides medical consulting services and advertises that it \"employs Doctors,\n\nPhysician Assistants, Registered Nurses, an a specially trained staff to provide a full suite of\n\n\n\n\nTemporary Injunction Enjoining Michael J.

DeLitta is a licensed physician assistant.\n\n5.     DeLitta has a Ph.D in Psychology from Newport University.\n\n6.    Axiom's company brochures and website to refer to DeLitta as \"Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.\"\n\n7.    DeLitta has referred to himself as a \"doctor\" and uses the titles \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\" in the\n\ncourse of his work for Axiom.\n\n8.    DeLitta has a license plate that reads \"OCC DOC\" which refers to being an Occupational\n\nDoctor.\n\n9.    DeLitta has had a credit card with the term \"M.D.\" after his name.\n\n10.   DeLitta uses the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in writing, including in e-mails\n\nand letters to Axiom employees and Axiom customers.\n\n11.   DeLitta answers and responds to the title \"Doctor\" when the circumstances make it obvious\n\nthat the person addressing him believes that he is a medical doctor, and that DeLitta never\n\ncorrects or clarifies the misunderstanding.\n\n12.   Because Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides medical advice, there is a\n\nsubstantial likelihood that DeLitta's use of the \"Dr.\" title could mislead others into believing that\n\nhe is a medical doctor.\n\n13.   DeLitta's conduct is causing immediate and irreparable harm to Axiom's reputation and\n\nmay subject Axiom to civil and criminal liability thereby diminishing its value and causing\n\ndamages that are not quantifiable.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   2\nTemporary Injunction Enjoining Michael J.

Plaintiff has demonstrated a viable cause of action against DeLitta.\n\n 15.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable right to the relief sought.\n\n 16.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable immediate and irreparable injury in the interim that\n\n cannot be compensated by money damages for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\n 17.   If DeLitta's conduct is not enjoined, his conduct will cause immediate and irreparable injury\n\nto Axiom's reputation, not only with its customers and employees but also within the medical\n\nindustry, and makes it a party to false advertising and complicit in DeLitta's wrongful conduct.\n\n       IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, that Defendant MICHAEL J.

In this business dispute over the ownership of Axiom, Schaefer\n                    asserts claims against her co-owner DeLitta for breach of fiduciary\n                    duty for DeLitta’s repeated and ongoing self-dealing and\n                    usurpation of corporate assets. ...................................................................... 1\n          B.        Schaefer has already successfully sought temporary relief enjoining\n                    DeLitta’s malfeasance, enforcing those prohibitions, and placing\n                    the company in a partial receivership............................................................ 2\n          C.        Axiom is a medical consulting company that provides injury\n                    management and medical advice concerning work-related\n                    accidents. .......................................................................................................... 3\n          D.        DeLitta, Axiom’s “Medical Director,” is not a medical doctor. ................ 3\n          E.        Yet DeLitta unabashedly portrays himself, professionally and\n                    personally, as “Dr. DeLitta.”.......................................................................... 4\n          F.        DeLitta’s fake persona is effective: clients and employees believe\n                    he is a medical doctor. .................................................................................... 7\n          G.        DeLitta justifies the title because he obtained a “Ph.D.” in\n                    psychology from a diploma mill. ................................................................... 8\n          H.        The trial court correctly determined that use of the title “Dr.\n                    DeLitta” is highly misleading when used by a “medical director” of\n                    a company in a medical-related industry and that enjoining DeLitta\n                    from doing so was necessary to protect Axiom’s corporate assets\n                    pending final resolution of this lawsuit......................................................... 8\n\n\n                                                                   iii\n\fStandard of Review .............................................................................................................. 10\nSummary of Argument ........................................................................................................ 11\nArgument ............................................................................................................................... 11\n\nI.       DeLitta misleads the Court by suggesting Schaefer asserts a statutory cause of\n         action under the Occupation Code......................................................................... 11\n          A.         The trial court’s injunction is based on Schaefer’s probable right to\n                     recover on her breach of fiduciary claims—a claim DeLitta does\n                     not even challenge. ........................................................................................ 12\n          B.         Violations of the Occupations and Penal Codes are the conduct\n                     enjoined, not the cause of action asserted, and prohibiting that\n                     misconduct is necessary to preserve the status quo of Axiom as a\n                     reputable entity free from civil and criminal liability. ............................... 13\n          C.         There is ample evidence to support the trial court’s determination\n                     that DeLitta was fraudulently holding himself out as a medical\n                     doctor. ............................................................................................................. 16\n\nII.      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that DeLitta’s\n         fraudulent conduct threatened Axiom with imminent harm............................... 19\nConclusion............................................................................................................................. 23\nCertificate of Compliance .................................................................................................... 25\nCertificate of Service ............................................................................................................ 25\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    iv\n\f                                              INDEX OF AUTHORITIES\nCases\nButnaru v.

In this business dispute over the ownership of Axiom, Schaefer asserts\n       claims against her co-owner DeLitta for breach of fiduciary duty for\n       DeLitta’s repeated and ongoing self-dealing and usurpation of corporate\n       assets.\n       This is a business dispute over the ownership and management of Axiom\n\nMedical Consulting, LLC. 5 DeLitta and Schaefer partnered to form the company in\n\n1999. 6 Over a decade later, the relationship between the two owners deteriorated and,\n\nin September 2013, DeLitta started taking drastic measures to unilaterally push Schaefer\n\nout of the company and undermine her goodwill within the company.7\n\n       Schaefer sued.8 Schaefer claims, among other things, that DeLitta breached oral\n\nand written contracts, committed fraud, and breached his fiduciary duties to her and to\n\nthe company.9 Her fiduciary claims include allegations that Delitta is depriving her of\n\nher 50% ownership in Axiom and her rights as a member and manager of Axiom, and\n\nthat DeLitta is engaging in self-dealing to the detriment of Axiom, including unilaterally\n\nrefusing to implement the resolutions of the Board and misusing corporate assets for\n\nhis personal benefit.10 Schaefer also asserts a claim for negligent misrepresentation\n\nbecause DeLitta provided false information for the guidance of others.11\n\n\n\n5\n   CR125–27.\n6\n  CR400.\n7\n  CR403–04.\n8\n  CR3.\n9\n  CR409–17.\n10\n   CR413–14.\n11\n   CR414.\n                                            1\n\fB.     Schaefer has already successfully sought temporary relief enjoining\n       DeLitta’s malfeasance, enforcing those prohibitions, and placing the\n       company in a partial receivership.\n       Upon filing suit, Schaefer immediately sought and received a temporary\n\nrestraining order enjoining DeLitta from interfering with her access to and position in\n\nthe company.12 Eventually, the parties entered into an Agreed Temporary Injunction.\n\nThe Agreed Injunction prohibited the parties from undertaking certain acts, similar to\n\nthe TRO, and also obligated the parties to file a joint motion for appointment of a\n\nprovisional member to break deadlock between Schaefer and DeLitta.13\n\n       Unfortunately, the Court is intimately familiar with this litigation from this point.\n\nThis is the fifth appeal that DeLitta has filed. Four of those appeals were attempted\n\ninterlocutory appeals.14      One was a mandamus proceeding. 15               None have been\n\nsuccessful.16 And, in addition to this appeal, one other remains pending before the\n\nCourt.17\n\n       DeLitta’s intentional, willful, and repeated self-dealing and violations of the\n\ninjunction—which harm both Schaefer and Axiom—have gotten so bad that the trial\n\n\n12\n   CR405.\n13\n   Id.\n14\n   See No. 03-15-00280-CV (this appeal); No. 03-14-000425-CV (appeal of order appointing receiver);\nNo. 03-14-00426-CV (appeal of an order enforcing the terms of agreed temporary injunction); No.\n03-15-00085-CV (appeal of order refusing to dissolve agreed temporary injunction).\n15\n   No. 03-14-00423-CV (original proceeding seeking to declare agreed temporary injunction void).\n16\n   No. 03-14-00423-CV (original proceeding seeking to declare injunction void, denied on July 11,\n2014); No. 03-14-00426-CV (appeal of an order enforcing the terms of the injunction dismissed for\nlack of jurisdiction on November 6, 2014); No. 03-14-000425-CV (appeal of order appointing a\nreceiver over Axiom dismissed for failure to prosecute on October 17, 2014).\n17\n   No. 03-15-00085-CV (appeal of order refusing to dissolve agreed temporary injunction).\n                                                2\n\fcourt was forced to appoint a receiver over Axiom’s finances and books and to\n\ndisqualify DeLitta’s attorneys from jointly representing Axiom and DeLitta to\n\nadequately protect Axiom’s interests.18 The case is set for trial on October 26, 2015.19\n\nC.    Axiom is a medical consulting company that provides injury management\n      and medical advice concerning work-related accidents.\n      Axiom is a medical consulting company.20            The company provides injury\n\nmanagement for work-related and personal injuries for oil and gas companies.21 Axiom\n\nadvertises that it “employs Doctors, Physician Assistants, Registered Nurses, and a\n\nspecially trained support staff to provide a full suite of medical management services,\n\nranging from work-related injury case management to a multitude of customizable exam\n\nprograms.”22 It allows employees and employers “immediate access to [a] medical\n\nprofessional 24/7 for [employment-related] injuries.”23\n\nD.    DeLitta, Axiom’s “Medical Director,” is not a medical doctor.\n      DeLitta serves as both CEO and “Medical Director” of Axiom. DeLitta,\n\nhowever, is not a medical doctor. He is a physician’s assistant. As a condition to his\n\nlicensure, DeLitta must be continuously supervised by a supervising physician and is\n\n\n\n\n18\n   CR410.\n19\n   CR635.\n20\n   2RR56.\n21\n   CR400.\n22\n   CR324.\n23\n   3RRPX2.\n                                           3\n\fprohibited from providing any medical services unless his supervising physician\n\ndelegates services for him to perform.24\n\n       A physician’s assistant is expressly prohibited from “falsely represent[ing] that\n\nthe person is a physician” or from acting “in a unprofessional or dishonorable manner\n\nthat is likely to deceive, defraud, or injure the public.”25 These prohibitions are stated\n\nin a section entitled “Conduct Related to Fraud or Misrepresentation.”26\n\nE.     Yet DeLitta unabashedly portrays himself, professionally and personally,\n       as “Dr. DeLitta.”\n       Despite these statutory prohibitions against a physician’s assistant misleading\n\nothers into believing he is a medical doctor, until recently, Axiom’s marketing materials\n\nstated that it “is a privately owned company established in 1999 by its CEO Dr. Michael\n\nJ. DeLitta” and whose “mission” is “to transform Occupational Medicine.”27\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 28\n\n\n\n\n24\n   TEX. OCC.

He maintains a similar email address: occdoc66@hotmail.com.34\n\n\n\n\n31\n   3RRPX7.\n32\n   2RR50, 56.\n33\n   CR625.\n34\n   2RR56, 58, 59-60 (occupational medicine field); 2RR50 (email).\n                                                 6\n\fF.     DeLitta’s fake persona is effective: clients and employees believe he is a\n       medical doctor.\n       These public representations by DeLitta have left the impression to those in his\n\nwork environment that DeLitta is a medical doctor. Schaefer alerted DeLitta of the\n\nfalse impression he was creating as early as 2010. 35 Since then, several former Axiom\n\nemployees have also sounded warnings about DeLitta’s misleading conduct. Ashley\n\nSantoro, a registered nurse who was employed by Axiom for over two years, expressed\n\nconcern about the issue in her resignation letter:\n\n       I am also concerned over the fact we also are told to lie to our clients\n       about Dr. Mike DeLitta. Although, he has a doctorate degree - it is not in\n       medicine. He is not a medical physician but a Physician’s Assistant. I was\n       told to never tell this to our clients and we are always to say “Dr. DeLitta”\n       when speaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does not want\n       anyone to know he is not a medical physician as he solicits himself to our\n       clients as. 36\n       Former Axiom employee Shane Enochs, also a registered nurse, offered similar\n\ntestimony at the hearing on the temporary injunction. He testified that DeLitta used\n\nthe title “Doctor” both orally and in writing in connection with his employment with\n\nAxiom. 37 Staff members regularly introduced him, both in staff meetings and in\n\npresentations to clients, as “Dr. Michael DeLitta.”38 He never corrected or clarified that\n\nhis title as “doctor” referenced a psychology degree and not a medical degree.39 Mr.\n\n\n\n35\n   3RRDX21.\n36\n   CR351–52.\n37\n   2RR29.\n38\n   2RR29.\n39\n   2RR30, 34.\n                                            7\n\fEnochs was convinced, based on his observations of how people reacted to DeLitta,\n\nthat using the title “doctor” was misleading people into falsely believing DeLitta was a\n\nmedical doctor. 40 Even Enochs was misled. He testified that he himself thought\n\nDeLitta was a medical physician his first year at Axiom.41\n\nG.     DeLitta justifies the title because he obtained a “Ph.D.” in psychology\n       from a diploma mill.\n       Although he is not a medical doctor, DeLitta does have a “Ph.D.” from Newport\n\nUniversity, a web-based “education institution.” 42 Now defunct, “Newport University\n\nwas not accredited by any higher education accreditation organization by the United\n\nState Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.” 43\n\nThe Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board lists Newport University as an\n\ninstitution that issues “fraudulent or substandard degrees.”44\n\nH.     The trial court correctly determined that use of the title “Dr. DeLitta” is\n       highly misleading when used by a “medical director” of a company in a\n       medical-related industry and that enjoining DeLitta from doing so was\n       necessary to protect Axiom’s corporate assets pending final resolution of\n       this lawsuit.\n       Deeply concerned that DeLitta was holding himself out as a medical doctor and\n\nmisleading others as to his qualifications, Schaefer filed a verified application for a\n\n\n40\n   2RR30.\n41\n   2RR34.\n42\n   3RRDX1.\n43\n   3RRDX1. Newport University appears on numerous lists of institutions known informally as\n“diploma mills.” CR347–48.\n44\n   CR349–50. DeLitta tried to convince the trial court that the “Newport University” listed here is\nnot the same institution that issued his “Ph.D.,” but this Court must view the evidence most favorably\nin support of the judgment.\n                                                  8\n\ftemporary injunction on December 12, 2014.45 The application was heard on April 15,\n\n2015. 46 The Honorable Orlinda Naranjo presided over the evidentiary hearing.47\n\n       On April 22, 2015, the trial court signed a temporary injunction enjoining\n\nDeLitta from using the title “Doctor,” “Dr.,” or M.D. in any context and removing any\n\nreference to the term Dr. or M.D. from Axiom marketing materials.48 The trial court\n\nemphasized that “[b]ecause Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides\n\nmedical advice, there is a substantial likelihood that DeLitta’s use of the ‘Dr.’ title could\n\nmislead others into believing that he is a medical doctor.” 49 As to harm, the trial court\n\nfound that DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct “is causing immediate and irreparable harm to\n\nAxiom’s reputation and may subject Axiom to civil and criminal liability thereby\n\ndiminishing its value and causing damages that are not quantifiable.”50 This harm, the\n\ntrial court found, harms Axiom’s reputation, not only with its customers and employees\n\nbut also within the medical industry, and makes Axiom a party to false advertising and\n\ncomplicit in DeLitta’s wrongful conduct.”51\n\n       The temporary injunction was later amended, by agreement, to correct the trial\n\ndate.52 This appeal followed.53\n\n\n45\n   CR323–59.\n46\n   2RR1.\n47\n   Id.\n48\n   CR624–28.\n49\n   CR625.\n50\n   CR625.\n51\n   CR626.\n52\n   CR632.\n53\n   CR642–45.\n                                             9\n\f                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Whether to grant or deny an injunction is within a trial court’s discretion.

App.—Dallas 1989,\n\nno writ).\n\n                               SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n      DeLitta is not a medical doctor, but he uses the title “doctor” in a way that leads\n\nthe employees and customers of his medical consulting company to falsely believe that\n\nhe is. Materials that market the company’s occupational medical services refer to him\n\nas “Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.” So do his business cards. He opened a credit card as\n\n“Michael J. DeLitta, MD” and even owns a car with “OCC DOC” vanity plates.\n\n       DeLitta’s conduct is not just misleading; it is against the law. The trial court was\n\nreasonable to conclude that DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct is causing irreparable harm to\n\nthe Axiom Companies’ reputation and subjecting Axiom to civil and criminal liability,\n\nthereby diminishing the companies’ value and thus Schaefer’s financial interest.\n\n                                      ARGUMENT\nI.    DeLitta misleads the Court by suggesting Schaefer asserts a statutory\n      cause of action under the Occupation Code.\n      The entire premise of DeLitta’s appeal is a conjured issue with no basis in this\n\nrecord. All but two pages of DeLitta’s argument is spent attempting to convince the\n\nCourt that Schaefer has “no standing” to seek an injunction because “no private civil\n\ncause of action exists” under the Occupations and Penal Code provisions that the trial\n\n\n                                            11\n\fcourt found DeLitta was violating.54 As such, he argues, Schaefer cannot show two\n\nnecessary elements for obtaining an injunction: (1) a cause of action against the\n\ndefendant, and (2) a probable right to the relief sought.55\n\nA.     The trial court’s injunction is based on Schaefer’s probable right to recover\n       on her breach of fiduciary claims—a claim DeLitta does not even\n       challenge.\n       Schaefer did not (and need not) plead and prove a statutory “cause of action”\n\nunder the Occupations and Penal Codes. The cause of action on which Schaefer will\n\nprobably obtain relief is her claims that DeLitta breached his fiduciary duties to Axiom,\n\ncommitted fraud, and provided false information for the guidance of others. This is\n\nthe wrongful conduct that forms the basis of the trial court’s injunction. Franklin Sav.\n\nAss’n v.

On appeal, too, his brief is silent as to these causes of action.\n\n       DeLitta was forced to conjure up a cause of action because Schaefer so easily\n\nmet her burden to show viable claims against him. In fact, Schaefer has already\n\nsuccessfully sought temporary relief enjoining DeLitta’s malfeasance, enforcing those\n\nprohibitions, and placing the company in a partial receivership.56 The trial court was\n\n\n54\n   Appellant’s Br. at 17.\n55\n   Appellant’s Br at 16–18 (Section 1, no cause of action under Occupations Code), 18–21 (Section 2,\nno probable recovery under Occupations and Penal Codes).\n56\n   See supra at 2 (Statement of Facts, Section B).\n                                                12\n\freasonable to conclude that Schaefer met her burden of showing a viable cause of action\n\nfor breach of fiduciary duty.

Violations of the Occupations and Penal Codes are the conduct enjoined,\n       not the cause of action asserted, and prohibiting that misconduct is\n       necessary to preserve the status quo of Axiom as a reputable entity free\n       from civil and criminal liability.\n       Although the injunction was not based on a statutory cause of action, the\n\nOccupations Code and Penal Code did play a role in the trial court’s decision to enter\n\nthe injunction. Texas law does prohibit an individual from holding himself out as a\n\nmedical doctor. As a PA, DeLitta also faces regulatory action, including forfeiture of\n\nhis license. If DeLitta’s conduct continued, Axiom faced civil penalties and third-party\n\nliability. At the time the injunction was sought, Axiom had not been cited or sued for\n\nDeLitta’s egregious conduct. Thus, the injunction preserved the status quo by ensuring\n\nthat Axiom would remain free from civil and criminal liability for DeLitta’s misconduct.\n\n       DeLitta’s conduct threatened both him and Axiom of civil penalties. DeLitta is\n\na Texas-licensed physician’s assistant (“PA”). As such, he is governed by the Texas\n\nPhysician Assistant Board and Chapter 204 of the Texas Occupations Code. His license\n\n                                             13\n\fimposes a specific obligation for him to avoid confusion over this training. A PA that\n\ncommits any of the following acts can face civil and criminal liability:\n\n      •      falsely represents that the person is a physician;\n\n      •      acts in an unprofessional or dishonorable manner that is likely to deceive,\n             defraud, or\n\n      •      injure the public; -unlawfully advertises in a false, misleading, or deceptive\n             manner, as described by Section 101.201.\nTEX.

CODE §§204.302(3), 302(4), and 302(8) (“Conduct Related to Fraud or\n\nMisrepresentation”).\n\n      The Occupations Code also prohibits false, misleading, or deceptive advertising\n\nby certain professionals, including PAs:\n\n      (a)    A person may not use advertising that is false, misleading, deceptive, or\n             not readily subject to verification.\n      (b)    False, misleading, or deceptive advertising or advertising not readily\n             subject to verification includes advertising that:\n             (1)    makes a material misrepresentation of fact or omits a fact necessary\n                    to make the statement as a whole not materially misleading;\n             (5)    causes confusion or misunderstanding as to the credentials,\n                    education, or licensing of a health care professional;\n             or\n             (9)    represents in the use of a professional name a title or professional\n                    identification that is expressly or commonly reserved to or used by\n                    another profession or professional.\nTEX. OCC. CODE §101.201.\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Finally, Texas makes it a crime for DeLitta to use his claimed Ph.D. (i.e., to refer\n\nto himself as a “doctor”) to promote a business or to obtain employment, compensation\n\nor other benefit in employment or in the practice of a trade. TEX. PENAL CODE §32.52.\n\n      These statutes were clearly designed to prevent the type of confusion that\n\nDeLitta is causing by calling himself a “doctor” (based on a phony Ph.D. in psychology)\n\nwhile he is engaged in a medical consulting business where he allegedly supervises\n\nnurses. But, more to the point, DeLitta’s flagrant violations of these statutes has serious\n\npotential consequences to Axiom.        The consequences range from revocation of\n\nDeLitta’s physician’s assistant license to civil penalties, enforcement actions by the\n\nTexas Attorney General, and remedies under Chapter 17 of the Texas Deceptive Trade\n\nPractices Act. Given DeLitta’s role as CEO and co-founder of Axiom, his conduct\n\nmakes the company itself a party to false advertising and complicit in DeLitta’s crime.\n\n      Enjoining DeLitta from continuing to violate these provisions was necessary to\n\nmaintain the status quo and to protect the rights and interests of Schaefer in the\n\nbusiness and the property of the Axiom Companies. The injunction prevents any\n\ndissipation or diminution of the business and the property of the Axiom Companies,\n\nwhich is the very heart of this lawsuit. It also protects the devastation to Axiom’s\n\nreputation should the industry learn that the company’s CEO and Medical Director was\n\ninvestigated, fined, or stripped of his PA license for fraud and false advertising.\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fC.        There is ample evidence to support the trial court’s determination that\n          DeLitta was fraudulently holding himself out as a medical doctor.\n          DeLitta also implies that the trial court erred in finding that his conduct does not\n\nviolate the Occupations and Penal Code provisions. 57 The trial court was not required\n\nto do so. In fact, the injunction does not even reference those statutes. And rightly so.\n\nEven if there was no statutory prohibition against an individual holding himself out to\n\nbe a medical doctor when he is not one, a trial court would be reasonable in enjoining\n\nthat misconduct as fraudulent and misleading and likely to subject a company to\n\nreputational harm and third-party liability. The fact that the Legislature has expressly\n\nlabeled this misconduct as fraudulent and misleading simply amplifies the impropriety\n\nof DeLitta’s actions.\n\n          And the evidence is overwhelming that DeLitta is misleading others into\n\nbelieving he is a medical doctor when he is not. The first sentence of the company’s\n\nonline brochure refers to DeLitta as “Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.” The brochure does not\n\ninclude the initials “Ph.D.” DeLitta maintains business cards as “Dr. Michael J.\n\nDeLitta.” Again, the cards do not include the initials “Ph.D.” But they do incorporate\n\ncaduceus, the modern symbol of medicine.\n\n          Several former Axiom employees have sounded warnings about DeLitta’s\n\nmisleading conduct. Ashley Santoro, a registered nurse who was employed by Axiom\n\nfor over two years, cited DeLitta’s fraudulent conduct in a scathing resignation letter:\n\n\n57\n     Appellant’s Br. at 17–18.\n                                               16\n\f       I am also concerned over the tact we also are told to lie to our clients\n       about Dr. Mike DeLitta. Although, he has a doctorate degree - it is not in\n       medicine. He is not a medical physician but a Physician’s Assistant. I was\n       told to never tell this to our clients and we are always to say “Dr. DeLitta”\n       when speaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does not want\n       anyone to know he [isl not a medical physician as he solicits himself to our\n       clients as. 58\n       Former Axiom employee Shane Enochs, who is also a registered nurse, testified\n\nbefore the trial court that he witnessed similar conduct from DeLitta. He testified that\n\nDeLitta used the title “Doctor” both orally and in writing in connection with his\n\nemployment with Axiom. 59 Staff members regularly introduced him, both in staff\n\nmeetings and in presentations to clients, as “Dr. Michael DeLitta.”60 He never corrected\n\nor clarified that his title as “doctor” referenced a psychology degree and not a medical\n\ndegree.61 Mr. Enochs was convinced, based on his observations of how people reacted\n\nto DeLitta, that using the title “doctor” was misleading people into falsely believing\n\nDeLitta was a medical doctor. 62 Enochs himself was misled. He testified that he worked\n\nat Axiom for over a year before he learned that DeLitta was not a medical physician. 63\n\nEnochs’ testimony supports Schaefer’s belief that Axiom’s employees and customers\n\nare unaware that DeLitta is not a medical doctor.64\n\n\n\n\n58\n   CR351–52.\n59\n   2RR29.\n60\n   2RR29.\n61\n   2RR30, 34.\n62\n   2RR30.\n63\n   2RR34.\n64\n   2RR86.\n                                            17\n\f       DeLitta has convinced himself that because he does not use the initials “M.D.”\n\nthat he is not holding himself out as a medical doctor. 65 But the record evidence shows\n\nDeLitta opened a credit card account as “Michael J. DeLitta MD.” He claims now that\n\nthis is a “personal” credit card, not a business card, issued by “mistake.”66 But the trial\n\ncourt was reasonable to dismiss this attempt to explain away damning evidence as not\n\ncredible and to infer from these credit card records that DeLitta intended to falsely\n\nportray himself as a medical doctor. DeLitta’s “OCC DOC” vanity license plates make\n\nthis inference all the more reasonable.\n\n       In any event, DeLitta’s technical distinction between a Ph.D. and M.D. might be\n\nmore persuasive if DeLitta worked in a non-medical field. But DeLitta is the CEO and\n\n“Medical Director” of medical consulting company that provides injury management\n\nfor work-related injuries in the oilfield. The company provides direct access to medical\n\nprofessionals. In this context, it was reasonable for the trial court to determine that\n\nDeLitta’s use of the title “Dr.” could mislead others into believing that he is a medical\n\ndoctor. 67 Jenkins v.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that DeLitta’s\n          fraudulent conduct threatened Axiom with imminent harm.\n          DeLitta also challenges the trial court’s determination that DeLitta must be\n\nenjoined from falsely representing himself as a medical doctor to protect the Axiom\n\nCompanies from imminent harm. Importantly, DeLitta does not dispute the fact that\n\nharm to an entity’s business reputation and goodwill is the type of harm that cannot be\n\neasily measured and thus is “irreparable” at law.

He asserts\n\nonly that the threat to the Axiom Companies was nothing more than “fear and\n\napprehension of injury” that is too “speculative” to support a temporary injunction.68\n\n          The threat to Schaefer’s interest in the Axiom Companies is more than just “fear\n\nand apprehension of injury.” DeLitta himself testified that this kind of misconduct\n\nposes a real threat to a company like Axiom:\n\n          Q.

And by the way, you would agree that if the company is—\n          and this is a hypothetical—if it’s using false or misleading designations\n          and they are doing something false or misleading or against the law, that\n          that can harm the company, correct?\n          A.   Let me see if I understand your question. If the company is doing\n          something that’s illegal, would it harm the company?\n          Q.

We withdraw our opinion dated July 7, 2001, and substitute\nthe following in its place.\n\nIn this case, we determine whether the Texas Motor Vehicle Board has exclusive jurisdiction over a prospective car dealership\ntransferees' claims that raise an issue about how to construe the Texas Motor Vehicle Commission Code. 1 We conclude\nthe Board has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve only those claims and issues the Code governs. Moreover, we conclude that\nthis exclusive jurisdiction does not extend to the prospective transferees' claims here, and thus, they do not have to exhaust\nadministrative remedies before bringing their claims in the trial court. Instead, because of the Board's special expertise in\ninterpreting the Code, the trial court should abate the prospective transferees' tortious interference and declaratory judgment\nclaims so the Board may exercise its primary jurisdiction to *201 determine the Code construction issue raised with those\nclaims. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by entering a temporary injunction. Accordingly, we\nreverse the court of appeals' judgment and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nMartin Graf is the sole shareholder of Graf Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Inc., a dealership in Del Rio, Texas. The dealership's\nagreement with Ford provides that if Graf Ford proposes to transfer the dealership, Ford shall have a right of first refusal\nto purchase the dealership on the same terms and conditions that the proposed buyer agreed to, “regardless of whether the\nproposed buyer is qualified to be a dealer.” A Ford representative testified that this provision's purpose, and the purpose of\nsimilar provisions in other standard Ford dealership agreements, is “to be able to put into business dealers who [Ford feels] are\nqualified whenever [Ford has] the opportunity.”\n\nIn 1999, Hanan and Gil Butnaru contracted with Graf to buy the Graf dealership. They also contracted separately to buy the\nreal property upon which the dealership was located. Graf and J.M. Barton owned the property and executed that contract. Graf\ntold the Butnarus about Ford's right of first refusal. Additionally, both agreements were “expressly conditioned upon approval\nby Ford of Hanan Butnaru as a[sic] authorized sales and service dealer” and warranted that neither agreement conflicted with\nany prior agreement to which Graf or Barton were parties.\n\nIn September 1999, Graf told Ford that he intended to sell the dealership to the Butnarus. The Butnarus then filed a Prospective\nDealer Application with Ford, seeking approval as an authorized dealer. A month later, Ford informed Graf that it intended\nto exercise its right of first refusal and offered to pay the Butnarus' reasonable expenses incurred in negotiating the purchase\nand sale agreements. On the same day, Ford assigned its right of first refusal to an existing Ford dealer. Ford and Graf agreed\nthat Ford would indemnify Graf against damages arising from Ford's exercising its right of first refusal and that Graf would\ncooperate with Ford in defending any action challenging the right.\n\nAnticipating their breaching the purchase and sale agreements, the Butnarus sued Graf, Graf Ford, and Barton for breach of\nthose agreements. The Butnarus also sued Ford for tortiously interfering with the agreements. They alleged Ford tortiously\ninterfered because Ford's right of first refusal violates a Code provision that prohibits a manufacturer from denying or preventing\na dealership transfer to a qualified applicant. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 5.01B(c), 5.02(b)(8). Thus, the\nButnarus sought a declaration that Ford's right of first refusal was unenforceable and a declaration about the parties' rights and\nobligations under the agreements. Finally, the Butnarus requested a temporary injunction to prevent Ford or its assignees from\nexercising its right of first refusal during the suit. Ford opposed this request and filed a plea to the jurisdiction. Ford argued that\nthe Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a manufacturer has violated the Code's provisions. The trial court\ndenied Ford's plea and granted the injunction.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of appeals first\nnoted that the Legislature did not confer any rights on prospective transferees under *202 the Code to seek relief for the\nCode violation the Butnarus allege. Then, the court of appeals held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the\nButnarus' claims, “to the extent their claims are based on violations of the [Code],” because the Code grants the Board exclusive\njurisdiction over alleged Code violations. 18 S.W.3d at 767. The court also held that the Code does not violate the Texas\nConstitution's open courts provision, which prohibits the Legislature from unreasonably abrogating well-established common-\nlaw claims. The court explained that the Code merely confers new statutory rights on motor vehicle dealers and leaves “all\nothers in the same position they previously occupied.” 18 S.W.3d at 768. Therefore, the court concluded that “the Butnarus can\nsue Ford ... for tortious interference with contract, breach of contract, and declaratory relief. They simply cannot base those\ncauses of action on [Code] violations....” 18 S.W.3d at 768. The court of appeals then remanded the claims not based on Code\nviolations and, holding that the Butnarus did not establish an inadequate legal remedy, dissolved the trial court's temporary\ninjunction. 18 S.W.3d at 769–70.\n\nThe Butnarus petitioned this Court to review the court of appeals' opinion. Typically, jurisdiction over an order granting or\ndenying a temporary injunction is final in the courts of appeals. See TEX. GOV'T CODE § 22.225(b)(4). However, because the\ncourt of appeals' decision here conflicts with another court of appeals' decision, this Court has jurisdiction. See TEX. GOV'T\nCODE § 22.225(c). Specifically, the court of appeals' holding that the Code does not violate the Texas Constitution's open\ncourts provision conflicts with David McDavid Nissan, Inc. v.

In David McDavid Nissan, the court of\nappeals held that the Code abrogated the plaintiff's common-law claims without reasonably substituting another remedy and\nthus contravened the open courts provision. 10 S.W.3d at 67–68. We granted the Butnarus' petition, as well as the petition in\nDavid McDavid Nissan, to resolve this conflict.\n\nAt the time the trial courts and courts of appeals here and in David McDavid Nissan determined whether the Board had exclusive\njurisdiction, section 3.01 of the Code provided:\n\n  (a) The board has the general and original power and jurisdiction to regulate all aspects of the distribution, sale, and leasing of\n  motor vehicles and to do all things, whether specifically designated in this Act or implied herein, or necessary or convenient\n  to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction, including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.\n  In addition to the other duties placed on the board by this Act, the board shall enforce and administer the terms of Chapter\n  503, Transportation Code.\n\n  (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided by Texas law not in conflict with the terms of this Act, all aspects of the distribution\n  and sale of motor vehicles shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this Act.\n\nTEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 3.01 (Vernon Supp.1998), amended by Act of May 18, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 155,\n§ 5, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 313.\n\nIn our original opinions in this case and in David McDavid Nissan, we concluded that this provision granted the Board primary\n—not exclusive—jurisdiction over Code issues and claims.

However, section 3.01(a) still may not constitutionally retroactively apply in this case if it\naffects a vested right. See Baker Hughes, 12 S.W.3d at 4; Middleton, 185 S.W. at 560.\n\nThe Butnarus do not allege that section 3.01(a) affects any vested right. Instead, they contend that the Legislature did not\nexpressly make the amendment to section 3.01(a) retroactive, and therefore, we should apply the Code Construction Act to\nconclude section 3.01(a) 's current version does not retroactively apply. See TEX. GOV'T CODE §§ 311.022 (“A statute is\npresumed *205 to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.”), 311.031 (“[T]he ... amendment ... of\na statute does not affect ... the prior operation of the statute or any prior action taken under it.”).\n\nBut the Butnarus misplace their reliance on the Code Construction Act. That statute applies only to “each code enacted by the\n60th or subsequent legislature as part of the state's continuing statutory revision program.” TEX. GOV'T CODE § 311.002.\nWhen the Legislature recodifies a statute under Texas's continuing statutory revision program, the statute will indicate this.\nSee, e.g., TEX. LOCAL GOV'T CODE § 1.001 (“This code is enacted as a part of the state's continuing statutory revision\nprogram....”). And, though we refer to the Motor Vehicle Code as “the Code,” nothing in the Code's language or legislative\nhistory shows that it is part of our State's “continuing statutory revision program.” TEX.

Accordingly, we conclude that amended section\n3.01(a) constitutionally applies retroactively in this case.\n\n\n\n               B. APPLYING SECTION 3.01'S CURRENT VERSION TO THE BUTNARUS' CLAIMS\n\n [9] Ford contends that section 3.01 's current version grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction, and thus, the Board has the sole\nauthority to make the initial determination about the alleged Code violation here. The Butnarus, on the other hand, argue that\nsection 3.01 does not oust the trial court's jurisdiction because the Board does not have authority to award damages for their\nwell-established common-law claims. Therefore, the Butnarus assert that the Board only has primary jurisdiction to decide\nwhether Ford's right of first refusal violates the Code.\n\nThe Butnarus' pleadings currently reflect four claims, the first two of which are based on Ford's allegedly violating the Code.\nFirst, the Butnarus seek a judicial declaration that Ford's right of first refusal violates the Code. Second, the Butnarus allege\nthat Ford tortiously interfered with the purchase and sale agreements by attempting to exercise its allegedly invalid right of first\nrefusal. Third, the Butnarus seek a declaration about the parties' rights and obligations under the purchase and sale agreements.\nFourth, the Butnarus claim that Graf and Barton have breached or are about to breach the purchase and sale agreements by\npermitting Ford to exercise its right of first refusal rather than requiring Ford to determine the Butnarus' eligibility under the\nCode for the dealership transfer.\n\nThe court of appeals, after analyzing section 3.01 's former version, concluded that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction; *206\nhowever, it held that the Butnarus do not have standing as prospective car dealership transferees to seek relief from the Board\nfor the Code violation they allege. The court of appeals further determined that the Butnarus' lack of standing to obtain relief\nfrom the Board did not give them a right to seek damages for the alleged Code violation in the trial court. 18 S.W.3d at 767–\n68. Accordingly, the court of appeals held that the Butnarus could maintain their breach of contract and tortious interference\nclaims; however, the Butnarus could not “base those causes of action on [Code] violations.” 18 S.W.3d at 768.\n\nAs discussed above, we disagree that section 3.01 's former version granted the Board exclusive jurisdiction. But we conclude\nthat section 3.01(a) 's current version, which applies here, grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction over issues and claims the\nCode governs. Thus, we must determine if the Butnarus' claims fall within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nBecause motor vehicle distribution and sales affects our State's economy and citizens' welfare, the Code's primary purpose is “to\ninsure a sound system of distributing and selling motor vehicles through licensing and regulating manufacturers ... and dealers\nof those vehicles.” See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 1.02. To accomplish this, the Code strictly regulates conduct by\nor between franchise dealers and manufacturers. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 4.01–.07, 5.01–.05. For example,\nthe Code establishes how a dealer must request a transfer, assignment, or sale of its franchise agreement. TEX.REV.CIV.\nSTAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B. Under that process, the Code also determines the circumstances under which a manufacturer\nmay withhold its consent to the dealer's request. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(c).\n\nSpecifically, to transfer a dealership the dealer must file a written application with the manufacturer to transfer the dealership.\nThe application must identify the prospective transferee and any pertinent agreements about the proposed transfer. See\nTEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(a)(1)-(4). The manufacturer must timely advise the dealer in writing if the\nprospective transferee is qualified or if the transferee is not acceptable. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(b). The\nCode prohibits a manufacturer from “unreasonably” withholding its consent to a dealer's transfer application if the prospective\ntransferee is “of good moral character” and otherwise meets the manufacturer's predetermined, written standards, if any, about\na transferee's business experience and financial qualifications. TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(c). Further, the\nCode makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to “fail to give effect to or attempt to prevent any sale or transfer” of a dealership\n“except as provided by Section 5.01B.” TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.02(b)(8).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              9\n\fButnaru v.

But the Butnarus' trial court claims involve something different. The Butnarus seek relief for Ford's alleged\ntortious interference, and this claim, in turn, raises a Code construction issue. To establish their tortious interference claim, the\nButnarus must show: (1) a contract exists between Graf, Graf Ford, Barton and the Butnarus; (2) Ford willfully and intentionally\ninterfered with that contract; (3) the interference proximately caused the Butnarus damage; and (4) the Butnarus suffered actual\ndamage or loss.

See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(c) (prohibiting\na manufacturer from unreasonably denying a dealership transfer); TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 1.04 (making an\nagreement to waive the Code's terms void and unenforceable). The Butnarus also request that the trial court enter a declaratory\njudgment that rights of first refusal violate the Code.\n\nWe conclude that the Butnarus' tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims fall outside the purview of the Board's\nexclusive jurisdiction. In David McDavid Nissan, we held that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction under section 3.01(a) required\nthe dealer in that case to exhaust its administrative remedies to obtain a final Board finding to support its Code-based DTPA, bad\nfaith, and oral contract claims. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 226. In concluding that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction\napplied to the dealer's Code-based DTPA and bad-faith claims, we explained that the Code provides a hybrid claims-resolution\nprocess by which a dealer or manufacturer may seek damages for certain Code violations. David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d\nat 226 (discussing TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 6.06(a), (e)). Based on this process, we held that the dealer had\nto exhaust its administrative remedies under the Code to obtain supporting Board findings before a trial court could finally\nadjudicate the dealer's damages request for its Code-based claims. See David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 227. Additionally,\nin requiring the dealer to obtain a Board finding before pursuing its oral contract claims, we relied on a Code provision mandating\nthat a dealer obtain the Board's approval and a license before operating a franchise in a certain area. See David McDavid Nissan,\n84 S.W.3d at 227 (discussing TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), §§ 4.02(c), 4.06(a)-(e)).\n\nHere, however, no Code provision extends the Board's exclusive jurisdiction to resolving the Butnarus' tortious interference\nand declaratory judgment claims so that they must exhaust any administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. In fact,\nthe Code's failing to establish any procedure through which the Board may resolve a prospective transferee's claim that a\nmanufacturer unlawfully refused to *208 accept a dealer's transfer request—coupled with the Board's inability to award\nmonetary damages—demonstrate the contrary. Thus, this case is analogous to Cash America, in which we held that the plaintiff\ndid not have to exhaust administrative remedies under the Pawnshop Act because “nothing in the statutory scheme indicate[d]\nthat the Legislature intended to replace a pledgor's common-law remedies with the like-kind replacement remedy” available\nunder the statute. Cash Am., 35 S.W.3d at 18. Similarly, because the Code does not indicate the Legislature's intent to replace\nthe prospective transferees' remedies here, the Butnarus do not have to exhaust any administrative remedies before suing Ford\nfor tortious interference or declaratory relief.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Though the Legislature did not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Board to resolve\nthe Butnarus' claims, we still must decide whether the Board has primary jurisdiction to resolve the Code construction issue that\nthose claims raise. See, e.g, Cash Am., 35 S.W.3d at 18 (recognizing that, though an agency does not have exclusive jurisdiction,\nthe policies underlying the primary jurisdiction doctrine may require the agency to initially decide an issue). In David McDavid\nNissan, we explained that the primary jurisdiction doctrine requires trial courts to allow an administrative agency to initially\ndecide an issue when: (1) an agency is typically staffed with experts trained in handling the complex problems in the agency's\npurview; and (2) great benefit is derived from an agency's uniformly interpreting its laws, rules, and regulations, whereas courts\nand juries may reach different results under similar fact situations.

The Butnarus' tortious interference and declaratory\njudgment claims raise a Code construction issue that is within the Board's special competence and expertise. See Cash Am.,\n35 S.W.3d at 18. As discussed above, the Legislature has specifically authorized the Board to resolve disputes between a\nmanufacturer and dealer when the dealer alleges that the manufacturer violated section 5.01B by unreasonably withholding\nconsent to transfer a dealership. See TEX.REV.CIV. STAT. art. 4413(36), § 5.01B(d). The Board's expertise in construing\nsection 5.01B in these disputes, and the State's interest in a uniform interpretation of the Code, requires the trial court to abate\nthe lawsuit and suspend finally adjudicating the tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims until the Board has a\nreasonable opportunity to *209 act on the matter. See David McDavid Nissan, 84 S.W.3d at 228; Central Power & Light, 17\nS.W.3d at 787; Roberts Express, 842 S.W.2d at 771. Accordingly, the trial court should abate the claims pending the Board\nhaving an opportunity to exercise its primary jurisdiction to determine, at least in the first instance, whether a right of first\nrefusal violates the Code. In sum, we hold that section 3.01(a) confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Board but only over issues\nand claims the Code governs. Here, the Code does not govern the Butnarus'—as prospective transferees—tortious interference\nand declaratory judgment claims. Consequently, the Butnarus do not have to exhaust any administrative remedies before raising\nthese claims in the trial court. However, because these claims raise a Code construction issue, the primary jurisdiction doctrine\nrequires the trial court to abate the claims pending the Board having a reasonable opportunity to determine whether a right of\nfirst refusal violates the Code.\n\n\n\n                                              C. OPEN COURTS CHALLENGE\n\n [13] The Butnarus contend that if the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over all Code issues and claims, this violates our\nConstitution's open courts provision. TEX. CONST. art. 1, § 13. This provision prohibits the Legislature from abrogating well-\nestablished, common-law claims unless the reason for doing so outweighs a litigant's constitutional right of redress. See Texas\nAss'n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 448.\n\n [14] But we have already concluded that the Board's exclusive jurisdiction does not extend to the claims in this case.\nAccordingly, the Code does not abrogate any previously existing common-law rights here. The trial court has immediate\njurisdiction to adjudicate the Butnaru's common-law claims for breach of the purchase and sale agreements. And, after deferring\nto the Board so it has an opportunity to decide the Code construction issue, the trial court may finally adjudicate the tortious\ninterference and related declaratory judgment claim.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The court of\nappeals dissolved the temporary injunction, agreeing with Ford's contention that the Butnarus did not establish an inadequate\nlegal remedy. 18 S.W.3d at 769. In so concluding, the court of appeals noted that generally a court will not enforce contracts by\ninjunction because a suit for damages is deemed to be an adequate remedy. 18 S.W.3d at 769. The Butnarus respond twofold.\nFirst, they argue that they were not required to show an inadequate legal remedy because an alleged statutory violation relieves\na movant of that burden. See Furr v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2457956\"><a href=\"/opinion/2457956/furr-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672 (Tex.Civ.App.-Amarillo 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.). They assert that\ncourts have a duty to enjoin statutory violations. See Priest v.

Second, the Butnarus argue that they have otherwise established the temporary-injunction elements.\nOn the inadequate legal remedy element, they argue that Ford's exercising its right of first refusal would deprive them of the\nopportunity to purchase two unique assets: real property and the dealership located on the property. See, e.g., Home Sav. of Am.\nv. Van Cleave Dev. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2413784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2413784/home-sav-of-amer-v-van-cleave-dev/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1987, no writ) (noting that “each and every piece of real\nestate is unique” and that “is certainly an element to be considered in deciding whether there [will be] irreparable damages”).\n\n\n\n                                                  *210 1. Statutory Violation\n\n [15] The Butnarus' misplace their reliance on Furr. See Furr, 553 S.W.2d at 672. Furr does not generally propose that an\nalleged statutory violation relieves the plaintiff's burden to show an inadequate legal remedy. Rather, the party seeking injunctive\nrelief in Furr relied on a specific statute giving the right to an injunction, and the court of appeals concluded that the statutory\nright relieved the party from proving an inadequate legal remedy. Furr, 553 S.W.2d at 672. The court relied on Republic\nInsurance Co. v. O'Donnell Motor Co., which explains:\n\n            The general rule at equity is that before injunctive relief can be obtained, it must appear that there does\n            not exist an adequate remedy at law. This limitation, however, has no application where the right to relief\n            is predicated on a statutory ground other than on the general principles of equity.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3919824\"><a href=\"/opinion/4154749/republic-ins-v-odonnell-motor/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1066 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1926, no writ).\n\nHere, the Butnarus rely on general equitable principles, not a statutory injunctive-relief right, to enjoin Ford's conduct. Thus,\nFurr does not apply. And the Butnarus had to establish in the trial court, in addition to the other temporary-injunction elements,\nan inadequate legal remedy.\n\n\n\n                                              2. Temporary Injunction Elements\n\n [16] In the trial court, the Butnarus alleged that Ford's exercising its right of first refusal would tortiously interfere with\nthe Butnarus' contract to purchase the real property and the contract to purchase the dealership. They further contended that\ntheir right to purchase the real property and dealership would be lost if Ford exercised its right of first refusal, and, therefore,\ninjunctive relief was necessary to preserve the status quo.\n\nAt the temporary injunction hearing, the Butnarus presented the following evidence: (1) their agreement with Graf and Barton\nto purchase the real property, (2) their agreement with Graf and Graf Ford to purchase the dealership, (3) Graf Ford's agreement\nwith Ford containing the right of first refusal that allegedly violates the Code, (4) the Code provisions that allegedly prohibit\nFord's right of first refusal provision, and (5) the Butnarus' dealership application to Ford detailing their business experience\nand financial qualifications. Additionally, Hanan Butnaru testified about his agreements with Graf, Graf Ford, and Barton to\npurchase dealership and the real property in Del Rio.

He also explained, and the agreements entered in evidence\nshowed, that the Butnarus agreed to pay $1.2 million for the real property and only $500,000 for the dealership.\n\nBased on the Butnarus' allegations and this evidence, the trial court granted the temporary injunction. The trial court stated in\nthe order that the Butnarus would be irreparably harmed if Ford exercises its right of first refusal “in that the issues and rights\nsought to be adjudicated will become moot and [the Butnarus] will have lost the opportunity to purchase the Dealership and\nthe Real Property.”\n\nThe court of appeals, however, dissolved the temporary injunction after concluding that the Butnarus did not establish an\ninadequate legal remedy:\n\n             The Butnarus are not interested in the real property for its own resources or aesthetics. Their interest in\n             the property results solely from the fact that the dealership is located on it. Thus, their true complaint\n             relates to their inability to purchase the dealership. The uniqueness *211 of the real property is therefore\n             irrelevant to the adequacy of their legal remedy.\n\n18 S.W.3d at 769. The court of appeals' holding is predicated upon its assumptions that the real property is neither unique nor\npertinent to this dispute and that the Butnarus are only interested in purchasing the dealership.\n\n [17] [18] [19] [20] We agree with the court of appeals that, generally, a court will not enforce contractual rights by\ninjunction, because a party can rarely establish an irreparable injury and an inadequate legal remedy when damages for breach\nof contract are available.

Davis, 571 S.W.2d at 862.\n\n [21] The evidence shows this is a case involving two contracts: a contract to purchase land and a contract to purchase a\nbusiness. There is some evidence that the Butnarus desired valuable land located at this specific Del Rio location. Thus, the\nevidence before the trial court supports its conclusion that this dispute is about the right to purchase real property worth at least\n$1.2 million and not just the dealership itself. See Home Sav., 737 S.W.2d at 59 (upholding temporary injunction in dispute\ninvolving land worth $1.5 million). And a trial court may grant equitable relief when a dispute involves real property.

Because the\nCode does not govern, or expressly authorize the Board to resolve, the Butnarus' tortious interference and declaratory judgment\nclaims, these prospective transferees need not exhaust any administrative remedies before the trial court has jurisdiction over\nthese claims. However, under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, the trial court should abate these claims to the extent that may\nbe necessary to allow the Board a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Code construction issue they raise. Finally, the trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in granting the temporary injunction. Thus, we reverse the court of appeals' judgment and\nremand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion on rehearing.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1579981\"><a href=\"/opinion/1579981/butnaru-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

In three points of\nerror, Canteen asserts that 1) the temporary injunctive relief is void ab initio 2) the finding that Canteen breached the lease\nwas in error and 3) the mandatory injunction was granted in error. Although we disagree with points of error one and two, we\nagree with Canteen's third point of error and for the reasons discussed herein, affirm the judgment of the trial court as to the\nprohibitory portion of the injunction and reform the judgment to eliminate the portion which decrees specific performance.\n\nIn February, 1985, Canteen, as lessee, and Republic as lessor, entered into a commercial lease agreement for the lease of space\nin RepublicBank Plano Tower. The lease agreement provided in part that “lessee warrants and represents to lessor that the\nleased premises shall be used and occupied only for the purpose of a restaurant.” Approximately three years later, Canteen\nceased to operate Gulliver's as a delicatessen style restaurant and installed vending machines. These machines served hot and\ncold beverages and food.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Republic and granted Republic's request\nfor injunctive relief. Specifically, the trial court enjoined Canteen from maintaining a vending machine operation in the leased\npremises and ordered *400 Canteen to reopen a restaurant in accordance with the lease agreement and in accordance with the\nGulliver's concept as utilized by Canteen at other locations in the Dallas area.\n\nIn its first point of error, Canteen maintains that the temporary injunctive relief granted by the trial court is void ab initio. A\nreview of the record reveals that although Republic requested a temporary injunction in its original petition, the injunction\nwhich issued was not a temporary injunction. Instead, it was a permanent injunction entered after a trial before the court. Thus,\nthe defects urged by Canteen such as lack of a bond, failure to set a trial date, and failure to state a reason for the temporary\ninjunction are not fatal to the injunction which was granted by the trial court. Canteen's first point of error is overruled.\n\nIn its second point of error, Canteen asserts that the trial court erroneously found that the installation of the vending machines\ndid not constitute the operation of a restaurant and, thus, was a breach of the lease agreement. In paragraph 5, the lease provides\nas follows:\n\n            Lessee warrants and represents to lessor that the leased premises shall be used and occupied only for the\n            purpose of restaurant use ...\n\nThe lease at paragraph 5(b) continues:\n\n            Lessee shall not at any time leave the leased premises vacant, but shall in good faith continuously\n            throughout the term of this lease conduct and carry on in the entire leased premises the type of business\n            for which the leased premises are leased. Lessee shall operate its business in an efficient, high class and\n            reputable manner so as to produce the maximum amount of sales from the leased premises, and shall,\n            except during reasonable periods for repairing, cleaning and decorating, keep the leased premises open to\n            the public for business with adequate personnel in attendance on all days and during all hours established\n            by lessor from time to time as store hours for the building, and during any other hours when the building\n            is generally open to the public for business ...\n\nThe lease at paragraph 5(c) continues:\n\n            Lessee understands that normal operating hours for this building are expected to be Monday through\n            Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Saturday, 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. ...\n\nThe lease at paragraph 5(e) continues:\n\n            Lessee shall not ... do anything which would tend to injure the reputation of the premises.\n\nFinally, the lease at paragraph 5(f) provides:\n\n            Exclusivity clause: Canteen Corporation shall have the exclusive right to provide manual food service in\n            the building with exception of a white tablecloth restaurant on the premises. Lessee reserves the first right\n            of refusal to install and maintain public vending machines at a location to be agreed upon in the future.\n\n\n [1] Under general contract principles, the primary concern of the courts is to give effect to the intentions of the parties as\nexpressed in the instruments.

Thus, the trial judge properly found that the vending machines were not a\nrestaurant and that the installation of the machines was a breach of the lease. Canteen's second point of error is overruled.\n\n [3] Canteen maintains, in its third point of error, that the trial court improperly granted the mandatory injunction. the injunction\nof the trial court consists of two parts: (1) a portion which prohibits Canteen from operating the vending machines *401 in\nthe lease space; and (2) a portion which orders Canteen to operate a restaurant in the leased premises in accordance with the\nGulliver's concept. It is well established that a court of equity will only order specific performance when present performance is\npossible. A court will generally not decree a party to perform a continuous series of acts which extend through a long period of\ntime and require constant supervision by the court. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v.

This is not capable of present performance. Neither is the operation of a delicatessen restaurant a\nmatter of public interest which justifies deviation from the general rule against ordering ongoing activities. The portion of the\ninjunction which orders the operation of a Gulliver's is improper. Accordingly, we sustain Canteen's third point of error.\n\n [5] Generally, contractual rights are not enforced by writs of injunction, since inadequate remedy at law and irreparable injury\nare rarely shown when a suit for damages for breach of contract is available.

Additionally, Republic\ndemonstrated that there was no way to prove how many prospective tenants had not approached Republic about leasing and\nhad not leased in the building because there was no restaurant. Thus, Republic demonstrated an inability to compute damages.\nThe injunction is proper as far as enjoining Canteen's vending machine operation.\n\nHowever, the injunction also commands Canteen to reopen and operate a Gulliver's-type restaurant in the nature of a decree of\nspecific performance. “Whether a court will grant an injunction the effect of which is to compel the specific performance of a\ncontract, depends, of course, upon the same principles as govern a decree of specific performance.” Beckham v.

Edmunds, Houston, of counsel), for appellee.\n\nOpinion\n\nBELL, Chief Justice.\n\nThe appellee is a private utility furnishing water and sanitary sewer service to residents of a defined area in the City of Houston.\nPrior to December 31, 1956, the territory served was outside the limits of the City. As a result of annexation, a part of the area\nserved by appellee bcame a part of the City of Houston. At the time of annexation appellee was charging rates for services\nrendered by it according to a rate schedule promulgated by it. These rates it continued to charge until it raised its rates effective\nJuly 1, 1959.\n\nOn January 2, 1957, the City Council of the City of Houston passed general ordinances Nos. 57–1 and 57–3, by which it, without\nnotice to appellee, fixed the rates that might be charged by a utility situated as was appellee for water and sanitary sewer service.\nThe rates so fixed were less than the rates prescribed by appellee's schedule of rates. The record here reflects that on February\n18, 1957, appellee furnished the City information as to the value of its properties, the appraisal being made by Freese, Nichols\nand Turner, the report being dated February 15, 1957. Also it furnished a statement of its income and expenses for the fiscal\nyear ending November 30, 1956. The furnishing of these statements was in an effort to comply with the above ordinances. At\nthe same time appellee for various reasons protested the passage of the ordinances and questioned their validity and the rates\nfixed thereby. The petition to the City Council contains this prayer:\n‘Wherefore, premises considered, petitioner prays that the City Council of the City of Houston pass an ordinance approving the\nrates and charges made by the petitioner in the operation of its utilities and in the furnishing of other public services (emphasis\nours) or in the alternative that said City Council conduct a public hearing concerning rates and charges made by the petitioner\nand at such hearing that said petitioner be given an opportunity to introduce evidence with reference thereto and further, that\nthe rates and charges made by petitioner be not changed until the City of Houston has taken final action after such hearing.’\n(Emphasis ours.)\n\n\nOn May 1, 1957, the City Council passed ordinance No. 57–531 by which it provided that a private utility operating without\na franchise could charge no greater rate for its service than was being charged by it on December 31, 1956. The effect of the\nordinance was to fix the maximum rate that could be charged, such maximum rate being that being charged by the utility on\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellee had no notice of the passage of the ordinance before its passage. On the same day ordinances\nNos. 57–1 and 57–3 were repealed.\n\nThe facts here show that the rates being charged by appellee on May 1, 1957 were the same as those being charged by them\non December 31, 1956.\n\nNothing was done by appellee until June 3, 1959. It continued to charge the rates it had voluntarily adopted and which it, by\nits petition of February 18, 1957, expressly asked the City Council to adopt and which the City Council did effectively adopt\nby ordinance No. 57–531. On June 3, appellee wrote the City Council contending it had on February 18, 1957 asked for a\nrate hearing and stating the rates in force were not compensatory and stating it did not intend to continue to operate under the\nexisting rates. *421 They requested a rate hearing. Mr. Puig, the Company president, stated appellee had several times from\nearly 1957 orally requested a rate hearing. Just what kind of a rate hearing he does not state, nor are the times of the requests\nstated. On June 9, 1959, the City Council set a rate hearing for July 23, 1959.\n\nAppellee, without approval of the City Council, promulgated an increase in rates to be charged by it effective July 1, 1959,\nand is now charging such rates.\n\nAppellant filed this suit to enjoin appellee from charging rates in excess of those fixed by ordinance No. 57–531. The trial court\nrefused to grant the injunction.\n [1] Appellee contends the ordinance is as to it invalid because it was given no notice or hearing in connection with the ordinance\nfixing its rates and it was thus denied procedural due process. Too, it contends the rates established are not compensatory, but\noperate to confiscate its property. Further, it says the ordinance recites facts which are contrary to the established fact, that\nis, that since Decembr 31, 1956, there has been no increase in prices and expenses, whereas certainly there has been a very\nsubstantial increase in taxes. Appellee says that in any event under all circumstances the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin refusing to grant the injunction.\n\n [2] [3] We have reached the conclusion that ordinance No. 57–531 was as to appellee valid and effective to fix the maximum\nrates which appellee could charge for its services. We take it to be established law that until such time as a regulatory body\nassumes to exercise its authority to fix rates which a utility may charge, that the utility may fix its own rates, provided they\nare reasonable. 73 C.J.S. Public Utilities §§ 14 and 15, p. 1009. Such rates would be binding until such time as the regulatory\nbody assumes to exercise its authority. United Gas Corp. v.

As we held on\nJanuary 14, 1960, in the case of the City of Houston v. Willow Bend Utilities, Inc., Tex.Civ.App., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2386764\"><a href=\"/opinion/2386764/city-of-houston-v-willow-bend-utilities-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in case the\nregulatory body proposes to fix the rates to be charged by the utility due process of law requires that the utility be given notice\nand be given a hearing, unless the utility in some manner consents to the fixing of the particular rates which the regulatory body\nin fact fixes. We think there can be no question that if the utility consents to an order by the regulatory body fixing particular\nrates, no notice of the passage of the order need be given and no hearing need be accorded the utility. In such case the rate is\nthat of the utility and the regulatory body. It would be a rate fixed by the regulatory body with the consent of the utility.\n\n\nIn this case, on February 18, 1957, appellee expressly requested the City Council of the City of Houston to pass an ordinance\napproving the rates and charges being made by appellee. There was an alternative prayer for a rate hearing, but it was for a\nhearing to examine the rates appellee was charging and in this connection it was expressly asked that the rates appellee was\ncharging be not changed until after a hearing. On May 1, 1957, with the enactment of Ordinance No. 57–531, the City Council\ndid just what appellee had expressly requested. It adopted the rates the appellee was charging. After the request by appellee\nthat an ordinance approving these rates be passed, appellee was entitled to no notice that the Council would be as appellee\nhad requested.\n [4] [5] When the ordinance was passed, the rate fixed became the rate promulgated by law and it could not be changed\nexcept in a manner provided by law. The utility could not itself promulgate new rates until the existing rates fixed by law be\nset aside. The only way the rates could be changed would be through a hearing before the City Council. The courts could not\nintervene until appellee first exhausted its remedy before the City Council. San Antonio Transit Company v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In the case\nbefore us, a hearing was set to commence July 23, 1959. There has been no denial of a hearing. We do not mean to say that even\nthough appellee consented to the adoption of a rate that it would be estopped to assert the rate was confiscatory in a suit filed\nwithin the time prescribed by law after the passage of the ordinance adopting the rates. We merely hold procedural due process\nhas not been denied and that the ordinance not having been contested in court for over two years after it became effective on\nthe ground that the rates established were noncompensatory, appellee cannot change its rates except with the approval of the\nCity Council. San Antonio Transit Co. v. City of San Antonio, supra. Of course, even should the City Council not expressly\ndeny a hearing but should delay or prolong the hearing so its action would be tantamount to a denial of a hearing, the courts\ncould intervene upon proper proceedings being instituted. We have no such situation here.\n\n [6] [7] Appellee contends continued enforcement of the rates would confiscate its property. What we have said above we\nthink should adequately dispose of such contention. However, without going into the matter extensively, it should suffice to\nsay that the proof shows that if revenue from tap charges is included as income, then for the years ending November, 1958,\nand May 31, 1959, appellee would show a profit. Appellee argues that since tap charges are nonrecurring, the revenue derived\nfrom this service may not be considered in determining profit. It is true that nonrecurring revenue may not be considered in\nfixing a rate operative in the future. However, it seems to us but reasonable to consider such in a situation such as we have here\nwhere appellee is contending it should not be enjoined from raising rates fixed by ordinance because it has been operating at\na loss. Certainly it has been income for the period meterial to our inquiry. In determining what the future rate should be you\nhave an entirely different problem.\n\n [8] [9] We are not unaware that the inquiry of this court in a temporary injunction proceeding is whether trial court has\nabused its discretion. However, we understand the law to be that where the facts conclusively show a party is violating the\nsubstantive law it becomes the duty of the court to enjoin the violation. In such case there is no discretion to be exercised.\nIt must correctly apply the law to positively established fact. General Drivers, Warehousemen & Helpers, Local 745, et al.\nv.

No alterations in\nthe exterior appearance of any building or structure shall be made without like approval. . . . ” 1\n\n\nThe Davises proposed to build a house on their lot to be situated twenty-five feet from the rear plot line. This placement of\nthe house on the lot will clearly comply with restriction 7. However, the developer, respondent Austin Corporation, acting\nthrough respondent David Barrow, refused to approve the Davises' plans because the proposed placement of the house on the\nlot would bar the side view from the Hueys' existing house. In its refusal of the plans the developer purports to exercise its\ngeneral authority under restriction 8 to refuse approval of a plan “on any ground, including purely aesthetic grounds, which in\nthe sole and uncontrolled discretion” of the developer shall seem sufficient.\n\nThe Hueys filed the instant lawsuit to permanently enjoin the Davises from building any structure upon their lot until the plans\ntherefor had been approved in writing by the developer. The Hueys' petition included a prayer that an immediate temporary\nrestraining order be granted and that after a hearing a temporary injunction be entered, both similarly restraining the Davises.\nThe trial court granted an immediate and Ex parte temporary restraining order. After a hearing the trial court entered an order\ndissolving the temporary restraining order and denying the temporary injunction. No findings of fact or conclusions of law\nwere requested or filed.\n\nThe Hueys appealed the denial of the temporary injunction. The court of civil appeals reversed the trial court judgment and\nrendered judgment “that the cause be remanded to the district court, with instructions to enter judgment enjoining Appellees\nDavis and wife from continuing with construction until the house and plot plans have been approved by the developer.” In\nreaching this result the court of civil appeals opinion concluded that the covenants in question were valid. The opinion discussed\nat length the authorities in Texas and other jurisdictions which uphold restrictive covenants implementing a general scheme of\ndevelopment for the common benefit of all lot owners by providing for approval of building plans by the developer. The court\nof civil appeals further examined the issue of the standard governing the developer's conduct in exercising its plan approval\nauthority and concluded that the developer's conduct is improper only if it is arbitrary or in bad faith.\n\n\n                                       THE TEMPORARY INJUNCTION REVIEW\n\n [1] The Davises contend that the court of civil appeals far exceeded the proper scope of appellate review of a temporary\ninjunction and improperly granted premature review of the entire case on its merits. We must agree. The appeal of an order\ngranting or denying a temporary injunction is an appeal from an interlocutory order, which is expressly authorized by Article\n4662, Texas Revised Civil Statutes Annotated. Accordingly, the merits of the underlying case are not presented for appellate\nreview. Appellate review of an order *862 granting or denying a temporary injunction is strictly limited to determination of\nwhether there has been a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court in granting or denying the interlocutory order.

To the contrary, it appears that the court of civil appeals gave full consideration to the merits of the underlying\nlawsuit. The opinion itself characterizes the case as an appeal from an order denying an injunction. The opinion makes no\nreference to the interlocutory nature of the injunction or to the abuse of discretion standard. Further, the order which the court of\ncivil appeals directed the trial court to enter upon remand fully grants the relief sought by the Hueys in their lawsuit: injunction\nof the construction until the Davises' plans are approved by the developer.\n [2] [3] The Hueys argue that the court of civil appeals opinion was clearly limited to review of the temporary injunction\nbecause that was the only issue raised before that court. However, a reading of the court of civil appeals opinion and order will\nnot support this contention.

First, the trial court might have concluded that the developer had no power to modify\nthe fifteen-foot setback requirement of deed restriction 7 under the holding of Johnson v. Dick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2458771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2458771/johnson-v-dick/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Civ.App.\nSan Antonio 1955, no writ). Second, the trial court could have found as a fact that the developer's action in refusing approval was\nnot reasonable under the circumstances. Third, the trial court could have found as fact that “views” were not a part of the general\nscheme of development of the subdivision and not a proper basis for the exercise of the developer's authority under restriction 8.\n\n\nThe Davises further contend that there are under the evidence at least three theories upon which the trial court could have\nconcluded that the Hueys failed to show irreparable injury. First, there was testimony *863 by Mr. Huey that the reduced value\nof his property could be compensated by money damages. Second, there was testimony that the Hueys could extend their deck\nten feet to preserve their view. Third, because the construction of the Davis house was in such early stages, the Hueys would\nsuffer little injury in the time period between the temporary injunction hearing and the final hearing on the merits. Without\nintruding upon the merits of the underlying cause of action, it may be concluded that at least some basis exists upon which\nthe trial court could have properly held that the Hueys were not entitled to a temporary injunction pending the final hearing.\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the temporary injunction.\n\n\n                                                  THE BOND QUESTION\n\n [9] In addition to ordering the case remanded to the trial court with instructions to issue an injunction against construction\nuntil the plans were approved, on October 5, 1977 the court of civil appeals also entered its own injunction pendente lite for\nthe stated purpose of protecting its jurisdiction, ordering the Davises to cease all construction work on the dwelling and not to\nresume work so long as the cause remained within its jurisdiction. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793938\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793938/huey-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 865. This injunction pendente lite was\nnot conditioned upon the posting of a bond by the Hueys to protect the Davises against loss for delay of construction should\nthe Davises eventually prevail. On October 6, 1977 the Davises filed a “Motion to Set Aside Order or, in the Alternative, to\nSet Bond” wherein the Davises complained of the court of civil appeals' failure to set bond on its own injunction. The motion\nwas overruled on the day it was filed.\n\n\nThe Davises maintain that the court of civil appeals' failure to condition its injunction pendente lite upon a bond is error.\nIn support of this argument the Davises rely upon the recent decisions of two courts of civil appeals requiring a bond upon\nthe issuance of injunctions to preserve their jurisdiction.

Petitioners and all respondents agree that the issue is rendered\nmoot by the expiration of the injunction pendente lite. It would appear that this court can grant no relief from an injunction\npendente lite which is no longer in existence. Therefore, we decline to comment upon the necessity of a bond in an injunction\npendente lite issued by a court of civil appeals to protect its jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                                     THE MOTION TO DISMISS\n\n [10] The Hueys have also filed in this court a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction the Davises' application for writ of\nerror on the grounds that it was not timely filed. An application for writ of error must be filed with the clerk of the court of civil\nappeals within thirty days after the overruling of the motion for rehearing in the court of civil appeals. Tex.R.Civ.P. 468. The\nDavis application was filed with the clerk of the court of civil appeals on November 14, 1977. The Hueys argue that the Davises'\n“Motion to Set Aside Order or, in the Alternative, to Set Bond,” filed and overruled on October 6, 1977, must be considered\nto operate as the Davises' only motion for rehearing in the court of civil appeals. If the Hueys were correct in this assertion,\nthe thirty-day time period expired on November 5, 1977, which was a Saturday, and the application was due to be filed by the\nfollowing Monday, November 7, 1977. Tex.R.Civ.P. 4. However, the Davises also timely filed a motion for rehearing *864\nin the court of civil appeals on October 20, 1977. The motion for rehearing was overruled November 2, 1977.

The trial dealt only\nwith damages because the trial court struck the defendant's answer as a discovery abuse sanction and signed an interlocutory\ndefault judgment as to liability. The court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment, holding that the action of *240 that\ncourt was an error of law and an abuse of discretion. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and\naffirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThe issues before us are whether TEX.R.CIV.P. 215a(c), as it existed prior to the amendment effective August 1, 1984,\nauthorized the trial court to strike defendant's answer, and, if so, whether the exercise of that authority constituted an abuse\nof discretion.\n\nEdward P. Downer was a seaman aboard the vessel Four Point IV. He drowned while attempting to free a line that had fouled the\nvessel's propeller. Ida E. Downer, his widow, brought this action against Aquamarine Operators, Inc., the owner and operator\nof the vessel. The case was filed in the 151st District Court of Harris County. Both Downer and Aquamarine are residents of\nHarris County, Texas.\n\nDowner filed Notice of Intent to Take the Depositions of All Members of The Crew on June 1. The notice identified each\ncrew member, including the captain, Chester P. Dalfrey, by name only. Downer also requested depositions of the immediate\nsupervisor of Chester Dalfrey and the custodian of Edward Downer's personnel file. On June 1, Aquamarine notified Downer\nthat the crew was at sea and would not appear. Aquamarine at that time agreed to produce the requested persons on June 22. On\nJune 21, Aquamarine again notified Downer that the crew was at sea and would not appear. It agreed to produce them on July 5.\n\nDowner filed written Notice of Intent to Take Depositions of the same individuals for July 5. On that date, the requested\ndeponents did not appear, whereupon Downer filed a Motion for Sanctions. A hearing on the Motion for Sanctions was set\nfor August 22. Aquamarine made no appearance at the hearing; the trial court granted the Motion for Sanctions and signed an\nOrder Striking Aquamarine's Answer.\n\nDowner filed a Motion for Interlocutory Default Judgment to which Aquamarine responded. The response contained\nAquamarine's reasons for not producing the requested individuals for depositions and its failure to appear at the sanctions\nhearing.\n\nThe reason offered for the first two occasions was that work for the FOUR POINT IV was scarce and, when work was available,\nit was necessary to send the vessel and crew to sea rather than produce them for depositions. On the third occasion, the vessel\nwas in port at New Iberia, Louisiana, but Coast Guard regulations required a skeleton crew to be kept aboard at all times.\nAquamarine's attorney stated that he notified Downer's attorney on July 1 of the necessity to take the depositions in New Iberia.\nDowner's attorney stated that he first learned that the individuals would not appear as noticed when Aquamarine's attorney called\nhim an hour after the depositions were scheduled to commence. Both agreed that Aquamarine requested that the depositions\nbe taken in New Iberia on July 6. However, Downer's attorney stated that he could not do so because he was preferentially set\nfor trial in Houston starting at 9:00 a.m. on July 6.\n\nThe reason given by Aquamarine for not appearing at the sanctions hearing was that Hurricane Alicia had struck La Porte,\nthe residence of Mr. Ayres, Aquamarine's lead counsel, four days previously. Mr. Ayres was involved in cleaning up after the\nhurricane and mitigating the damages to his home. Also, he had a hearing set in federal court in Beaumont on the following\nday and was directing all of his available attention to that matter.\n\nTo his Motion to Reconsider the Sanctions, Mr. Ayres attached an affidavit from his secretary, which stated that she had called\nthe clerk of the court on July 7, and had advised her that Mr. Ayres had to make a docket call in Angleton on August 22. She\nunderstood the clerk to say that the sanctions hearing would be reset for September 6. In response to this motion, Downer's\nattorney advised the court by letter of his version of the circumstances leading up to the non-appearance on July 5, and the\ntime when he was first advised *241 that the named individuals would not appear. Attached to this letter to the court was\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                            3\n\fDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436853/downer-v-aquamarine-operators-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985)\n\n\na copy of a letter dated July 28, written by Mr. Bales, an associate of Mr. Ayres, which confirmed that the sanctions hearing\nwas set for August 22.\n\nWith the above information before it, the trial court overruled Aquamarine's Motion to Reconsider the Sanctions and to reinstate\nits answer. The court signed an order granting an interlocutory default judgment as to liability. Aquamarine filed a Motion to\nSet Aside the Default Judgment. The motion contained practically the same information as the Motion to Reconsider Sanctions\nset out above. The trial court considered this motion and overruled it. On April 16, 1984, the case was preferentially set for trial\nfor June 4, and the trial court refused to consider Aquamarine's Second Motion to Set Aside the Interlocutory Default Judgment\nand Reinstate Defendant's Pleadings.\n\nA jury trial was had in a different court, the 334th District, on the issue of damages. At the trial, Chester Dalfrey testified that\nhe was captain of the FOUR POINT IV and as such he was in complete charge of the vessel with authority over all of its\noperations. Mr. Clark Ivans testified that he was president of Aquamarine at all times pertinent to this case, and that as such,\nhe was the immediate supervisor of Chester Dalfrey.\n\n [1] We now address the issue of whether the trial court had authority under Rule 215a(c) to strike Aquamarine's answer. That\nrule stated in pertinent part:\n\n             If a party or an officer or managing agent of a party, except for good cause shown, fails to appear before\n             the officer who is to take his oral deposition ... the court in which the action is pending on motion and\n             notice may strike out all or any part of the pleading of that party or dismiss the action or proceeding or\n             any part thereof....\n\nAs noted above, Ivans testified that as president of Aquamarine he was in complete charge of all operations of the company.\nThus he was a party as contemplated by Rule 215a(c).\n\n [2] [3] The next question is whether the trial court, in refusing to grant a new trial and reinstate Aquamarine's answer,\ncould consider the evidence introduced subsequent to the original sanctions hearing. Aquamarine contends that the trial court,\nin imposing sanctions, could consider only the evidence before it at the time of the sanctions hearing, and not any evidence\nsubsequently produced. A trial court's plenary jurisdiction gives it not only the authority but the responsibility to review any\npre-trial order upon proper motion. In doing so, it is presumed that the court is familiar with the entire record of the case up\nto and including the motion to be considered. The plenary jurisdiction of the trial court in this case continued through the\nfinal judgment and overruling of Aquamarine's motion for new trial. When considering the motion for new trial, the court had\nbefore it the reasons advanced by Aquamarine for not appearing for depositions or the sanctions hearing; Downer's response to\nAquamarine's motions; and the evidence produced at the trial on damages. Thus, the court of appeals erred in holding that the\ntrial court did not have authority under Rule 215a(c) to strike Aquamarine's answer.\n\nWe now turn to the court of appeals holding that the trial court abused its discretion in striking Aquamarine's answer. The\ncourt of appeals concluded its review of the abuse of discretion issue by stating: “The facts of the case simply do not, in our\nopinion, show this to be an appropriate case to impose the ultimate sanctions of striking the pleadings and entering default\njudgment.” We interpret that statement to mean that the court of appeals disagreed with the decision of the two trial judges\nwho reviewed the matter.\n\n [4] The test for abuse of discretion is not whether, in the opinion of the reviewing court, the facts present an appropriate case\nfor the trial court's action. Rather, it is a question of whether the court acted without reference to any guiding rules and *242\nprinciples. Craddock v.

The Texas Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to discovery and sanctions for noncompliance have\nbeen amended several times, culminating in Rule 215a as it existed at the time of this case, and now embodied in Rule 215. The\nuse of sanctions by trial courts to prevent discovery abuse has developed steadily over the past several years. These changes\nreflect the continuing pattern both to broaden the discovery process and to encourage sanctions for failure to comply.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in National Hockey League v.

Among these were\nthe following: (1) whether voluntarily sending the crew to sea rather than producing them for depositions as agreed on two\noccasions was in conscious disregard of this court's rules; (2) whether the contradictory statements of both attorneys indicated\nthat Aquamarine's attorney did in fact wait until one hour past the scheduled time for depositions on July 5, to advise Downer's\nattorney that he would have to fly to New Iberia and take depositions on the following day; (3) whether Aquamarine's attorney\nconsciously disregarded the sanctions hearing in preference to his personal needs and the federal court case set the following\nday; (4) whether the information contained in the secretary's affidavit as to the date of the sanctions hearing conflicted with\nthe letter from an attorney *243 in that law firm confirming that the hearing was set on August 22; and (5) the unexplained\nfailure of Aquamarine to produce for depositions on any of the occasions in question Clark Ivans, the immediate supervisor\nof Chester Dalfrey and the president of Aquamarine.\n\n [5] The record contains no indication that the trial court was capricious, arbitrary, or unreasonable. Thus, the court of appeals\nerred in holding that the trial court abused its discretion.\n\nIn determining whether to reverse and render this cause or to remand it to the court of appeals, we must look to the four points\nof error raised by Aquamarine before the court of appeals but not addressed by that court. If those points raise questions of law,\nas opposed to questions of fact, they can be addressed by this court.\n\nThe first point was that Downer's First Amended Original Petition was insufficient to support the judgment. The contention is\nthat the facts supporting the cause of action were not pleaded. TEX.R.CIV.P. 47 requires that a petition contain a short statement\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Our rules do not require pleadings to contain evidence\nor factual detail. That point is overruled.\n\n [6] The second point was that the trial court improperly refused to strike a juror for cause. After the court had ruled on\nchallenges for cause, there were 26 names left on the jury list. Each party was given six jury strikes, so, after making those\nstrikes, 14 names remained on the list. The challenged juror was Number 14 and was thus a spare. There was no harm in refusing\nto dismiss him for cause.\n\n [7] The third point was that the trial court improperly refused to admit evidence of Downer's contributory negligence.\nContributory negligence is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded. Aquamarine's answer had been struck and default\njudgment rendered as to liability. Thus, defendant had no pleading to support contributory negligence, so the court did not err\nin refusing to admit the requested evidence.\n\n [8] Aquamarine's remaining point before the court of appeals was that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest\nin a Jones Act case tried to a jury. This point was not presented to the trial court and was thus waived.\n\nAquamarine's points of error presented to the court of appeals but not considered by that court concerned questions of law\nover which we have jurisdiction. There is no merit to these points so it is not necessary for this cause to be remanded to the\ncourt of appeals.\n\nThe judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436853/downer-v-aquamarine-operators-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\n§§ 552.001–552.353 (West 1994 & Supp.2001). Ebony Lake informed the Department that it considered some of the\ndocuments privileged. Accordingly, the Department requested an attorney general's opinion. The Attorney General found\nthat the documents in question were not privileged and ordered the documents released. Ebony Lake subsequently sought a\ndeclaratory judgment, asking the trial court to declare the documents subject to a confidentiality privilege; in conjunction with\nthe suit, Ebony Lake also sought a temporary injunction. The trial court denied the temporary injunction, and Ebony Lake brings\nthis interlocutory appeal from that ruling. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 51.014 (West Supp.2001). We will reverse\nthe trial court's order denying the temporary injunction and remand the cause to the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\nOn February 23, 2000, an attorney representing family members of an Ebony Lake resident sent an open records request to the\nDepartment, seeking among other items all incident reports sent by Ebony Lake to the Department. On April 6, Ebony Lake\ninformed the Department that it considered some of the documents privileged from disclosure. Based on this information, the\nDepartment requested an attorney general's opinion concerning the confidentiality of the documents. The Attorney General\ndetermined that the documents were not subject to the asserted privileges and should be disclosed.\n\nEbony Lake then filed a declaratory judgment suit, seeking a judicial determination that the documents were subject to the\nasserted privileges. In conjunction with the suit, Ebony Lake sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the release of the\ndocuments. On August 20, 2000, visiting Judge Pete Lowry granted the temporary restraining order and set the matter for a\ntemporary injunction hearing. Following the hearing, Judge Lowry granted the temporary injunction in part. 1 The order signed\nby the trial court, *870 however, failed to include a date for a trial on the merits and failed to set a bond.\n\nOn January 9, 2001, the Department and the Attorney General filed a joint motion to dissolve Judge Lowry's order, claiming\nthat it was void ab initio because it failed to set a trial date or a bond. Judge Darlene Byrne considered the motion and agreed\nthat the order was void.\n\nThereafter, the trial court granted a second temporary restraining order and held a second temporary injunction hearing. At the\nhearing, the parties and the trial court agreed to adopt all evidence and exhibits from the first temporary injunction hearing,\nand the trial court heard legal arguments. Following the hearing, the trial court denied the application for temporary injunction.\nEbony Lake requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, which the trial court declined to file. Ebony Lake now appeals\nthe trial court's denial of its application for temporary injunction and the trial court's ruling that the initial temporary injunction\norder was void.\n\n\n\n                                                           DISCUSSION\n\nJudge Lowry entered an order granting Ebony Lake's application for temporary injunction in part on August 28, 2000. More\nthan four months later, the Department and the Attorney General filed a joint motion to dissolve the temporary injunction,\narguing that the order was void on its face because it failed to include a date for a trial on the merits and failed to set a bond\namount. The trial court agreed and declared the order void. By its second issue, Ebony Lake claims the trial court erred in\ndeclaring the first temporary injunction order void.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The applicant need only demonstrate that it is entitled to protection and\nthe status quo should be maintained until a trial on the merits commences.\n\nEbony Lake claims it established a probable right to recovery because it has a claim based on the Public Information Act. See\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001–.353. Ebony Lake further argues that it established a likelihood of success on the merits\nby presenting competent, uncontroverted evidence that the reports at issue were created by a medical peer review committee\nand are therefore confidential.\n\nThe Texas Public Information Act governs access to governmental information. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 552.001–.353. At\nthe heart of the Act is the principle that the public is entitled to all information “collected, assembled, or maintained by a\ngovernmental body.” Holmes v.

Justice, 39 S.W.3d at 347. A trial court abuses its discretion when it misapplies the law to the facts. Center for Econ.\nJustice, 39 S.W.3d at 347.\n\nEbony Lake claims on appeal that the information sought is made confidential by the medical peer review committee privilege\n(“peer review privilege”). Tex. Occ.Code Ann. § 160.007 (West 2001). The Medical Practice Act provides: “[E]ach proceeding\nor record of a medical peer review committee is confidential, and any communication made to a medical peer review committee\nis privileged.” Tex. Occ.Code Ann. § 160.007(a). Medical peer review committee is defined as\n\n            a committee of a health care entity, the governing board of a health care entity, or the medical staff\n            of a health care entity, that operates under written bylaws approved by the policy-making body or the\n            governing board of the health care entity and is authorized to evaluate the quality of medical and *872\n            health care services or the competence of physicians.\n\nId. § 151.002(a)(8) (West 2001). The Act defines medial peer review as “the evaluation of medical and health care services,\nincluding evaluation of the qualifications of professional health care practitioners and of patient care provided by those\npractitioners.” Id. § 151.002(a)(7).\n\nIn determining whether Ebony Lake established the elements necessary for temporary injunctive relief, the trial court considered\nwhether Ebony Lake had a probable right to prevail on its claim of privilege. In support of its claim to a privilege, Ebony Lake\npresented the documents at issue for in camera inspection and produced its quality assurance committee policy, along with\ntestimony from the facility administrator, Del Waggoner. The documents themselves detail three different accidents involving\nresidents at the facility. They include witnesses' observations of the incidents, along with any subsequent action taken by the\nfacility, including any actions directed toward its employees as a result of the incidents. Finally, the reports include diagnoses\nof the residents following their transport to the hospital.\n\nWaggoner testified that the incident reports were “processed” by the quality assurance committee and handled through the\ncommittee process. Waggoner also testified that at least one of the documents was created following an investigation performed\nby an “expression” of the quality assurance committee. He added that this investigation would have been conducted even if the\ncommittee had elected not to file any incident report with the Department. On cross-examination, Waggoner conceded that one\nof the reports would not have been filed with the Department if a complaint had not been lodged against the facility.\n\nIn response, appellees maintain that because Ebony Lake was required by law to file its reports with the Department, see Health\n& Safety Code Ann. § 242.122 (West 2001), the reports constitute business records, which are public information.

In addition, appellees argue that Ebony Lake cannot\nsatisfy the strict requirements mandated by Jordan v. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Supreme Judicial District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437007\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437007/jordan-v-ct-of-app-for-fourth-sup-jud-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1985), in order to assert a privilege. We will first address the applicability of Jordan to the facts of this case.\n\nAccording to appellees, Jordan mandates that in order for a party to successfully assert a privilege, the party must establish\nthat the documents at issue were (1) created with committee impetus and purpose, and (2) not “gratuitously submitted to a\ncommittee.” Id. at 648. Jordan addressed the predecessor to section 161.032 of the Health and Safety Code, or the medical\ncommittee privilege. 2 The *873 statutory definition of “medical committee” is broad in scope and encompasses a medical\npeer review committee.

McCown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1686897\"><a href=\"/opinion/1686897/memorial-hospital-the-woodlands-v-mccown/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (Tex.1996); Irving Healthcare Sys. v.\nBrooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1686897\"><a href=\"/opinion/1686897/memorial-hospital-the-woodlands-v-mccown/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">2, 20 (Tex.1996). In considering the scope of the privilege provided by that section, the supreme court\nnarrowly construed its applicability and held: “[T]his privilege extends to documents that have been prepared by or at the\ndirection of the committee for committee purposes. Documents which are gratuitously submitted to a committee or which have\nbeen created without committee impetus and purpose are not protected.” Jordan, 701 S.W.2d at 648.\n\nLater, in Irving and McCown, the supreme court considered the scope of the predecessor to the peer review privilege, now\ncodified in the Occupations Code, and its applicability to communications regarding the qualifications of a physician. Both\nIrving and McCown addressed a narrow set of facts in which the supreme court was asked to determine whether documents\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Texas Dept. of Human Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1353409\"><a href=\"/opinion/1353409/ebony-lake-ctr-v-tex-dept-of-human-serv/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001)\n\n\ngenerated by a medical peer review committee in its initial credentialing process are subject to the peer review privilege. The\ncourt broadly applied the peer review privilege and held that “even a ‘gratuitous' communication to a peer review committee\nabout the qualifications of a physician or the quality of health care provided by that physician is within the scope of section\n5.06 [now section 160.006 of the Occupations Code].” Irving, 927 S.W.2d at 19; accord McCown, 927 S.W.2d at 5.\n\n [11] In this case, Ebony Lake relies on only the peer review privilege. This privilege is associated with one discreet and specific\ntype of medical committee—that which performs peer reviews. Although the peer review committee is encompassed by the\nmore broadly defined “medical committee,” the supreme court has held that the more specific sub-category of a medical peer\nreview committee enjoys broad application of the peer review privilege. Accordingly, we consider only whether Ebony Lake\nhas shown a probable right to recovery based on its assertion of a peer review privilege. Although the documents at issue were on\npre-printed forms developed by the Department, reports were appended to those forms. The reports indicate the time and location\nof the occurrences, the nature of the occurrences, post-occurrence treatment, witnesses to the occurrences, and descriptions of\nthe incidents. The documents also indicate that the actions of some of the facility's medical staff were investigated or reviewed.\nMoreover, Waggoner testified that the reports were processed by the quality assurance committee, and Ebony Lake produced a\ncopy of the policy under which the committee operates. Appellees presented no controverting evidence. Based on this evidence,\nwe conclude that Ebony Lake has satisfied its burden for purposes of a temporary injunction. Cf. In re Osteopathic Med. Ctr.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1448366\"><a href=\"/opinion/1448366/in-re-osteopathic-medical-center-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 2000, orig. proceeding) (holding trial court abused its discretion in ordering production\nof report documenting occurrence at facility, patient's condition before occurrence, diagnosis of condition after occurrence,\nand care and treatment received until transport to hospital); In re WHMC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472691\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472691/in-re-pack/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">09 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n1999, orig. proceeding) (holding trial court abused its discretion in ordering medical facility to produce documents even though\nwitness averred that documents were generated for committee purpose of improving quality of patient care).\n\n [12] [13] Ebony Lake has also demonstrated a showing of probable harm in the interim. A party proves irreparable harm\n *874 by showing an injury for which there can be no real legal measure of damages or none that can be ascertained with a\nsufficient degree of certainty. Thompson, 24 S.W.3d at 577. Ebony Lake argues that disclosure of the reports prior to the trial on\nthe merits would result in a noncompensable injury. We agree. It would be a hollow victory if, following a trial on the merits,\nthe trial court were to determine that the reports were indeed privileged, but the reports had already been disclosed.\n\nRelying on In re Pack, appellees counter that because Ebony Lake was required by law to disclose the reports to the Department,\nthey have failed to demonstrate any injury. Pack was a mandamus action, in which the second court of appeals was called\nupon to decide whether nursing home investigation reports prepared by the Texas Department of Human Services, along with a\nnursing home's responsive plans of correction, and the testimony of the Department's surveyors regarding their investigations,\nwere excluded from discovery under the peer review privilege. 996 S.W.2d at 5. The nursing home argued that the records\nwere prepared from confidential information collected from the nursing home's peer review committee, and that the Department\nwas an agent of this committee when it prepared its reports. However, in that proceeding the nursing home did not segregate\nthose documents that it claimed included confidential information for in camera inspection, as it was required to do. The court\nconcluded that because the Department and the nursing home were required by law to make the documents at issue public, the\ndocuments were discoverable. In re Pack, 996 S.W.2d at 7. The court further held, “The mere fact that the Nursing Home's peer\nreview committee may have reviewed the TDHS documents does not make them privileged.” Id.\n\n [14] In this case, the nursing home did segregate the questionable documents for in camera inspection. Furthermore, the\ndocuments were not created by the Department, as was the case in Pack, but were created by the quality assurance committee.\nWe need not decide at this juncture whether In re Pack applies to the facts of this case and renders the reports at issue subject to\ndisclosure. The facts before us, however, are sufficiently distinguishable to establish a bona fide issue that should be addressed\nat a trial on the merits. And because Ebony Lake has shown clear evidence of irreparable injury, its certainty of victory need not\nbe as stringently examined. See Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Util.

We conclude, however, that Ebony Lake established a probable right to recovery and a probable\ninjury in the interim and thus satisfied the prerequisites for a temporary injunction.

Justin Lindley, Ramey & Flock, P.C., Tyler, TX, Sheral Kniffin Maloy, El Paso, TX, for Respondents.\n\nOpinion\n\nJustice GREEN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe principal question in this case is whether consideration received for the sale of a business interest is subject to equitable\nforfeiture as a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty. We hold that when a partner in a business breached his fiduciary duty by\nfraudulently inducing another partner to buy out his interest, the consideration received by the breaching party for his interest\nin the business is subject to forfeiture as a remedy for the breach, in addition to other damages that result from the tortious\nconduct. Here, the trial court ordered equitable forfeiture, but the court of appeals reversed, concluding that forfeiture was not\nan available remedy. We reverse the court of appeals' judgment in part and remand the case to that court for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                            I. Facts\n\nLarry G. Snodgrass and J. Mark Swinnea owned equal interests in two business entities, ERI Consulting Engineers, Inc., and\nMalmeba Company, Ltd., which they operated together for approximately ten years. ERI is a small consulting company that\nmanages asbestos abatement projects for contractors. It leased office space from Malmeba, a partnership that owned the building.\n\nSnodgrass and ERI purchased Swinnea's interest in ERI in 2001. ERI paid Swinnea $497,500 to redeem Swinnea's ERI stock,\nand Snodgrass transferred his half-interest in Malmeba to Swinnea. ERI agreed to employ Swinnea for six years, and Swinnea\nagreed not to compete with ERI. At the same time, ERI agreed to continue leasing from Malmeba for six *871 years. 1\n\nUnknown to Snodgrass, the wives of Swinnea and Chris Power, an ERI employee, had created a new company called Air\nQuality Associates a month before Swinnea and Snodgrass executed the buyout agreement. Air Quality Associates was created\nto perform mold abatement, but later engaged in asbestos abatement as a contractor even though neither wife had experience\nin the asbestos abatement field. Swinnea did not disclose the existence of Air Quality Associates to Snodgrass during the ERI\nbuyout negotiations. In fact, because Swinnea believed Snodgrass would “run [ERI] into the ground,” Swinnea told Power to\n“[b]e patient because we can buy this company back 50 cents on the dollar.” The trial court found that “Swinnea's placement of\nhis wife, Dawn Swinnea, and Tracy Power as principals of Air Quality Associates, Inc. was deceptive, a sham and constituted\nfraud.”\n\nAfter the buyout, Swinnea's revenue production as an ERI employee dropped 30%–50%. Snodgrass testified that although\nSwinnea's supervisory responsibilities were to cease under their agreement, Swinnea's revenue production was to remain the\nsame, if not increase. Soon thereafter, Snodgrass learned about Swinnea's relationship with Air Quality Associates from one\nof ERI's asbestos contractors, Merico, with which Air Quality Associates was competing. Because of the personal relationship\nbetween the individuals involved with ERI and Air Quality Associates, Merico told Snodgrass that Merico would no longer\nwork with ERI if ERI were to accept bids from Air Quality Associates on asbestos abatement projects. ERI had been accepting\nbids from Air Quality Associates without Snodgrass knowing of Swinnea's or Power's relationship with Air Quality Associates.\n\nPower and his wife later bought out the Swinneas' interest in Air Quality Associates. ERI subsequently worked with Air\nQuality Associates, while its work with Merico declined. Meanwhile, Swinnea and his wife formed a new company, Brady\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However,\nBrady Environmental began performing asbestos abatement using the Resilient Floor Covering Institute method. Evidence\nsuggests that ERI's clients' use of this method impacted ERI's business because RFCI does not require a consultant like ERI.\nAlthough he was employed by ERI, Swinnea encouraged ERI's clients to use RFCI instead, contrary to ERI's interest and policy.\nAfter the relationship between Swinnea and ERI deteriorated, Snodgrass ultimately fired Swinnea, releasing him from his non-\ncompete obligations. Swinnea obtained a license to perform asbestos consulting work the next day and began working for Brady\nEnvironmental as a consultant. Snodgrass moved ERI out of Malmeba's building and pursued this lawsuit with ERI against\nSwinnea, Malmeba, and Brady Environmental.\n\nAfter a bench trial, the trial court found for Snodgrass and ERI on their claims for statutory fraud in a real estate and stock\ntransaction, common law fraud, breach of the non-compete clause in the contract, as well as for breach of fiduciary duty.\nIt rendered judgment awarding ERI and Snodgrass combined damages of $1,020,700, and $1 million in exemplary *872\ndamages. The non-exemplary damages awarded by the trial court consisted of both equitable forfeiture and actual damages:\nforfeiture of $437,500, a portion of the $497,500 paid to Swinnea by ERI; forfeiture of $150,000, the value of Snodgrass's one-\nhalf interest in Malmeba transferred to Swinnea; forfeiture of $133,200, constituting the sum of the lease payments from ERI to\nMalmeba after the buyout; and $300,000 as ERI's lost profits from its business relationship with Merico. The trial court found\nthat a civil conspiracy existed between Swinnea and Brady Environmental, and held Brady Environmental jointly and severally\nliable with Swinnea for the damages.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor of Swinnea because it found the evidence “legally insufficient to\nsupport the damage awards.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2186151\"><a href=\"/opinion/2186151/swinnea-v-eri-consulting-engineers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2007). In particular, the court of appeals found that ERI\nfailed to prove any actual damages. Id. at 841. It found that the equitable remedy of forfeiture was unavailable because there\nwas no fee paid to Swinnea to be forfeited. Id. It concluded further that ERI failed to prove that Swinnea obtained any ill-gotten\ngains subject to disgorgement. Id. It determined that the lease payments were not recoverable because the evidence that the\nlease payments were intended as consideration for the buyout was “incompetent parol evidence.” Id. at 835. Finally, the court\nof appeals concluded that there was no basis for joint liability as to Brady Environmental because there was no evidence of a\nconspiracy between Swinnea and Brady Environmental. Id. at 841–42.\n\nSwinnea does not dispute his liability for fraud, breach of contract, or breach of fiduciary duty. Rather, he disputes the damages\nthe trial court awarded. He asserts that the forfeiture award is unsupported by law. He also asserts that the lost profits award is\nunsupported by legally sufficient evidence. Brady Environmental primarily disputes whether it can be jointly liable for any of\nthe particular damages awarded by the trial court regardless of whether it later conspired in certain wrongful acts.\n\n\n\n                                                    II. Equitable Forfeiture\n\n [1] The primary question we must address is whether forfeiture of contractual consideration is available as a remedy against\nSwinnea. We have previously upheld equitable remedies for breach of fiduciary duty. E.g., Burrow v. Arce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419918\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419918/burrow-v-arce/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n237–45 (Tex.1999) (upholding remedy of forfeiture upon attorney's breach of fiduciary duty).

Corbett–\nWallace Corp., we stated the principle behind such remedies:\n\n  It is beside the point for [Defendant] to say that [Plaintiff] suffered no damages because it received full value for what it has\n  paid and agreed to pay.... It would be a dangerous precedent for us to say that unless some affirmative loss can be shown,\n  the person who has violated his fiduciary relationship with another may hold on to any secret gain or benefit he may have\n  thereby acquired. It is the law that in such instances if the fiduciary “takes any gift, gratuity, or benefit in violation of his\n  duty, or acquires any interest adverse to his principal, without a full disclosure, it is a betrayal of his trust and a breach of\n  confidence, and he must account to his principal for all he has received.”\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3927955\"><a href=\"/opinion/4161880/kinzbach-tool-co-v-corbett-wallace-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3927955\"><a href=\"/opinion/4161880/kinzbach-tool-co-v-corbett-wallace-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1942) (quoting United States v.

Rather, *873 the central purpose ... is to protect relationships of trust by discouraging\nagents' disloyalty.” Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 238.\n\n [2] [3] Accordingly, courts may fashion equitable remedies such as profit disgorgement and fee forfeiture to remedy a breach\nof fiduciary duty. For instance, courts may disgorge all ill-gotten profits from a fiduciary when a fiduciary agent usurps an\nopportunity properly belonging to a principal, or competes with a principal. See, e.g., Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2105795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2105795/johnson-v-brewer-pritchard-pc/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (Tex.2002) (stating the rule that courts may disgorge any profit where “an agent diverted an opportunity\nfrom the principal or engaged in competition with the principal, [and] the agent or an entity controlled by the agent profited\nor benefitted in some way”). Similarly, even if a fiduciary does not obtain a benefit from a third party by violating his duty, a\nfiduciary may be required to forfeit the right to compensation for the fiduciary's work. See, e.g., Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 237\n(“[A] person who renders service to another in a relationship of trust may be denied compensation for his service if he breaches\nthat trust.”). The difficulty comes in categorizing the damages awarded in this case. Here, the damages awarded by the trial court\nwere not ill-gotten profits from an outside opportunity or external competition, or compensation for work done by the fiduciary.\nRather, the trial court returned a significant part of the contractual consideration paid by ERI and Snodgrass to Swinnea as part\nof the buyout agreement. The situation arises because here the contracting party, Swinnea, was a fiduciary, such that we must\nconsider whether under the circumstances an equitable remedy may cross the line from actual damages for breach of contract\nor fraud (redressing specific harm) to further, equitable return of contractual consideration.\n\nThe trial court found Swinnea liable for fraudulent inducement as to the buyout agreement, and Swinnea does not challenge this\nliability. The trial court also found that Swinnea owed fiduciary duties both to ERI and to Snodgrass. It follows that Swinnea's\nactions in fraudulently inducing the buyout agreement contracts were willful breaches of his fiduciary duty. We hold that\nwhere willful actions constituting breach of fiduciary duty also amount to fraudulent inducement, the contractual consideration\nreceived by the fiduciary is recoverable in equity regardless of whether actual damages are proven, subject to certain limiting\nprinciples set out below.\n\nThe situation in this case is akin in many respects to the fee forfeiture scenario between a principal and agent, which we discussed\nat length in Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 237–45. In that case, former clients sued their attorneys alleging breach of fiduciary duty\narising from settlement negotiations in a previous lawsuit. Id. at 232–33. We held that “a client need not prove actual damages\nin order to obtain forfeiture of an attorney's fee for the attorney's breach of fiduciary duty to the client.” Id. at 240. We repeated\nthat “the central purpose of the remedy is to protect relationships of trust from an agent's disloyalty or other misconduct.”\nId. That policy applies equally to the relationship of trust at issue here and the duties Swinnea owed to ERI and Snodgrass.\nWe cited section 469 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, which states that if “conduct [that is a breach of his duty of\nloyalty] constitutes a wilful and deliberate breach of his contract of service, he is not entitled to compensation even for properly\nperformed services for which no compensation is apportioned.” Id. at 237. We also stated:\n\n             [T]he possibility of forfeiture of compensation discourages an agent from taking *874 personal\n             advantage of his position of trust in every situation no matter the circumstances, whether the principal\n             may be injured or not. The remedy of forfeiture removes any incentive for an agent to stray from his duty\n             of loyalty based on the possibility that the principal will be unharmed or may have difficulty proving\n             the existence or amount of damages.\n\nId. at 238. The same principles apply to circumstances where a fiduciary takes advantage of his position of trust to induce a\nprincipal to enter into a contract. The remedy of forfeiture is necessary to prevent such abuses of trust, regardless of proof of\nactual damages.\n\n [4] Although forfeiture of contractual consideration may “have a punitive effect” like forfeiture of compensation, id. at 240,\nit may nevertheless be necessary to protect fiduciary relationships. As we said in the attorney-client context:\n\n             An attorney who has clearly and seriously breached his fiduciary duty to his client should not be\n             insulated from fee forfeiture by his client's ignorance of the matter.

The same reasoning applies here: a fiduciary who breaches his duty should not be insulated from forfeiture if the\nparty whom he fraudulently induced into contract is ignorant about the fraud, or fails to suffer harm. Likewise, the innocent\nparty should not be put into a difficult choice regarding termination of the contract upon discovering the breach of duty.\n\n [5] [6] Where equitable remedies exist, however, “the remedy of forfeiture must fit the circumstances presented.” Id. at 241.\nIn Burrow, we listed several factors for consideration when fashioning a particular equitable forfeiture remedy in the context\nof attorney-client relationships:\n\n  “[T]he gravity and timing of the violation, its wilfulness, its effect on the value of the lawyer's work for the client, any other\n  threatened or actual harm to the client, and the adequacy of other remedies.” These factors are to be considered in determining\n  whether a violation is clear and serious, whether forfeiture of any fee should be required, and if so, what amount. The list\n  is not exclusive. The several factors embrace broad considerations which must be weighed together and not mechanically\n  applied. For example, the “wilfulness” factor requires consideration of the attorney's culpability generally; it does not simply\n  limit forfeiture to situations in which the attorney's breach of duty was intentional. The adequacy-of-other-remedies factor\n  does not preclude forfeiture when a client can be fully compensated by damages. Even though the main purpose of the remedy\n  is not to compensate the client, if other remedies do not afford the client full compensation for his damages, forfeiture may\n  be considered for that purpose.\n\nId. at 243–44 (quoting RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 49 (Proposed Final Draft No.\n1, 1996)). We also cited comment c to section 243 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts:\n\n             It is within the discretion of the court whether the trustee who has committed a breach of trust shall\n             receive full compensation or whether his compensation shall be reduced or denied. In the exercise of\n             the court's discretion the following factors are considered: (1) whether *875 the trustee acted in good\n             faith or not; (2) whether the breach of trust was intentional or negligent or without fault; (3) whether the\n             breach of trust related to the management of the whole trust or related only to a part of the trust property;\n             (4) whether or not the breach of trust occasioned any loss and whether if there has been a loss it has been\n             made good by the trustee; (5) whether the trustee's services were of value to the trust.\n\nId. at 243. Several of these factors are also relevant in this context. The gravity and timing of the breach of duty, the level of\nintent or fault, whether the principal received any benefit from the fiduciary despite the breach, the centrality of the breach to\nthe scope of the fiduciary relationship, and any threatened or actual harm to the principal are relevant. Likewise, the adequacy\nof other remedies—including any punitive damages award—is also relevant. Above all, the remedy must fit the circumstances\nand work to serve the ultimate goal of protecting relationships of trust.\n\nThere is no indication the trial court followed these principles in fashioning its award. Accordingly, we direct the court of\nappeals to remand the case to the trial court for consideration of these factors upon resolution of the issues remaining for the\ncourt of appeals. 2\n\n\n\n                                          III. Evidence of Contractual Consideration\n\n[7] We next consider whether the trial court properly admitted undisputed testimony offered to show that the lease agreement\nwas intended to be consideration for the buyout agreement, and thus subject to potential forfeiture under our analysis above.\nThe court of appeals concluded that such testimony was “incompetent parol evidence.” 236 S.W.3d at 835.

A collateral agreement between\nparties concerning the relationship of several distinct obligations between them falls within the exception. See, e.g., Hubacek,\n317 S.W.2d at 34 (“A and B in an integrated contract respectively promise to sell and to buy Blackacre for $3,000.00. A\ncontemporaneous oral agreement between them that the price shall be paid partly by discharge of a judgment which B has\nagainst A is operative.” (quoting with approval RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF CONTRACTS section 240 cmt. d (1939))). Here,\nif the parties agreed that the lease obligation was to be additional *876 consideration for the buyout, then such an agreement\nwas a consistent collateral agreement. Nothing in such an agreement would contradict the written contracts. See id. at 32 (“If ...\nthe parol evidence rule precludes enforcement of the oral agreement, it is because the agreement varies or contradicts the terms\nor obligations of the [written contracts].”). Accordingly, Swinnea's testimony conceding this fact was properly admitted under\nthis long-standing exception to the parol evidence rule. The fact that the lease agreement was consideration for the buyout\nagreement as a whole is thus established by legally sufficient evidence.\n\nTherefore, as contractual consideration, the lease payments from ERI to Malmeba are subject to forfeiture for Swinnea's breach\nof fiduciary duty. The trial court should consider whether to include them in fashioning an appropriate equitable forfeiture.\n\n\n\n                                                     IV. Lost Profit Damages\n\n[11]   We turn next to the question of actual damages. Here, where the only actual damages that the trial court awarded were\nlost profit damages, the issue is whether ERI provided legally sufficient evidence of those lost profits. 3\n\n[12]    [13]      [14]   The rule concerning adequate evidence of lost profit damages is well established:\n\n               Recovery for lost profits does not require that the loss be susceptible of exact calculation. However, the\n               injured party must do more than show that they suffered some lost profits. The amount of the loss must be\n               shown by competent evidence with reasonable certainty. What constitutes reasonably certain evidence\n               of lost profits is a fact intensive determination. As a minimum, opinions or estimates of lost profits must\n               be based on objective facts, figures, or data from which the amount of lost profits can be ascertained.\n               Although supporting documentation may affect the weight of the evidence, it is not necessary to produce\n               in court the documents supporting the opinions or estimates.\n\nHolt Atherton Indus., Inc. v.

Later,\nfrom September 2001 through May 2004 (33 months), average revenue dropped to $1,792.59 per month. 6 Contrasting revenue\nfrom a time period immediately before the period at issue is an established method of proving revenue for a lost profit damages\ncalculation.

Even assuming\na 30% profit margin on the work from Merico, Snodgrass's maximum profit margin estimate, the damages award would be only\n$178,601.05 for the 33–month period at issue when ERI's profits from Merico declined. 7 ERI's evidence thus fails to meet the\nminimum requirements for legal sufficiency that we set out in Holt Atherton regarding reasonable certainty as to the amount\nawarded by the trial court—here, $300,000. Up to this point, the court of appeals reached the same conclusions that we have.\nSee 236 S.W.3d at 838–39 (reciting the same evidence and reaching the same conclusion regarding whether such evidence is\nlegally sufficient to prove $300,000 of lost profit damages with reasonable certainty).\n\n [16] Still, while the evidence does not prove $300,000 in lost profits, ERI's evidence is legally sufficient evidence to prove\na lesser, ascertainable amount of lost profits with reasonable certainty. In this situation, such a discrepancy between two\nreasonably certain amounts will not defeat recovery by ERI. See Sw. Battery, 115 S.W.2d at 1099 (“[U]ncertainty as to the\nfact of legal damages is fatal to recovery, but uncertainty as to the amount will not defeat recovery.”); Tex. Instruments, 877\nS.W.2d at 279 (explaining that Southwest Battery and subsequent cases required reasonable certainty as to the amount of lost\nprofit damages); cf. *878 Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. v. Nat'l Dev. & Research Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109\n(Tex.2009) (remanding to the court of appeals where there was some evidence of damages, but not enough to support the full\namount awarded by the trial court). ERI proved lost profit damages; its entitlement to recover them survives the trial court's\nerror in awarding too much. Accordingly, the appropriate remedy is to remand the case to the court of appeals to consider the\npossibility for remittitur on lost profit damages. See TEX.R.APP. P. 46.3, 46.5 (providing procedures for remittitur by courts\nof appeals).\n\n [17] Swinnea argues that ERI's lost profits calculation is inadequate because it fails to apply certain credits or deduct certain\nexpenses. First, Swinnea asserts that because ERI's lost profits were on the Merico account, which were in turn lost because\nof Swinnea's involvement with Air Quality Associates, we must offset any amount that ERI gained by doing business with\nAir Quality Associates. That is, where the two accounts were mutually exclusive, loss from one must be offset by gain from\nthe other. This argument is unpersuasive in part because the exclusivity arose out of Merico's ultimatum to ERI about Air\nQuality Associates—“us or them”—not because it was otherwise impossible for ERI to pursue both business relationships\nsimultaneously. The evidence shows that Merico came to give ERI its ultimatum because of Swinnea. Merico did not object\nto ERI's work with Air Quality Associates—a competitor of Merico's in asbestos abatement—until it discovered that Swinnea\nand Power were involved with Air Quality Associates. Nothing suggests that ERI could not have profited from working both\nwith Air Quality Associates (apart from Swinnea) and Merico. 8 Accordingly, because nothing indicates that ERI could not\nwork with both companies, any profits from ERI's work with Air Quality Associates need not be offset against the lost profits\nfrom Merico caused by Swinnea's position with Air Quality Associates.\n\n [18] [19] Even assuming that Swinnea is correct that profits from Air Quality Associates must be credited against the lost\nprofits figure, he can point to no evidence to support his assertion that ERI profited from work with Air Quality Associates as\na substitute for Merico. The plaintiff bears the burden of providing evidence supporting a single complete calculation of lost\nprofits, which may often require certain credits and expenses. See Holt Atherton, 835 S.W.2d at 85 (“Recovery of lost profits\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However, the defendant properly bears the burden of providing at least\nsome evidence suggesting that an otherwise complete lost profits calculation is in fact missing relevant credits. Cf. Brown v.\nAm. Transfer & Storage Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514858\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514858/brown-v-american-transfer-storage-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 936 (Tex.1980) (“The right of offset is an affirmative defense. The burden of\npleading offset and of proving facts necessary to support it are on the party making the assertion.”). Were this not so, every\nfacially adequate calculation of lost profits would be susceptible to an unsubstantiated challenge that something is missing.\nThat subtle distinction is crucial here because Swinnea directs us to nothing in the record proving that ERI profited—in any\namount—from working with Air Quality Associates as a substitute for Merico in *879 asbestos abatement; and we can find\nnone. 9 Rather, he simply asserts that ERI does not dispute that it developed a mutually successful relationship with Air Quality\nAssociates. The only evidence in the record indicates that ERI continued to show an overall profit despite the decline in revenue\nfrom Merico, and that ERI worked with Air Quality Associates. No evidence shows whether any profits from working with Air\nQuality Associates contributed to ERI's overall profits, as a substitute for Merico or otherwise. 10\n\n [20] Swinnea also contests that overhead costs and other unspecified expenses were not included in ERI's evidence or\ncalculation. However, it is not necessarily the case that a company will incur increased expense or overhead, especially where—\nas evidence here suggests—a corporation was already profitable at the time damages began, and evidence supports an inference\nthat it could have performed profitable services using only its existing resources. See Tex. Instruments, 877 S.W.2d at 279\n(“[P]re-existing profit, together with other facts and circumstances, may indicate with reasonable certainty the amount of profits\nlost.” (quoting Sw. Battery, 115 S.W.2d at 1099)). This is not a manufacturing scenario, where production costs necessarily\nexist. Rather, ERI was a consulting company, which wrote plans and specifications, solicited bids for projects, and completed\nsurveys. Evidence suggests that ERI would have been able to perform all of this service work using its existing employees.\nPower, for instance, testified that he “put in whatever hours it takes to get jobs done.” Swinnea himself had begun contributing\nmuch less work to ERI, despite having been one of its most productive workers before. Had Swinnea continued to contribute at\nhis prior level, that productivity would only have helped ERI complete additional projects. Furthermore, after Snodgrass fired\nSwinnea, ERI began to work with Merico again, while still working with Air Quality Associates, without expansion to ERI's\nstaff. Accordingly, Swinnea has not met his burden to provide at least some evidence that ERI's otherwise complete lost profit\ndamages calculation was actually inadequate because of a necessary credit or additional expense.\n\n [21] Swinnea also challenges causation as to ERI's lost profit damages. However, evidence showed that at the end of October\n2001, upon concluding a series of conversations about Swinnea's involvement with Air Quality Associates, Merico specifically\nindicated that it would no longer be working with ERI because of Swinnea's involvement. 11 Swinnea himself testified *880\nthat his involvement with Air Quality Associates could harm the Merico relationship, and that a severance of ERI's relationship\nwith Merico would negatively affect ERI's revenues. This evidence is legally sufficient to establish a straightforward link\nbetween Swinnea's breach of duty and the loss of profits to ERI.\n\nIn sum, legally sufficient evidence does not exist to prove the trial court's lost profit damages award under the minimum\nrequirements of Holt Atherton. However, this insufficiency does not extend to reasonable certainty as to any amount. Rather,\ncompetent evidence exists to establish some reasonably certain amount of lost profits—just not the particular amount awarded\nby the trial court. Unlike a situation where no evidence establishes any amount of lost profit damages with reasonable certainty,\nthe situation here requires a potential reduction, not a take—nothing judgment against the plaintiff. Therefore, we reverse the\ncourt of appeals' judgment that ERI recover no lost profit damages and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.\nShould the court of appeals fail to arrive at a disposition concerning remittitur, it may remand for a new trial on lost profit\ndamages, as we might have if the evidence did not seem conducive to remittitur.

The trial court found clear and convincing\nevidence establishing that Swinnea willfully, maliciously, and intentionally caused injury to ERI and Snodgrass in committing\nfraud.

Liability for Conspiracy\n\n [22] Having found that legally sufficient evidence established lost profit damages in some amount, and that Swinnea may\nalso be liable for punitive damages as well as forfeiture of contractual consideration, we must next address whether Brady\nEnvironmental may be jointly liable for these damages as a conspirator.\n\n [23] [24] An actionable civil conspiracy requires specific intent to agree to accomplish an unlawful purpose or a lawful\npurpose by unlawful means.

Another element\nis actual damages as the proximate result of the conspiracy. Id.\n\nIn its live pleading at trial, ERI asserted that Brady Environmental conspired in Swinnea's ongoing fraudulent misrepresentations\nas well as Swinnea's ongoing breach of fiduciary duty, which among other things damaged existing ERI client relationships.\nThe trial court found that Swinnea's wrongful conduct “continued after the buy-out, including but not limited to his formation\nof Brady Environmental, Inc.” It also found that Brady Environmental “participated in and knowingly accepted the benefits\nof ... Swinnea's wrongful conduct,” and that Brady Environmental “had actual awareness of the wrongful conduct.”\n\nEven assuming those findings are true, there is no evidence that any of the damages awarded by the trial court occurred as the\nproximate result of any involvement by Brady Environmental. Moreover, no meeting of the minds between Swinnea and Brady\nEnvironmental could have occurred involving the actions causing ERI actual harm—lost profits—because Brady Environmental\ndid not yet exist, having been formed approximately six months after Swinnea left Air Quality Associates. Accordingly, Brady\nEnvironmental cannot be jointly and severally liable for any lost profit damages discussed above, or any potential punitive\ndamages that follow from them.\n\n [25] Furthermore, while Brady Environmental may have participated in the abuse of trust in Swinnea's ongoing breaches of\nfiduciary duty and Swinnea's ongoing fraudulent misrepresentations, Brady Environmental had no part in inducing the buyout\nagreement. As discussed above, the forfeiture of contractual consideration is available as an equitable remedy against a fiduciary\nwho fraudulently induces the contract, regardless of actual harm. Contractual consideration is subject to forfeiture because it was\nfraudulently bargained for by a fiduciary. Certainly the rule allowing such equitable remedies to protect relationships of trust\nencompasses the ability to fashion such remedies against those who would conspire to abuse such relationships. See Kinzbach,\n160 S.W.2d at 514 (“It is settled as the law of this State that where a third party knowingly participates in the breach of duty of\na fiduciary, such third party becomes a joint tortfeasor with the fiduciary and is liable as such.”).

The trial court's award included no equitable remedy tied to\nconduct in which Brady Environmental participated. Rather, the only equitable award—forfeiture of contractual consideration\n—arose from a transaction that occurred approximately a year before Brady Environmental existed. Under the circumstances of\nthis particular case, we believe that even if Brady Environmental *882 conspired in later breaches of fiduciary duty or fraud,\nBrady Environmental is not subject to liability for any particular equitable forfeiture amount from the return of contractual\nconsideration given in the specific transaction at issue. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment that ERI take\nnothing on its conspiracy claim against Brady Environmental.\n\n\n\n                                                            VI. Conclusion\n\nWe hold that when a fiduciary fraudulently induced a contract, such a breach of fiduciary duty may give rise to equitable\nforfeiture of contractual consideration. We therefore reverse the portion of the court of appeals' judgment that ERI take nothing\nin equity. Because trial courts are required to consider certain factors when fashioning a forfeiture remedy, which we have set\nout, we direct the court of appeals to remand the case to the trial court, in turn, for review of its forfeiture award in light of these\nprinciples. Additionally, we conclude that the court of appeals erred in excluding evidence that certain lease payments were\ncontractual consideration subject to forfeiture because testimony proving this fact was properly admitted under the consistent\ncollateral agreement exception to the parol evidence rule.\n\nWe also hold that while legally sufficient evidence does not exist to prove the lost profits awarded by the trial court, legally\nsufficient evidence does exist to prove some reasonably certain amount of lost profits. We therefore also reverse the portion of\nthe court of appeals' judgment that ERI take nothing on its claims for lost profit damages and punitive damages and remand\nthe case to the court of appeals to consider a remittitur, as well as any other remaining issues, before remanding the case to\nthe trial court.\n\nFinally, we affirm the portion of the court of appeals' judgment that ERI and Snodgrass take nothing on their civil conspiracy\nclaims against Brady Environmental because the actual damages awarded by the trial court were not caused by Brady\nEnvironmental's wrongful conduct, and the equitable forfeiture awarded by the trial court arose from a transaction too remote\nfrom Brady Environmental's involvement to support liability in equity.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895225\"><a href=\"/opinion/895225/eri-consulting-engineers-inc-v-swinnea/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

Thirty percent of this figure\n       is $178,601.05.\n8      Swinnea elsewhere points out to us that Air Quality Associates was also doing profitable mold treatment work, while Merico focused\n       on asbestos removal. This suggests that ERI might have had separate consulting opportunities with Air Quality Associates that\n       were unavailable from Merico, meaning it could have consistently worked with both without overlap, as ERI also performed mold\n       assessments. Indeed, ERI began to work with both Merico and Air Quality Associates some time after the period in question.\n9      Swinnea asserts in his brief that where “ERI chose the relationship with AQA [instead of Merico, such] conduct of itself is evidence\n       of ERI's belief that the AQA relationship was the more profitable one.” At most, this suggests that ERI might have believed that the\n       Air Quality Associates relationship would be the more profitable one, which says nothing about whether it was actually profitable.\n       Swinnea also asserts in his brief that “the AQA relationship was demonstrably ... lucrative to ERI, as the corporate financial records\n       proved.” But Swinnea does not direct us to any such financial records in the record. Further, having reviewed hundreds of ERI's\n       invoices (the majority of which were issued to Merico), as well as other financial records introduced as evidence, we could not find\n       a single piece of evidence in the record proving any profit to ERI from Air Quality Associates.\n10     Indeed, we are left to wonder further whether any such alleged profits were in turn for asbestos projects that Merico might have\n       worked on rather than for mold projects.\n11     We reiterate that Swinnea does not contest liability. The trial court entered specific findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning\n       the impropriety of Swinnea's involvement with Air Quality Associates. Thus, Swinnea's liability extends to any damage caused by\n       his involvement with Air Quality Associates.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

That they changed the mode of operations to this extent, they not only gave out\ntickets to customers who bought merchandise, but in some instances to individuals who were not purchasers. That defendants\nhad distributed many prizes in this manner, and had advertised a drawing for a Chrysler car to take place May 23, 1928. That\nthe admitted purpose of such scheme was to attract trade from competitors who did not participate in the scheme and to build\nup their own business.\n\nThe court found: That plaintiff was a competitor of the defendants in the sale of oil, gasoline, and in the general garage business,\nand that members of said association had opened up places of business immediately surrounding that of plaintiff, at which they\ndisplayed advertisements to the effect that customers would receive chances on automobiles by patronizing their places. That\nvarious prospective customers of plaintiff left his place without making purchases, on discovering that he did not distribute\ntickets for the automobile drawing, and that, since and during the operation of the scheme, plaintiff's business declined, he lost\nmoney, whilst the defendants' business increased and they made money as the result of the scheme.\n\nThe court concluded that the facts showed the existence of a lottery in violation of the penal statutes of the state; that every\nelement of the offense existed--that is, a prize to be distributed, by chance, to the holder of a ticket, who acquired the same\non a consideration.\n\nParagraphs 3 and 4 of the court's legal conclusions are as follows:\n“(3) I find that the plaintiff has no property rights involved in the crime committed by the defendants and each of them, and loss\nof trade and patronage by the plaintiff, caused by the defendants, does not constitute injury to property rights. In this connection,\nI find that general business, commonly known as ‘trade,’ coming from the general public in the form of patronage, is entitled\nto go into whatever channel it deems fit, and, although said scheme and device directly injures the plaintiff financially in the\noperation of his business, that same does not constitute such unfair competition that plaintiff has a legal cause to complain by\nasking an injunction.\n\n“(4) I further find that the plaintiff, M. B. Featherstone, is not entitled to equitable relief in the form of a permanent injunction\nfor the reason hereinabove stated, to wit, that his property rights are not affected as the term ‘property right’ is construed by\nthis court, and that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, to wit, protection by the criminal courts, and that the plaintiff's\nadequate remedy would be to file a criminal complaint against the defendants herein in the event he desires to do so.”\n\n\nIn harmony with the court's legal conclusions, judgment was rendered denying plaintiff the relief sought, from which this appeal\nis prosecuted.\n\nPlaintiff's contention in effect is this, that his property and property rights (that is, his business and the right to operate the\nsame without unlawful interference, invasion, or injury) were violated by the lottery scheme conducted by defendants, and\ntherefore he was entitled to the injunctive relief sought, notwithstanding the fact that the lottery constituted a violation of the\nPenal Code of the state.\n\nLottery as an offense was unknown to the common law, and only within recent times the scheme was not only tolerated,\nbut employed as a convenient method of raising revenue for governmental, religious, charitable, and educational purposes.\nExperience, however, demonstrated that the practice was demoralizing in arousing and cultivating the *126 gambling instinct\ndormant in all human nature, was widespread, casting a baneful influence over entire communities, reaching persons of all ages\nand classes, entering every fireside, preying especially upon the meager means and earnings of the poor, attracting especially\nthe simple and ignorant, and leading at last to idleness, mendicancy, moral profligacy and debauchery. In view of its malign and\ndemoralizing influence, the lottery has been outlawed in probably every state in the Union, and all propaganda, with reference\nto such enterprises, has been banished from the mails and interstate commerce, by acts of Congress.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

They are to the effect that the Independent Service Station Association of Dallas sold to its members, including\nthe individual defendants, tickets in batches of 1,000 that were distributed by the dealers to their customers, one ticket, for every\ndollar's worth of merchandise purchased, that entitled the holder to a chance to win an automobile at a drawing to be held;\nthus is revealed all the essential elements of a lottery--that is, the prize, the chance distribution of same, and the consideration\npassing from the holder of the ticket.\n\n\nAppellees, however, do not seriously contend that the scheme above outlined was not a lottery within the meaning of the\nstatute, but by appropriate cross-assignments of error challenge the correctness of the findings of the trial court, to the effect\nthat defendants were operating under a lottery scheme at the time the restraining order was issued. Their contention is that the\nundisputed facts show that this scheme had been abandoned prior to the institution of the suit, and that the scheme, under which\nthey were then operating, was a perfectly legal and permissible procedure.\n\nThey insist that, under the plan as changed, instead of giving to customers a ticket for each one dollar's worth of merchandise\npurchased, defendants and other members of the association, for the purpose of advertising their business as independent oil and\ngas dealers, and to promote good will among customers, gave tickets that entitled the holder to a chance to draw an automobile,\nthat these tickets were given indiscriminately, to whomsoever they pleased, to customers and noncustomers as well; hence this\nnew scheme was lacking in one of the essential elements necessary to constitute a lottery, to wit, the consideration.\n [2] [3] We readily agree to the correctness of the proposition that, if tickets given by defendants and other members of the\nassociation were gifts, unsupported by a consideration moving from the ticket holder, were in fact gratuities pure and simple,\nthe lottery statute was not violated, for the evident reason that a person is at liberty to give away his property, by chance, at a\ndrawing to ticket holders, or in any other manner, without violating the law. But is the case at bar of that nature? We do not\nthink so for the following reasons: The change wrought as testified to by defendants was not a change in the scheme itself, but\nmerely in the procedure or method of executing the same.

On this point,\nC. M. Proctor, one of the defendants, testified:\n          “The purpose of this scheme is to draw business; to get all the business we can; to draw business from\n          our competitors. We have now changed our plan of operation. It was not because we were enjoined by\n          the court. We did not change our plan because of any court action. We do not intend to give any more\n          automobiles away under that plan. Our plan now is to give tickets to our various customers; to issue tickets\n          to whomsoever we see fit; if they come in to get water or gas; if we want to give them to our patrons,\n          and others. We threatened at this time to give a car away on May *127 24 (1928) by giving chances to\n          customers. * * * These tickets are to be given patrons and customers. Yes; we are going to give them to\n          our customers. * * * I take the tickets under the present plan, and, when the customers come in to buy\n          merchandise, I give them a ticket. I do not give every one a ticket. We give to those whom we see fit. We\n          give them whether they buy or not. One of the purposes is to advertise, and we give the tickets out as an\n          advertisement. Under this new plan we have a drawing, and the winning number gets the prize. That is the\n          plan we will attempt to use.”\n\n\n\n\nMr. R. E. Tomlinson, one of the defendants, after testifying that he and Messrs. Proctor and Haskins (also defendants) constituted\nthe committee that acted for the Independent Service Station Association in handling the matter of purchasing automobiles,\netc., said:\n          “Our intention is to enforce this new plan (the new plan of procedure); to make the men live up to it just\n          like they have to live up to the by-laws and constitution of the association. * * * The purpose of our entire\n          scheme is to draw business. It is an advertising proposition to take away business from others. That is the\n          whole proposition, like any other advertising, to get business. It has worked very satisfactorily. * * * I\n          haven't changed my mind that the purpose of advertising is getting good will for the independents, and that\n          a man would buy for the purpose of getting a chance. We have abandoned the other plan we had. Now\n          we have a new plan; we have a prize. The men buying the prize are members of the Independent Service\n          Station Association of Dallas. They sell tickets to the members of this association for money. They buy\n          these chance tickets from the committee for money, and the money goes into the general fund to buy the\n          prize, the car. The purpose of the scheme is to promote good will, but when the dealer pays for the tickets,\n          buys them, one of the purposes of it is to give the tickets away to the fellow that comes into the station.\n          That is one of the purposes. Then, when these dealers that buy these tickets give them away, they are all put\n          in a receptacle, and there is a drawing, and the ticket that is drawn gets the automobile. They draw seven\n          tickets. That is the scheme we intend to follow.”\n\n\n\nThis testimony fails to show any material change in the scheme as originally operated, but reveals a change simply in the plan\nof its operation. While dealers, under the new plan, distributed tickets to noncustomers as well as to customers, it seems that the\nscheme was to distribute tickets, in the main to customers, as the evidence discloses that only a few, negligible in number, were\ngiven to persons other than customers. That the giving of tickets, and the drawings and distribution of prizes, were inducements\nto patronage and unquestionably lured customers, is shown from the very satisfactory business results that followed. Patronage\nthus induced was the consideration that passed from the ticket holder for the chance received, in that the price paid, whatever it\nwas, the amount being immaterial, constituted the aggregate price for the merchandise or service and the ticket that represented\na chance to win the prize; in other words, for one undivided price both were purchased, the merchandise, or service, and ticket,\nthe ticket being as much bought as though priced separately.

The\ngeneral rule is that, except as conferred by statute, courts of equity have no criminal jurisdiction, and acts or omissions will not\nbe enjoined merely on the ground that they constitute violations of penal statutes.\n\n [5] Notwithstanding this is the general rule, it is also well settled that, when necessary to protect civil or property rights, equity\nwill interfere, and the fact that the commission of a statutory offense must be enjoined, as an incident to the giving of proper\nrelief, will not deprive the court of its jurisdiction in this respect.\n\n\nAn apt statement of the law on this point was made by Judge Neill in State v.

The injury threatened to such rights may, if committed,\n          constitute a crime, and subject its perpetrator to punishment under the criminal law; yet, as his punishment\n          would furnish him whose property or civil rights have been irreparably injured by the acts constituting\n          the offense no compensation for such injury, courts of equity will interfere to prevent such an injury,\n          notwithstanding the commission would constitute a criminal offense, not because it would be a crime, but\n          because the injury to such rights would be irreparable. It cannot be said that such interference by a court\n          of equity is an invasion of the domain of the criminal law, for no crime has been committed where equity\n          interposes its arm for the protection of property or civil rights. In extending such protection, it may prevent\n          a crime; but, as no one has a right to commit crime, no one should be heard to complain that he is restrained\n          from its commission, when such restraint has been exercised in the jurisdiction of a court for the purpose\n          of preventing him from *128 irreparably injuring another in his property or civil rights.”\n\n\n\nThis doctrine was approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in Re Debs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94238\"><a href=\"/opinion/94238/in-re-debs/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

R. 77.\n\nIn the case of Glover v. Malloska, supra, certain dealers sought to enjoin a competitor from executing a lottery scheme very\nsimilar to the one under consideration. Responding to the contention there made, that plaintiffs had no property rights involved\nthat a court of equity would protect, the court said:\n“Have plaintiffs property rights of a pecuniary nature here involved? It would astound the business world to hold that an\nestablished business is barren of property rights of a pecuniary nature. Merchants, and others engaged in business, feel that\nthey have property rights therein, and we must hold that an injury to such rights, through criminal acts, is an injury to property\nrights of a pecuniary nature.\n\n“No one should be permitted to employ criminal means in trade rivalry. The law proscribes a lottery, and those injured thereby\nin their rights of property are not required to suffer successive inflictions of pecuniary injury until a criminal prosecution is\nlaunched. Courts do not depart from the rule that equity may not interfere, except to protect property rights of a pecuniary\nnature, in enjoining criminal acts exercised by one dealer to enhance his sales to the calculated pecuniary injury of a lawabiding\ncompetitor. Defendant Malloska adopted the lottery scheme for profit, admits its employment increased his sales, and plaintiffs\nestablished the fact that such increase was directly traceable to their loss of customers.”\n\n [8] That plaintiff's business, in the case at bar, was interfered with and injured, as a direct result of the operation of the lottery\nscheme conducted by defendants, is shown by the undisputed facts and the unchallenged findings of the trial court.\n\n\nArticle 4642 (4643) (2989), R. S. 1925, authorizes the issuance of injunctions:\n          “(1) Where the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and such relief or any part thereof requires the\n          restraint of some act prejudicial to him.”\n\n\n\nIf we are correct in the conclusions announced above, plaintiff was and is entitled to have his business protected from unfair\ncompetition produced by the unlawful means employed by his competitors, and it seems that the only adequate remedy,\nappropriate and suited to the conditions with which we are dealing, is the restraint of the prejudicial acts of which plaintiff\ncomplains.\n\nPlaintiff cannot successfully combat this competition except on the plane where the contest for business has been pitched, and\nthis he cannot attempt, without himself becoming a violator of the law. The lottery scheme had been in operation eight or nine\nmonths at the time this suit was instituted, a number of drawings had taken place and prizes distributed thereunder, and, so far as\nthe record discloses, without any effort having been put forth for its suppression. The Independent Service Station Association\nof Dallas at that time had 86 members, operating 108 oil stations scattered over Dallas county, most of them located in the city\nof Dallas. In these circumstances, to invite plaintiff to seek relief from this unlawful competition by the institution of criminal\nprosecutions against the large number of individuals who are aiding and abetting the lottery, to assume the burdens and suffer\nthe loss of time that attention to the prosecutions *129 would require, is to invite him to attempt the accomplishment of an\nHerculean, if not impossible, task. If this is plaintiff's only relief from the conditions in which his business is enmeshed, the\nstatute, promising relief from prejudicial acts, is delusive, in holding out the word of promise to the ear only to disappoint the\nhope. The remedy, to be adequate, must be applied at the source of the evil, the association, the head and front of the offending,\nas well as the individual members sued, must be enjoined from further operations under the lottery scheme.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The Court of Appeals, Carroll, J., on rehearing held that: (1) issuance of temporary injunction to\nprevent foreclosure of property on basis that mortgagor had probable right of recovery was proper, and (2) setting of injunction\nbond at $10,000 was improper since $10,000 did not adequately protect savings and loan.\n\nAffirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part.\n\n\n\n West Headnotes (5)\n\n\n [1]     Injunction      Likelihood of success on merits\n         In hearing on application for temporary injunction, only question for trial court is whether applicant is entitled to\n         preservation of status quo pending trial on merits, and applicant need only demonstrate probable injury and probable\n         right of recovery and does not have to establish that he will finally prevail on merits.\n\n         7 Cases that cite this headnote\n\n\n [2]     Appeal and Error         Injunction\n         Injunction      Discretionary Nature of Remedy\n         Where pleadings and evidence present case of probable injury and probable right of recovery, trial court is clothed\n         with broad discretion in determining whether to issue temporary injunction, and its order will be reversed only on\n         showing of clear abuse of discretion.\n\n         1 Cases that cite this headnote\n\n\n [3]     Appeal and Error         Injunction\n         Standard of review of grant of temporary injunction is whether trial court abused its discretion, which occurs when\n         decision of trial court was arbitrary or unreasonable, in finding that there was probable injury and probable right of\n         recovery.\n\n         4 Cases that cite this headnote\n\n\n [4]     Mortgages       Restraining foreclosure in general\n         Issuance of temporary injunction to prevent foreclosure of property on basis that mortgagor had probable right of\n         recovery was proper; evidence in record, if believed, established at least one of mortgagor's causes of action.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellant owned a large tract of real property in Travis\nCounty known as Jourdan Crossing. Appellee Louis G. Reese, III, is an experienced and sophisticated real estate investor and\ndeveloper, and is the principal owner of appellee Louis G. Reese, Inc., a Texas corporation. In this opinion we will refer both\nto Reese individually and to his corporation jointly as “appellee.”\n\nThe parties agree that in the fall of 1985, appellant contracted to sell appellee the Jourdan Crossing property for some\n$45,000,000. While the parties agree on very little else, it is clear that the transaction ultimately closed.\n\nAppellee paid $10 million (borrowed from another savings and loan) as a down payment and executed a note to appellant for\nover $34 million. The market fell, development of the project stalled and appellee was unable to meet his obligations under the\n$34 million note. Appellant attempted to foreclose its deed of trust against the property, and appellee filed suit seeking both\ntemporary and permanent injunctive relief along with actual and exemplary damages and a declaratory judgment. Appellee\nbased its suit on claimed causes of action involving usury, breach of contract, real estate and common-law fraud, and conspiracy,\nas well as violations of the Federal Savings and Loan Tying Act and Savings and Loan Act.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The applicant need only demonstrate a probable injury\nand a probable right of recovery; he does not have to establish that he will finally prevail on the merits. Transport Co. of Texas,\net al. v.

Where the pleadings and evidence present a case\nof probable injury and probable right of recovery, the trial court is clothed with broad discretion in determining whether to\nissue a temporary injunction and its order will be reversed only on a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. Davis v. Huey,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443943\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443943/davis-v-huey/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex.1978).\n\n [3] This is not an appeal of the cause on the merits, and we are not to be understood as holding that appellee will ultimately\nprevail on any of the alleged causes of action. To the contrary, our standard of review of a grant of a temporary injunction is\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion in finding that there was a probable injury and a probable right of recovery. An abuse\nof discretion occurs when the decision of the trial court was arbitrary or unreasonable. Landry v. Traveler's Insurance Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1575107\"><a href=\"/opinion/1575107/landry-v-travelers-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1970). Since it is obvious that appellee would probably *16 be injured if the property were foreclosed and\nsold, the only question here is whether the trial court erred in determining there was a probable right of recovery.\n\n [4] The parties have not yet had the opportunity to present all their evidence on appellee's allegations. Until then, the probable\nright to recover is determinable only by what now appears in the record. And what now appears in the record is evidence that,\nwhile hotly disputed, if believed establishes at least one of appellee's causes of action. Point of error one is overruled.\n\nAppellant's second point of error challenges the trial court's setting of bond for the temporary injunction at $10,000. Texas\nR.Civ.P. 684 (Supp.1988) provides that in the order granting any temporary injunction, the court shall fix the amount of security\nto be given by the applicant. The rule then provides that the bond is to be conditioned “... that the applicant will abide the\ndecision ... in the cause, and that he will pay all sums of money and costs that may be adjudged against him if the ... temporary\ninjunction [is] dissolved ...” (emphasis added). The rule also provides that the discretion of the trial court in fixing the amount\nof the bond is subject to review. Neither Rule 684 nor the case law gives us much guidance in evaluating the sufficiency of\nthe bond here, but several courts have required bond amounts that, in relation to the value at stake in the action below, are\nproportionately far greater than the bond set in this case. See, e.g., Westside Airways, Inc. v. JR Aircraft Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1574293\"><a href=\"/opinion/1574293/westside-airways-inc-v-jr-aircraft-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Tex.App.1985, no writ); Lee v.

The property at issue is valued at between $25\nmillion and $50 million. The debt to appellant is some $34 million, and the unpaid interest on the debt has been accruing at the\nrate of about $300,000 each month; thus, the potential loss of interest alone over the life of the injunction (which took effect\nDecember 1, 1987) already exceeds $2 million. Furthermore, should appellant eventually prevail on the merits, it might sustain\nother losses resulting from its inability to develop the property during the term of the injunction. We think the trial court abused\nits discretion in failing to set bond at an amount adequate to protect appellant, and accordingly sustain the second point of error.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nWe affirm the district court's order granting the temporary injunction, but remand the cause to that court with instructions to\ndetermine what amount of security (which in any event should greatly exceed $10,000) will adequately protect appellant, and\nto set bond accordingly under Tex.R.Civ.P. 684.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

American counters that any suit brought against it attempting to apply standards to its AAdvantage® program would be\npre-empted as an attempt to place state regulations upon prices, routes, or services but that any attempt by it to enforce via state\nlaw its own standards as to prices, routes, or services, including frequent flyer mile credits, is not pre-empted as impermissible\nstate regulation. We agree with American.\n\nIn Morales, the Court considered the effect the advertising restrictions would have on airlines' fares, holding that the restrictions\nwould curtail the airlines' ability to communicate their fares to customers. Morales, 504 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 2039–40. But\nit also held that “ ‘[s]ome state actions may affect [airline fares] in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner’ to have pre-\nemptive effect.” Id. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 2040.\n\nThe Court further distinguished contract actions in Wolens, holding that the Act does not shelter airlines from suits “seeking\nrecovery solely for the airlines' alleged breach of its own self-imposed undertakings.” Wolens, 513 U.S. at 228, 115 S.Ct. at 824.\nAlthough concluding that the Act pre-empted AAdvantage® members' Illinois Consumer Fraud Act claims because mileage\ncredits are akin to “rates,” the Court nevertheless held that as to contracts affecting such mileage credits, “[m]arket efficiency\nrequires effective means to enforce private agreements.” Id. at 230, 115 S.Ct. at 824.\n\nAfter Morales and Wolens, courts have held that certain personal injury causes of actions against airlines are not pre-empted by\nthe Act. See, e.g., Hodges v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6122\"><a href=\"/opinion/6122/hodges-v-delta-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (5th Cir.1995); Continental Airlines v.

In explaining its decision in Kiefer, the Texas supreme court noted that, “as Wolens explains at some\nlength, claims are not [pre-empted] if they do not involve the enforcement of policy-laden state law that too closely approaches\na regulatory effect on airlines.” Kiefer, 920 S.W.2d at 283.\n\nHere, although American has brought mostly tort claims, those claims attempt to protect the vitality of its self-imposed\nobligations: those arising from the AAdvantage® program. American's invoking the benefits and protections of state law to\nprotect its own agreements does not have the same impermissible regulatory effect upon prices, routes, or services that Congress\nwas concerned with in enacting section 41713(b)(1). The Act was intended to pre-empt only those state actions having a\nregulatory effect upon the airlines rather than to preclude airlines from seeking the benefits and protections of state law to\nenforce their self-imposed standards, regulations, and contracts. See id. (“[T]he purpose of ADA preemption is not to absolve\nairlines from all liability under state law, but to prohibit state regulation of air carriers, direct or indirect. Congress' concern\n *222 was ‘that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.’ ”); see also Hodges, 44 F.3d at\n337 (“Following deregulation, the CAB's [the former Civil Aeronautics Board's] statements implementing the ADA strongly\nsupport the view that the ADA was concerned solely with economic deregulation, not with displacing state tort law.”). Indeed,\ndenying American access to state courts for such purposes would seem to have such an impermissible regulatory effect.\n\nAppellants contend that it is unfair to allow the airlines unfettered access to the state courts to enforce their own standards\nrelated to frequent flyer programs while denying access to the state courts to the states themselves and other parties attempting\nto impose standards on the airlines under state law. But the fairness of this application is not for us to decide; we must abide\nby Congress's intentions when determining whether a suit is pre-empted by the Act. See Morales, 504 U.S. at 383, 112 S.Ct.\nat 2036 (noting that in determining whether a suit is pre-empted under the Act, the question is one of statutory intent, and we\nmust “begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately\nexpresses the legislative purpose”).\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The attorney told George that those domain\nnames constituted trademark infringement and that American wanted them back. George told the attorney that the domain\nnames were connected to frequentflyerdepot.com, and he agreed to give them to American. Although George testified that\nthe attorney did not tell him to stop operating frequentflyerdepot.com, he also admitted that he could not recall whether they\nhad talked about Frequent Flyer's brokerage business. He also said that the lawyer never told him that American would permit\nFrequent Flyer to sell AAdvantage® miles.\n\nSince 2005, American has stopped travel on tickets sold by Frequent Flyer by freezing the accounts of AAdvantage® members\nwho American discovers have improperly sold their rewards points to a third party. But George Pirkle admitted that American\nsuccessfully discovers and *223 stops travel on Frequent Flyer's transactions only between about three and four to ten percent\nof the time. American's representative testified that these “policing” efforts are disruptive, causing operational difficulties for\nAmerican and diverting resources away from legitimate ticketing.\n\n\nWhen American deposed George Pirkle as the designated representative of Frequent Flyer, 1 he admitted that Frequent Flyer\n“brokers” AAdvantage® rewards points; in other words, Frequent Flyer buys rewards points from AAdvantage® members\nand sells those points to third parties. He agreed that American had asked Frequent Flyer to stop doing so “earlier this year\n[2008],” and he confirmed that Frequent Flyer had refused. American sought the temporary injunction hearing shortly after\ntaking appellants' depositions.\n\n\n [12] If, as American claims, appellants' activities are in violation of its agreements with AAdvantage® members, 2 the last\npeaceable, noncontested status is for appellants to refrain from selling AAdvantage® rewards points. There is no evidence that\nAmerican knew of Frequent Flyer's brokering activities in 2002 when its attorney contacted George Pirkle about the domain\nnames; as George himself testified, he bought around 136 domain names when he started. Likewise, there is no evidence that\nAmerican knew in 2005 and later that the AAdvantage® accounts it was freezing for the improper sale of rewards points were\nsold through Frequent Flyer in particular. 3 Even so, it is a reasonable inference that American could not have known the\nfull extent of Frequent Flyer's activities, considering George's testimony that Frequent Flyer transactions were “caught” only\nbetween three to ten percent of the time.\n\nAmerican moved for a temporary injunction when it learned the full extent of Frequent Flyer's activities and Frequent Flyer\nrefused to discontinue those activities even in the face of American's suit.

Any such\nmileage or tickets are void if transferred for cash or other consideration.” The User Agreement also contains other provisions\nallowing American to change the terms of the AAdvantage® program, upon which appellants base their claim that the User\nAgreement lacks mutuality and is, therefore, unenforceable. Specifically, the User Agreement states that American may,\n\n            in its discretion, change the AAdvantage® program rules, regulations, travel awards, and special offers\n            at any time with or without notice.... American Airlines may make one or more of [certain enumerated]\n            changes at any time even though such changes may affect your ability to use the mileage credit or\n            awards that you have already accumulated. American Airlines reserves the right to end the AAdvantage®\n            program with six months notice. 4\n\n\nAccording to appellants, this clause shows a fatal lack of mutuality, rendering the entire agreement unenforceable.\n\n [13] [14] [15] [16] A bilateral contract is one in which there are mutual promises between two parties to the contract, each\nbeing both a promisor and a promisee.

However, that does not mean American is without obligation to its\nmembers under the User Agreements. In consideration for AAdvantage® members' purchasing paid travel on American and\nits partner airlines, and purchasing other services from specified providers, American agrees to provide rewards points to those\ncustomers. It is nonsensical for appellants to argue that no enforceable agreement exists when their entire business depends on\nthe enforceability of that agreement. In other words, if American has no obligation to issue a ticket in exchange for rewards\npoints when an AAdvantage® member fully complies with the User Agreement, appellants are ill-positioned to complain about\nthe trial court's enjoining their activities, which depend on American's complying with its obligation even when a ticket is\nobtained in violation of the applicable User Agreement. Appellants cannot have it both ways.\n\nAdditionally, as appellants point out in their brief, American's misappropriation claim “as alleged requires a showing that\n[appellants] ‘wrongfully[ ]obtained award tickets.’ ” The key word here is “obtained,” in the past tense. It is undisputed that\nAmerican has issued tickets in exchange for rewards points purchased through Frequent Flyer. With regard to those tickets,\nthen, American has performed under the applicable User Agreements. Thus, even if American's consideration was illusory when\nit entered into the applicable User Agreements, its subsequent performance under those agreements established consideration,\nrendering those agreements enforceable. See Hutchings, 174 S.W.2d at 489; Cherokee Commc'ns, 893 S.W.2d at 316.\n\nThe same holds true for tickets that American will issue in exchange for rewards points in the future. If American does not issue\nany such tickets, then the question of whether American can enforce the no-sale rule is moot. But if American does issue tickets\nin exchange for rewards points acquired through purchase or barter—then it will again have partially performed under the User\nAgreements at issue, thus establishing the necessary consideration to render those agreements enforceable. See Hutchings, 174\nS.W.2d at 489; Cherokee Commc'ns, 893 S.W.2d at 316. 5\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude and hold that American's AAdvantage® User Agreements do not fail for lack of mutuality, and\nwe overrule appellants' third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                       *226 Continuance\n\nIn their fourth issue, appellants claim that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to continue the temporary injunction\nhearing.\n\n [23] Appellants moved for a continuance both before and after the temporary injunction hearing on the ground that American\nhad refused to produce documents in response to appellants' Third Request for Production. Appellants requested these\ndocuments in conjunction with their counterclaims against American for interference with contractual and business relations,\ntortious interference with prospective relations, a declaratory judgment that appellants' actions in purchasing and selling\nAAdvantage® rewards points are not improper, violations of the Texas Free Enterprise Act, violations of the DTPA, and\ninjunctive relief. In particular, appellants claimed they needed additional discovery on their antitrust claims, their equitable\ndefenses, and whether American had an adequate remedy at law. The gist of appellants' counterclaims is that American is a\ncompetitor and is unlawfully attempting to restrict their ability to maintain a competing business.\n\nAppellants' complaint fails initially because they failed to support their written motion for continuance with an affidavit as\nrequired by rule 251.

American also\nalleged that it lost goodwill with AAdvantage® members in that those members were prevented from using their AAdvantage®\nrewards points because seats were occupied by persons using the void tickets. Appellants contend that American “offered no\nevidence of any identified passenger, actual or potential, who suffered any aspect *227 of [American's] litany of claimed\ninjuries.”\n\n [25] [26] A party proves irreparable injury for injunction purposes by proving that damages would not adequately compensate\nthe party or cannot be measured by any certain pecuniary standard. Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d at 204; Fox, 121 S.W.3d at 857.\nAn injunction is not proper when the claimed injury is merely speculative, however; fear and apprehension of injury are not\nsufficient to support a temporary injunction.

Balsom further stated that dealing with these types of transactions causes “operational difficulties or\nissues.”\n\nRegarding displacement, Balsom testified that when Frequent Flyer sells an AAdvantage® member's rewards points to a third\nparty, that third party displaces a customer “who would either pay cash for that ticket or ... who would redeem AAdvantage®\nmiles for the seat.” He said it also “does use resources through [American's] reservations office [and] potentially AA.com for\nother business purposes” instead of valid ticket sales.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It also points to statements in those reports to the effect that, with respect to the AAdvantage®\nprogram, AMR “believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given the Company's load factors, its ability to manage\nfrequent flyer inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total passengers boarded.” According to appellants,\nabsent evidence from specific flights on which displacement occurred, American cannot overcome this evidence of empty seats\non its flights.\n\nThe SEC filings do not give information for specific flights; indeed, the vacancies in paying seats may be higher due to higher\nnumbers of business travelers paying a lower price for rewards points tickets through Frequent Flyer than paying for typical\nfull-fare seats. 6 And the isolated *228 statement that displacement is minimal is clearly in relation to the function of the\nprogram according to its guidelines; in other words, passenger displacement is minimal when the program is operating without\noutside influences.\n\nAmerican points to additional evidence as supporting the proof of injury requirement, such as the fact that it is virtually\nimpossible to police appellants' actions (when American discovers a void ticket, Frequent Flyer simply buys more miles and\nissues a new one), that American has to devote resources to investigating and policing appellants' actions that disrupt its\noperation and divert its resources from legitimate customers, and the unobjected-to evidence that American's inability to police\nactivities such as Frequent Flyer's causes AAdvantage® members to question its ability to effectively run the program.\n\n [28] Disruption to a business can be irreparable harm.

Here, we have already discussed the lack of evidence\nthat American knew or should have known of appellants' activities when its lawyer contacted George Pirkle in 2002 about the\ndomain names. In addition, we have also pointed to the evidence that Frequent Flyer purposefully concealed its dealings from\nAmerican and instructed AAdvantage® members to do the same. Accordingly, we do not believe that the evidence shows that\nAmerican deliberately slumbered on its rights with regard to appellants' conduct.\n\nMoreover, there was evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that appellants failed to show prejudice; the\ntrial court elicited testimony from George that Frequent Flyer's expansion also had to do with increased trade in other airlines'\nfrequent flyer miles. George also testified that he had been aware of American's no-sale provision since at least 2005 because\nAmerican had stopped travel on tickets bought with rewards points sold by Frequent Flyer before that time. Accordingly, we\nconclude and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting appellants' claim of laches.\n\n [35] Appellants contend that American has unclean hands because “the evidence *230 shows that [American] is part of an\nillegal conspiracy with regard to the antitrust laws of the United States and the State of Texas.” According to appellants, the\ntemporary injunction prevents (and American's suit seeks to prevent) them from competing with American. Appellants also\nclaim that American must do equity to obtain equity and that American has failed to do so by authorizing Points.com and\nits airline partners to trade with members for AAdvantage® rewards points. This argument appears to incorporate appellants'\nantitrust and anticompetition claims. But as we have already held, an otherwise proper injunction will not be rendered improper\nby claims that such an injunction would have a preclusive effect on competition. See Sharma, 231 S.W.3d at 429. Thus, we\nconclude and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting appellants' equitable defenses.\n\nWe overrule appellants' seventh issue.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The market for these flights is divided between consumers whose volume of purchases is relatively insensitive to\n           price (primarily business travelers) and consumers whose demand is very price sensitive indeed (primarily pleasure travelers).\n           Accordingly, airlines try to sell as many seats per flight as possible at higher prices to the first group, and then to fill up the flight\n           by selling seats at much lower prices to the second group (since almost all the costs are fixed, even a passenger paying far below\n           average cost is preferable to an empty seat). In order for this marketing process to work, and for it ultimately to redound to the\n           benefit of price-conscious travelers, the airlines must be able to place substantial restrictions on the availability of the lower priced\n           seats (so as to sell as many seats as possible at the higher rate), and must be able to advertise the lower fares.\n           504 U.S. at 389, 112 S.Ct. at 2040.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

George Hilton, TransDel's vice-president, board member, and majority stockholder, filed this\nshareholder's derivative suit, alleging that Jenkins violated his fiduciary duties by attempting to acquire TransDel's assets and\ndivert its business to All About Freight Services, Inc., Jenkins's new corporation. TransDel requested a temporary injunction\nbarring Jenkins from interfering with TransDel's business, contacting TransDel's customers, or attempting to collect any funds\nowed to TransDel.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court granted TransDel's request and enjoined Jenkins from interfering with Hilton's management\nand operation of TransDel, withholding TransDel's assets, contacting TransDel's customers, or attempting to divert TransDel's\nbusiness in any way. Jenkins was ordered to return a truck to Hilton and give him information stored in TransDel's computer.\nJenkins was allowed to contact TransDel customers that were also All About Freight customers for purposes of collecting\nbalances due to All About Freight. The trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law related to the temporary injunction.\nIn this accelerated interlocutory appeal, Jenkins contends that TransDel did not establish (1) a probable right of recovery or\n(2) interim injury without an adequate remedy at law, and that the injunction (3) does not maintain the status quo, (4) violates\nrule 683 of the rules of civil procedure, (5) is overbroad, and (6) amounts to a prior restraint on Jenkins's constitutional right\nto free speech. We affirm the trial court's order.\n\n\n\n                                                       Standard of Review\n\nA temporary injunction is intended to preserve the status quo pending a trial on the merits.

In 2003, TransDel owed money to the Internal Revenue\nService and was behind in rent payments. Relations between Hilton and Jenkins soured, apparently having to do at least in part\nwith Hilton's decision as majority shareholder to fire Jenkins's wife, who was working part-time for TransDel. In late August\n2003, Jenkins prepared a letter resigning as president of TransDel and stating that he would remain only as an employee; the\nparties disagree about when Hilton saw that letter and whether he believed Jenkins was still acting as president of TransDel\nduring the fall of 2003. TransDel alleged that Jenkins developed a plan that he represented would help TransDel pay its past\ndue rent; under the plan, All About Freight would assume the lease and TransDel would sublease the premises from All About\nFreight. In September 2003, a truck belonging to TransDel was transferred into Jenkins's name. Hilton believed the transfer was\ndone to get a loan for a final balloon payment on the truck and thought that the truck still belonged to TransDel. Jenkins testified\nthat the truck was transferred to him because he took out a personal loan to provide $4,000 for the truck. He also testified that\nTransDel paid $7,300 to buy the truck and made the payments on the $4,000 loan that Jenkins took out for the remaining balance.\n\nIn October 2003, Jenkins and Hilton signed an agreement that stated that Jenkins was starting All About Freight in the same line\nof business as TransDel (“the Agreement”). The Agreement further stated that TransDel waived any fiduciary duty owed it by\nJenkins. Hilton testified that he did not read the entire document but instead relied on Jenkins's representations about what the\nAgreement entailed because he trusted Jenkins after their years of working together. Jenkins also drafted a proposal stating that\nAll About Freight was taking over TransDel's business accounts; Hilton testified that he first saw this document in November\n2003, when Jenkins left it behind in a vehicle he had driven. Jenkins then wrote a letter to TransDel's customers on letterhead\nlisting both TransDel's and All About Freight's names, signing as “President.” The letter stated that TransDel was revamping\nits structure and changing its name and asked the customers to send payments to All About Freight's post office box, while all\nother correspondence should continue to be sent to TransDel's address. Hilton discovered this when a letter was returned to\nTransDel as undeliverable. TransDel alleged that Jenkins misrepresented that his plans would help clear up TransDel's debts,\nwhen in fact Jenkins was diverting business to his new company.\n\n\n\n                                                            Discussion\n\n [1] [2] In his first issue, Jenkins contends that TransDel failed to establish a probable right to recovery, arguing that Hilton\nsigned the Agreement and therefore should be bound by its terms, which included a waiver of any fiduciary duty owed by\nJenkins to TransDel. However, although Jenkins argues that Hilton should be bound by the Agreement, there was testimony\nthat Hilton did not know the full substance and import of the document when he signed it and that he signed it in reliance on\nmisrepresentations by Jenkins and in light of a long history of working together and trusting Jenkins's word. 2 Jenkins urges\nthat the agreement is valid “as long as this Court does not hold that JENKINS' conduct of contacting TRANSDEL customers on\nbehalf of [All About Freight] does not constitute self-dealing, bad faith, an intentional adverse act, or an act made with reckless\nindifference.”However, in reviewing the grant of temporary injunctive relief, we view the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the trial court's decision. There was testimony that Hilton was misled into signing the Agreement and that Jenkins did contact\nTransDel's customers in bad faith, seeking to lure TransDel's customers to All About Freight. We make no holding on the merits\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              4\n\fJenkins v.

Such a decision is not before us in this appeal. Based on the record before us and viewing\nthe testimony in the light most favorable to the trial court's decision, we cannot hold it was an abuse of discretion for the trial\ncourt to find that TransDel had demonstrated a probable right of recovery. We overrule Jenkins's first issue on appeal.\n\n *3 [3] Jenkins next contends that TransDel failed to establish a probable injury in the interim with no adequate remedy by\nlaw, noting that the trial court did not in its order expressly find imminent or irreparable harm or inadequate remedy. However,\nthere was evidence that All About Freight was interfering with TransDel's business relationships and attempting to acquire\nTransDel's customers. Jenkins's letter to TransDel's customers stated that TransDel was reorganizing and changing its name\nand asked that payments be sent to All About Freight. This can be interpreted as some evidence that Jenkins was attempting to\nacquire TransDel's customers under false pretenses, and the trial court could have concluded that such behavior could result in\nimminent and irreparable harm of a kind that would not be fairly compensable following trial.

Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that\nTransDel established a probable injury in the interim with no adequate remedy at law. We overrule Jenkins's second issue.\n\n [4] In his third issue, Jenkins contends that the injunction does not maintain the status quo. Status quo is the “ ‘last, actual,\npeaceable, noncontested’ “ state of affairs preceding the controversy. Universal Health, 24 S.W.3d at 577 (quoting Transport\nCo. of Tex. v. Robertson Transports, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1508656\"><a href=\"/opinion/1508656/transport-co-of-texas-v-robertson-transports/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553–54 (Tex.1953)). If one party's act changes\nthe relationship between him and another, and the other party contests that action, the status quo to be maintained is not the\nrelationship as it existed after the act, but rather is the state of things as they were before the controversy arose.

Guerra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1531210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1531210/benavides-ind-school-dist-v-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1984, writ ref'd n.r.e.)). Jenkins asserts that\nthe last uncontested situation was in November 2003, just before Hilton realized that Jenkins was trying to acquire TransDel's\ncustomers. Up until then, Jenkins asserts, the parties were operating peaceably under the Agreement, and by that time All\nAbout Freight had already contacted and perhaps acquired some of TransDel's customers. However, as discussed earlier,\nHilton asserted that he signed the Agreement due to Jenkins's misrepresentations. The trial court could have found that the\nlast uncontested status was prior to the fall of 2003, Jenkins's purported resignation of his presidency, and his establishment\nof All About Freight. We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in making such a finding. We overrule Jenkins's\nthird issue.\n\nIn his fourth issue, Jenkins contends that the injunction violates rule 683 of the rules of civil procedure because it does not explain\nhow TransDel's right to recover will be harmed if Jenkins is not enjoined from contacting its customers and does not specify\nwhat imminent injury may occur. Jenkins argues that because he is no longer TransDel's officer or director, his competition\nviolates no fiduciary duty and cannot endanger TransDel's right to recover.\n\n *4 [5] An order granting a temporary injunction must set forth the reasons for its issuance and describe in “reasonable detail”\nthe acts to be restrained. Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. The trial court's order states that Jenkins was at all relevant times a TransDel board\nmember, diverted business to All About Freight in violation of his fiduciary duty to TransDel, and took possession of TransDel's\nproperty. Jenkins was enjoined from (1) interfering with Hilton's operation of TransDel by withholding TransDel's assets and\n(2) contacting TransDel's customers or trying to divert its business to All About Freight. Jenkins was allowed to contact All\nAbout Freight customers that are “coincidentally” TransDel customers for the purpose of collecting outstanding balances due\nAll About Freight. Jenkins was also ordered to return certain property to TransDel.\n\nRule 683 does not mandate that an order set out each and every element that must be shown by a party seeking a temporary\ninjunction . 3 Instead, it requires a trial court to set out with reasonable specificity and detail the reasons for the injunction and\nthe acts to be enjoined. See Transport Co., 261 S.W.2d at 552–53 (rule 683 does not require order to state specifically why\napplicant will probably prevail on final trial, only why probable right to recover will be endangered without injunction; enjoined\nparty may seek findings of fact and conclusions of law). This order does precisely that. The trial court explained what Jenkins\nhad done and explained what he was forbidden to do in the future. Those statements sufficiently describe the situation and how\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We hold that the order complied with the requirements of rule\n683 and overrule Jenkins's fourth issue.\n\nFinally, in his fifth and sixth issues, Jenkins argues that the injunction is overbroad and amounts to a prior restraint on his\nconstitutional rights to free speech. Jenkins again urges that because he is no longer a TransDel director or officer, he owes\nTransDel no fiduciary duty and should have the right to seek customers for All About Freight. However, under this argument, as\nsoon as a corporate officer resigned from his company, he could use any information or asset he acquired in trust from his former\ncompany in direct competition against it and to acquire its customers and business, even using misrepresentations to do so.\n\n [6] TransDel argues that All About Freight was established and began to acquire customers under false pretenses and in\nderogation of Jenkins's fiduciary duties. Jenkins wrote to TransDel's customers that TransDel was reorganizing, including\na name change, and that all payments should in the future be sent to All About Freight. It is conceivable that TransDel's\ncustomers could be confused and believe that All About Freight was TransDel's new name, not realizing it was in fact TransDel's\ncompetitor. It is not overly restrictive to order Jenkins to refrain from trying to acquire TransDel's customers while this lawsuit\nis pending.\n\n *5 [7] Nor does this amount to an impermissible prior restraint on free speech.

We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n\n\n                                                                 I.\n\n\n                                                      Factual Background\n\nRutherford is a real estate developer who purchased twenty-seven of the fifty-four lots in Section 6 in the Terramar Beach\nsubdivision on Galveston Island for $1.8 million. The lots Rutherford purchased in Section 6 were subject to deed restrictions\nrequiring, among other things, that all buildings be set back ten feet from the property side lines and that no building shall\nbe erected until the Terramar Beach Association Architectural Control Committee had approved the construction plans. It is\nuncontroverted that Rutherford knew of these restrictions and failed to follow them.\n\nOn January 10, 1998, two days prior to commencing construction, Rutherford attended a general Terramar Association meeting\nand introduced himself and his plans for development to the association. *848 Although he did not have the required\nspecifications, he told the group about his plans, and also told them he was not required to follow the deed restrictions in his\nsection because “it states in the deed restriction that 100% of the property owners on that section right there can really do\nwhatever they want to do. We can voluntarily withdraw from the ceremony.” Based on these representations, the committee\napproved Rutherford's plans for two homes (Lots 8 and 9) that violated the setback restriction; however, the committee did not\napprove the construction plans for a third home (Lot 7) that violated the restriction. Rutherford's construction of this third home\nand his proposed construction of other homes in the subdivision form the basis of this suit.\n\n\n\n                                                                II.\n\n\n                                                       Procedural History\n\nOn January 20, 1998, ten days after the association meeting, the Architectural Control Committee chairman, Gordon Hopkins,\ntold Sherman Eagleton, Rutherford's foreman, that the plans for Lot 7 would have to comply with the setback restriction. On\nFebruary 5, 1998, the association's legal counsel wrote to Rutherford, reminding him that the lots were still subject to the setback\nrequirements and that he needed approval by the Architectural Control Committee before beginning construction. Following\nthese encounters, Rutherford contacted his attorney and refused to halt construction. Therefore, on February 18, 1998, Terramar\nfiled suit in district court seeking temporary and permanent injunctions to enforce the deed restrictions. Rutherford answered,\ncounterclaiming based on wrongful injunction and asserting the affirmative defenses of waiver, laches, estoppel, and fraud.\nRutherford also sought his own injunction against Terramar to “keep it from interfering in the construction of the remaining\nresidential homes in the development.”\n\nThe district court granted Terramar's motion for temporary injunction, finding it likely that Terramar would prevail in its suit\nfor a permanent injunction. Terramar then moved for summary judgment as to all of its claims against Rutherford, Rutherford's\naffirmative defenses, Rutherford's counterclaim, and its own reasonable attorney's fees. The trial court partly granted Terramar's\nmotion, permanently enjoining Rutherford from further violations of the subdivision's deed restrictions, denying Rutherford's\ncounterclaim, and rejecting Rutherford's affirmative defenses. The trial court, however, denied Terramar's summary judgment\nmotion for recovery of attorney's fees. On appeal, Rutherford challenges the trial court's grant of Terramar's summary judgment,\nand Terramar contests the trial court's denial of its attorney's fees.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Standards of Review\n [1] The grant or refusal of a permanent or temporary injunction is ordinarily within the trial court's sound discretion, and on\nappeal, review of the trial court's action is limited to the question of whether the action constituted a clear abuse of discretion.\nSee Priest v. Texas Animal Health Com'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2412901\"><a href=\"/opinion/2412901/priest-v-texas-animal-health-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1989, no writ). However, where the facts\nconclusively show that a party is violating the substantive law, the trial court should enjoin the violation, and in such case, there\nis no discretion to be exercised. See id. at 876.\n\nThe standard of review becomes more complex when the permanent injunction is issued by the trial court's grant of a motion for\nsummary judgment. A trial court may render summary judgment only if the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nSee Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c); *849 see also Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1782385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1782385/nixon-v-mr-property-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548–49 (Tex.1985). In\ndeciding whether there is a disputed material fact issue precluding summary judgment, we indulge every reasonable inference\nin favor of the non-movant and resolve any doubts in his favor. See O'Bryant v. Century 21 South Central States, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1506705\"><a href=\"/opinion/1506705/obryant-v-century-21-so-cent-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 271 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, no writ). If the movant's motion and summary judgment proof facially\nestablish his right to judgment as a matter of law, then the burden shifts to the non-movant to raise fact issues precluding\nsummary judgment. See City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1571353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1571353/city-of-houston-v-clear-creek-basin-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (Tex.1979). Moreover, if the non-\nmovant relies on an affirmative defense to defeat summary judgment, he must present summary judgment proof sufficient to\nraise a fact issue as to each element of that defense. See Brownlee v. Brownlee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1505453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1505453/brownlee-v-brownlee/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (Tex.1984). With both\nstandards of review in mind, we turn to the propriety of the trial court's issuance of the permanent injunction.\n\n\nB. Permanent Injunction Elements\n [2] [3] [4] On appeal, Rutherford complains the trial court erred in permanently enjoining his construction because Terramar\nhas not demonstrated his violations of the deed restrictions will cause irreparable injury. Ordinarily, injunctive relief may only\nbe granted upon a showing of (1) the existence of a wrongful act; (2) the existence of imminent harm; (3) the existence of\nirreparable injury; and (4) the absence of an adequate remedy at law. See Priest, 780 S.W.2d at 875. However, when the basis of\nthe suit is enforcement of deed restrictions, the elements differ slightly. In Munson v. Milton, the court held “a movant seeking\na temporary injunction to enforce a restrictive covenant is not required to show proof of irreparable injury.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1711540\"><a href=\"/opinion/1711540/munson-v-milton/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n815 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1997, pet. denied). Instead, the movant is only required to prove that the defendant intends to\ndo an act that would breach the restrictive covenant. See id. Although Munson involved a temporary rather than a permanent\ninjunction, we believe the rule applied in Munson also applies here. See Tien Tao Ass'n v. Kingsbridge Park Community Ass'n,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518749/tien-tao-assn-inc-v-kingsbridge-park-community-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529–530 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist] 1997, no pet.)

It is\nundisputed that Rutherford purchased the lots with full knowledge of the setback and prior approval of building specifications\ndeed restrictions. Because he purchased the property with knowledge of the recorded deed restrictions and then promptly\nviolated the restrictions, the additional burden should not be upon Terramar to demonstrate irreparable injury.

Application of Law to Facts\n [5] The trial court's issuance of a permanent injunction was proper. First, Terramar's summary judgment proof demonstrates\nRutherford substantially breached the setback and prior approval of building specifications deed restrictions. Rutherford\nadmitted he never received approval for the setback violations for Lot 7. Further, the record clearly demonstrates the home\nRutherford built on Lot 7 has side *850 setback lines seven and one-half feet from the edges of the lot, thereby violating the\nten foot setback restriction by two and one-half feet. The record also demonstrates that when asked to stop construction on Lot 7\nbecause of deed restriction violations, Rutherford did not stop. Instead, he contacted his attorney and sought his own injunction\nto enjoin Terramar from impeding his construction in the future. Moreover, Terramar submitted evidence that demonstrates\nRutherford's activities were considered substantial breaches of the deed restrictions by homeowners and board members. See\nTien Tao, 953 S.W.2d at 531 (noting association's perception of the violation as “substantial” constituted evidence of substantial\nbreach).\n\nSecond, a balance of the equities demonstrates that those favoring Terramar significantly outweigh any equities favoring\nRutherford. See Beere v. Duren, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2457051\"><a href=\"/opinion/2457051/beere-v-duren/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (Tex.App.—Beaumont 1999, pet. denied) (citing rule from Cowling\nv.

As discussed, Rutherford purchased the property with knowledge of the restrictions. At the meeting,\nhe represented he did not have to follow the deed restrictions. Finally, when informed his property was subject to the deed\nrestrictions, he refused to halt construction and sought an injunction to keep Terramar at bay. By contrast, Terramar consulted its\nlegal counsel following the meeting and repeatedly informed Rutherford he needed to comply with the existing deed restrictions.\nFurther, when it became apparent Rutherford would not willingly comply, Terramar instituted legal action to force him into\ncompliance with the deed restrictions. Thus, the equities of enforcing the deed restrictions favor Terramar.\n\nBased on this evidence, Terramar conclusively proved its entitlement to summary judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by permanently enjoining Rutherford from violating the Terramar Beach deed restrictions.\n\n\n\n                                                               IV.\n\n\n                                                     Affirmative Defenses\n\nOn appeal, Rutherford also challenges the trial court's grant of Terramar's motion for summary judgment based on his affirmative\ndefenses. Rutherford insists there are fact issues to be resolved concerning three of his asserted defenses: waiver, estoppel, and\nlaches. 1 Because Terramar moved for a Rule 166a(i) no-evidence summary judgment as to Rutherford's affirmative defenses,\nwe will review the trial court's grant as we would a directed verdict.

City of Houston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437652\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437652/new-jerusalem-baptist-church-inc-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 669 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1980).\nAmong the factors to be considered by the “average man” are the number, nature, and severity of the then existing violations,\nany prior acts of enforcement of the restriction, and whether it is still possible to realize to a substantial degree the benefits\nintended through the covenant. See id.\n\n [9] First, Rutherford argues that Terramar waived its setback deed restriction as to Lot 7 when it approved his five foot setbacks\non Lots 8 and 9. Based on his assertions, our inquiry is whether an average person could reasonably conclude that based on\nthe prior approvals, Terramar had abandoned its setback and approval restrictions. However, Rutherford admitted that although\nTerramar approved Lots 8 and 9, he knew Terramar did not approve the Lot 7 setback violation. In fact, Rutherford admitted\nhe did not submit the required specifications in order to obtain approval for Lot 7. Further, within ten days of the association\nmeeting, Rutherford was on notice that Terramar would not allow his violation of either the approval or setback restrictions\nas to Lot 7. 2\n\n[10]    Second, Rutherford claims Terramar waived its setback restriction because four other homes in Section 6 of the\nsubdivision violate the deed restrictions. 3 However, the deed restrictions in question contain a severability clause, stating “[t]he\ninvalidity, violation, abandonment or waiver of any one or more of or any part of the Restrictions shall in no wise affect or\nimpair the remaining Restrictions or parts therof which shall remain in full force and effect.” Therefore, we will not consider the\nalleged waiver of deed restrictions other than side setback violations in our analysis of the setback restriction. See Tanglewood\nHomes Ass'n v. Henke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2370387\"><a href=\"/opinion/2370387/tanglewood-homes-assn-inc-v-henke/\"><span class=\"volume\">728</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41–42 (Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Thus, the only support\nfor Rutherford's waiver argument is the evidence of one other setback violation in Section 6.\n\nIn Tanglewood, the court was faced with five violations of a certain deed restriction which the appellees, in violation of that\nrestriction, argued was abandoned. The court adverted to this court's analysis of the issue of waiver of deed restrictions in *852\nNew Jerusalem Baptist Church, 598 S.W.2d at 669. This court in New Jerusalem stated that to establish the affirmative defense\nof waiver in a deed restriction case, the non-conforming user must prove that the violations then existing are so great as to lead\nthe average man to conclude the restriction in question had been abandoned and its enforcement waived. See id. Among the\nfactors to be considered by the average man are the number, nature, and severity of the then existing violations, any prior acts\nof enforcement, and whether it is still possible to realize the benefits intended through the covenant. See id.\n\n [11] In New Jerusalem this court held that four non-conforming uses within the subdivision did not constitute abandonment\nof the restrictions. See id. Similarly, in Tanglewood, the court held that five violations of the main residence restriction were\ninsufficient in number, nature and severity to constitute a waiver of the restrictive covenant's benefits. See Tanglewood, 728\nS.W.2d at 44. Here, because Rutherford points to only one violation of the side setback restriction, we hold that one violation is\nnot so great as to lead the mind of the average man to reasonably conclude that the restriction in question had been abandoned\nand its enforcement waived. See New Jerusalem, 598 S.W.2d at 669.\n\n\nB. Estoppel\nEstoppel has been defined as follows:\n\n             the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in\n             equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of property, of contract,\n             or of remedy, as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been\n             led thereby to change his position for the worse, and who on his part acquires some corresponding right,\n             either of property, of contract, or of remedy.\n\n\n [12] Finkelstein, 675 S.W.2d at 278. Estoppel does not apply in this case primarily because Rutherford presented no evidence\nthat he changed his position regarding the setback violations on Lot 7 based on Terramar's conduct.\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

His plans demonstrated a violation\nof the setback restriction at the time of the meeting and at all times thereafter. Thus, Rutherford cannot demonstrate he changed\nposition in reliance on Terramar's actions when his position, the violation of the setback restrictions, never changed. Having\nfailed to present more than a scintilla of probative evidence as to each element of estoppel, Rutherford may not rely on this\naffirmative defense. We now address Rutherford's final defense, laches.\n\n\nC. Laches\n [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Laches, like waiver and estoppel, is an affirmative defense, 4 which Rutherford had the\nburden to prove. See Caldwell v. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428612\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428612/caldwell-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (Tex.1998); see also City of Houston v.

The two elements of laches are: (1) an unreasonable delay in asserting a\nlegal or equitable right; and (2) a good faith change of position by Rutherford to his detriment in reliance upon the delay. See\nMuse, 788 S.W.2d at 422. When a party takes no steps to enforce its known rights until the other party has, in good faith, so\nchanged its position that it cannot be restored to its former state, the delay becomes inequitable and may estop the assertion of\nthe right. See Id., see also Culver v. Pickens, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170–71 (1943). As a general rule, laches does not\nbar a plaintiff's suit before the statute of limitations has run unless estoppel or “extraordinary circumstances” are present. See\nGreen v. Parrack, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418564\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418564/green-v-parrack/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 204 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1998, no pet.). *853 Moreover, laches does not apply where\nthe defendant has acted in open and known hostility to a plaintiff's rights and has not been misled by the plaintiff's apparent\nacquiescence. See Muse, 788 S.W.2d at 423.\n\nHere, there are no extraordinary circumstances, and as previously discussed, no estoppel is present. Rutherford began\nconstruction on Lot 7, without the requisite approval, on January 12, 1998. Terramar's legal counsel wrote him a letter discussing\nhis compliance with the setback restriction on February 5, 1998. When Rutherford refused to halt construction or comply with\nthe restriction, Terramar filed suit on February 18, 1998. Therefore, Terramar did not unreasonably delay in asserting its legal\nright to enforce the restrictions. Thus, Rutherford has not met his burden of bringing forth more than a scintilla of probative\nevidence as to both elements of laches. Because Rutherford failed to adequately support each element of his affirmative defenses,\nthe trial court correctly granted Terramar's no-evidence summary judgment. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the trial\ncourt's judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                                V.\n\n\n                                                        Attorney's Fees\n\n [19] [20] Finally, Terramar cross-appeals the trial court's denial of attorney's fees. Terramar appeals this portion of the trial\ncourt's order asserting that reasonable attorney's fees are mandated by the property code for the prevailing party in an action\nto enforce deed restrictions. See TEX. PROP.CODE ANN. § 5.006(a) (Vernon 1984); see also Beere, 985 S.W.2d at 249. We\nagree with Terramar, inasmuch as the issue of whether attorney's fees are authorized in a particular case is a question of law\nto be determined by the court. See id. However, the determination of the amount to be awarded as reasonable attorney's fees is\na question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. See id. Here, the trial court should have awarded reasonable attorney's\nfees. Therefore, the trial court erred by refusing to award attorney's fees to Terramar, the prevailing party. However, the award,\nif any, must be supported by competent evidence. See id. Although Terramar claims attorney's fees in the amount of $25,000 at\nthe trial level, $10,000 at the intermediate appellate level, and $7,500 if the case is appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, section\n5.006 only authorizes the award of reasonable attorney's fees. That statute also provides the trial court with four factors to\nconsider in its determination of reasonable attorney's fees. 5 Terramar submitted evidence of all factors for the court to consider\nexcept evidence relating to the time and labor factors. Because the amount of fees is a fact question, we remand this case to\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

However because he has not challenged the summary judgment's\n       denial of that claim on appeal, we do not reach the issue of whether he brought forth more than a scintilla of evidence on each element\n       of fraud so as to defeat Terramar's no evidence summary judgment on Rutherford's affirmative defenses.\n2      Arguably, Rutherford was on notice seven days after the meeting that the approval restriction was still in force because his foreman,\n       Sherman Eagleton, signed and returned the “Important Notice to All Terramar Property Owners and Builders Requirements to\n       Build.” This document was submitted with the application fee to the Association. The Notice states: (1) that two complete plans with\n       specifications “shall” be furnished to the Architectural Control Committee; (2) that the plans are subject to approval by the Committee;\n       (3) that violation of these requirements “shall be sufficient cause for legal process against owner, builder, and contractor;” (4) that\n       plan approval is required fifteen days prior to start of construction, and (5) that the Architectural Chairman “shall have the owner\n       to halt construction if requirements are not met.” Rutherford admitted Eagleton, as his agent, had authority to sign this agreement\n       and bind him.\n3      In support of his waiver argument, Rutherford submitted the affidavit of David Watson. Watson noted numerous deed restriction\n       violations in Sections 3, 4, 6, and the Marina, but only one setback violation in Section 6.\n4      See TEX.R. CIV.

Morish assigned to Nirvana and Glen Keightley causes of action Morish claimed against Republic Insurance\n              1\nCompany.

We will reverse the judgment in part, affirm the remainder, and remand the cause to the trial court for proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n\nWe believe our discussion will be more easily understood if we generally refer to Morish as if he had been the plaintiff in the\ncourt below and refer to the Keightleys only where required for clarity.\n\n\n\n                                                      THE CONTROVERSY\n\nNational County Mutual Fire Insurance Company issued a liability-insurance policy to Morish. The policy was among several\nthat National County reinsured with Republic. In October 1987, owing to National County's financial difficulties, Republic\nbegan to administer the reinsured policies. This lasted until October 1988 when a court-appointed receiver took over National\nCounty's affairs and property. See Tex.Ins.Code Ann. art. 21.28–C (West Supp.1997). The Keightleys recovered a judgment\nagainst Morish in excess of the limits of his National County policy.\n\nMorish sued Republic on causes of action allegedly arising from Republic's refusal to settle, within policy limits, on terms\noffered by the Keightleys between October 1987 and October 1988—the period when Republic administered the Morish policy\n\n\n\n                    © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The causes of action were as follows (1) a statutory cause of action under article 21.21,\nsection 16(a), of the Texas Insurance Code, for unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance; (2) a statutory\ncause of action under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Texas Business and Commerce Code, section 17.46(a), for\nfalse, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of commerce; 2 (3) a common law cause of action for Republic's\nbreach of a duty of good faith and fair dealing owed Morish; and (4) a common law cause of action for Republic's negligence\n *127 and gross negligence in failing to settle the Keightleys' claim within policy limits.\n\nIt is undisputed in the summary judgment record that Morish was not a party to the reinsurance contract between Republic\nand National County nor any other contract with Republic. The basis for Morish's claims is Republic's alleged conduct during\nOctober 1987—October 1988 in relation to the National County policy, as that conduct is set out in the summary judgment\nrecord: with the knowledge and consent of National County, Republic assigned a claims manager to manage the Morish\nclaim and other claims against National County insureds; dealt directly with National County's defense counsel; investigated,\nevaluated, negotiated, and settled such claims; employed independent insurance adjusters and lawyers in defending the claims\nand paid attendant litigation expenses; exercised settlement authority over the claims; and established and funded a bank account\nin National County's name. The summary judgment record includes the affidavit of John W. Berkel, an attorney engaged to\ndefend Morish against the Keightleys' claim. Berkel swore that Republic “took over the duties and responsibilities with regard\nto settlement authority and claims adjusting ... prior to the time National County went into receivership;” and, that Republic paid\nBerkel's fees and expenses directly and issued drafts against a National County bank account that were signed by a Republic\nemployee.\n\nRepublic moved for summary judgment on the following grounds: (1) Morish had no claim against Republic on the reinsurance\ncontract because he was not a party to it; (2) in the absence of a contractual relationship between Republic and Morish, he had\n“no standing to assert any statutory or common law causes of action against Republic,” specifically “no standing to assert any\nclaim for common law bad faith claims handling, for any violation of the DTPA or for any violation of the Insurance Code;”\nand (3) “Republic had a reasonable basis for denying any obligation” to pay the Keightleys' claims against Morish because an\ninjunction issued in the receivership proceeding prohibited such payment.\n\nThe summary judgment ordered by the trial court does not specify the ground or grounds upon which the court rendered\njudgment as a matter of law. We must therefore examine the summary judgment record, in relation to each of the causes of\naction pleaded, under the familiar rules applicable to such judgments on appeal. See Nixon v.

Morish alleged causes of action against Republic for\n“unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance” and for a “practice specifically enumerated in a subdivision\nof Section 17.46(b)” of the Business and Commerce Code, a part of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\n [3] We conclude Republic was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law respecting Morish's cause of action for “unfair or\ndeceptive practices in the business of insurance.” Article 21.21, section 16(a), states the requisite elements for the statutory\ncause of action: (1) actual damages (2) sustained by any person and (3) caused by another's engaging *128 in an act or practice\n(4) declared unfair or deceptive in section 4 of the article. Privity of contract is not a stated element. Instead, the statute explicitly\ndefines standing in terms of any person sustaining actual damages caused by another's engaging in an unfair or deceptive act\nor practice described in article 21.21. The statutory elements are exclusive; we may not add to them the element of contractual\nprivity. See Mingus v.

The statutory cause of action is available only to “consumers,” a word defined as a person who acquires goods or services\n“by purchase or lease.” See Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(4) (West Supp.1997); Transport Ins.

The reinsurance contract between Republic and National County is included in the summary judgment record. We\nfind in its terms nothing to indicate that Morish was an intended beneficiary. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not\nerr in its summary judgment respecting Morish's statutory cause of action based upon the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. We\noverrule in this respect point of error one.\n\n\n\n                                            COMMON LAW CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n [5] [6] We conclude the trial court did not err in awarding Republic judgment as a matter of law on Morish's cause of action\nfor breach of a common law duty of good faith and fair dealing. Absent privity of contract, the duty does not arise.

We overrule point of error one in this respect and turn to Morish's claimed\ncauses of action for negligence.\n\n [7] Morish alleged that Republic breached a duty of ordinary care in the settlement *129 of the Keightley's claims. That is,\nof course, a duty that an insurer owes an insured—a duty imputed to their insurance contract. See G.A. Stowers Furniture Co. v.\nAmerican Indem.

Morish was not an insured under any\ncontract to which Republic was also a party as an insurer. Morish, therefore, cannot have a Stowers claim against Republic.\n\n [8] [9] There is, however, a more general rule made applicable to the case by the pleadings and the remainder of the summary\njudgment record: the law places a duty of ordinary care upon any person who voluntarily enters upon an affirmative course of\naction affecting another's interest.

We hold Republic was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law respecting Morish's\ncauses of action based upon allegations of negligence and gross negligence; and we sustain in this respect point of error one.\n\nIn its motion for rehearing, Republic argues against our holding on a theory that Morish's sole cause of action for negligence is\na Stowers claim—a claim we have stated Morish does not have because he was not Republic's insured. In support of Republic's\ntheory, it cites Maryland Ins. Co. v. Head Indus. Coatings & Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369433\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369433/maryland-ins-v-head-indus/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.1997). Head does not suggest\nthe theory Republic imputes to the decision. Head hold that an insured is adequately protected against his liability insurer's\nmishandling of a claim against the insured by the duties imposed upon the insurer in the insurance contract, augmented by\nthe Stowers doctrine; consequently it is unnecessary to impose upon the insurer an additional common law duty of good faith\nand fair dealing in handling such a claim. Head, 938 S.W.2d at 28–29. Both Head and Stowers deal with common law duties\narising expressly or by implication from the contract relationship of insurer and insured. See G.A. Stowers Furniture Co. v.\nAmerican Indem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3923453\"><a href=\"/opinion/4157940/g-a-stowers-furniture-co-v-american-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547 (Tex.Comm'n App.1929). Our holding, in contrast, does not derive from such a\nrelationship. Our holding derives instead from the relationship created when one undertakes, gratuitously or for his own benefit,\nan affirmative course of action that affects the interest of another. Upon that relationship, the supreme court in Otis Engineering\nand Colonial Savings has fixed a duty in the actor to conduct his undertaking with ordinary care. We adhere to our holding that\nthe summary judgment record does not defeat, as a matter of law, the Keightley's cause of action based on such a duty.\n\n\n\n                                          REPUBLIC'S AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE\n\n [10] Republic contended in its motion for summary judgment that it could not pay the Keightleys' claims against Morish\nbecause Republic was legally required by the injunction order, issued in the receivership proceeding, to pay the receiver any\nsums owed by Republic under the reinsurance contract. Presumably, the defense referred to all the actions pleaded against\nRepublic. The pleadings disclose, however, that the Keightleys did not allege a cause of action to recover sums owed under\nRepublic's reinsurance contract. Instead, they sued on Morish's causes of action for consequential damages allegedly caused by\nRepublic's wrongful conduct in relation to Morish's insurance contract with National County; moreover, they alleged that such\nconduct occurred before the receivership proceeding began and before the injunction was issued. We hold Republic was not\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law, on its affirmative defense, as to Morish's common law causes of action for negligence\n *130 or gross negligence and his statutory cause of action under article 21.21, section 16(a), of the Texas Insurance Code, for\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance. We need not discuss Republic's affirmative defense in relation\nto Morish's other causes of action because we have rejected them on other grounds stated previously.\n\n\n\n                     INSUFFICIENCY OF REPUBLIC'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\nIn point of error two, the Keightleys complain that Republic's motion for summary judgment did not attack their “causes of\naction” for negligence, gross negligence, waiver, and estoppel as set out in their petition. We have previously discussed the\ncauses of action for negligence and gross negligence and need not refer to them again.\n\n [11] [12] “Waiver” and “estoppel” are not causes of action because they cannot create liability in and of themselves. See\nHruska v. First State Bank of Deanville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438876\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438876/hruska-v-first-state-bank-of-deanville/\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 785 (Tex.1988). The Keightleys did not, in their response to Republic's\nmotion for summary judgment, raise waiver and estoppel in opposition to Republic's contention that it was entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. For that reason they may not, on appeal, claim error based alone upon their pleading of waiver and estoppel.\nId. We hold accordingly and overrule point of error two.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We, therefore, overrule Republic's new assignments of\n        error relating to the validity of the assignment.\n2       Section 17.46(a) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act is incorporated in article 21.21, section 16(a) of the Texas Insurance\n        Code.\n3       In its motion for rehearing, Republic contends that because article 1.14–1 § 2(b)(2) statutorily exempts the “lawful transaction of\n        reinsurance” from the definition of “business of insurance” we cannot hold Republic liable under article 21.21. See Tex.Ins.Code\n        Ann. art. 1.14–1 § 2(b)(2) (West Supp.1997). We do not find this argument persuasive. The supreme court recently analyzed this\n        provision and found that article 1.14–1(2) was enacted after article 21.21 and was not intended to alter the scope of the term “business\n        of insurance” as it was used in article 21.21.

Appellees are ten women's clinics and several doctors\nwho sometimes perform abortions. Based upon the jury's findings that appellants were liable for civil conspiracy, tortious\ninterference, invasion of privacy and property rights, the judgment awarded actual and punitive damages to appellee Planned\nParenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, Inc. (“Planned Parenthood”). Appellants, Philip “Flip” Benham and Bob Jewitt,\nare referred to as “B/J,” and appellants, Operation Rescue–National, Rescue America, Dallas Rescue, Don Treshman and Keith\nTucci, are collectively referred to as “OR.” In separate briefs, B/J raise thirty-seven points of error and OR raise fifty-four\npoints, for a total of ninety-one points of error, many of which overlap. Both groups contend the permanent injunction violates\nboth the Texas and United States Constitutions. They also attack the sufficiency of the evidence to substantiate the trial court's\nfindings supporting the injunctive relief. They complain of errors in the jury instructions, in the composition of the jury, in the\namended and corrected judgments, and in the assessment of costs. In addition, OR challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the actual and punitive damages imposed against them. 1 We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                          Background\n\nAppellants sought to interfere with the activities of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics in August 1992 during\nthe Republican National Convention in Houston. *68 Don Treshman, the National Director of appellant Rescue America,\nannounced a plan for a concerted, large-scale assault on Houston abortion providers. Treshman met with leaders of Operation\nRescue–National before the GOP Convention. The groups agreed to jointly exert pressure on Planned Parenthood and other\nclinics to force them to close during the Convention. The primary tactic was conducting or sponsoring “rescues” which are\nblockades of clinics. In addition, Operation Rescue planned to promote residential pickets of physicians who worked at the\nclinics, and Rescue America was to coordinate information on these pickets. Pat Mahoney, a spokesman for Operation Rescue–\nNational, acknowledged that the two groups had a common purpose and plan and were “all working toward a common goal.”\nAppellants also announced their plan at a press conference.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

All sought habeas relief, which the Texas Supreme Court granted. The\nsupreme court held that the TRO imposing a 100–foot speech-free zone around the clinics' entrances and exits violated the\nprotestors' constitutional right to freedom of expression because there was no showing the zone was the “least restrictive” means\nof protecting the clinics from harm.

Following a six-week jury trial and a two-day evidentiary hearing on the particulars of the proposed injunctive\nrelief, Judge Eileen O'Neill of the 190th District Court signed a Judgment and Permanent Injunction on December 5, 1994. The\njudgment awarded the following damages to Planned Parenthood, plus pre- and post-judgment interest:\n\n  $204,585 in actual damages from Operation Rescue–National, Rescue America, Don Treshman, and Keith Tucci, jointly and\n  severally; plus punitive damages as follows: $350,000 from Operation Rescue–National; $355,000 from Rescue America;\n  $155,000 from Don Treshman; and $150,000 from Keith Tucci, for a total of $1,010,000 in punitive damages.\n\nThe judgment permanently enjoined and restrained appellants from interfering with the clinics, harassing the physicians and\ntheir family members, and demonstrating within a specific zone as to each clinic and doctor's residence. These zones range from\nfifteen feet to thirty-two feet around the entrances to the clinics and are outlined on maps attached to the injunctive order. The\ndemonstration-free zones also extend thirteen feet from the property line in front of each physician's residence. The judgment\nincorporates the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the injunctive relief.\n\nAfter entry of the judgment, the cause was transferred to the 333rd District Court, where Judge Richard Bianchi signed an\nAmended Judgment and Permanent Injunction on February 1, 1995, to correct two errors in the judgment. Subsequently, on\nJune 15, 1995, the same court entered a Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc and Permanent Injunction to include the attachment of exhibits\ninadvertently omitted from the Amended Judgment.

At the\ncharge conference, appellants objected that *70 the instruction did not require an “unlawful overt act” and that there was no\nelement of damages included in the cause of action. The attorney representing Benham and Jewitt objected to the definition in\nInstruction No. 2, and tendered another definition, which was refused. The parties stipulated at trial that objections made by\none defendant were applicable to the others. Appellees contend Rescue America and Treshman have waived any complaint as\nto the conspiracy definition because their attorney did not receive a ruling. However, when an objection is made and the court\nmade no change in the charge, it is presumed that the objection was properly and timely presented and that the objection was\noverruled. Acord v.

Massey, 652 S.W.2d at 934. The instruction in this case is substantially the same, except that\nit requires the jury to find “at least one act to further the conspiracy.” When the elements submitted in this case are considered\nin the context of the basic conspiracy definition, we find no error in this slight deviation from the Massey elements. According\nto the court's instruction in this case, the jury was required to find an act furthering appellants' “unlawful *71 purpose,” or an\nact forming the “unlawful means” of accomplishing their conspiracy.\n\n [15] In addition, while not every act of protest described at trial was illegal, it was uncontroverted that one or more of appellants'\nactions were unlawful. The charge defined “unlawful” as “violative of either criminal or civil law.” Appellants admitted many\nof their actions, at the very least, violated appellees' common law rights as well as the initial injunctive order. There is also no\ndispute that the actions at issue in this case were “overt.” It was therefore established that some appellants committed overt,\nunlawful acts, and the only disputed issue was whether these acts were part of a conspiracy so that each co-conspirator is\nresponsible for all acts done by any of the conspirators.

In response, appellees first assert that appellants have waived every factual sufficiency point of error, and any\nobjection that damages were excessive, by failing to bring a separate point of error complaining of the trial court's overruling\nof their motion for new trial. To preserve error on factual sufficiency complaints, a party must include an objection in a motion\nfor new trial. See TEX.R. CIV. P. 324(b)(2), (b)(4); Luna v. Southern Pacific Transp.

Appellees\ncite no case authority directly on point, relying only on O'Connor's Texas Rules * Civil Appeals (1993). We find no other\nauthority requiring such a strict interpretation of the briefing rules. We hold the filing of a motion for new trial, raising specific\npoints in the motion as to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury's answers, as appellants did in this case, is effective\nto preserve error for factual sufficiency points. A separate point of error complaining of the overruling of the motion for new\ntrial is duplicitous and unnecessary.\n\n [22] When a party attacks a finding concerning an issue upon which it did not have the burden of proof, it must demonstrate\nthat there is insufficient evidence to support the adverse finding.

They argue that because the findings are erroneous, the court's conclusion cannot stand because it\nis without a factual base. Conclusion of Law No. 1 states:\n\n            Absent injunctive relief, defendants are likely to continue to engage in the tortious conduct found by the\n            jury to be in violation of plaintiff clinics and physicians' common law and constitutional rights, and such\n            conduct is likely to cause plaintiff clinics and physicians irreparable harm.\n\n\nAppellants argue the evidence is insufficient to support the injunction because appellees called only three witnesses to testify at\nthe hearing on the injunctive relief, and these witnesses did not provide testimony relevant to the standard for determining the\nnecessity for and nature of constitutionally permissible injunctive relief. Our review of the record, however, reveals evidence of\nthe conspiracy to interfere with the business, property and privacy rights of appellees, which threatened imminent, irreparable\nharm.\n\nIn addition to the evidence adduced at the hearing on the injunction, ample evidence supporting the injunctive relief was provided\nat the jury trial. The record contains evidence of appellants' interference with business, privacy and property rights, which is\nrelevant to the harm element necessary for the permanent injunction. Appellees presented evidence that from early 1992 up to\n *74 and including the time of trial, appellants engaged in blockades and used aggressive “sidewalk counseling” by yelling,\nscreaming and following patients at the clinics. The jury saw numerous videotapes and photos of blockades at the clinics during\nthe Convention. At times during the Convention there were estimated to be a thousand people outside Planned Parenthood.\nJudy Reiner, Planned Parenthood's Deputy Director, Dr. Jerry Edwards, an appellee, and Larissa Lindsay, a clinic escort, all\ntestified they saw appellants and those operating at their direction attempting to or successfully impeding or preventing clinic\naccess. Reiner testified that it was obvious the protests were organized and that the large numbers of people were not appearing\nspontaneously. Reiner testified she saw Keith Tucci, the former national director of Operation Rescue, outside her clinic several\ntimes. Reiner testified the protesters were not peaceful, but instead attempted to block patients' access to the clinic. They got\nwithin inches of the patients' faces and often touched them. She told how “escorts” had to form a human circle around patients\nto get through the mobs to the entrance during large protests. She described the patients' and staff's attempts to gain access to\nthe clinics “like running a gauntlet.”\n\nReiner testified Planned Parenthood has had bomb threats, defacement of the building, thrown bottles and rocks, the locks glued\nshut, and two butyric acid attacks. She described an invasion at Planned Parenthood that occurred in 1989 or 1990 for which\nTreshman claimed credit. The protesters entered Planned Parenthood and chained their necks to cement blocks. Daniel Scott, a\nPlanned Parenthood employee, testified he fears being shot every time he leaves the building. Jesse Miller, a protester associated\nwith Rescue America, told Scott in March 1994, “This is the day you die, brother.” Reiner testified that Planned Parenthood\nand the other clinics and physicians took seriously the threats made by Tucci and Treshman and those who work under their\ndirection. She testified to the repairs made to the building and measures taken to safeguard the building, staff and patients.\n\nDon Treshman testified about the aggressive sidewalk counseling promoted by Rescue America and discussed rescues or\nblockades conducted at the plaintiff clinics. Although Treshman did not participate, his publication, Rescue America's Newsline,\nadvertised a picket at Dr. Kaminsky's house. Treshman invited Rev. Michael Bray, who advocated justifiable homicide of\nabortionists, to speak at a Rescue America conference in the summer of 1993. Treshman acknowledged that Rescue America\nwill use any methods it deems necessary to save unborn children. The jury saw the videotaped confession of Joshua Graff,\nadmitting he “interfered” with the operation of the West Loop Clinic by trying to blow it up.

Moloney was seen at clinic protests hundreds of times and also conducted many residential pickets.\nAt these protests, Moloney was seen directing Daniel Ware, who was later arrested on weapons charges for carrying prohibited\nfirearms in his car.\n\nThe physicians testified that appellants' actions negatively affected their patients' mental and physical health and made medical\nprocedures more risky. In addition, they testified about the protests at their homes. Dr. Jerry Edwards testified his home had been\npicketed twelve or fifteen times, the picketing continued after the Republican Convention up to “last weekend.” He testified that\nprotesters bring signs, come into his *75 yard, play loud music, yell and make threats. Photographs were admitted showing the\nprotesters at his residence. He testified he and his young daughter received death threats. He testified he did not feel comfortable\nat his home and had placed it for sale. He also described protest activities at Planned Parenthood, where he worked as medical\ndirector. These activities interfered with his ability to work and caused stress to his patients. Judy Reiner of Planned Parenthood\ntestified she was present at two pickets at the homes of Drs. Edwards and Rosenfeld and saw people associated with Rescue\nAmerica. She did not see Treshman, Tucci, Benham or Jewitt, however.\n\nDr. Robert Kaminsky testified his office, Women's Medical Center of Northwest Houston, is picketed regularly. He saw\nTreshman picket there about five times. He testified James Doyle followed him in his car once. The previous Saturday his\nbusiness was significantly interfered with by picketers. He testified the activities of protestors pose a health risk to his patients.\nHis house has been picketed about two dozen times. A “Wanted” poster with a photograph of Dr. Kaminsky was used during\nthe picketing. Mrs. Kaminsky testified their home had been picketed about fifteen times, the last time on the previous Saturday.\nMrs. Kaminsky also testified she does not feel safe because the protesters follow them to work. Mrs. Kaminsky testified she saw\nseveral of Treshman's followers outside both her home and her husband's office several times. She could identify Treshman's\nfollowers because she saw them taking direction from him or from John Moloney. She saw John Moloney and James and Estelle\nPratt picket their home. She had also seen the Pratts and James Doyle with Treshman in front of their office. A videotape of\npicketing at the Kaminsky residence was introduced into evidence. On the tape, Moloney shouted at Mrs. Kaminsky, “there is\na just punishment that you deserve.... This is just a small taste of what's coming down the pike. We trust we won't have to do\nit.” She described that picket as a “huge shoving match.” She testified John Moloney grabbed her, and her teenage daughter\nwas pushed to the ground by activists in her front yard. This incident occurred shortly after Dr. David Gunn was murdered\noutside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida while a Rescue America-sponsored picket was taking place, and Mrs. Kaminsky\ntestified she feared for her husband's safety. She did not want her husband to come outside during the confrontation with the\npicketers, but he eventually helped his wife and daughter return to the house. Mrs. Kaminsky testified the event was very\nscary and upsetting. She described it as “the most terrifying thing I've ever been through.” A few days later, Treshman praised\nMoloney for the Kaminsky picket on his hotline.\n\nDr. Doug Karpen testified he had seen Treshman at clinic demonstrations and had met him at Hobby Airport, where Treshman\nand five others followed him. Treshman and Benham admitted monitoring and following Dr. Karpen in a joint effort with\nDallas Rescue for more than six weeks. Dr. Karpen practices at Aaron's Women's Clinic and at Women's Pavilion. He\ntestified protestors had tried numerous time to block access at Aaron's, including an attempted blockade during the Republican\nConvention and an actual blockade about that time, organized by Operation Rescue and Treshman. There were two attempted\nblockades at The Women's Pavilion during the Convention. Dr. Karpen's house had been picketed about three to four times,\nbut not within the past two and a half years.\n\nDr. Bernard Rosenfeld testified demonstrations occur every Saturday at the Houston Women's Clinic where he works. The\nclinic had been subjected to acts of vandalism, including acid attacks, gluing of door locks, and flooding of his clinic. Many\npatients had been accosted by protestors and had been “extremely stressed out,” making the medical procedures “much more\ndangerous.” Dr. Rosenfeld testified that his house has been picketed about six to eight times and his driveway has been blockaded\nby protesters. This activity interfered with his ability to work and terrorized his wife and children. The activists told his three\nand four-year old children, “Your daddy kills babies.” Photographs were admitted showing the protesters at his residence.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Treshman denied he was the leader of that protest, and claimed he only\nwent there to talk to the press. Dr. Adesomo admitted his house had not been picketed. He testified that he was aware that an\nanti-abortion protester who was an admitted follower of Rescue America had killed a physician working at an abortion clinic,\nand he feared the same fate could happen to anyone performing abortions.\n\nDr. Coleman died before trial, and his deposition was not taken. He worked at A–Z Women's Health Services and at the West\nLoop Clinic. The evidence was that his house had been picketed several times. Treshman admitted he “organized, conducted\nand announced” a picket at Dr. Coleman's funeral. 3\n\nThe evidence from the hearing on the injunctive relief is directed to the issue of irreparable harm and is summarized as follows.\n\nDr. Morris Taggart, a psychologist, testified about the emotional impact of picketing on patients and staff. He interviewed eight\nemployees of Planned Parenthood. He characterized the reactions of those he interviewed as those of “people having undergone\nsome kind of trauma.” The workers reported being physically jostled on arrival at the clinic, and they were yelled at with\ncries of “baby murderer.” The staff was upset and unable to work after these incidents. In Dr. Taggart's opinion, a buffer zone\nbanning “harassing speech” was necessary because of the distress to staff and patients. He testified restrictions are necessary\nmost importantly to prevent physical contact, but also to reduce the proximity of the yelling and screaming. He admitted that\non four visits to the Planned Parenthood clinic, he observed only “peaceful protests.”\n\nDr. Dale Hill, also a psychologist, interviewed three patients, three nurses, one doctor and one volunteer in January 1994. In\nher testimony, she described the encounters with protesters. The patients and staff reported being “hollered at” and “physically\ntransgressed.” Some received threats, such as, “You need to die.” She concluded protesting was harmful to patients and staff,\nand a buffer zone is necessary to protect them from psychological and emotional trauma. She observed protests at Planned\nParenthood, but never observed any violence at the protests. Her own ingress or egress was not blocked during her three trips\nto Planned Parenthood.\n\nLaura Lindsay, a Planned Parenthood employee, primarily introduced photographs and diagrams of the clinics setting forth the\nrequested buffer zone areas. She demonstrated through photographs that signs held outside the buffer zones could still be read.\nShe admitted there are numerous differences about the clinics as to the level of traffic, noise, parking, or whether the clinic is in\na residential area as opposed to downtown Houston. She acknowledged that, since the 1992 Republican Convention, Planned\nParenthood has constructed a wall higher than six feet and a private enclosed drive provides access to the entrance door.\n\nAppellants called Mary Hall Kleypass, a pro-life “sidewalk counselor.” She testified she approaches women considering\nabortion and offers literature about the “development of the baby as well as a place where she could go for help.” To be\nsuccessful, “sidewalk counseling” involves “direct interaction” with the women, using “eye contact.” She denied she uses\nintimidation or grabs anyone, but instead counsels “gently and quietly.” She testified that counseling could not be done from\nacross the street because she would be forced to yell and could not interact with the women. However, on cross-examination\nKleypass admitted she is not a party to this case, does not know most of the appellants, does not act in concert with them, and\nis not subject to the injunction.\n\n [27] The party seeking an injunction must establish the defendant “will engage in *77 the activity enjoined.” State v.

There was evidence presented at trial that Daniel Ware, Tom Weighard, Rusty Thomas, John Byrd, C.D. Money,\nJesse Miller, and other persons in Houston act at the direction or control of appellants in harassing, threatening and interfering\nwith appellees. Tom Wieghard, a member of Operation Rescue, signed Operation Rescue's pledge “to follow the mission's\nleadership” and engage in its activities “as directed.” Weighard admitted his intention was to interfere with Planned Parenthood's\nbusiness. He admitted he supervised and instructed “anyone who was out there” in front of the clinics, including Joshua Graff,\nand that he assisted at the blockade of the A–Z Clinic. He testified he had been taught techniques for these activities by\ncoordinators for Operation Rescue–National. Jeff White, director of Operation GOP (“Guard Our Preborn”), the name given\nthe protest activities during the Convention, announced that after the Convention, Operation Rescue “had left behind a thriving\npastor-lead rescue community in Houston.”\n\nNone of the appellants testified that they were willing to stop their activities. Most expressed a clear intention to violate any court\norder that interfered with their activities. Pat Mahoney of Operation Rescue testified to holding a “Boston Tea Party” where\nhe publicly destroyed a copy of Judge O'Neill's initial TRO and said he would do the same thing again. Flip Benham, national\ndirector of Operation Rescue, testified he intended to continue his activities. He testified that Operation Rescue will “live out\nits gospel in the streets despite injunctions and court orders.” Operation Rescue literature makes it clear that “[t]he threats of\nrescues will hang over the killers' heads every day.” Treshman testified Rescue America intends to continue to blockade clinics,\n“continue to use any effective means we feel will save lives,” continue residential picketing, and “continue all activities and all\navenues that are effective in stopping the abortion Holocaust.” Bob Jewitt wrote to Operation Rescue supporters that “[t]hose\nof us included in the injunction admitted that we already had an injunction from God to rescue children no matter how the\njudge would rule.” Keith Tucci, former national director of Operation Rescue, wrote, “[n]o matter what the laws say, we are\ncommitted to keep rescuing children.” He stated in another letter “we will continue our ... direct action....” Reiner testified the\nprotests continued through her testimony at trial.\n\n [28] In making its determination of imminent harm, the trial court may determine that, when violations are shown up to or\nnear the date of trial, the defendant has engaged in a course of conduct and the court may assume that it will continue, absent\nclear proof to the contrary. Texas Pet Foods, 591 S.W.2d at 804. The probability of the continuation of the prohibited practices\nis not subject to direct proof, and injunctive relief is proper when the trial court finds it justified under the rules of equity,\nnotwithstanding a defendant's cessation of the activity or promise to cease the activity. Id. Here, there was evidence that threats\nof violence, interference, and invasion of personal and property rights continued up to and during trial. There was no “clear\nproof to the contrary.”\n\n [29] [30] Under Texas law, a violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right inflicts irreparable injury warranting injunctive\nrelief.

When the clinic faced a continuation of picketing and harassment\nby abortion protesters, we determined that a suit for money damages for loss of business was insufficient, and the only adequate\nremedy was an injunction limiting the protests. Id.\n\n [31] In this case, when the jury inquired whether it had to determine that each appellant personally violated the physicians'\nprivacy and property rights, the court instructed that it could “consider the acts of non-defendants if those persons committed\nthe act, if any, as agents of the listed Defendants. An agent is one who consents to act on behalf of and subject to control of\nanother, the principal, who has manifested consent that the agent shall so act.” Appellants make no complaint on appeal as\nto this instruction. Therefore, we conclude that it is immaterial that each of the individual appellants were not identified as\npersonally engaging in many of the protest activities. It is not essential that each conspirator be shown to have acted in concert\nwith his co-conspirators. See Bourland v.

In addition, the evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court's findings\nin granting the requested injunctive relief both as to the clinics and in favor of the physicians. The contrary evidence is not so\noverwhelming as to render the court's judgment unjust.

Id. at 6. Instead,\nthose seeking the restraint urged a uniform restriction for “administrative convenience.” Id. The court left open the possibility\nof a permanent injunction imposing a limited geographical ban on activity as long as any restriction is “justified by a proper\nevidentiary showing that such measures are essential to preserve the right of clinic access, and that each satisfies fully the\nstandard we have required under the Texas Constitution.” Id. The court required “specific findings supported by evidence”\nthat the speech-free zone is the least restrictive means to insure unimpeded access to clinics and guard against intimidation\nand harassment. Id.\n\n [35] While we recognize that our supreme court has held that the Texas constitution generally provides greater free speech\nrights than those provided under the federal constitution, we conclude that the standards of review for the constitutionality of\nthis injunction are essentially the same under both the United States Constitution and the Texas Constitution. Any buffer zone\ninjunction must “burden no more speech than necessary” and be the “least restrictive means” to protect unimpeded access to\nthe clinics and residences.\n\nIn Madsen, the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a state court injunction prohibiting anti-abortion\nprotestors, including Operation Rescue and “Operation Rescue America,” from demonstrating outside a health clinic in Florida.\nAmong other restrictions, the injunction prohibited the protestors, from “congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or\nentering” any portion of the public right-of-way or private property within 36 feet of the property line of the clinic to ensure\naccess to the clinic. Madsen, 512 U.S. at 768, 114 S.Ct. at 2526. In upholding this part of the injunction, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that the state court had “few other options to protect access,” and the Court gave deference to the state court's\nfamiliarity with the facts and the background of the dispute between the parties, even in light of its heightened review. Id. at\n769, 114 S.Ct. at 2527. The Court considered the fact that an earlier, more narrow injunction failed to accomplish its purpose,\nbut stopped short of setting any requirement for a similar failure of a narrow restriction as a prerequisite for injunctions in future\ncases. Id. The Court concluded that “the 36–foot buffer zone around the clinic *80 entrances and driveway burdens no more\nspeech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake.” Id.\n\n [36] The Supreme Court in Madsen also identified numerous significant government interests protected by the injunction,\nincluding: a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical or counseling services in connection with her pregnancy; ensuring public\nsafety and order; promoting the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks; protecting the property rights of citizens;\nand protecting residential and medical privacy. Madsen, 512 U.S. at 767–68, 114 S.Ct. at 2526. The Court found that these\ngovernmental interests were sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to protect them. Id.\n\nHere, the same significant governmental interests exist, and almost identical interests are listed in the trial court's conclusions\nof law. We hold that the governmental interests in this case are sufficiently significant to justify and demand injunctive relief.\nWe now must evaluate the terms of the injunction to determine if they contain the least restrictive means of protection and are\ntailored to burden no more speech than necessary.\n\nIn Madsen, the United States Supreme Court upheld a complete buffer zone to protect access to the abortion clinic at issue. The\nonly provision of the clinic buffer zone that the Court struck down was that portion which extended onto the private property\nof adjoining landowners at the sides of the clinic. 4 The zones at issue here do not extend onto private property other than\nthe property on which their clinics or homes are situated. Each of the distance restrictions in the buffer zones in this case are\nnarrower than the 36–foot zone upheld in Madsen.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Appellants agreed to stipulate to maps,\nphotographs and written descriptions of the proposed buffer zones that were introduced in evidence. Photographic evidence\ndemonstrated that appellants could still be seen outside the prohibited zones. Each zone has been specifically tailored to the\ngeography of the particular clinic. The width and breadth of each zone varies widely depending on the physical characteristics\nand location of each clinic. The zones range from fifteen to thirty-two feet, depending upon the particular requirements for\nadequate clinic access.\n\nFor example, there was testimony that patients were required to cross two streets from the parking lot to the Planned Parenthood\nentrance. Narrow corridors were provided across these streets to enable patients to cross the streets without fear of unwanted\ninterference. At the A–Z Women's Clinic, which is located in a high-rise office building, the prohibited zone is fifteen feet from\nthe driveways leading to the clinic's private parking lots, leaving one lane of traffic open for cars to enter and exit. Appellants\ncan still be seen and heard at these locations. The West Loop Clinic has one of the largest buffer zones, thirty-one feet. It is\njustified due to the physical lay-out of the clinic which fails to provide any separation between appellants and arriving patients.\nIn addition, the West Loop Clinic has been the target of repeated and dangerous acts of protest, including butyric acid attacks\nand fire-bombing.\n\nWe believe that the injunction satisfies the Texas Supreme Court's concern that distances not be imposed based solely upon\n“administrative convenience.” Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 6. We find that the evidence established that these zones are the least\nrestrictive means and are “essential to preserve the right of clinic access” as required by Tucci. See Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 7.\nIn addition, we find the injunction satisfies Madsen's requirement for “precision of regulation” to insure that the injunction\nburdens no more speech than necessary. Madsen, 512 U.S. at 767, 114 S.Ct. at 2525–26.\n\n [37] Appellants also argue, as part of B/J's points one through three, that the injunction on picketing near the clinics and\nphysicians' residences is overbroad. OR *81 raise essentially the same argument under their point of error forty-four. They\ncontend that the injunction improperly bans all speech included within the term “demonstrating” within the buffer zones. This\nargument is unpersuasive because the United States Supreme Court upheld a complete ban on “demonstrating” within a 36–\nfoot “speech-free” zone in Madsen. Id. at 768–69, 114 S.Ct. at 2526–27.\n\n [38] Appellants also contend the ban on residential picketing is unconstitutional. The injunction banned all “picketing,\npatrolling, or demonstrating within ... zone[s] along the entire ... street edge of [each physician's] property extending 13 feet\nfrom the property line” into the street where the residence is located.\n\nAppellants maintain that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Frisby v. Schultz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112134\"><a href=\"/opinion/112134/frisby-v-schultz/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112134\"><a href=\"/opinion/112134/frisby-v-schultz/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court traditionally\nsubjects restrictions on public issue picketing to careful scrutiny. The restrictions must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant\ngovernment interest and must leave open ample alternative channels of communication. Id. at 482, 108 S.Ct. at 2501. In Frisby,\nthe Court upheld an ordinance banning picketing in residential neighborhoods, finding anti-abortion protestors had ample\nalternative means to proselytize their views. Id. at 484, 108 S.Ct. at 2502. The Court construed the ban narrowly as prohibiting\nfocused picketing taking place in front of a particular residence. Id. at 483, 108 S.Ct. at 2501–02.\n\n [39] [40] The Court also found the restriction served a significant government interest: the protection of residential privacy.\nId. A restriction is narrowly tailored if it eliminates no more than the exact source of the “evil” it seeks to remedy. Id. at 485, 108\nS.Ct. at 2502–03. The Court found that focused picketing inherently and offensively intrudes on residential privacy. Id. at 486,\n108 S.Ct. at 2503. The First Amendment permits the government to prohibit offensive speech as intrusive when the “captive”\naudience cannot avoid the objectionable speech. Id. at 487, 108 S.Ct. at 2503–04. The Court concluded that a complete ban on\ntargeted picketing is narrowly tailored to eliminate the “evil” of an unwelcome visitor at the home. Id.\n\n [41] The Supreme Court applies a “somewhat more stringent application of First Amendment principles” when evaluating an\ninjunctive order than it does when a content-neutral, generally applicable statute is reviewed, as was the case in Frisby.

Consequently, the injunction must satisfy the review announced in Madsen, that is, it must\nburden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest. Id. at 765, 114 S.Ct. at 2525.\n\nThe injunction in Madsen prohibited picketing and demonstrating within 300 feet of the residences of clinic staff. Id. at 774,\n114 S.Ct. at 2529. In striking down this provision, the Court found a 300–foot zone would ban general marching through the\nneighborhood or even a walking route in front of an entire block of houses, instead of a prohibition on “focused picketing\ntaking place solely in front of a particular residence” that the Court had approved in Frisby. Id. at 775, 114 S.Ct. at 2530. The\ncourt recognized that a “limitation on time, duration of picketing, and number of pickets outside a smaller zone could have\naccomplished the desired result.” Id.\n\nThe more narrow restriction proposed by the U.S. Supreme Court is precisely what the trial court imposed in this case. This\ninjunction prohibits protests in a small zone in front of each doctor's residence. There are time limits within each 24–hour period\nand limits on sound amplification within 100 feet of the residences. In Madsen, the Supreme Court approved even broader\nlimitations on sound amplification near the residences of clinic staff. Id. at 774, 114 S.Ct. at 2529. Appellants complain that\nthe buffer zone impermissibly prohibits them from passing through the neighborhood. However, the zone is only thirteen feet\ndeep, and protestors have ample access to picket through the neighborhood, so long as they do not “focus” on the area in front\nof a particular doctor's residence. The thirteen-foot zone is necessary to permit the doctors' families to have *82 access to their\ndriveways, and it leaves one lane of traffic open for alternate channels of communication by appellants or others.\n\nWe hold the injunction on protests at the doctors' residences satisfies the criteria set forth in Frisby as well as Madsen, and\nis therefore constitutional.\n\n [42] [43] Appellants also contend the trial court made no specific factual findings supporting the injunctive relief. They\nargue the court instead made mere conclusions that appellants conduct “threatened” the access and use of the clinics. Appellants\nfailed to preserve this complaint for our review.

The court found that appellants continued\ntheir protest activity despite existing injunctions imposing place and manner restrictions, and concluded that absent injunctive\nrelief, defendants were likely to continue to engage in their tortious conduct. In fact, appellants have brazenly ignored the\nprevious orders of judges in several states. The court determined that narrowly tailored injunctive relief was required to protect\nseveral significant governmental interests, which are substantially *83 the same as those identified in Madsen. The court\ndetailed the specific, narrowly tailored zone around each clinic's entrance. Each zone was a “[m]eans of protecting unfettered\ningress and egress from the clinic, ensuring that [appellants] do not block traffic.” Madsen, 512 U.S. at 769, 114 S.Ct. at 2526.\nThese zones, by their very descriptions, demonstrate that they are designed to limit no more than the very evil of “in-your-\nface” harassment shown by the evidence at trial and to permit adequate access to the clinics.

It is also significant that the jury awarded $5,000 additional punitive\ndamages, over and above the amount originally requested, against Rescue America, and its leader Don Treshman, for whom\nthere was abundant evidence of involvement in organizing the protests and encouraging acts of vandalism. The evidence already\ndiscussed shows that the organizers acted intentionally and with malice. They were unconcerned about the consequences so\nlong as their goal of stopping abortion was achieved. The evidence of appellants' conduct in this case, such as firebombing,\nacid attacks, and death threats, is so egregious as to be highly offensive and repugnant to law abiding citizens.\n\nWe conclude that the evidence supporting the jury's award of punitive damages is factually *85 sufficient. OR's point of error\nthirty-eight is overruled.\n\n [58] In point of error forty, OR challenge the award of punitive damages because two of the jurors voting for punitive damages\ndid not join in the verdict on actual damages. Only ten of the twelve jurors voted to award actual damages.\n\nRule 292 provides that the same ten members of an original jury of twelve may render a verdict. TEX.R. CIV.

There is a split of authority as to whether the same ten\njurors who found liability in the first phase of the trial must agree upon the amount of punitive damages in the second phase of\na bifurcated trial. The Corpus Christi Court of Appeals determined that they did not, finding Rule 292 does not apply. Greater\nHouston Transportation Co. v. Zrubeck, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1717576\"><a href=\"/opinion/1717576/greater-houston-transp-co-v-zrubeck/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ denied).

In Hyman, the court rejected what it called “dicta” in Zrubeck, and held that Rule\n292 requires the same ten or more jurors to concur in all answers necessary to a judgment, including the answer to the amount\nof punitive damages awarded, if any, in a bifurcated trial. Id. at 457–58.\n\n [59] We need not decide whether Rule 292 applies because appellants made no objection before the verdict to the two\ndissenting jurors' participation in the punitive damages deliberations. In fact, appellants demanded the two jurors' participation.\nThus, they have waived any complaint. TEX.R.APP. P. 52(a). Moreover, the punitive damages verdict was unanimous.\nTherefore, the same ten jurors that voted to award actual damages found punitives. In the event it was error for the other two\njurors to join in the verdict, it is clearly harmless. We overrule point of error forty.\n\n [60] In point of error forty-one, OR challenge Planned Parenthood's amendment of its damages request after the jury verdict\nbut before rendition of judgment. The jury awarded $5,000 additional punitive damages, above the amount requested, against\nTreshman and Rescue America. Planned Parenthood requested a pre-judgment trial amendment, which the court granted. The\ntrial court then incorporated the amended amounts in its judgment. OR contend the amendment operated to their surprise and\nprejudice, and that it was violative of Rule 47.\n\n [61] [62] Rule 47 requires a pleading setting forth a claim for relief to give fair notice of the claim involved and to state that\nthe damages sought are within the jurisdictional limits of the court. TEX.R. CIV. P. 47. A pleading is sufficient when it gives\nfair and adequate notice of the facts upon which the pleader basis its claim. Roark v.

Appellees requested the court to correct two matters they deemed “clerical errors.” The\ntwo changes were: (1) to correct the parenthetical numerical in the award of punitive damages to $355,000 to coincide with\nthe wording; and (2) to change the enforcement paragraph in the injunction by adding “any officer, agent, servant, employee,\nattorney, or person acting in active concert with defendant, who has actual notice of the order.” OR assert that this second\nchange is not a clerical error. OR concede that the transferee court had plenary jurisdiction over the judgment by virtue of\nappellants' timely filed motion for new trial, but argue the court could not correct a “judicial error” in the enforcement paragraph\nof the judgment.\n\n [67] “Clerical errors” are mistakes or omissions that prevent the judgment as entered from reflecting the judgment as rendered.\nThe trial court may correct clerical mistakes even if it has lost plenary jurisdiction.

In addition, we note that Rule 683 contemplates the injunctive order being\nbinding upon “parties, their officers, agents, servants, employes, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or\nparticipation with them who receive actual notice of the order.” See TEX.R. CIV. P. 683. Therefore, the correction to comply\nwith the terms of the rule was properly made. We find no error in the correction in the amended judgment of this clerical error\nand overrule OR's points forty-nine and fifty and B/J's points thirty-two and thirty-three.\n\n [68] In OR point of error fifty-one and B/J point thirty-four, they argue the trial court had no authority to enter the judgment\nnunc pro tunc to correct the amended judgment. Appellants' motion for new trial was overruled on February 10, 1995. The trial\ncourt entered a judgment nunc pro tunc on June 15, 1995 to include attachment of exhibits describing the buffer zones. These\nexhibits were referred to in the original judgment, and were attached to that judgment. When the judgment was first amended,\nthe exhibits were inadvertently omitted. Failure to attach the exhibits to the judgment is a clerical error, not a judicial error.\nTherefore, the trial court could properly enter a judgment nunc pro tunc after expiration of it plenary power.

We are cited to no authority requiring the trial court to make this proportionate\nreduction in costs. Moreover, rather than retaxing of costs, this proportionate reduction is an allocation or adjudication of costs,\nwhich was required to be made within the trial court's plenary power. Where the complaint is made of the ruling of a court in\nadjudging costs against the wrong party, the error is inherent in the judgment and must be properly assigned, just as any other\nalleged error.

They do not state facts which they\ncould even be tested. This is important because the court was stating reasons to enjoin twenty- *90 eight different parties. The\ndiffering operative facts as to all such parties, including where located, militate against the sweep treatment the court displayed\nfor permanent injunction purposes. The Court failed to state what conduct the appellants were protesting or what they did.\n\nThe trial court must state these reasons without any request of the parties. The Court was not required to make findings of fact\nand conclusions of law as this was a jury case. Rule 296 Texas Rules Civil Procedure specifically provides that findings may\nbe requested in any case tried “without an jury.” Therefore, the reasons for injunction could not be waived for not asking for\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law as suggested by the majority.\n\n4. The Permanent Injunction is unconstitutionally overbroad. The Permanent Injunction portion of the judgment provides in\nSection E that appellants are prohibited from “demonstrating” within described zones that circumvent nine facilities belonging\nto appellees. “Demonstrating” was defined as “oral or other expression that publicly displays, manifests, or expresses one's\nfeelings or opinions ... and expressly includes ‘sidewalk counseling.’ ” These zones also extend from the edges of the properties\ninto any adjoining public streets, approximately to the center line of the respective streets adjoining each of the facilities.\nThe zones are shown on plats of each facility attached as exhibits to the judgment. The Planned Parenthood facility also has\ntwo protected corridors, fifteen feet wide, extending from two parking lots across the public streets to the facility. The widest\nzone is thirty-two feet (Women's Medical Center of N.W. Houston) and the narrowest zone is fifteen feet (AAA Concerned\nWomen's Center). Similarly, Section I of the judgment provides restrictions pertaining to the five physician appellees prohibiting\n“congregating, picketing, patrolling, or demonstrating” within thirteen foot zones extending from their respective property lines\ninto the adjoining streets.\n\nThe record does not show any evidence that “such measures are essential to preserve the right of clinic access, and that each\nsatisfies fully the standard we have required under the Texas Constitution” as required by Ex Parte Tucci, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384623\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384623/ex-parte-tucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7\n(Tex.1993). Tucci held: “Unless such a restriction is proved to be the least restrictive means of guarding against an irreparable\nand imminent injury, it is an impermissible infringement on our state constitutional right of free expression.” Id.\n\nIn Tucci, Rev. Keith Tucci, and six other abortion protestors, had been held in contempt for violating a temporary restraining\norder previously entered in these proceedings. The parties, four of whom are appellants in this appeal, brought original habeas\ncorpus proceeding in the Texas Supreme Court asserting they had been confined for expression which is protected under article\nI, section 8 of the Texas Constitution (freedom of expression). The temporary restraining order, in part, barred demonstrating\nwithin one hundred (100) feet of any of the nine clinics, appellees in this appeal. The relators in Tucci did not attack any\nof the other provisions of the restraining orders but challenged only the one-hundred foot limitation as unconstitutional. The\nconfinement of relators was premised solely on their having disregarded portions of the one-hundred foot limitation. The other\nprovisions of the restraining orders were clearly directed to protecting against the specific injuries alleged by the women, clinics\nand businesses and access by injunctive relief that barred:\n\n             [t]respassing on, physically invading, entering without consent, damaging, sitting in, blocking, impeding\n             or obstructing access to, ingress into or egress from any part of the Planned Parenthood 1 facility ...,\n             including the entrances and exits, the parking lots ..., and any of the clinic's or parking lots' entrances\n             and driveways.\n\n\nAdditionally, the temporary restraining orders contained four independent provisions to guard against intimidation and\nharassment that prohibited:\n\n  Demonstrating within twenty-five (25) feet of any person seeking access to or leaving the clinic, its parking lots, or\n  intervenors' businesses or parking lots, or in any way *91 impeding such person's entrance to or exit from the clinic, parking\n  lots or businesses;\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Tucci mandates\nthat such restrictions must be justified by a proper evidentiary showing that such measures are essential to preserve the rights\nof clinic access and that such restrictions are the least intrusive as to individual liberties. Tucci, 859 S.W.2d at 7.\n\nThe judgment contains provisions clearly directed to protecting against the specific injuries alleged by the women and clinics.\nInjunctive relief bars:\n\n  A. Entering without consent upon or damaging any part of the premises, facilities and parking lots of [the nine clinics].\n\n  B. Blocking or attempting to block, barricade, or in any other manner obstruct the entrances to, or the premises of [the nine\n    clinics].\n\n  C. Inhibiting, impeding, obstructing or interfering with, or attempting to inhibit, impede, or obstruct or interfere with the free\n    and unmolested ingress and egress of persons (either pedestrian or vehicular) to and from the facilities and parking lots\n    and the streets and sidewalks adjacent to the facilities and parking lots of [the nine clinics].\n\n  D. Touching, physically abusing, intimidating, or harassing any individual attempting to enter or exit the facilities or parking\n    lots of [the nine clinics].\n\nSection E, as written in the judgment, concerning “demonstrating” violates Article I, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution, as\nset out in this opinion. However, the above restrictions A through D would be the least restrictive means to protect against the\nintimidation and harassment complained of. Sections A through D are the least restrictive means that are essential to preserve\nthe right of clinic access or if there is evidence to prove that demonstration-free zones would be the least restrictive means to\nprotect a woman's right to have an abortion as set out in Tucci at 7.\n\nFor the same reasons, the restrictions in Sections F through H, that pertain to the residences of the physicians specifically\nprovide for injunctive relief that would protect the physicians against the conduct complained of. These restrictions are:\n\n  F. Trespassing on, sitting in, blocking or impeding plaintiff physicians, their family members and their guests or invitees\n     from access to, ingress into or egress from any part of plaintiff physicians' residences.\n\n  G. Inhibiting, impeding or attempting to impede or inhibit the free ingress or egress of any person to the streets that provide\n    access to the streets on which the plaintiff physicians' residences are located;\n\n  H. Harassing, threatening, assaulting, or physically abusing plaintiff physicians, their family members, guests or invitees.\n\nHowever, Section I of the judgment providing for the 13 foot zone is likewise void under Tucci as there was no evidence\nintroduced at the trial or at the hearing on the *92 injunction that would prove that such a zone would be the least restrictive\nmeans to prevent the harm complained of. The United States Supreme Court has approved prior restraints against free speech.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In Frisby, abortion protestors brought suit seeking\nto enjoin the enforcement of a municipal ordinance prohibiting picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any\nindividual. The Court found that the ordinance did not ban all picketing in residential areas, but only prohibited focused picketing\ntaking place solely in front of particular residences. The ordinance served a significant government interest of protecting\nresidential privacy. An important aspect of such privacy is the protection of unwilling listeners within their homes from the\nintrusion of objectionable or unwanted speech. The ordinance is “narrowly tailored” to serve that governmental interest, since\nit targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of “evil” it seeks to remedy: offensive and disturbing picketing focused\non a “captive” home audience. It does not prohibit more generally directed means of public communication that may not be\ncompletely banned. Id. 487 U.S. at 487–89, 108 S.Ct. at 2504. Although injunctive relief is available to prevent picketing, similar\nto the picketing in Frisby, Tucci mandates an evidentiary hearing to prove that a buffer zone, such as is the case here, is the least\nrestrictive means of preventing this harm. Section I could read: “Congregating, picketing, patrolling, or demonstrating in front\nof the [physician's] residence” if the court finds this is the least restrictive means of preventing the harm.

Massey, 652 S.W.2d at 934.\n\nIn Massey the court held plaintiffs had not alleged a cause of action for conspiracy because of failure to allege an unlawful\novert act. Harmful error resulted from such omission because the definition of conspiracy was the basis of appellees' causes\nof action. The first two questions to establish liability on the appellants and questions 3 through 9 establishing damages use\nthe term “conspiracy.” It is obvious it was harmful to appellants because a $1,214,585 judgment was rendered against them.\nThis judgment does not include damages for personal injuries, and seems excessive for what was involved. The jury could very\nwell have decided the case differently had the omitted elements been included by the trial judge.

In three issues, West asserts that the district court erred by granting *515 the temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance. Because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the\nsupplemental temporary injunction order.\n\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\nAt the supplemental temporary injunction hearing, the court admitted evidence of a printed copy of West's Web site, testimony\nfrom an investigator employed by the Consumer Protection and Public Health Division of the Texas Attorney General's office,\nand documents from Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge provided in response to the State's civil investigative demand. The\ninvestigator's testimony and the Web site evidence revealed that West used an Austin radio commercial, a recorded telephone\nmessage (identified as a “phone overview”), and a Web site to advertise meetings at a local hotel about a “banking opportunity”\nthat would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal debt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles,\nloans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before December 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank.\nWest's “www.bankopp.com ” Web site also stated that “David [West] found a Bank that is willing to give individuals loans to\npay off their debts. Then the Bank is willing to turn around and forgive that loan so it doesn't have to be paid off.” It asserted that\n“two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking and Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The\nsite claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,” the “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the\nproject to take place this once. While the system intended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage\nof this, it was never intended that regular every day people would gain access to it.”\n\nThe site further claimed that the unnamed bank had agreed to pay off $100 million in debt and that “[the] project is about David\n[West]'s looking for others to add their debt to the pile David started.” The idea was to accumulate $100 million in debt for\nthe bank to “fractionalize then forgive” so that “the bank can make money and the folks with David can get out of debt.” The\nsite claimed that, after “David told his 10 closest friends about the project,” word spread quickly throughout Louisiana and\nMississippi. The site also explained that West accelerated its marketing of the project following Hurricane Katrina:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

These Open Meetings will have hundreds of people in attendance and are expected to\n             help reach[ ] the goal of $100 Million in debt before Thanksgiving. This would leave plenty of time for\n             the bank to pay before December 31st (the bank only needs 10 business days).\n\n\nAs a signal of their “commitment to be involved with the project,” the site asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of\n$5,000 to a bank account in Panama, or to the “Del Sur International Holdings” account with Hibernia National Bank in Baton\nRouge. According to the site, after the money was submitted, the bank would perform a financial analysis and might contact\nthe participant to discuss any issues: “[T]he bank will analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are\nconcerns.” Also after wiring their $5,000 “commitment/deposit money,” the site stated that participants would receive *516\na document “guarantee[ing] that the loan that [they] are signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\nVisitors to the Web site were not informed that the Del Sur International Holdings account, to which the $5,000 wire transfers\nwere directed, was the sole proprietorship of David West.\n\nThe State filed suit under the Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. §§\n17.46(a)-(b), .47 (West Supp.2005) ( “DTPA”) against David West, Roxana Suadi West, 1 Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/\na www.bankopp.com, seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief based on the debt elimination “service for sale to consumers.”\nThe State obtained a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction against West, preventing any further marketing in\nTexas of the “banking opportunity.” 2\n\nAfter learning that David West attempted to withdraw all funds from the Baton Rouge account to which the participants' $5,000\nwire transfers had been directed, 3 the State obtained a supplemental restraining order, freezing the funds in the Hibernia\nbank account. The State also sought to convert the supplemental restraining order into a supplemental temporary injunction,\nmaintaining the freeze on the account. Following a hearing on October 25, 2005, the district court entered an order preventing\nDavid West, Roxana Suadi West, Carlos M. Suadi, and Pydia, Inc. d/b/a www.bankopp.com from accessing the Hibernia bank\naccount.\n\nSpecifically, the order enjoined them (and those associated with them) from\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from Account # [ ], held at Hibernia National Bank; and\n\n  • transferring, spending, hypothecating, concealing, encumbering, withdrawing, removing or allowing the transfer, removal,\n     or withdrawal of any funds from any other financial institution and/or account into which Defendants have placed or caused\n     to be placed, funds from consumers to participate in Defendants' “bank opportunity.”\n\nThe order also set the case for trial.\n\nWest appeals only from the district court's October 25 supplemental temporary injunction order that froze the assets in the\nHibernia bank account. It asserts that the district court abused its discretion by entering the supplemental temporary injunction\nbecause the State did not demonstrate (1) a probable right to recovery or (2) a probable injury, and (3) the order did not\nspecifically state the reasons for its issuance. We consider each of these assertions.\n\n\n\n                                                        DISCUSSION\n\nStandard of review\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court does not abuse its discretion if some evidence reasonably\nsupports its decision. Id. at 211.\n\n\nProbable right to recovery\n [4] In its first issue, West argues that the district court erred in granting the temporary injunction because the State did not\ndemonstrate a probable right to recovery. West asserts that the transaction at issue is a loan of money, which is neither a “good”\nnor a “service” under the DTPA. See Riverside Nat'l Bank v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1624043\"><a href=\"/opinion/1624043/riverside-nat-bank-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (Tex.1980); see also Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(1), (2) (West 2002). West argues that the DTPA applies to transactions in which the borrower's\nobjective is to purchase or lease goods or services, but the DTPA is inapplicable if a borrower's objective is merely an attempt\nto acquire money. See La Sara Grain Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Mercedes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455879\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455879/la-sara-grain-v-first-nat-bank-of-mercedes/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566–67 (Tex.1984); Megason v.\nRed River Employees Fed.

Cf.\nTex. Fin.Code Ann. § 301.002(a)(10) (West Supp.2005) (defining “loan” as “an advance of money that is made to or on behalf\nof an obligor, the principal amount of which the obligor has an obligation to pay the creditor”). Alternatively, the State argues\nthat West is offering a loan forgiveness service.\n\nThe district court's finding of a probable right to recovery under the DTPA is supported by the evidence that West's Web site,\noffers a service—specifically, the elimination of debt—in exchange for $5,000. According to the site, after the money was\nsubmitted, “the bank [would] analyze each project member's debt and provide feedback if there are concerns.” The site also\ninformed the public that, after wiring $5,000, participants would receive a document “guarantee [ing] that the loan that [they]\nare signing will be forgiven and that [they] will not have to pay it back!”\n\n“Services” are defined in the DTPA as “work, labor, or service purchased or leased for use, including services furnished in\nconnection with the sale or repair of goods.” Tex. Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 17.45(2). The State's suit complains that West's\nservice violates the DTPA because it (1) fails to disclose the factual basis for its representations that David West has found a\nbank willing to give individuals “loans” to pay their debts without expectation of repayment and (2) encourages consumers to\nwire $5,000 to an account that is not identified as belonging to David West.\n\nThe debt elimination opportunity that West offered is similar to the function of a “credit services organization,” defined in the\nfinance code as\n\n  a person who provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, for the payment of valuable consideration, any of\n  the following services with respect to the extension of consumer credit by others:\n\n  (A) improving a consumer's credit history or rating;\n\n  (B) obtaining an extension of consumer credit for a consumer; or\n\n   *518 (C) providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to Paragraph (A) or (B).\n\nTex.

These activities parallel West's “banking\nopportunity”—advertised on the radio, in a telephone message, and on the Web—offering debt elimination, for $5,000 as\nspecified on the Web site, to any “U.S. Citizen” for any type of debt through a “loan” that would not require repayment. The\nservice West promoted on its Web site included financial analysis, by which “the bank [would] analyze each project member's\ndebt and provide feedback if there are concerns.”\n\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the State demonstrated a probable right to\nrecovery under the DTPA.

The State contends that the common\nlaw requirements for a temporary injunction—including balancing of the equities, proof of irreparable harm or injury, and lack\nof an adequate remedy at law—are inapplicable when the State is seeking statutorily-authorized injunctive relief. See Tex. Bus.\n& Com.Code Ann. § 17.47(a).

(holding that when\nlegislature authorized attorney general to seek injunctions on behalf of multiple consumers, it determined that past or threatened\nDTPA violation coupled with public need constituted sufficient “irreparable risk of harm” to support entry of injunction).\n\n [6] Accordingly, the State argues that, to be entitled to a temporary injunction under the DTPA, it need only demonstrate to\nthe court its reason to believe that (1) any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in any act or practice\ndeclared to be unlawful by the DTPA, and (2) that proceedings would be in the public interest. See Tex. Bus. & Com.Code\nAnn. § 17.47(a). The fact that a person has ceased its unlawful conduct will not affect the State's entitlement to injunctive relief.\nId. Furthermore, the DTPA authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary to compensate\nidentifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by\nmeans of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d) (emphasis added).\n\nAt the October 25 hearing on the supplemental temporary injunction, the State introduced evidence of West's\n“www.bankopp.com ” Web site, promoting a “banking opportunity” that would allow any “U.S. Citizen” to pay off all personal\ndebt—including “credit cards, mortgages, student loans, vehicles, loans, IRS settlements, and back child support”—before\nDecember 31, 2005, by securing a “loan” from an unnamed bank. The site contained repeated assertions that participants will not\nrepay the bank because the “loans” will be forgiven. It claimed that “two little known banking practices ... Fractional Banking\nand Forgiven Loans” made this “one shot opportunity” possible. The site also claimed that although “this opportunity is legal,”\nthe “Federal Reserve will undoubtedly close the loopholes that allowed the project to take place this once. While the system\nintended on well connected, wealthy individuals to be able to take advantage of this, it was never intended that regular every\nday people would gain access to it.” The site also asked participants to deposit a wire transfer of $5,000—as a signal of their\n“commitment *520 to be involved with the project”—to a bank account in Panama, or to an account with Hibernia National\nBank in Baton Rouge.\n\nThe State also introduced into evidence documents that the Hibernia National Bank in Baton Rouge, Louisiana provided in\nresponse to the State's civil investigative demand. The documents included a commercial new account information card for\nDel Sur International Holdings and its “sole proprietorship resolution certificate,” along with a copy of a Louisiana driver's\nlicense issued to David Jason West. These documents show that David West opened a free small business checking account\nwith $100 cash at Hibernia on August 8, 2005, under the business name of Del Sur International Holdings. He is the sole owner\nand signatory on the account. The account number assigned to the Del Sur International Holdings checking account matches\nthe account number on the Web site to which the participants' $5,000 wire transfers had been directed. The Web site does not\ndisclose that the $5,000 transfers of participants' “commitment money” were deposited into an account owned by David West.\n\nBased on this evidence, the district court determined that West “may be violating the DTPA” and that the State's action “was\nin the public interest.” Indulging every reasonable inference in favor of the court's order as we must, we conclude that there is\nsufficient evidence to support the court's findings in accordance with section 17.47(a). Thus, we overrule West's second issue.\n\n\nSpecificity of order under rule 683\n [7] [8] In its third issue, West claims that the district court's temporary injunction violated rule 683 because it did not state\nthe reasons for its order with specificity. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 683. West argues that the district court's order does not specifically\nstate the reasons why injury will be suffered if the interlocutory relief is not ordered. West also faults the order for its failure to\nstate why the identified probable injury is an irreparable one for which the State has no adequate legal remedy. Under Rule 683\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              7\n\fDavid Jason West and Pydia, Inc. v.

Because we conclude that the order was sufficiently specific under rule\n683, we need not address the waiver issue. 4\n\n *521 Relying on rule 693, the State responds that “the principles, practice and procedure governing courts of equity shall\ngovern proceedings in injunctions when the same are not in conflict with these rules or the provisions of the statutes.” Tex.R.\nCiv. P. 693 (emphasis added); see also Texas Pet Foods, Inc., 591 S.W.2d at 805 (“When it is determined that the statute is\nbeing violated, it is within the province of the district court to restrain it .... [t]he doctrine of balancing the equities has no\napplication to this statutorily authorized injunctive relief.”).\n\nThe State reiterates that section 17.47(a) of the DTPA authorizes the State's consumer protection division to bring an action\nfor injunctive relief when “it has reason to believe that any person is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in\nany act or practice declared to be unlawful by [the DTPA], and that proceedings would be in the public interest.” Tex. Bus. &\nCom.Code Ann. § 17.47(a). The DTPA also authorizes the court to “make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary\nto compensate identifiable persons for actual damages or to restore money or property, real or personal, which may have been\nacquired by means of any unlawful act or practice.” Id. § 17.47(d). The State contends that the order is proper because it contains\nthe essential findings that “Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer\nProtection Act,” and that “this action is in the public interest.”\n\nThe court found that the freeze was necessary to prevent West from dissipating funds in the account to which the participants'\nwire transfers had been directed:\n\n            [U]nless Defendants are immediately restrained from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate\n            funds obtained from consumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices\n            Act, before a full trial can be held on the merits of the State's claims. To the extent required by law,\n            Plaintiff [State] has proved that continued violation of these laws will continue to cause Plaintiff and the\n            general public to suffer irreparable harm.\n\nWe conclude that this order complied with the statutory prerequisites under section 17.47(a) of the DTPA by finding that\n“Defendants may be violating § 17.47(a) and (b) of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices–Consumer Protection Act,” and that\n“this action is in the public interest.” The order also satisfied the specificity requirement of rule 683 by finding that, “unless\nDefendants are immediately restrained *522 from the acts prohibited below, Defendants will dissipate funds obtained from\nconsumers through misrepresentations in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, before a full trial can be held on the\nmerits of the State's claims.” Accordingly, we overrule West's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

PATTERSON, Justice.\n\n*1 This is an accelerated appeal from an order granting a temporary injunction. R & R Resources Corporation is the operator\nand a working interest 1 owner of three oil and gas wells—the Ullrich, Goebel Brothers, and Toennis—located in Fayette\nCounty. Echelon Oil and Gas, L.L.C., Tex–El Oil and Gas, Inc., and BairTex Energy, Inc. are also working interest owners.\nR & R Resources appeals a temporary injunction entered against it that prevents it from opposing the designation of Leexus\nOil & Gas, L.L.P. as the new operator of the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells. R & R Resources challenges the trial court's\norder as an abuse of discretion, arguing that the order violated the rules of equity and that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex did not\ndemonstrate standing to seek injunctive relief, a probable right of recovery, or irreparable injury. R & R Resources's reply brief\nadded two issues: (i) that R & R Resources was denied an opportunity to be heard at a subsequent status hearing on September\n9, 2005, and (ii) that the trial court's order was impermissibly speculative. Because we find that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by granting the temporary injunction, we affirm the trial court's order.\n\n\n\n                                                        BACKGROUND\n\nEchelon, Tex–El, and BairTex are in the business of purchasing and selling interests in oil and gas producing properties. As\npart of this business, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex purchased certain working interests in the Ullrich, Goebel Brothers, and\nToennis oil and gas wells. 2 The parties operate the wells under two identical joint operating agreements, the 1989 American\nAssociation of Petroleum Landmen Form 610 Model Form Operating Agreements. These forms are agreements between oil and\ngas lease owners and interest holders for the exploration and development of oil and gas within the “contract area” described in\nthe agreements. The agreements in this case designate R & R Resources as the “Operator,” that conducts, directs, and controls\noperations in the contract area. All other parties to the agreements—Echelon, Tex–El, 3 and BairTex—are designated as “Non–\nOperators.”\n\nThe parties conducted business through their respective corporate presidents: Frederick Doutel, Jr. of R & R Resources, Roger\nSlayton of Tex–El, Randal Snider of Echelon, and Warren Bair of BairTex. On November 14, 2003, after Slayton complained\nto Doutel about R & R Resources's operations and accounting procedures concerning the wells, Doutel sent an e-mail offering\nto arrange for Slayton to “take over operations on [the] Goebel, Ullrich and/or Toennis” wells “th[at] afternoon.” Later that\nday, Doutel sent another e-mail to Slayton stating, “Sorry, we'll do it December 1st. You will be the operator.”\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                              4\n\fR & R Resources Corp. v.

His letter also stated that R & R Resources was\n“working up a letter agreement regarding conditions for operator transfer,” including a requirement that the new operator use\nparticular vendors. Tex–El, Echelon, and BairTex audited R & R Resources's books in December 2003, but afterward Doutel\ndid not sign the P–4 forms.\n\n *2 Unsuccessful in its attempts to have R & R Resources transfer operation of the wells, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex retained\ncounsel. Their attorney wrote to Doutel on April 30, 2004, advising that his clients, who were “majority interest” owners in\nthe three wells, had voted to remove R & R Resources as operator for “good cause” pursuant to the joint operating agreements'\nterms. The letter proceeded to list the ways in which R & R Resources had “failed and refused to act as a reasonably prudent\noperator.”Counsel's letter also demanded that R & R Resources: (i) relinquish operation of the wells to a new operator to be\ndesignated by Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex, and (ii) pay a refund owed to them. Doutel's May 28 response letter denied the\nrequest to relinquish operation of the wells and stated that he had instructed his accountant to remit the funds due to Echelon,\nTex–El, and BairTex within ten days. 5 Doutel's response did not address the other allegations in counsel's letter. Bill Jaehne of\nLeexus Oil & Gas also called Doutel to ask whether he would turn the operations over to Leexus, but Doutel refused.\n\nAlmost four months after sending its demand letter, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex (collectively, the “Non–Operators”)\nrequested the Texas Railroad Commission's approval of single-signature P–4 forms designating Leexus Oil & Gas, L.L.P. as\nthe new operator of the three wells. The request explained that, although R & R Resources had been removed as operator under\nthe terms of the joint operating agreements because of its “operational and/or billing discrepancies,” R & R Resources refused\nto cease operations and transfer the P–4s to another operator. The Commission requested a response from R & R Resources in\nsupport of R & R Resources's good faith claim to operate the leases. It noted that R & R Resources was not required to refute\nLeexus's good faith claim but only to substantiate R & R Resources's own good faith claim to operate the wells.\n\nOn November 19, 2004, after R & R Resources responded with copies of the wells' leases and operating agreements, the\nCommission informed the parties that “[w]hether Leexus is entitled to become the designated operator of the subject leases\nappears to turn on the question of whether the owners of a majority of the working interest in the leases had the right to remove R\n& R Resources as operator.”The Commission stated that it lacked jurisdiction to construe the terms of the operating agreements,\ndetermine what constituted “good cause” for removal under the agreements, and otherwise determine the parties' contractual\nrights. Accordingly, it deferred these determinations to the courts and declined to process the single-signature P–4s.\n\nThe Non–Operators filed suit against R & R Resources on May 18, 2005, and sought a temporary injunction. On July 1, 2005,\nafter a two-day hearing held on June 15 and 17, the trial court entered an order preventing R & R Resources from opposing\nthe designation of Leexus as the operator of the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease. 6 In summary, the order enjoined\nR & R Resources from\n\n\n   *3 • refusing to join in the immediate execution and delivery of proper joint form P–4s designating Leexus as the operator\n    for and of the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease;\n\n       • interfering, opposing, preventing or refusing to cooperate with Plaintiffs' and/or Leexus's efforts to file and obtain\n          approval from the Texas Railroad Commission of joint form P–4s designating Leexus (for Commission purposes) as\n          the operator of the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease;\n\n       • further operating or performing operations on the Ullrich Lease and Goebel Brothers Lease following the Commission's\n          approval of the joint form P–4s;\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

R & R Resources quotes language in the joint operating\nagreements that permits removal of the operator “by the affirmative vote of Non–Operators owning a majority interest.”But\nthe testimony at the temporary injunction hearing revealed that, although Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex sold portions of the\nworking interests that they had purchased, they also reserved portions of those oil and gas interests for themselves.\n\nAdditionally, Slayton and Bair testified that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex owned a majority of the working interest in the\nwells through participation or subscription agreements with their respective investors that had delegated decision-making and\nvoting authority over their interests to Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex. Slayton testified that Tex–El and its investors own 20%\nof the working interest in the Ullrich well and 15% of the working interest in the Goebel Brothers well. The parties, including\nR & R Resources, stipulated to the testimony concerning BairTex's and Echelon's interests in the wells. 7 With regard to the\nUllrich well, the parties stipulated to the testimony that BairTex and its investors own 12.40% of the working interest while\nEchelon and its investors own 36.20% of the working interest. The parties further stipulated to the testimony that, with regard\nto the Goebel Brothers well, BairTex and its investors own 10% of the working interest while Echelon and its investors own\n37% of the working interest. The parties also stipulated to the testimony that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex—along with their\ninvestors who purchased a portion of the working interests—collectively owned 69% of the total working interest in the Ullrich\nwell and 62% of the total working interest in the Goebel Brothers well.\n\n *5 [2] R & R Resources next contends that it had a statutory right to determine the identities of Echelon's, Tex–El's,\nand BairTex's investors and obtain their opinions on the lawsuit. SeeTex. Nat. Res.Code Ann. § 91.141(b) (West 2001). Its\nunderstanding of section 91.141 of the natural resources code entitles “any stockholder, or shareholder, or royalty owner in\nan oil well ” to inspect the records of any owners and operators of oil and gas wells. But that section of the code states that\n“[t]he books shall be kept open for inspection of the commission or any accredited representative of the commission and any\nstockholder, shareholder, or royalty owner in the business.” Id. (emphasis added). This statute requires Echelon, Tex–El, and\nBairTex each to keep its books open for its own stockholders, shareholders, and royalty interest owners. R & R Resources does\nnot cite any authority for its contention that the books must be opened to “any stockholder, or shareholder, or royalty owner\nin an oil well,” other than its interpretation of excerpts from section 91.141 of the natural resources code. We do not find its\nargument under section 91.141 persuasive.\n\n [3] R & R Resources's reliance on a contractual right to disclosure under the joint operating agreements is similarly misplaced.\nIt asserts that paragraph V.B.2 of the joint operating agreements entitles it to determine whether Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex\nconducted a valid vote or polling of their investors prior to removal of the operator. Paragraph V.B.2 of the agreements states\nthat the successor operator shall be selected by the affirmative vote of two or more parties owning a majority interest. As\npreviously noted, there was testimony at the hearing that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex owned a majority of the working interest\nin the wells through participation or subscription agreements with their respective investors and that each of these agreements\ndelegated decision-making and voting authority over their interests to Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex.\n\nThe trial court found that “Plaintiffs [Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex] own or, by virtue of written agreements with their\nrespective investors, exclusively control (including all voting and decision making rights) a majority of the working interest” in\nthe Ullrich and Goebel Brothers leases. The court further found that in April 2004, plaintiffs notified R & R Resources of their\naffirmative vote to remove R & R Resources as operator of the three leases. Because there was some evidence adduced at the\nhearing that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex have direct ownership in the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells, that their interests\ncombined with those of their investors constituted a majority, and that they affirmatively voted to remove R & Resources as\noperator, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in determining that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex had standing to\nrequest a temporary injunction. We overrule R & R Resources's first issue.\n\n\nProbable, Imminent, and Irreparable Injury\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

R & R Resources also argues that the Non–Operators have an adequate legal remedy in the form of\na contractual suit for damages.

But Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex introduced\nevidence that R & R Resources was billing them for expenses incurred at least two months earlier, or expenses incurred in the\nsame month as the billing, that their revenues were reduced by the amount of these untimely billings, and that R & R Resources\ndelayed paying the expenses for several months despite its ability to pay them. There was evidence that the Goebel Brothers\nrefund was not paid until seventeen months after the well was drilled, $100,000 of the Goebel Brothers well expenses were\nunpaid for ten months, revenue checks to some owners were dated weeks before they were mailed, and the audit of R & R\nResources raised questions about whether certain bills were paid at all.\n\nMark Jaehne of Leexus testified that, although he received checks for his override interest from Doutel in three or four weeks\nfrom the time the check was “cut,” Doutel was further behind because Doutel's check represented payment for the preceding\nmonth's production; it was not an advance payment. Jaehne explained that if Tex–On, an oil and gas gatherer, typically wired\npayment to Doutel on the 20th, but Doutel did not write a check to the interest owner until the 5th of the next month and did\nnot mail it until three or four weeks after the date on that check, the interest owner would not be paid for production until sixty\nto seventy-five days after Doutel received payment. Jaehne also testified that he had a conversation with Tex–On about being\npaid directly, but Doutel would not allow Tex–On to make such direct payments.\n\nJaehne further testified that continual late payments may cause vendors to refuse to extend credit, charge higher prices, or refuse\nto provide services. He testified that R & R Resources's operational charges were excessive; that the price it received from\nthe sale of salvage was too low; that it failed to install continuous chemical treating systems, the lack of which can corrode\nequipment and affect production; and that it failed to adequately determine the need for replacement materials and equipment.\nAdditionally, Snider testified that Leexus could do a better job, had more experience, more personnel, and a better location.\n\n *7 Slayton characterized Doutel's demeanor as, “I'm going to do it the way I'm going to do it and you can like it or dislike\nit.”Slayton also testified that an investor on the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells resolved never to invest with Slayton again\nbecause the “operational bills were too high,” and that vendors complained about the way their bills had been handled by R &\nR Resources. Doutel testified that he was “not concerned about what vendors think.”\n\n [5] Ongoing and continuing harm resulting from an operator's refusal to relinquish operations is at least one basis for finding\nirreparable injury in support of a temporary injunction.

Moreover, Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex made claims for cloud on title and injury to\nreal property, which do not require a showing that an adequate legal remedy is lacking to support an award of injunctive relief.\nSeeTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 65.011(4)-(5) (West 1997). The trial court's order found that Echelon, Tex–El, and\nBairTex would suffer injury for which there was no adequate remedy at law, noting that R & R Resources's improper accounting\nand operational practices\n\n            have caused and will continue to cause loss and/or delay of revenue; payment of excessive and/or\n            unnecessary lease/well expenses; late payment of lease/well expenses; exposure to lease/well creditors\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The trial court was within its discretion to make such determinations based on the evidence before\nit. Furthermore, the court could have issued the temporary injunction without finding a lack of adequate legal remedy based on\nsection 65.011(4)-(5) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code. See id.\n\n [6] R & R Resources also argues that, although the operations for the three wells at issue have been conducted under the terms\nof the joint operating agreements for the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells, the court granted a temporary injunction as to only\ntwo of the three wells. Although the temporary injunction was inapplicable to the Toennis well, the record shows that, of the\nthree wells in the underlying suit, the Toennis is the only well that is not expressly covered by a joint operating agreement.\nThe court heard Benny Jaehne of Leexus testify that, because the Toennis does not have any operating agreement, if R & R\nResources did not want to pay another bill it “would not be bound to anything.”The trial court's findings state that, while the\nparties did not execute a joint operating agreement for the Toennis lease, R & R Resources argued without objection that the\nterms of the agreements for the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers leases applied to the Toennis lease by implication. Indulging every\nreasonable inference in favor of the court's order, we may infer that the trial court declined to include the Toennis well within\nthe temporary injunction because it is not expressly covered by either of the two joint operating agreements. We overrule R\n& R Resources's second issue.\n\n\nProbable Right to the Relief Sought\n *8 [7] In its third issue, R & R Resources urges that the trial court abused its discretion in finding a “probable right of\nrecovery” because Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex did not obtain a finding of R & R Resources's gross negligence, willful\nmisconduct, material breach, or total inability to perform. A probable right of success on the merits is shown by alleging a cause\nof action and presenting evidence that tends to sustain it. Telephone Equip.

The letter listed the ways in which R & R Resources had “failed and refused to act as a reasonably prudent operator”\nand demanded that R & R Resources relinquish operation of the wells. Doutel's May 28 response letter denied the request to\nrelinquish operation of the wells.\n\nR & R Resources urges that the trial court should have applied a gross negligence standard. But the first paragraph of article\nV.B. in the joint operating agreements clarifies that good cause for an operator's removal “shall mean not only gross negligence\nor willful misconduct but also the material breach of or inability to perform its obligations under this agreement.”Furthermore,\nR & R Resources does not cite any authority supporting application of an exculpatory clause that concerns the manner in which\nan operator conducts drilling operations, as in article V.A. of these joint operating agreements, to equitable claims that do not\ninvolve R & R Resources's “liability” for damages, or to claims for damages that are not based on drilling operations.

Failure to make prompt adjustments to an operating account and improperly\nassessed charges—similar to the allegations in this case—have been bases for finding that an operator “failed or refused to\ncarry out its duties,” which would support the entry of a temporary injunction. See Tri–Star Petroleum Co., 101 S.W.3d at 589–\n90.Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in finding that Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex established a probable right of recovery in support of their request for\ntemporary injunction. We overrule R & R Resources's third issue.\n\n\nViolations of Equity\n *10 [8] In its final issue, R & R Resources claims that the trial court's temporary injunction violated the rules of equity\nbecause Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex materially breached the notice and removal provisions of the joint operating agreements\nand thus did not have “clean hands” when they sought equitable relief. The evidence adduced at the hearing does not support\nthis contention.

Almost four months after sending its demand letter, the Non–Operators requested the\nassistance of the Texas Railroad Commission via single-signature P–4s. That request was denied on November 19, 2004. The\nNon–Operators did not seek an injunction against R & R Resources until May 18, 2005, when they filed suit. R & R Resources's\nargument that it did not have thirty days to cure the Non–Operators' complaints is not persuasive. Similarly, its arguments that it\ndid not have written notice of the accounting discrepancies or receive a copy of the audit prior to the lawsuit are not persuasive\nbecause they are not prerequisites to filing suit under the terms of the joint operating agreements.\n\n [9] R & R Resources's final argument is that the trial court's temporary injunction violated the rules of equity because\nthe temporary relief requested was identical to the permanent relief requested. It claims that the Non–Operators' temporary\ninjunction effectively accomplished the entire purpose of their lawsuit and made the court's order a ruling on the merits of\nwhether R & R Resources should be removed as operator. A ruling on temporary injunctive relief may not be used to obtain an\nadvance ruling on the merits. See Iranian Muslim Org. v. City of San Antonio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2449626\"><a href=\"/opinion/2449626/iranian-muslim-orgn-v-city-of-san-antonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 208 (Tex.1981). But Echelon,\nTex–El, and BairTex did not receive all the relief requested in their motion for temporary injunction or in their petition. The\ntemporary injunction does not cover the Toennis well. Additionally, the petition makes claims for damages based on breach\nof contract and cloud on the title. Thus, the trial court did not grant relief identical to that which the Non–Operators sought\nin their lawsuit by issuing the temporary injunction concerning the Ullrich and Goebel Brothers wells. We overrule R & R\nResources's fourth issue.\n\n\nOpportunity to be Heard at Subsequent Status Hearing\n [10] In its fifth issue, R & R Resources urges that it was denied an opportunity to be heard at a subsequent status hearing\non September 5, 2005. R & R Resources argues that it should have been able to present additional evidence on the issues of\nauthority and irreparable injury. The court had previously scheduled the status hearing to determine whether its temporary\ninjunction order was being followed, not as a continuation of the two-day temporary injunction hearing held in June. We have\nfound that the court had some evidence to support its findings on the issue of authority—as noted in the earlier discussion of\nthe Non–Operators' standing to seek the temporary injunction—and irreparable injury. We also note that the court agreed to\nconduct an in camera inspection on November 4, 2005, to address the issue of Echelon, Tex–El, and BairTex's authority, thus R\n& R Resources had an additional opportunity to raise this issue with the trial court. We overrule R & R Resources's fifth issue.\n\n\nImpermissibly Speculative Order\n *11 R & R Resources's sixth issue argues that the trial court's order was impermissibly speculative because it did not make\nfindings of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of R & R Resources and that its findings on irreparable injury\nare not supported by the evidence. We previously noted that article V.B.1 in these joint operating agreements states that “good\ncause” for an operator's removal includes the operator's “material breach of or inability to perform its obligations under th[e]\nagreement[s]” and found that the trial court had some evidence to support its finding that R & R Resources “failed or refused to\ncarry out its duties” to support the entry of a temporary injunction. We also found that ongoing and continuing harm resulting\nfrom an operator's refusal to relinquish operations is at least one basis for finding irreparable injury in support of a temporary\ninjunction. We overrule R & R Resources's sixth issue.\n\n\n\n                                                        CONCLUSION\n\nBased on the record before us, R & R Resources has not shown that the district court acted outside the bounds of reasonable\ndiscretion by granting the temporary injunction. Accordingly, we affirm the court's order.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The appeal has been taken by the corporation, Rattikin Title Company,\nand it and it alone is the appellant in the case before us. Therefore, of necessity we must disregard even the question of whether\nany other person, firm or corporation had the right of appeal, for only the Title Company appealed. Certainly the temporary\ninjunction is operative to restrain the attorneys, agents, servants and employees of the party enjoined under provisions of Article\n4661, R.C.S., but this would not restrain the same attorneys, etc., from performing the enjoined acts for other persons if they\nwould be legitimately performed by such other persons as their attorneys, agents or employees. We confine ourselves to the\nspecific order of the court below as same applies to the Title Company, and to the findings and conclusions of the trial judge\nrelating to and purporting to support the order's entry. Of course, we resort to the records of the pleadings and the evidence as\nnecessary to determine the propriety of such findings and conclusions and order.\n\n\nThe specific order of the court reads as follows:\n\n‘It Is Therefore Ordered that a temporary injunction be issued to continue in force and effect until this case is finally disposed of\non its merits, enjoining and restraining the Rattikin Title Company, a corporation, and any officer, director, employee, attorney\nor stockholder thereof, from preparing any legal instrument which is not for execution by Rattikin Title Company or by a person\nor persons employed by it and to which neither the Rattikin Title Company nor the Kansas City Title Insurance Company is a\nparty and in which these companies neither have nor acquire any interest in the subject matter of the instruments; and restraining\nand enjoining any officer, director, employee, attorney or stockholder of the Rattikin Title Company from giving advice, whether\noral or written, to persons who are not employees of said title companies, as to the purpose and legal effect of instruments to\nwhich neither the Rattikin Title Company nor Kansas City Title Insurance Company is a party; and such temporary injunction\nshall be binding upon all persons having notice thereof in active concert or participation with the defendant, Rattikin Title\nCompany. However, it is not intended by this order that any Notary Public who may be employed by Rattikin Title Company\nshall refrain from complying with the provisions of Article 6605, R.C.S. of Texas, in regard to taking the acknowledgment of\na married woman privily and apart from her husband.\n\n‘All relief prayed for by way of temporary injunction, which is not hereby granted, is denied.’\n\nIt is clear from the record that the appellant Title Company was the agent for the Kansas City Title Insurance Company, by\nwhich Insurance Company all the titles approved by the Title Company were insured. The Title Company was left free by\nthe order of temporary injunction to do everything for its principal, the Insurance Company it was enjoined from doing as to\nthird persons. It was also left free to do the same things for its own employees. The record reflects that the Title Company\nhad attorneys employed as its servants rather than as attorneys are ordinarily employed to perform legal services for clients.\nBy the provisions of the order of temporary injunction its attorney-employees were left free to prepare legal instruments as a\npart of any transaction to which the Title Company itself was a party, or to which the Insurance Company for which it was the\nagent was a party, or to which one of its employees was a party. Such attorney-employees were left free to make statements\nand representations regarding the purpose and effect of legal instruments (prepared by them or not) to persons they did not or\ncould not represent and to whom they owed no duty, in connection with transactions to which either the Title Company or its\nprincipal, the named Insurance Company, was a party.\n\n *951 These same attorney-employees, as well as others in the employ of the Title Company, were, as the result of the court's\norder, enjoined from preparing legal instruments which would become a part of any transaction where such privity would not\nexist. They were likewise enjoined from making statements or giving advice as to the purpose or effect of any such character\nof instrument to any person, firm or corporation other than their employer and the Insurance Company for which it was agent\nin or in connection with any transaction to which neither such employer nor said principal were privy parties.\n [2] It was the contention of the appellee that the appellant was doing and performing the very things which it was enjoined from\ndoing by the temporary injunction order.

Appellee\nsought their enjoinder as constituting the unlawful practice of law. The Texas State Bar Act, in part at least, is statutory. See\nArticle 320a-1, R.C.S. of Texas. The Rules of the State Bar of Texas, enacted as provided by Section 4 of said Article, are to\nbe found in Vernon's Annotated Texas Civil Statutes immediately following the Article. These Rules have the same force and\nlegal effect upon the matters to which they relate as the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure have to the matters to which they relate.\nBy such Rules of the State Bar of Texas ‘all persons not members of the State Bar are hereby prohibited from practicing law in\nthis State.’ The members in question are those attorneys licensed to practice law by the Supreme Court of Texas. There is no\nquestion but what the appellant Title Company is not, nor could it be, such a ‘person.’ Article XII of such Rules provides for an\nagency of the State Bar, to-wit: the Grievance Committee (which is the appellee herein and which was the plaintiff-petitioner\nin the court below) to prosecute appropriate suits against persons, firms and corporations other than the members of the State\nBar for the purpose of suppressing, prohibiting or preventing the unauthorized practice of law by such others.\n\n\nThe ‘practice of law’ is not defined by any statute presently in effect. This has been true since the repeal in 1949 of Article\n430a of Vernon's Annotated Penal Code. Even when that Article was in effect, however, it was held that it was within the\npower and authority of the judicial branch of the government to determine what services and what acts constitute the practice\nof law.

Stewart Abstract Co. v. Judicial Commission\n *952 of Jefferson County, supra. See also the cases cited at page 952 of 179 S.W.2d of the opinion in the Hexter Title &\nAbstract Co. v. Grievance Committee, Etc., case, supra.\n\n [6] [7] It is thus clear that the Title Company has, perforce the temporary injunction order, been enjoined from doing specific\nthings which our courts have declared to constitute the practice of law. Such things, when done by a party such as the Title\nCompany, are illegal acts. If the pleadings alleged the present commission of such acts or a future intent on the part of the Title\nCompany to commit such acts unless it is restrained from so doing, the Grievance Committee was entitled to a hearing upon its\napplication for a temporary injunction. As applied to the instant controversy, if upon that hearing the evidence introduced by\nit showed that such illegal acts are occurring or will occur in the absence of restraint, then the record shows that the Grievance\nCommittee has demonstrated the existence of a probable right on the part of the organization for which it acts, the State Bar, to\nhave an injunction writ issue, and a probable injury to that body should injunction writ be withheld.\n\n\nThe question of whether the very acts enjoined constitute the unlawful practice of law is not new in Texas. It is settled law that\nthese acts constitute such unlawful practice when performed by an incorporated ‘Title and Abstract Company.’ In the case of\nHexter Title & Abstract Co. v. Grievance Committee, Etc., supra, Chief Justice Alexander had a case which bore directly upon\nthe question posed in the present instance. The Hexter Company was incorporated for the identical purposes that the Rattikin\nTitle Company was incorporated (to-wit: to make, compile and own abstracts of title to lands and liens of all character on any\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In the Hexter case, however, there was no third ingredient, to-wit: a law firm which purported to do all the things\nwhich constituted the practice of law. In the instant case this ingredient has been added in the law firm of Rattikin and Spiller,\nattorneys. In the Hexter case, all those acts constituting the practice of law (and which the authorities have held to constitute such\npractice) were done and performed by the Hexter Company through attorneys solely employed by it in its legal department. The\nHexter Company defended that very similar suit on the theory, in part, that its acts through its agents who were also attorneys\ndid not constitute the practice of law because there was no charge made for their services. The Supreme Court readily perceived\nand held that the work of such agent-attorneys was paid for by the Hexter Company's customers through the consideration paid\nthe Hexter Company for other express services. In the present instance, the Title Company attempted to refrain from performing\nsuch acts, channeling their performance into the hands of attorneys, particularly Rattikin and Spiller. Messrs. Rattikin and\nSpiller are attorneys, and their association together is as a law firm which purports to do all of such things for clients which were\nheld by the Hexter case to constitute the unlawful practice of law by the Title Company. These things the law firm performs for\nspecific charges as attorney's fees. Certain of the very acts the Title Company was enjoined from performing,-the preparation\nof the instruments for conveyancing and for mortgaging and in the curing of titles,-were acts such Title Company contends it\ndid not perform. It contends that the independent firm of Rattikin and Spiller performed such acts. But the record reflects that\nmany of such acts were frequently and more or less continuously performed by the Title Company.\n\nAnother theory upon which the Hexter Company sought to defend the suit against it was based upon the premise that it, the\nHexter Company, was a party to the negotiation and consummation of a particular transaction, culmination of which was its\n *953 issuance of a title insurance policy,-and if such a transaction be not properly considered as one and indivisible, then the\ntransaction to which it was a party, to-wit: the examination of title to determine that it was one which it would insure with the\ninsurance company for which it was the agent,-and the act of effectuating such title insurance, necessarily entailed the action\nof its attorney-employees in the preparation of the instruments of conveyance, etc., and in the curing of title defects, and in\nthe supervision and direction of the acts involved in conveyancing, mortgaging, etc. The Supreme Court held, in effect, that\nin the issuance of a title policy, to which the title company would be a party or be acting for a party, the seller would not be a\nparty to that transaction though he paid the premium therefor, and that in the conveyance of real estate to a buyer by a seller,\nthe title company would not be a party to that transaction for it neither had nor acquired any interest in the property by reason\nthereof. In his opinion, Judge Alexander pointed out by analogy to circumstances theorized in certain extremes the legal as well\nas practical necessity of considering certain facets of the involved negotiation and consummation of modern day real estate\nconveyancing and financing, etc., as several and distinct transactions-not necessarily incident to one another or inclusive one of\nthe other. The reasoning of the opinion readily discloses that as to a mortgage of the property the seller is not necessarily a party\nto the mortgage transaction, especially where there was no mortgage on the property prior to the title conveyance,-nor would\nthe buyer or seller necessarily be a party to a mortgagee's title policy issued only to protect the mortgagee. The Supreme Court\nheld that it would only be as to transactions in which the Hexter Company was in privity as a party that the company's attorney-\nemployees or other agents could prepare instruments whereby it either had or acquired an interest in property by reason thereof,\nand could make statement as to the purpose and effect of such instruments to third persons. In the present instance, there is no\ndirectly advanced defense by the Rattikin Title Company based upon this same defensive theory, though the ‘thread’ containing\nthis thought on its part runs through all its argument as contained in its brief.\n\nIn the Hexter case, the title company frankly did the things constituting the practice of law, seeking primarily to justify the\nperformance of these things by refraining (as it believed) from making any charge therefor, and in the alternative, to justify\ntheir performance by contending that it was a party to the single transaction involved, or all of the several transactions involved.\nHere the Rattikin Title Company has sought to refrain from doing these things as a corporation, acting as it must through its\nagents, servants, etc.,-and instead has sought to cast the responsibility for the performance of such acts upon attorneys who are\nnot acting as its employees. In most instances it sought to cast such responsibility upon the law firm of Rattikin and Spiller.\nThe question thus resolved is whether the Title Company actually has refrained from such actions or whether it is doing them\ndespite any intent not to. As we have stated, the record demonstrates that it has done them and is doing them. In the main, it\nappears that such action was inadvertent, but it also appears that some acts were intentionally performed through a mistaken\nopinion as to what constitutes the practice of law. The principal instances where the latter appears seem to be those in which\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Both members of the law firm were administrators of the business of *954 the Title Company. One of them\nwas its chief executive. The law firm had numerous employees who were also employees of the Title Company, and many of\nthese worked indiscriminately among and alongside the numberous employees of the Title Company alone, as well as among\nand alongside the numerous employees of the law firm alone. Adding to the difficulty was the fact that each of the members\nof the law firm, as administrators of the business of the Title Company, conducted the affairs of the Title Company from the\nsame desk from which he conducted the business of the law firm. The public was misled, as well as even the clients of the law\nfirm and the customers of the Title Company. In the record we see instances where the Title Company is frequently directed\nto do certain things which could only be properly done by an attorney, and we have no doubt but what members of the law\nfirm (and its exclusive employees) were directed to do things properly done only by the Title Company. There is no doubt what\nin the case of any similar interrelated activity of a sizeable law firm with a title company of a size comparable to that of the\nRattikin Title Company, with any lengthy period of such intermingling of personnel one would always discover that certain\nof the exclusive employees of the Title Company would find themselves doing legal work for the clients of the law firm, and\nseveral of those exclusively employed by the law firm would find themselves performing work for the Title Company.\n [8] In the present instance, such interrelated activity by intermingled personnel resulted, as disclosed by the record, in the\nRattikin Title Company (though its employees) performing acts which constituted the practice of law, to-wit: preparing legal\ninstruments for persons and corporations other than itself and its principal in transactions whereby it neither had nor acquired any\ninterest in the subject matter of the transaction,-and also resulted in it (through its employees) giving advice or making statements\nto persons other than its principal and its employees as to the purpose and effect of legal instruments in transactions to which\nneither the Title Company nor its principal was a party. These very acts on the part of the Title Company's employees constituted\nthe unauthorized and illegal practice of law by the Title Company, and the trial court properly enjoined their continuance. The\nTitle Company indirectly profited by such acts in the same manner that the Title Company profited in the Hexter case. That the\nTitle Company might have committed or performed such acts inadvertently or unintentionally or through mistake constitutes\nno defense. It matters not why the acts were being done. That is not a matter for our inquiry and in this instance, at least, excuse\nfor the commission of such acts is not before us.\n\n\nIndeed, so long as the system of commingling the employees of the law firm with those of the Title Company shall persist,\nand so long as the system of doing business for both firms through individuals serving both (from the same ‘side of the table’)\nshall persist, we readily perceive how-in view of the record's disclosure as to the volume of business handled by both the Title\nCompany and law firm-at least some of the acts constituting the unauthorized practice of law will again, in time, be performed\nor committed by the Title Company even should it in good faith do all things possible to prevent such. If such acts should\nrecur, in view of any subsisting order enjoining them, their performance would be imprudent conduct on the part of the Title\nCompany, to say the least, and, to paraphrase Justice Holmes, should the Title Company walk too near the line that divides\nprudent from imprudent conduct, it takes the risk, and if it oversteps the line, it must bear the consequences with fortitude.\n\nBesides its points of error which are disposed of by what we have said above, the appellant Title Company has assigned\nadditional points wherein it contends that there was no urgent necessity for granting the temporary injunction and that since its\ngranting virtually accomplished the object of the suit, it should not have been granted. The Title Company contends that the\nmain objective of the Grievance Committee is to prevent the lawyers who work part time for *955 the Title Company from\nworking part time for the law firm of Rattikin and Spiller. We do not view this as the Grievance Committee's objective, but\nwhether it is or not, such was not enjoined by the court's order.\n\nAs to the urgent necessity warranting the granting of a temporary injunction, the Title Company states, ‘The rule for which\nwe are now contending, namely that important and new questions of law should not be answered in a hearing on a temporary\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Such is demonstrated\nby the authorities, including the Hexter case. It is also our opinion that the facts proved upon the temporary injunction hearing\nwere sufficient to entitle the trial judge to believe and decide that there was a continuing violation of the substantive law.\nThe order of temporary injunction commands, in effect, that the Title Company ‘cease its unlawful action and desist from any\nresumption pending a trial of the merits of the case.’ We recognize that in the hearing upon an application for a temporary\ninjunction the only question before the trial court is the right of the applicant to a preservation of the status quo of the subject\nmatter of the suit pending a final trial of the case on its merits.

But in an injunction case wherein the very\nacts sought to be enjoined are acts which prima facie constitute the violation of expressed law, the status quo could never be a\ncondition of affairs where the respondent would be permitted to continue the acts constituting that violation.

Gifford v. State, supra.\n\n\nBy a cross-point upon the appeal, the Grievance Committee contends that the trial court erred in refusing to enjoin the Title\nCompany from acting as the attorney for mortgage loan companies to the extent of determining that certain legal instruments\nare in proper form before delivering over the money lent by them to other parties (contingent upon and in connection with\npending purchase transactions) and held by the Title Company as an escrow agent.\n [12] [13] [14] The cross-point presents a question of law not heretofore determined and not patently illegal. The right the\nGrievance Committee contends for will admit of doubt. The trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, could therefore not be\nsaid to have abused that discretion in refusing to stay such action on the part of the Title Company in the order which he did enter\nupon temporary injunction proceedings. See 43 C.J.S., Injunctions, s 19, sub. (c), p. 434. We have no function on this appeal\nother than to determine whether or not the trial judge clearly abused his discretion. *956 Texas Foundries v.

Inasmuch as T & R Associates, Inc., has stipulated its violations\nof the ordinances, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the temporary injunction to maintain the status\nquo. Affirmed.\n\nT & R Associates, Inc., operated a lounge known as Scarlett O'Hara's in Space 15-A, Sunset Center, an area of the City of\nAmarillo zoned as “General Retail.” Alleging that the lounge operated in violation of zoning and building code ordinances, the\nCity instituted this litigation. By its action, the City sought a temporary injunction, to be made permanent after a final hearing,\ndirecting T & R Associates, Inc., to cease and desist the lounge operation until and unless the ordinances were complied with\nby (a) obtaining a Special Use Permit and (b) providing two properly constructed and approved exits on the premises.\n\nResponding, T & R Associates, Inc., pleaded, among other matters, that the City was estopped to seek, and was barred by\nlaches, waiver, ratification and the clean hands doctrine from seeking, the equitable injunctive relief. T & R Associates, Inc.,\nthen pleaded for, together with other relief, a temporary injunction which, in essence, would restrain the City from impeding\nor terminating the operation of the lounge.\n\nHearing the temporary injunction evidence, the trial court found, inter alia, that:\n\n(1) The operation of the lounge in a general retail zoning district without a Special Use Permit is a violation of the zoning\nlaws of the City;\n\n(2) The lounge is operated without having a minimum of two properly constructed and approved exits in violation of the Uniform\nBuilding Code adopted by the City; and\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The execution of the order requiring a minimum\nof two exits was stayed for a period of forty days to allow T & R Associates, Inc., to comply with the Uniform Building Code.\n\nT & R Associates, Inc., perfected an appeal. During the time allowed for preparation of the appellate record, the court reporter's\nnotes and transcription of the evidence heard by the trial court were stolen. The parties elected to proceed on appeal with a\nwritten “Stipulation of Evidence,” the effect of which is an agreement to some facts established by, but a disagreement about\nother portions of, the evidence adduced in the trial court. Nevertheless, by the following numbered stipulations, the parties\nagree the uncontroverted evidence was that:\n\n  4. T AND R ASSOCIATES, INC., operates a tavern or a lounge at Space 15-A, Sunset Center, as those words are defined\n  in Chapter 26-11 of the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n  5. The operation of a tavern or a lounge in a General Retail zoning district is prohibited by the provisions of Chapter 26 of\n  the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n   *180 11. The exit doors to Space 15-A are not in compliance with Chapter 5 of the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n  12. RON TWITTY testified that T AND R agreed to bring its exit doors into compliance with the Municipal Code if it is\n  allowed to continue operating as a tavern in Space 15-A;\n\n  13. T AND R ASSOCIATES, INC., has, on two occasions, made application to THE CITY OF AMARILLO for a specific\n  use permit for the operation of the lounge at the premises in question as provided by s 26-22 of the Amarillo Municipal Code;\n\n  16. THE CITY OF AMARILLO City Commission has denied each application for a Specific Use Permit filed by T AND\n  R ASSOCIATES, INC.\n\nIn pursuing its appeal, T & R Associates, Inc., has drafted twelve points of error, two of which have five subpoints, directed\nto its basic contentions that it was, and the City was not, entitled to temporary injunctive relief, and that the injunction order\nupset the status quo between the parties. By its points, as well as by its live trial pleadings, T & R Associates, Inc., does not\nquestion the validity of the City's ordinances; instead, it claims the City is estopped, barred and lacks clean hands to enforce\nthe ordinances against T & R Associates, Inc.\n\n [1] The grounds interposed by T & R Associates, Inc., to escape the force of the ordinances it admittedly violated may\nnot be entertained. These grounds embrace matters which go to the merits of the underlying litigation, and undertaking their\ndetermination would be to give full consideration to the merits of the entire lawsuit, thereby denying a conventional trial on\nthe merits. In an appeal from an interlocutory order granting or denying a temporary injunction, the merits of the entire suit\nneither are presented for appellate review nor may be considered by the appellate court.

We address: (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion in enjoining former employees from\nusing information regarding, or working on, three types of motor vehicles they had worked on for their former employer; and\n(2) whether the temporary injunction is overbroad. We reform, and affirm the temporary injunction as reformed.\n\n\n\n                                                            Facts\n\nIn 1991, John Hennessey founded Hennessey Motorsports, Inc. (appellee), which specializes in high performance upgrades for\na variety of vehicles, including the Dodge Viper Roadster and Dodge Viper GTS coupe. By May 1993, appellee had designed\nits first custom performance and enhancement package for a Dodge Viper. 2 In late August 1993, appellee hired Roy Terpstra\nto assist in meeting the increased demand for the Venom upgrades and to perform research and development. In April 1994,\nappellee hired Joe Terpstra to again meet increased demand for its products.\n\nIn 1996, the Terpstras incorporated their part-time body shop as T–N–T Motorsports, Inc. Prior to T–N–T's incorporation, the\nTerpstras worked for T–N–T as well as for appellee, with appellee's knowledge. During this time period and with appellee's\nconsent, T–N–T manufactured and designed products that it sold to appellee for use in connection with the Venom upgrades.\nAlso with appellee's knowledge, T–N–T performed engine modifications for customers other than appellee's, although not on\nVipers.\n\nOn May 20 1997, the Terpstras terminated their employment without notice to appellee, and began full-time employment with\nT–N–T. On May 30, 1997, Roy Terpstra attended a Viper Club meeting in Florida at which he distributed T–N–T business\ncards and T–N–T brochures advertising the availability of high grade performance upgrades for Vipers. Roy Terpstra told a\nprivate investigator hired by appellee that the T–N–T upgrades were identical to the Venom upgrades, that he had learned how\nto create these packages as an employee of appellee, and that he offered the same upgrades as appellee but at a better price.\nHe said at least three of appellee's customers had already moved their *21 business to T–N–T. He also told the investigator\nthat appellee was his only competitor.\n\nIn addition to using the same products and vendors, T–N–T also planned to perform the same tests and have an identical warranty\non its cars as appellee, and use the same type of equipment that appellee used. T–N–T intended to use a similar name for its\npackages (“Serpent” instead of “Venom”).\n\nIn June 1997, appellee sued appellants and successfully obtained temporary injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In point\nof error six, appellants complain the court erred as a matter of law in determining that appellee met the requisite elements\nof preliminary injunctive relief. In points of error seven through 12, appellants challenge the trial court's findings regarding\nappellee's confidential information, and assert no identifiable “trade secrets” exist that might be subject to misappropriation.\n\nThe basis of appellee's underlying suit is that, by virtue of their employment with appellee, the Terpstras acquired confidential\ninformation, 3 which they then used to compete directly with appellee. Appellee sued appellants alleging misappropriation\nand conversion of confidential information, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, breach of confidential relationship,\ntortious interference with prospective relations, civil conspiracy, fraud or fraudulent concealment, and negligence or negligent\nmisrepresentation.\n\nAppellants' concerns are for their right to earn a livelihood in their area of expertise in competition with their former employer.\nAppellants invoke the free enterprise system as a basis for limiting the general right of former employees to wide-open\ncompetition with former employers only where employers have obtained: (1) covenants not to compete; or (2) confidentiality\nagreements.

K & G Oil Tool, 314 S.W.2d at 785; Gonzales, 791 S.W.2d at 264.\nFurther, when an effort is made to keep material important to a particular business from competitors, trade secret protection is\nwarranted.

They also contend that a lack of secrecy prevents\nappellee's alleged confidential information from being trade secrets. They assert that the specifications of the performance\nupgrades and the identities of appellee's customers and vendors are available to the public, and are common knowledge through\npublication of various magazine articles about appellee's upgrades and via appellee's Internet website. However, Roy Terpstra\nadmitted John Hennessey told him the information he learned on behalf of appellee about designing, modifying, and building\nthe Venom upgrades was proprietary.\n\nThe idea of upgrading the performance of any vehicle is not a new idea. However, the specific means by which appellee upgrades\nthe performance of the Vipers is not common knowledge. Hennessey explained that through years of trial and error, appellee\n *23 builds the “fastest normally aspirated 4 Vipers.” He knows which components work and which do not. Appellee spent a\nsubstantial amount of time and money developing the upgrade packages that would fit the exact needs of its clientele. Hennessey\ntestified that the component parts used by appellee in its upgrade packages are confidential. Many components are not available\nand need to be built from the ground up. Although materials for these parts are purchased from outside vendors, most parts\nare then modified to fit together and work in concert with all the other components to achieve the desired horsepower, so that\nthe car performs reliably and is cost efficient and profitable. Even appellee's customers are not told the exact specifications of\nthe work done on their vehicles.\n\nHennessey testified it has taken him four years to compile a list of vendors he considers capable of providing the materials and\nservice he needs, who have the best prices, and who are the most reliable. Although retail prices are public, the overall cost\nof the Venom upgrades, the cost of items sold separately, the cost of components and sub-assemblies, and the cost of labor\nassociated with assembling and process development is not public.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The magazine articles and appellee's website do not reveal how the\nvarious parts are assembled, or explain the process of designing or modifying the various parts that go into a Venom upgrade.\nThere is no access to this information except through appellee.\n\nHennessey testified that only certain people within the company have access to and were trained to use its computer systems.\nComputers containing certain information are located in a locked room separate from employees. Access to the customer\ndatabase requires a password. Appellee's customer database contains information such as names, addresses, and telephone\nnumbers, the types of vehicles they own, whether other upgrades have been done on the vehicle, birthdays, and e-mail addresses.\nHennessey testified that some customers even leave instructions not to tell their wives how much money was spent on the\nupgrades. Although appellee purchases a list of new vehicle buyers from an outside source, this information is contained in a\nseparate database from its customer list. The customer list has been compiled over a four-year period, and appellee does not\nsell it to outsiders.\n\nAppellee's shop is a large, non-air-conditioned airplane hangar. Hennessey stated the shop is at a remote location because he\ndoes not want off-the-street customers wandering in. The airport has a secured access gate from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. that\nrequires a code for entry. Non-employees are allowed in the shop area only after they have checked in with the office. Cylinder\nheads and specific components are kept in a separate area from the shop.\n\nThe record indicates the information about the specifics of the Venom upgrades, appellee's customers, and its vendors is\nconfidential and intended to be kept a secret. The court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellee had shown a\nprobability of success in proving that its confidential information deserved trade secret protection.\n\n\nB.

Manufacturers\nHanover, 819 S.W.2d at 610.\n\n [17] [18] [19] A probable right of success on the merits is shown by alleging a cause of *24 action and presenting evidence\nthat tends to sustain it.

A legal remedy is inadequate if damages are difficult to calculate or their award may\ncome too late. Miller Paper, 901 S.W.2d at 597.\n\n [20] Prior to leaving appellee's employ, Roy Terpstra was the director of Viper operations, and he admitted this was a position\nof trust. He performed specialized performance upgrades on vehicles, and designed, developed, tested, and assembled parts\nfor the Venom upgrades. He worked with Hennessey in strategizing product development. He admitted that both T–N–T and\nappellee were in the business of custom high performance upgrades.\n\nAlthough he had the knowledge to build the same various upgrades done by appellee for other vehicles prior to his employment\nwith appellee, Roy Terpstra had never designed, modified, or built certain parts specifically for the Viper. It was while employed\nby appellee that he learned about Viper upgrades. He located vendors who could fabricate, modify, or supply parts for the\nupgrades for different types of vehicles, and he knew who were the best and most reliable. He also learned how to increase the\nhorsepower of a vehicle, such as the Viper, because of the research and development done at appellee's shop. He admitted that\nthe Venom upgrades took time and money to develop, and it was appellee who paid for product development.\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

But a\nformer employee may not use, for his own advantage and to the detriment of his former employer, confidential information\nor trade secrets acquired by or imparted to him in the course of his employment. Rugen, 864 S.W.2d at 551. “Injunctive relief\nis recognized as a proper remedy to protect confidential information and trade secrets.” Id. The record supports the court's\nconclusion that appellee demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims against appellants.\n\nThe record indicates that appellants possess appellee's confidential information and are in a position to use it to compete directly\nwith appellee. Under these circumstances, it is likely appellants will use the information to appellee's detriment. The record\nsupports the court's conclusion that use of this information by appellants to perform services on the two types of Dodge Vipers\nor the Mitsubishi 3000 GT poses an inherent threat to the disclosure or use of appellee's trade secrets.\n\n [21] Appellants argue that any damages suffered by appellee are compensable through money damages, and, therefore,\nappellee has not demonstrated that no adequate remedy at law exists. Injunctive relief is proper to prevent a party, which has\nappropriated another's trade secrets, from gaining an unfair market advantage. The only effective relief available to appellee is\nto restrain appellants' use of its trade secrets and confidential information pending trial. At the time of the injunction hearing,\nappellee had over 20 Vipers in its shop. Hennessey stated that if the Venom upgrades could be obtained anywhere, there would\nbe no reason for people to send their Vipers to appellee. He testified that if the confidential information was distributed, appellee\nwould lose its advantage. He estimated that appellee's gross sales for 1997 would drop from approximately $4 million to about\n$2 million. He also said the loss of good will was immeasurable. The potential damage to appellee's business cannot be easily\ncalculated; therefore, a legal remedy is inadequate.\n\nWe hold that appellee satisfied its burden so that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the temporary injunction\nagainst appellants. Accordingly, we overrule points of error one through 12.\n\n\n\n                                                    Injunction Overbreadth\n\nIn point of error thirteen, appellants contend the court granted relief that was not specifically sought by appellee. Specifically,\nappellants assert the decretal paragraphs of the injunction make no mention of the confidential information as defined by the\ncourt. *25 In point of error fourteen, appellants contend the court granted broader relief than was necessary. Appellants argue\nthat the injunction is not limited to appellee's alleged trade secrets or confidential information. Instead, appellants assert, the\ninjunction restrains not only them, but other nondisclosed and nonascertainable entities from disclosing, using, selling, or testing\nany information related to the two types of Dodge Vipers or the Mitsubishi 3000 GT. Appellants also contend the injunction\nprevents them and various other parties from working on or providing any type of service for Dodge Viper GTS, Dodge Viper\nRoadster, or Mitsubishi 3000 GT vehicles. Appellants assert that, read literally, the injunction would prevent former customers\nof appellants from even changing the oil or rotating the tires on their own cars.\n\nRule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\n\n  Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in\n  terms; shall describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be\n  restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and\n  upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service\n  or otherwise.\n\n  Every order granting a temporary injunction shall include an order setting the cause for trial on the merits with respect to the\n  ultimate relief sought. The appeal of a temporary injunction shall constitute no cause for delay of the trial.\n\nTEX.R. CIV. P. 683.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Certain corporate investors contracted with a group\nof Austin gynecologists and obstetricians to open a unique medical facility housing a hospital, clinic, and doctors' offices, all\ndedicated to women's health care needs. Appellants are “the Investors” who owned and operated the facility; appellees are\n“the Doctors” who located their offices in the facility and sent their patients to its hospital. When the facility continued to lose\nmoney, the Investors decided to close the hospital. The Doctors responded by suing for breach of contract and fraud and seeking\na temporary injunction to prevent the Investors from closing the hospital pending a trial on the merits, which is scheduled for\nAugust 7, 2000. The trial court granted the Doctors' application for a temporary injunction. In eight points of error, the Investors\nbring this consolidated, interlocutory appeal challenging both the order granting the injunction and a subsequent order denying\ntheir motion to dissolve the injunction. 1 We will affirm both orders.\n\n\n\n                                                        BACKGROUND\n\nIn 1995, the Investors 2 approached Margaret Thompson and Linda Litzinger, doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology,\nwith the concept of a multi-service women's health care center to be known as Renaissance Women's Center of Austin (the\nCenter). The two-story facility would offer a women's hospital on the first floor and physicians' offices and a clinic on the\nsecond floor. Thompson and Litzinger decided to commit to the project and on October 11, 1995, entered into a lease and\nletter agreement (the Agreement) with the Investors memorializing their commitment *575 to the contemplated Center. 3 The\nAgreement provides in relevant part:\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In late 1999, the Investors decided to close the hospital. Upon learning of\nthe Investors' intention, the Doctors filed a lawsuit on December 10, pleading breach of contract and fraud. The Doctors claimed\nin part that the Investors had breached paragraph five of the Agreement by failing to use reasonable efforts throughout the term\nof the lease to certify the Center as a hospital approved by all insurance companies and health maintenance organizations for\nwhich the Doctors are approved providers. The Doctors also sought a temporary and a permanent injunction to prevent the\nclosing of the Center. In their request for a temporary injunction, the Doctors claimed that they “have and are suffering harm\nand irreparable harm as a result of the actions of [the Investors]” and sought to enjoin the Investors “from closing the hospital,\nselling the hospital, reducing the hospital staff or nurses, or reducing the quality of women's health care services” during the\npendency of the suit.\n\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court granted the temporary injunction. In support of its decision, the court made the following\nfindings: (1) the Doctors have a probable right of recovery; (2) the Doctors will suffer imminent, irreparable harm in the absence\nof the injunction; (3) the Doctors have no adequate remedy at law for their interim damages, and their financial damages will\nbe immeasurable; and (4) the balance of hardships and the public interest favors an injunction maintaining the status quo. Until\njudgment is rendered in the pending suit, the Investors are enjoined from closing the hospital or changing its status from the\nwomen's health care hospital that was in operation as of the date the Doctors filed their petition. The trial court further ordered the\nInvestors to “continue to use reasonable efforts to obtain, and maintain in full force and effect ... written agreements certifying\nthe hospital *576 ... as an approved hospital by all health care insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, health\ncare plans or other health care benefit providers for which [the Doctors] are approved providers.” Having lost at the hearing,\nthe Investors filed a motion to dissolve the temporary injunction based on fundamental error and changed circumstances. The\ntrial court denied the motion. The Investors now appeal both the trial-court order granting the temporary injunction and the\norder refusing to dissolve it.\n\n\n\n                                                           DISCUSSION\n\nStandard of Review\n [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a trial on the merits.

A mandatory injunction, urge the Investors, should be denied unless the right to relief is clear and compelling and\na case of extreme necessity or hardship is presented. See Rhodia, Inc. v.

If the effect of the order implies that the Investors must\nseek funding, this implication is only incidental to the order's primary function of preventing the Investors from closing the\nhospital, and we will not presume such an order is mandatory.

Therefore, we will uphold the trial court's\njudgment on any legal theory supported by the record, indulging all reasonable presumptions in favor of there having been\nsufficient evidence to sustain the trial court's judgment. See Martin, 671 S.W.2d at 708–09.\n\n\n [14] Here, the wrongful conduct alleged was a breach of contract. 5 This claim rests on the Investors' alleged failure *578\nto use reasonable efforts to maintain written agreements with insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. The\nevidence adduced in support of the wrongful conduct included the 1995 Agreement. Based on the Doctors' cause of action for\nbreach of contract and the evidence adduced to sustain it, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the\nDoctors had a probable right to recovery. 6\n\n [15] [16] The Doctors also adduced evidence of irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. The Doctors'\nburden was to show that an award of damages would be inadequate for the harm suffered; they were not required to show that\nan award of damages would be wholly ineffectual. See Walling, 863 S.W.2d at 58 (“Simply because the applicant ... asks only\nfor damages as ultimate relief does not guarantee that damages are completely adequate as a remedy.”); Roland Mach. Co. v.\nDresser Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445078\"><a href=\"/opinion/445078/roland-machinery-company-v-dresser-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">749</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386 (7th Cir.1984). An award of damages may be deficient if the nature of the Doctors'\nlosses makes damages difficult to calculate. See Roland Mach. Co., 749 F.2d at 386. The trial court's order reflects that if the\nhospital were to close or change its status from a women's health care hospital, the Doctors would be unable “to provide to their\npregnant mothers the care that they now receive and expect [or] to ensure the utmost safety of those mothers upon the delivery\nof their babies.” One of the witnesses, Dr. Thompson, noted two instances where the ability of the Doctors to rush the patients\ndownstairs to the hospital within minutes possibly saved the lives of the babies being delivered. The Doctors also provided\nsome evidence that other area facilities may not have the capacity to accommodate all of the Center's patients. 7 This evidence\nwas sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the Doctors would likely suffer irreparable injury and that the nature of the\nDoctors' and their patients' losses would make damages incapable of calculation.\n\n[17]    [18] The Investors also complain that the district court erred in considering Universal Health Services' financial status in\nbalancing the hardships and concluding that the equities weighed in favor of granting the temporary injunction. 8 In considering\nan application for a temporary injunction, a trial court “balances the equities of the parties and the resulting conveniences and\nhardships.” Surko Enter., 782 S.W.2d at 225. The trial court here balanced the hardship to the Doctors, as well as the public\ninterest of the patients and their babies, against the hardship to the Investors in maintaining the status quo until August 7, the\ndate set for the trial. In doing so, the court noted that over 1000 babies were scheduled to be delivered during the eight months\nbefore the trial. The court also acknowledged some evidence that other area facilities may not be adequately equipped to handle\n *579 the delivery and care of all of those babies. The trial court based its decision to maintain the status quo on the health\nrisks involved if the hospital were closed. Indeed, the court's order states, “Maintaining the status quo of the hospital as the\nRenaissance Women's Center as a women's hospital will ensure that the quality of care these mothers and their babies expect\nto receive will not be compromised. The equities are balanced in favor of the [Doctors] because of the risks involved in closing\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

While there were no doubt equities on both sides, we cannot say the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in balancing them in favor of the Doctors and their patients.\n\nApplying the appropriate standard of review and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's order, as\nwe must, we hold that appellants have not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the temporary injunction.\nOur holding is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in attempting to preserve the status quo until August 7,\nthe scheduled date of the trial. We note that if the Doctors had lost on the motion for a temporary injunction, the Investors\nhad closed the hospital, and the trial court later determined that the Investors had breached the terms of the Agreement, the\nremedy of compelling the Investors to comply for a while longer with the reasonable efforts mandated in the Agreement would\nno longer be viable. While the Investors may have presented conflicting evidence in support of their claim that they should not\nbe required to continue operating the hospital or that they have used reasonable efforts in accordance with the Agreement, we\nwill not address the merits of the Investors' defenses on this interlocutory appeal.\n\n\nSpecificity of the Temporary Injunction\n [19] [20] In its first and sixth points of error, the Investors argue that the trial court erred in granting an open-ended, over-\nbroad injunction requiring the Investors to continue operations without specifying how the operations should be funded. The\nlaw in Texas regarding the specificity of temporary injunctions is that they must be\n\n             as definite, clear and precise as possible and when practicable [they] should inform the defendant of the\n             acts he is restrained from doing, without calling on him for inferences or conclusions about which persons\n             might well differ and without leaving anything for further hearing. But obviously the injunction must be\n             in broad enough terms to prevent repetition of the evil sought to be stopped, whether the repetition be in\n             form identical to that employed prior to the injunction or (what is far more likely) in somewhat different\n             form calculated to circumvent the injunction as written.\n\nSan Antonio Bar Ass'n v.

The trial court was not required to examine the\nspecific details associated with running the hospital prior to December 10 in order to spell out what is necessary to maintain the\nstatus quo. A temporary injunction should not be greatly concerned with “rights of the defendants that are asserted largely in the\nabstract. Otherwise, it would probably take longer to write the decree than it would to try the case and the injunction might well\nbecome unintelligible and self-destructive.” Id.; see Wesware, Inc. v.

Blessing provided testimony indicating that Southwest Seton would have the capacity to accommodate between 800\nand 1400 deliveries per year, thereby refuting the Doctors' evidence of insufficient capacity in the area hospitals. It was within\nthe trial court's discretion to determine whether additional evidence regarding capacity was necessary to the due administration\nof justice. The court was under no duty to allow the Investors another opportunity to litigate the same issue prior to the trial on\nthe merits. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the evidence. The Investors' seventh\npoint of error is overruled.\n\n\nChanged Circumstances and Fundamental Error\n [24] [25] [26] In their final point of error, the Investors insist that the court erred in denying their motion to dissolve the\ntemporary injunction in light of newly discovered evidence, changed circumstances, and fundamental error. A determination\nof whether to dissolve a temporary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not overrule its\ndetermination absent an abuse of discretion.

The new evidence consisted of testimony from Laraine McIntyre, the Director of Women's\nHealth Services for St. David's Hospital. McIntyre testified that St. David's Hospital has sufficient capacity to deliver the babies\nscheduled to be born at the Center *581 prior to the August 7 trial on the merits. This evidence, however, is not evidence\nof changed circumstances or of fundamental error. The Investors did not demonstrate how this evidence altered the status\nquo. Instead, McIntyre's testimony was merely additional conflicting evidence regarding the capacity of other hospitals to\naccommodate the Center's patients. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to dissolve when it was\npresented with additional conflicting evidence.\n\nThe Investors also argue that since the granting of the temporary injunction, the hospital's operating losses have increased. In\ntheir motion to dissolve, the Investors contend that the trial court did not clearly provide in its order how they should continue to\nfund the hospital operations. However, prior to the granting of the temporary injunction, the trial court was made aware of the\nhospital's operating losses. Upon balancing the equities, the trial court determined that a temporary injunction was necessary\nto preserve the status quo pending a trial on the merits. The Investors did not provide any new evidence of conditions that\naltered the status quo or revealed fundamental error. As we stated in Tober, the trial court has no duty to reconsider the validity\nof its original grant of the temporary injunction absent such new evidence. See Tober, 668 S.W.2d at 835.

See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 51.014(a)(4) (West Supp.2000).\n2       Initially, Renaissance Centers for Women, Inc., an Oklahoma based corporation, approached the Doctors with the concept for a\n        women's health care facility. That corporation was subsequently acquired by another corporation, RCW of Edmond, Inc. (RCW).\n        RCW then created a limited partnership, Renaissance Women's Center of Austin, L.P., for the purpose of developing the proposed\n        facility in Austin. After the facility was completed, a limited liability corporation, Renaissance Women's Center in Austin, L.L.C.,\n        was formed to own and operate the first floor hospital. The limited partnership retained ownership of the second floor doctors' offices.\n        For the sake of convenience, we refer to all of these entities collectively as the Investors.\n3       Although Thompson and Litzinger were the only two doctors involved at this stage of the Center's development, the 1995 letter\n        agreement and all subsequent agreements were binding on any of the physicians employed by them, including all the doctor appellees.\n4       The parties subsequently entered into a Second Agreement and a Second Modification and Ratification of Lease Agreement. The\n        primary purpose of these agreements was to reflect subsequent name changes of the parties and to affirm their respective interests and\n        obligations. The Second Modification and Ratification of Lease Agreement also acknowledged the Investors' satisfaction of certain\n        obligations under the 1995 Agreement.\n5       The Investors also argue that injunctions are not appropriate remedies for breach of contract claims because money damages are\n        sufficient to compensate for these claims. The supreme court addressed this issue in Walling v. Metcalfe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429609\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429609/walling-v-metcalfe/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58\n        (Tex.1993), in which it held that a trial court may grant a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo even though the cause of\n        action is for damages resulting from breach of contract and does not request equitable relief.\n6       Our decision on this point is not a reflection on the merits of the case. We merely examine the evidence through the filter of an abuse\n        of discretion standard in upholding the trial court's decision.\n7       The Investors claim that because subsequent evidence conclusively disproved the Doctors' evidence of lack of capacity in area\n        hospitals, the court erroneously relied on lack of capacity as a basis for the temporary injunction. However, the Investors did not\n        produce the subsequent evidence regarding existing hospital capacity during the hearing on the application for a temporary injunction.\n        They presented the evidence at the hearing on the motion to dissolve the temporary injunction. As we discuss later, the trial court was\n        under no duty to revisit the validity of its order granting the temporary injunction absent changed circumstances or fundamental error.\n8       Universal Health Services, along with other shareholders, incorporated RCW of Edmond, Inc. (RCW). RCW currently manages the\n        hospital on the first floor of the Center. The Investors argue that because Universal is only one investor in the hospital, owns neither\n        the land nor the building that houses the Center, and was not a party to any of the agreements, the court should not have considered\n        Universal's balance sheets in balancing the equities.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                            © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The truth would be that\n\n        7    he wasn't really a doctor.

When I was at the refinery, they would actually\n\n        4    come to the medical department.     We had an on-site\n\n03:12   5    occupational clinic at the refinery, and I would\n\n        6    actually see the patients and I would examine them,\n\n        7    diagnose them, and ultimately treat them.\n\n        8                     As I progressed in my career and became\n\n        9    the medical director and I moved to another division, I\n\n03:12   10   then oversaw the programs.\n\n        11                    So if an injured employee -- if an injury\n\n        12   occurred and they were in another state, I would\n\n        13   telephonically assess them, determine medical needs, and\n\n        14   direct them to medical facilities, if their injury\n\n03:13   15   warranted.\n\n        16       Q.   You'd direct them to medical facilities in that\n\n        17   particular state?\n\n        18       A.   Yes.\n\n        19       Q.

Plaintiff and DeLitta disagreed about whether Axiom needed to purchase a building as\n\nopposed to leasing larger space and if a purchase was made, which building would be purchased.\n\nDeLitta wanted to purchase a building located at 4840 West Panther Creek Drive, The Woodlands,\n\nTexas (\"Panther Creek Building\"). Plaintiff suggested leasing a building located at 110 Cypress\n\nStation Drive, Houston, Texas 77090 (\"Cypress Court\"). After much discussion, DeLitta decided\n\nto purchase the Panther Creek Building himself through a solely owned company that he would\n\nform for the single purpose of purchasing the Panther Creek Building (\"DeLCom Properties\").\n\nPlaintiff and DeLitta agreed that if DeL Com Properties purchased the building, Axiom would lease\n\nspace from it in the Panther Creek Building.\n\n24.    On or about August 8, 2013, without Plaintiff's consent and before forming DeLCom\n\nProperties and closing on the Panther Creek Building, DeLitta executed a lease on behalf of both\n\nDeLCom Properties and Axiom Medical with terms that were very favorable to DeLCom\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED PETITION, ORIGINAL\nTHIRD-PARTY PETITION, AND JURY DEMAND- Page 6\n\n\n                                                                                                      125\n\fProperties (DeLitta's solely owned company) acting as the landlord and very unfavorable to\n\nAxiom Medical, the purported tenant (the \"Panther Creek Lease\").\n\n25.    A few days later, DeLitta formed DeLCom Properties on or about August 13, 2013.\n\n26.    On or about August 26, 2013, DeLCom executed a promissory note to Wells Fargo, N.A.\n\nfor the principal sum of $4,720,000.00 for the purchase of the Panther Creek Building. Axiom\n\nMedical, Axiom Properties, DeLitta and Plaintiff executed guaranties. In an effort to fund the\n\ndown payment for the purchase of the Panther Creek Building, Plaintiff and DeLitta each agreed to\n\ntake a $590,000.00 distribution.     Plaintiff then agreed to lend her $590,000.00 to DeLCom\n\nProperties and DeLCom Properties agreed to pay it back through a second note guaranteed by\n\nDeLitta. A true and correct copy of the Wells Fargo promissory note, the settlement statement, the\n\nguaranties, and the second note and guaranty are attached as Exhibits \"B-1 through B-7\"\n\nrespectively, and are incorporated by reference.\n\n27.    On or about September 23, 2013, Plaintiff received correspondence from Nicole Beck, HR\n\nSpecialist for Axiom Medical regarding maintenance items to address due to Plaintiff's leaving\n\nAxiom Medical's employment (\"Exit Letter\"). This was the first time Plaintiff had heard anything\n\nabout her \"leaving\" Axiom Medical. A true and correct of the Exit Letter is attached as Exhibit\n\n\"C-1\" and incorporated by reference.\n\n28.    Shortly after Plaintiff received the Exit Letter, DeLitta sent an email to all Axiom\n\nemployees that purported to terminate Plaintiff as Executive Vice President and misrepresented or\n\nsought to usurp (or both) Plaintiff's role or participation in the continued operation and control of\n\nAxiom (\"Termination Email\"). A true and correct of the Termination Email is attached as Exhibit\n\n\"C-2\" and incorporated by reference. More specifically, Mr. DeLitta stated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED PETITION, ORIGINAL\nTHIRD-PARTY PETITION, AND JURY DEMAND- Page 7\n\n\n                                                                                                        126\n\f       As President & CEO, I have a responsibility to make sure that Axiom remains a\n       viable company and that all of its employees are happy. In order to do this, some\n       changes will need to be made.\n\n       Effectively immediately, Nancy Schaefer is no longer Executive Vice President.\n       She will still be co-owner but will have no input or involvement with the day-to-\n       day activities with nursing or Axiom as a whole. Processes are in place to acquire\n       Nancy's share of the company as we move forward.\n\n       Some of you may receive calls from her while others may want to reach out to her.\n       There is to be no communication with Nancy from a business perspective. If she\n       calls you or you call her, you may talk about anything other than Axiom. If she\n       requests information or documentation from you, you are to refer her to Nicole\n       Beck in HR. Any disregard of this will result in disciplinary action.\n\n29.    DeLitta's actions have created an atmosphere of fear and distrust between the two members\n\nand undermined Plaintiff's longstanding and cherished business relationship with the Nursing\n\nStaff. The damage to the relationship between Plaintiff and Axiom's employees- and hence, her\n\nability to protect her investment and interest in Axiom - is immediate and irreparable and is\n\nincapable of being accurately measured or legally compensated.           The damage to Plaintiff's\n\nbusiness relationship with the Nursing Staff is continued and ongoing.\n\n30.    DeLitta has improperly attempted to engineer a hostile take-over of Axiom through his\n\nunilateral and oppressive attempt to deprive Plaintiff of all rights of management or control of\n\nAxiom, including those rights vested in Plaintiff under the Operating Agreement. The Operating\n\nAgreement contains no provisions that would permit DeLitta to deprive Plaintiff of her role as a\n\nmanager without her input or consent, much less unilaterally. Both the fact that DeLitta has\n\nusurped or attempted to usurp all of Plaintiff's control of Axiom, and the manner and means by\n\nwhich he has endeavored to do so, has caused and continues to cause Plaintiffharm.\n\n31.    In addition, DeLitta has deposited, or caused to be deposited, checks payable to Axiom into\n\nhis own personal account on more than one occasion.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIRST AMENDED PETITION, ORIGINAL\nTHIRD-PARTY PETITION, AND JURY DEMAND- Page 8\n\n\n                                                                                                     127\n\f                                                                       12/12/2014 4:22:34 PM\n                                                                              Amalia Rodriguez-Mendoza\n                                                                                            District Clerk\n                                                                                            Travis County\n                                       CAUSE NO. 0-1-GN-13-003516                        D-1-GN-13-003516\n\nNANCY SCHAEFER,                                        §    IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n                                                       §\n         Plaintiff,                                    §\n                                                       §\nvs.                                                    §\n                                                       §\nMICHAEL J.

DeLitta (\"DeLitta\"), enjoining him from holding himself out as a medical doctor, using\n\nthe title \"Dr.,\" and otherwise misleading others as to his qualifications.   DeLitta's conduct is\n\nagainst the law, is causing irreparable harm to Axiom Medical Consulting LLC's reputation, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                    323\n\f subjects Axiom to third-party liability, thereby diminishing its value. Michael DeLitta is not a\n\n medical doctor and does not even have a Ph.D. from an accredited university. He is passing\n\n himself off as a medical doctor by pretehding· ti;'at his Ph.D. degree from a discredited \"diploma\n\n mill\" entitles him to call himself \"Dr.\" DeLitta. This is a sham, a fraud on the public, a violation of\n\nMr. DeLitta's obligations under the Physician's Assistant Licensing Act, and a violation of a\n\nspecific criminal statute.\n\n                                   I.       FACTS AND ARGUMENT\n\n 1.      Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\") provides medical consulting services.                  It\n\nadvertises that it \"employs Doctors, Physician Assistants, Registered Nurses, and a specially\n\ntrained support staff to provide a full suite of medical management services, ranging from work-\n\nrelated injury case management to a multitude of customizable exam programs.\" See\n\nhttp://www.axiomllc.com/about/company. Defendant DeLitta is one of the founders of Axiom and\n\nis the current CEO and presumably a licensed Physician's Assistant.                   See Exhibit 1, Axiom\n\nbrochure. The first sentence of the company's online brochure refers to DeLitta as \"Dr. Michael J.\n\nDeLitta.\" !d. (emphasis added). This is a sham.\n\n        A.       \"Dr.\" DeLitta's Fake Ph.D.\n\n2.      DeLitta is not a medical doctor and has never attended medical school. Yet DeLitta\n\nroutinely refers to himself as a \"doctor\" and uses the titles \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\" in the course of\n\nhis work for Axiom. Exhibit 2, Affidavit of Andrea Ruffen.                   Because Axiom is a medical\n\nconsulting company and provides medical advice, there is an substantial likelihood that DeLitta's\n\nuse of the \"Dr.\" title could mislead others into believing that he is a medical doctor. In fact, as\n\nshown below, that is exactly what is happening.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 2\n\n                                                                                                             324\n\f  3.       DeLitta purportedly has a \"Ph.D.\" in psychology from \"Newport University.\" 1 However,\n\n  Newport University is not accredited by any accreditation agency recognized by the U.S.\n\n  Department of Education.          See http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation!Search.aspx.           Furthermore, the\n\n  Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board lists Newport University as an institution that issues\n\n  \"fraudulent or substandard degrees.\" See http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/index.cfm?objectid=\n\n' EF4C3C3B-EB44-4381-6673F760B3946FBB, attached hereto as Exhibit 4. The misuse of this\n\n  fraudulent degree is more than just an exhibition ofDeLitta's vanity or insecurity. Texas makes\n\n  it a crime for DeLitta to use his claimed Ph.D. (i.e., to refer to himself as a \"doctor\") to promote\n\n  a business or to obtain employment, compensation or other benefit in employment or in the\n\n  practice of a trade. TEX.     PENAL    CODE §32.52. DeLitta's Ph.D. \"degree\" in psychology is not\n\n  even what it purports to be, much less a proper basis for him to pass himself off as a medical\n\n  doctor. On these grounds alone, DeLitta should be enjoined from using the title \"Doctor\" or\n\n  \"Dr.\" in any form while employed by Axiom. His actions are hurting the company and subject it\n\n  to liability and a diminished reputation.\n\n          B.       Stretching the Truth Even Further- \"Paging Dr. DeLitta\"\n\n 4.       DeLitta is a Texas-licensed physician's assistant (\"P A\"). As such, he is governed by the\n\n Texas Physician Assistant Board and Chapter 204 of the Texas Occupations Code. His license\n\n imposes a specific obligation for him to avoid confusion over this training. In Texas, a PA that\n\n commits any of the following acts can face civil and criminal liability:\n\n          -falsely represents that the person is a physician;\n\n          - acts in an unprofessional or dishonorable manner that is likely to deceive, defraud, or\n          injure the public;\n\n          1\n              DeLitta also claims to have a \"masters degree\" in Psychology from Newport University. Newport\n  University appears on numerous lists of institutions known informally as \"diploma mills.\"                  See\n. http://www.geteducated.com/fake-diplomas/250-non-accredited-college-newport-intemational-university-forced-to-\n  close, attached hereto as Exhibit 3.\n\n\n Plaintiff's Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta -Page 3\n\n                                                                                                                   325\n\f         -unlawfully advertises in a false, misleading, or deceptive manner, as described by\n         Section 101.201.\n\n TEX. Occ. CODE §§ 204.302(3), 302(4), and 302(8) (\"Conduct Related to Fraud or\n\n Misrepresentation\").\n\n         Section 101.201 ofthe Texas Occupations Code is also applicable to PAs and provides in\n\npertinent part:\n\n         Sec. 101.201. FALSE. MISLEADING. OR DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING.\n\n         (a) A person may not use advertising that is false, misleading, deceptive, or not readily\n         subject to verification.\n\n         (b) False, misleading, or deceptive advertising or advertising not readily subject to\n         verification includes advertising that:\n\n                  (1) makes a material misrepresentation offact or omits a fact necessary to make\n                  the statement as a whole not materially misleading;\n\n                  (5) causes confusion or misunderstanding as to the credentials, education, or\n                  licensing ofa health care professional;\n\n                  or\n\n                  (9) represents in the use ofa profossional name a title or professional\n                  identification that is expressly or commonly reserved to or used by another\n                  profossion or professional.\n\nThese statutes were clearly designed to prevent the type of confusion that DeLitta is causing by\n\ncalling himself a \"doctor'' (based on a phony Ph.D. in psychology) while he is engaged in a\n\nmedical consulting business where he allegedly supervises nurses.\n\n5.      At least three former Axiom employees have sounded warnings about DeLitta's misleading\n\nconduct. Ashley Santoro, a registered nurse who was employed by Axiom for over two years,\n\nexpressed concern about this issue in her resignation letter:\n\n        \"I am also concerned over the tact we also are told to lie to our clients about Dr. Mike\n        Delitta. Although, he has a doctorate degree - it is not in medicine. He is not a medical\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 4\n\n                                                                                                      326\n\f          phvsician but a Physician 1s Assistant. I was told to never tell this to our clients and we are\n          always to say ''Dr. DeLitta\" when speaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does\n          not want anyone to !mow he [isl not a medical physician as he solicits himsel[to our clients\n          as.\n\nExhibit 5, Santoro resignation letter.         Former Axiom employee Andrea Ruffen, who worked\n\n closely with DeLitta for seven years, testified by affidavit that she thought DeLitta was a medical\n\ndoctor during the entire time she was employed at Axiom. Exhibit 2, Affidavit of Andrea Ruffen,\n\n~ 4.   Ruffen further testified that:\n\n          a.    DeLitta uses the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in writing, including in\n                e-mails and letters to Axiom employees and Axiom customers and that relate to\n                medical advice or medical issues;\n\n         b.    DeLitta introduces himself as \"Doctor Delitta\" or \"Dr. Delitta\", particularly in\n               medical contexts where the only reasonable impression is that he is a medical\n               doctor;\n\n         c.    DeLitta answers and responds to the title \"Doctor\" when the circumstances make it\n               obvious that the person addressing him believes that he is a medical doctor, and that\n               DeLitta never corrects or clarifies the misunderstanding;\n\n         d.    DeLitta provides medical advice to Axiom employees;\n\n         e.    DeLitta has discussed his experience in \"medical school\";\n\n         f.    DeLitta portrays himself as a \"doctor\" who supervises the nurses that Axiom\n               employs; and\n\n         g.    that the majority of people that DeLitta interacts with and to whom DeLitta has\n               presented himself as a \"doctor\" are misled into believing that he is a medical doctor.\n\nExhibit 2, at~ 5. Finally, former Axiom employee Shane Enochs, who is also a registered nurse,\n\ntestified that he witnessed similar conduct from DeLitta. Exhibit 6, Affidavit of Shane Enochs.\n\n6.       Having gotten away with this charade for so long, DeLitta is self-delusional. Since 2008,\n\nhe has been using a vanity license plate for his vehicle that reads \"OCC DOC,\" which refers to\n\nbeing an Occupational Doctor. He is clearly misleading the public by presenting himself as a\n\n\n\n\nPlaintif:fs Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J.

The Fraud Must Be Corrected\n\n7.                    All of this conduct violates the above-referenced subsections of the Texas Occupations\n\nCode and criminal statutes, with serious potential consequences to Axiom. The consequences\n\nrange from revocation of DeLitta's physician's assistant license, to civil penalties, enforcement\n\nactions by the Texas Attorney General, and remedies under Chapter 17 of the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practices Act. Given DeLitta's role as CEO and co-founder of Axiom, his conduct causes\n\ninunediate and irreparable damage to Axiom's reputation, not only with its customers and\n\nemployees but also within the medical industry, and makes it a party to false advertising and\n\ncomplicit in DeLitta's crime. Plaintiff's request to enjoin DeLitta from holding himself out as a\n\nmedical doctor is absolutely necessary to ensure that Axiom does not continue to violate the Texas\n\nstatutes enacted to protect the safety and welfare of the public, whose injury is also immediate and\n\nirreparable because it cannot be quantified.\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Application for Temporary and Pennanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 6\n\n                                                                                                                                                 328\n\f         D.     Defendant Must be Removed as President, CEO and Medical Director\n\n8.       If Defendant is allowed to continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer, President and\n\nMedical Director of Axiom, Axiom will suffer irreparable harm to its reputation and client base.\n\nDefendant's fraudulent conduct goes to the very core of Axiom's reputation, competence and\n\nstanding in the occupational medical field. Mr. DeLitta therefore should be removed and replaced\n\nby a person with bonafide credentials.\n\nIII.     REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY INJUNCTION AND PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n\n9.      Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 7 the same as if set forth\n\nherein verbatim.\n\n10.     Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, or otherwise, for the harm or damage which will\n\noccur to the operation of Axiom, unless DeLitta is restrained from continuing to utilize the\n\nbusiness to perpetuate a fraud on the public. Axiom's relationship with its clients will suffer harm\n\nthat cannot be easily measured in damages.\n\n11.     The issuance of requested relief will return the parties to the status quo prior to Plaintiffs\n\nouster. Prior to the lawsuit being filed, Plaintiff had counseled Defendant not to use the .. Dr.\"\n\ndesignation.     However, since her ouster, Defendant has obviously disregarded the law and\n\ncontinues to misrepresent himself.\n\n        E.       Irreparable Harm and No Adequate Remedy at Law\n\n12.     It is essential that DeLitta be restrained and enjoined as prayed for because:\n\n        a.     Such restraint is necessary to maintain the status quo and to protect the rights and\n               interests of Plaintiff in the business and the property of the Axiom Companies;\n\n        b.     Such restraint is necessary to maintain the status quo to prevent any dissipation or\n               diminution ofthe business and the property of the Axiom Companies; and\n\n        c.     Such restraint is necessary to maintain the status quo to prevent any further\n               irreparable damage to Plaintiffs business relationship with the nursing staff.\n\n\n\nPlaintiff's Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta- Page 7\n\n                                                                                                         329\n\f         d.     Such restraint is necessary to protect the public interest.\n\n 13.     All conditions precedent to the filing of Plaintiffs application and the damages herein\n\nrequested have been performed or have occurred.\n\n                                       II. PRAYERFORRELIEF\n\n         Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter a Temporary Injunction prohibiting\n\nDeLitta from: (1) using the title \"Doctor\", \"Dr.\", \"M.D.\" or otherwise misleading people into\n\nbelieving that he is a medical doctor while performing any duties or functions for Axiom; (2)\n\nremoving any reference to the term \"Dr.\" or \"M.D.\" from Axiom marketing material including\n\nits website; (3) advising Axiom employees and staff to refer to him as \"Dr.\"; and (4) prohibiting\n\nhim from continuing to be listed on Axiom credit cards and bank statements as \"Dr.\"\n\n         In addition, Defendant should be removed as President, Chief Executive Officer and\n\nMedical Director of Axiom.\n\n         Upon final trial, this Court should enter an order permanently enjoining DeLitta as\n\nset forth above.\n\n                                                    Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                    TAYLOR DUNHAM AND RODRIGUEZ LLP\n\n\n\n\n                                                            dtaylor@taylordunham.com\n\n                                                            Of Counsel Stacey Reese\n                                                            State BarNo. 24056188\n                                                            stacey@reeselawpractice. com\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs Application for Temporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J.

I was an employee of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC C'Axiom\") for\n    approximately seven years.\n\n             3.      During the time that I was employed by Axiom, I worked closely with Michael J.\n    Delitta (\"Delitta~') and interacted with him on an almost daily basis.\n\n           4.       Throughout my entire period of employment with Axiom, it was my belief and\n    understanding that DeHtta was a medical doctor. This belief was based on Delitta •s words and\n    conduct that I observed.\n\n           5.     Some of Deiitta's words and conduct that caused rne to believe that he was a\n    medical doctor included:\n\n                      a. His use of the title \"Doctor'' and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in wTiting, including\n                         in e-mails and letters he sent to Aximn employees and Axiom customers and\n                         that related to medical advice or medical issues;\n                      b. His introducing himself as '\"Doctor Delitta\" or \"Dr. Delitta\", particularly in\n                         medical contexts where the only reasonable impression was that he was a\n                         medical doctor;\n                      c. Witnessing him answer to and respond to tbe title \"Doctor\" when the\n                         circumstances made it obvious that the person addressing him bdieved ti:lat he\n                         was a medical doctor, and never witnessing him correct or clarify the\n                         misunderstanding;\n                      d. His providing medical advice to myself and other Axiom employees;\n                      e.      discussing his experience in \"medical school\"' in conversation with me;\n                      [ His portrayal of himself as a \"doctor\" who supervises the nurses that Axiom\n                         employs.\n\n    cmscay '\\vnn vl::hua aifO. ·w::u.l m:e oppotu.:un1.y to uDscrVtf h11s HiU::ra0'\\I6ftB ~~·1hr n'l.iflffi't:\\tsl un.TlHt:l\n    people, including non-Axiom parties and Axiom customers. Based on my observations, I\n    that the majority of people that Delitta interacts \\Vith and to whom Delitta has presented himself\n    as a ''doctor\" are misled     believing that he is a medical doctor. The potential fix confusion is\n    particularly high because Axiom is in the medical consulting industry, employs nurses, and\n    provides :medical advice to its customers.\n\n             7.

As a registered nurse the nurse not only has\n the right but an obligation and responsibility to make sure she/he is working legaliy in the state they are\n asked to practice in by Axiom as a nurse. 1have also never worked for a company who is so fearful of\n anyone knowing what the company policies are In regards to the nurses job duties, expectations, and\n internal workings in regards to the nurses job. Especially, when the nurse is only trying to see if what\n she/he is doing ls legal in regards to their nursing license.\n\nAxiom solk!ts itself to companies in states where no nurses are licensed in and accepts dlent case\nmanagement in these states by falsely representing Axiom as having nurses licensed in these states.\nAxiom also instructs the nurse case managers to not reveal to this to their dients, even when the nurse\ngets a case in a state they are not licensed in and are not legally suppose to be practking in. Axiom also\nis forcing, coercing, bullying, and intimidating the nurses into taking these cases by threatening their\nemployment with Axiom by declining to accept cases in states they knowing are not licensed ln. The\nTeam Leaders and Supervisors assigning these cases to nurses not licensed in these states also have\nvicarious liablilty In assigning these cases by knowing first hand aH nurses state licensure status prior to\nassigning these cases and also support the bul!ylng, threatening, and intimidating behavior by enforcing\nthis on the nurses they supervise,\n\nl have requested a copy of the written legal opinion which we were told was done by Jon Neff, Axiom's\nAttorney, along with other nurse.s in regards to the fl ndlngs of the nurses concerns with taking cases in\nstates in which we are r1ot legally licensed in. l have requested this from Pam Tilly, Director of Nursing,\nDara Sievers, Vice-President, Emily Lopez, Compliance Officer, and Nicole Beck, Human Resource,· all\nwho have declined to submit this: opinion which l was told was done, but no one is allowed to see it. I\nwas also declined the request to see the current policy which l was assured Axiom hsd one in place by\nDara Sievers, Vh:e·President, and Nicole Sed; Human Resource, whlch! felt r could work off of until the\nnew policy came into place, The only thing the nurses have been allowed to see is a new guideline by\nAxiom in case assignments with no true opinion and a question and answer sheet which had no attorney\nname attached to it.\n\n In our team meeting this week Emily Lope!, CompHance Officer, Pam Tilly, Director of Nursing, and Mike\n Detitta, President, stated Jim Puente, National Council of State Board of Nursing, assisted Axiom's\nattorneys in the new guidelines. Mike, Emily, and Pam also personally stated and assured the nurses In\nour meeting that lt was okay for the nurses to take cases and act as a practicing nurse In those states in\nwhich she/he Is not !lcensed in and wcs also legally okay. Emily also stated the nurse would be in mona\nlegal trouble for refusing a case in which someone could be really hurt in and used the Goorl Samaritan\nexample and that Jim Puente himself discussed tl;is with her and approved. Emily also told our team\nmembers to call him ·which ! did and he corrected me on this. He not only stated Axiom\nmisrepresented his name, title, and position but also assured he did not assist with Axiom's new\nguidelines ami dld not approve that mJrses can practice !n states they are not legally licensed in, When\nAxiom's attorney called Jim Puente they declined to release the client name they were representing l:>ut\nwanted to discuss only dlscipHnary actions. Axiom's attorneys only cl!scussed with Jim Puente if there\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        00003098\n\n                                                                                                   EXHIBIT 5\n                                                                                                                   351\n\f was documentation of nurses being punished for practicing in states in which they were not licensed ln.\n As he told your attorneys (and how convenient for Axiom) that documentation (if any}   wm not be easily\n found due the nurses do not go to a court of law but have to stand before the Individual nursing board\n ofthe state they have violated or thelr home state nursing board whom disdp!ines them and\n them of their license. The information would have to come for each individual state's nursing board.\n\n! am also concerned r:rver the fact we also are told to lie to our clients about Dr. Mike Delltta. Although,\nhe has a doctorate degree- it is not in medicine. He is not a medical physician but a Physician's\nAssistant. 1was told to never tell this to our clients and we are always to say \"Dr. Delitta\" when\nspeaking about him to keep up the image. Axiom does not want anyone to know he not a medical\nphysician as he solicits himself to our clients as. Given Mr. Mike Delitta and Amy Hamilton, Physician\nAssistant, are not licensed io all these states we are asked to practice in ! wonder about the legal liability\nof both of them also. Antt who Is the actual acting physician for our company who is signing off and\noverseeing every Axiom chart/file? Is he/she license ln all these states? I seriously doubt it.\n\n For a company who had a survey donB at the end of last year which showed the employees felt there\nwas lack of communication, dishonesty, and they did not trust the company I would say ! can truly see\nwhy< l also feel since Nancy Schaffer's absence this company has taken a very sharp spiral downward\nand it saddens me I worked so hard for a company who has no disregard for the nurses licenses and\nliveHhooct\n\n! will return your computer, printer, manual, and equipment within the next few days and l obviously do\nnot need an exlt Interview,\n\n! also request this resignation letter go into my personal and human resource file at .Axiom, I also\nrequest a copy of this letter go into the following individuals persona! and humiUl resource file at Axiom:\nMike Delitt:a, President, Nancy Schaffer, Co·Owner, Dara Sievers:, Vice·President, Pam Tilly, Director of\nNursing, Nicole Seck, Human Resource, Emily Lopez, compliance Officer, Shelly Dace, Team Leader, Usa\nHal!, 5L:pervisor, and Jen Brady, Supervisor,\n\nPlease do not contact me further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAshley Santoro\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                 352\n\fCAUSE NO.

The facts stated in this Affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true\nand correct\n\n       2.     I was an employee of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\") for\napproximately 4 years.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               EXHIBIT 6         353\n\f        3.      During the time that I was employed by Axiom, I worked closely with Michael J.\nDelitta (\"Delitta\") and interacted with him on a regular basis.\n\n       4.      Throughout approximately the first year of my employment with Axiom, it was\nmy belief and understanding that DeHtta was a medical doctor. This belief was based on Delitta's\nwords and conduct that I observed.\n\n       5.     Some of Delitta's words and conduct that caused me to believe that he was a\nmedical doctor included:\n\n              a.      His use of the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and\n                      in writing, including in e-mails and letters he sent to Axiom\n                      employees and Axiom customers and that related to\n                      medical advice or medical issues;\n\n              b.      His introducing himself as \"Doctor Delitta\" or \"Dr.\n                      Delitta\", particularly in medical contexts where the only\n                      reasonable impression was that he was a medical doctor:\n\n              c.      Witnessing him ansv;er to and respond to the title \"Doctor\"\n                      when the circumstances made it obvious that the person\n                      addressing him believed that he was a medical doctor, and\n                      never witnessing him correct or clarify the\n                      misunderstanding;\n\n              d.      His providing medical advice to myself and other Axiom\n                      employees;\n\n              e.      His portrayal of himself as a \"doctor\" and the \"Medical\n                      Director\" who supervises the nurses that Axiom employs.\n\n        6.     During the approximately four years that I was employed by Axiom, I worked\nwith Delitta and had the oppottunity to observe his interactions with numerous other people,\nincluding non-Axiom parties and Axiom customers. Based on my observations, I believe that the\nmajority of people that Delitta interacts with and to whom Delitta has presented himself as a\n\"doctor\" are misled into believing that he is a medical doctor. The potential for confusion is\nparticularly high because Axiom is in the medical consulting industry, employs nurses, and\nprovides medical advice to its customers.\n\n      7.        I also observed Dara Wheeler, Vice President, provide instructions to other\nAxiom staff that Delitta should be addressed as \"Dr, Oelitta\".\n\n       8.

An unsigned copy of the Operating Agreement was filed originally because an executed copy\n\nof the signature page to the Operating Agreement could not be located. The parties have treated and\n\ncontinue to treat the Operating Agreement as an effective agreement (e.g., Plaintiff filed suit in Travis\n\nCounty; Defendants did not contest venue and thereby waived any venue challenge; and DeLitta\n\nmade an offer to buy Plaintiff's shares pursuant to the terms in the Operating Agreement). The\n\nOperating Agreement is effective because Schaefer and DeLitta consented to the form, terms and\n\nprovisions of the agreement and approved the agreement in all respects by signing the agreement\n\nand the Written Consent and have also sufficiently ratified the Operating Agreement and Written\n\nConsent as both has treated them as operative and relied on them in good faith.\n\n                                            IV.     FACTS\n\nA.      Creation of Axiom Medical and Establishment of 50/50 Ownership from Inception\n\n15.     In 1999, DeLitta contacted Plaintiff about starting a company that would be owned 50/50\n\nbetween Plaintiff and DeLitta and provide injury management for work-related and personal injuries\n\nfor oil and gas companies. In reliance on DeLitta's agreement that he and Plaintiff would own the\n\nnew company 50/50 and/or be \"equal partners,\" Plaintiff accepted DeLitta's offer. Over the course\n\nof 1999 and 2000, Plaintiff and DeLitta formalized their business plan that included DeLitta handling\n\nall the company's operations and Plaintiff managing the nursing staff. As part ofDeLitta's duty to\n\nhandle the operations of the business, DeLitta formed Axiom Medical in October 1999.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 4\n\n\n                                                                                                            400\n\f24.    On or about August 8, 2013, without Plaintiff's consent and before forming DeLCom\n\nProperties and closing on the Panther Creek Building, DeLitta executed a lease on behalf of both\n\nDeLCom Properties and Axiom Medical with terms that were very favorable to DeLCom Properties\n\n(DeLitta's solely owned company) acting as the landlord and very unfavorable to Axiom Medical,\n\nthe purported tenant (the \"Panther Creek Lease\").\n\n25.    A few days later, DeLitta formed DeLCom Properties on or about August 13, 2013.\n\n26.    On or about August 26,2013, DeLCom executed a promissory note to Wells Fargo, N.A. for\n\nthe principal sum of$4,720,000.00 for the purchase of the Panther Creek Building. Axiom Medical,\n\nAxiom Properties, DeLitta and Plaintiff executed guaranties. In an effort to fund the down payment\n\nfor the purchase of the Panther Creek Building, Plaintiff and DeLitta each agreed to take a\n\n$590,000.00 distribution. Plaintiff then agreed to lend her $590,000.00 to DeLCom Properties and\n\nDeLCom Properties agreed to pay it back through a second note guaranteed by DeLitta. A true and\n\ncorrect copy of the Wells Fargo promissory note, the settlement statement, the guaranties, and the\n\nsecond note and guaranty are attached as Exhibits \"B-1 through B-7\" respectively, and are\n\nincorporated by reference.\n\n27.    On or about September 23, 2013, Plaintiff received correspondence from Nicole Beck, HR\n\nSpecialist for Axiom Medical regarding maintenance items to address due to Plaintiff's leaving\n\nAxiom Medical's employment (\"Exit Letter\"). This was the first time Plaintiffhad heard anything\n\nabout her \"leaving\" Axiom Medical. A true and correct of the Exit Letter is attached as Exhibit \"C-\n\n1\" and incorporated by reference.\n\n28.    Shortly after Plaintiff received the Exit Letter, DeLitta sent an email to all Axiom employees\n\nthat purported to terminate Plaintiff as Executive Vice President and misrepresented or sought to\n\nusurp (or both) Plaintiff's role or participation in the continued operation and control of Axiom\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 7\n\n\n                                                                                                        403\n\f(\"Termination Email\"). A true and correct of the Termination Email is attached as Exhibit \"C-2\"\n\nand incorporated by reference. More specifically, Mr. DeLitta stated as follows:\n\n       As President & CEO, I have a responsibility to make sure that Axiom remains a\n       viable company and that all of its employees are happy. In order to do this, some\n       changes will need to be made.\n\n       Effectively immediately, Nancy Schaefer is no longer Executive Vice President. She\n       will still be co-owner but will have no input or involvement with the day-to-day\n       activities with nursing or Axiom as a whole. Processes are in place to acquire\n       Nancy's share of the company as we move forward.\n\n       Some of you may receive calls from her while others may want to reach out to her.\n       There is to be no communication with Nancy from a business perspective. If she\n       calls you or you call her, you may talk about anything other than Axiom. If she\n       requests information or documentation from you, you are to refer her to Nicole Beck\n       in HR. Any disregard of this will result in disciplinary action.\n\n29.    DeLitta's actions have robbed Plaintiff of her goodwill, created an atmosphere of fear and\n\ndistrust between the two members, and undermined Plaintiff's longstanding and cherished business\n\nrelationship with the Nursing Staff. The damage to the relationship between Plaintiff and Axiom's\n\nemployees - and hence, her ability to protect her investment and interest in Axiom - is immediate\n\nand irreparable and is incapable of being accurately measured or legally compensated. The damage\n\nto Plaintiff's business relationship with the Nursing Staff is continued and ongoing.\n\n30.    DeLitta has improperly attempted to engineer a hostile take-over of Axiom through his\n\nunilateral and oppressive attempt to deprive Plaintiff of all rights of management or control of\n\nAxiom, including those rights vested in Plaintiff under the Operating Agreement. The Operating\n\nAgreement contains no provisions that would permit DeLitta to deprive Plaintiff of her role as a\n\nmanager without her input or consent, much less unilaterally. Both the fact that DeLitta has usurped\n\nor attempted to usurp all ofPlaintiff's control of Axiom, and the manner and means by which he has\n\nendeavored to do so, has caused and continues to cause Plaintiffharm.\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 8\n\n\n                                                                                                       404\n\f31.    DeLitta has deposited, or caused to be deposited, checks payable to Axiom into his own\n\npersonal account on more than one occasion. Additionally, DeLitta has used company funds to pay\n\nfor personal litigation expenses.\n\nC.     Plaintiff Obtains a Temporary Restraining Order and Temporary Injunction\n\n32.    After learning that DeLitta had executed the Panther Creek Lease without her consent and\n\nafter receiving both the Exit Letter and Termination Email, on October 9, 2013, Plaintiff filed her\n\noriginal petition and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining Defendants from interfering\n\nwith Plaintiff's access to Axiom's offices, books, records, and employees, from transferring\n\ncompany assets, and from interfering with Plaintiff reinstating herself as Executive Vice President,\n\namong other things. A copy of the Temporary Restraining Order is attached as Exhibit \"D\" and\n\nincorporated by reference.\n\n33.    Plaintiff and Defendants entered into an Agreed Temporary Injunction dated October 29,\n\n2013 (under similar, additional and revised conditions as those imposed by Temporary Restraining\n\nOrder), and the Court appointed a Provisional Voting Member to break ties at the Axiom Medical\n\nboard level. A copy of the Agreed Temporary Injunction and the Order appointing the Provisional\n\nMember is attached as Exhibit \"E-1\" through \"E-2\", respectively, and are incorporated by\n\nreference. One of the most significant disagreements sought to be resolved at that time was the\n\ndispute over DeLitta's pre-litigation execution of the Panther Creek Lease that contained grossly\n\none-sided terms to the benefit of DeLCom Properties and to the detriment of Axiom Medical, the\n\nterms and execution of which constitute self-dealing and defective corporate approval.\n\n34.    After the Provisional Member was appointed, Axiom, with DeLitta's approval, retained the\n\nHouston law firm of Andrews Kurth, LLP to review the alleged Panther Creek Lease. That review\n\nindicated that the alleged Panther Creek Lease was fraught with egregious terms and conditions for\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 9\n\n\n                                                                                                       405\n\fany percentage of her 50% ownership in Axiom Medical interests to the Trust and or agree to the\n\ncompany valuation recited in the Sale Agreement. A copy of the Sale Agreement is attached as\n\nExhibit \"G\" and is incorporated by reference. Further, upon information and belief, the Trust is a\n\nsham- a mere instrument created and/or controlled by DeLitta to deprive Plaintiff of her ownership\n\ninterests. Through these actions, DeLitta and the Trustee have deprived Plaintiff of her interest in\n\nAxiom with and for no payment or consideration to Plaintiff.\n\n43.    Amazingly, Defendants have now abandoned that claim and executed a document stipulating\n\nthat the Trust and Danielle Seger have no interest in Axiom. As result of the stipulation, Plaintiff\n\nhas dropped her claims against the Trust.\n\nE.     DeLitta's Continued Self-Dealing and Violations of the Agreed Temporary Injunction\n       Caused the Court to Appoint a Receiver and Disqualify Counsel from Jointly\n       Representing Axiom and DeLitta\n\n44.    DeLitta has used and continues to use corporate assets for his own personal benefit and\n\ncontinues to violate the Agreed Temporary Injunction in the following ways:\n\n           o used company funds to pay rent without authorization;\n\n           o used company credit cards for personal expenses for himself and for his family;\n\n           o caused unauthorized, self-serving, undocumented and fraudulent accounting entries\n             to be made to his benefit;\n\n           o backdated a fraudulent software license;\n\n           o provided inaccurate financial information to Axiom's board;\n\n           o used company funds to pay for personal litigation expenses;\n\n           o made payments for leasehold improvements and design work for DeLCom\n             Properties' office building without authority;\n\n           o granted raises and changes in employee compensation without authority;\n\n           o delayed payments to Plaintiff while timely paying himself;\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 13\n\n\n                                                                                                       409\n\f            o   delayed or hindered Plaintiff's access to records;\n\n            o   utilized his control over the finances of Axiom by refusing to take certain actions\n                or refusing to pay for certain items when there was a disagreement about an action\n                to be taken by the members; and\n\n            o   threatened Mr. Compton if he exercised his duties as the provisional member.\n\n45.     DeLitta's intentional, willful, and repeated self-dealing and violations of the injunction\n\nharm both Schaefer and Axiom. DeLitta's conduct has gotten so bad that the Court was forced to\n\nappoint a receiver over Axiom's finances and books and disqualify Ms. De Ford and Mr. Drucker's\n\nfirms from jointly representing Axiom and DeLitta to adequately protect Axiom's interests.            In\n\naddition, upon information and belief Defendant DeLitta has apparently used the designation of\n\n\"PhD\" which degree was issued by an unaccredited university and as such Mr. DeLitta should be\n\nenjoined from using such designation.\n\n                                   V.      CAUSES OF ACTION\n\nA.      Count One- Request For Declaratory Judgment\n\n46.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n47.    A present, justiciable controversy exists, the outcome of which may determine the rights\n\nof the parties and the outcome of this litigation. In particular, the ownership of 50% of the member\n\ninterest in Axiom Medical and the validity of the Panther Creek Lease are in dispute. Pursuant to\n\nTEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE §37.001, et seq., Plaintiff requests a declaratory judgment declaring\n\nthe rights of the parties under and in connection with, among other things, writings constituting a\n\ncontract or affected by statute or a contract, whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected\n\nthereby. More specifically, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that:\n\n        a. Plaintiffhas been the owner of 50% ofthe member interest of Axiom Medical since its\n\n            inception or at least prior to June 29, 2005;\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 14\n\n\n                                                                                                            410\n\f        b. the purported transfer of 99% of non-voting membership interests to DeLitta and\n\n            subsequently to the Trust is invalid, voidable and/or void and/or was procured by fraud\n\n            and all documents purporting to transfer same are set aside;\n\n        c. the alleged Panther Creek Lease is void and of no further force and effect; and\n\n        d. Axiom Medical (not DeLitta) owns the DeLCom Software and/or DeLCom Program.\n\n        e. In the alternative, if Axiom Medical does not own the DeLCom Software and/or\n\n            DeLCom Program, it has a perpetual free license to use it.\n\n48.     Pursuant to TEX. Crv. PRAC. & REM. CODE §37.009, Plaintiff is entitled to recover an award\n\nof costs and reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees as are equitable and just.\n\nB.      Count Two - Breach Of Operating Agreement by DeLitta\n\n49.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n50.     The Operating Agreement is a valid and enforceable agreement.\n\n51.     DeLitta breached the Operating Agreement.\n\n52.     As a result, Plaintiff has been damaged m an amount m excess of the mm1mum\n\njurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\nC.      Count Three -Breach of Oral Agreement by DeLitta\n\n53.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n54.     DeLitta promised and orally agreed that Plaintiff was 50% owner of Axiom Medical.\n\n55.     DeLitta breached that oral agreement and as a result, Plaintiff suffered damages.\n\nD.      Count Four - Common Law Fraud By DeLitta\n\n56.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n57.     If Plaintiff is not a 50% owner of all membership interests in Axiom Medical, then DeLitta\n\nmade false material misrepresentations to Plaintiff when he told her and acted as if she was a 50%\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 15\n\n\n                                                                                                      411\n\fowner in Axiom Medical and treated her as such. DeLitta knew the misrepresentations were false\n\nwhen he made them or he made them recklessly with the intent that Plaintiff would act on them.\n\nPlaintiff relied on DeLitta's misrepresentations that she was a 50% owner in all interests to her\n\nown detriment and injury.\n\n58.    DeLitta also committed fraud when he made false material misrepresentations about the\n\nSale Agreement inducing Plaintiff to sign it by telling Plaintiff that she was merely consenting to\n\nthe transfer ofhis 50% of the shares to the Trust when in fact the Sale Agreement and the Purchase\n\nAgreement purported to convey 99% of the membership interest in Axiom Medical to the Trust.\n\nDeLitta knew the misrepresentations were false when he made them or he made them recklessly\n\nwith the intent that Plaintiff would act on them. Plaintiff relied on DeLitta's misrepresentations to\n\nher own detriment and injury.\n\n59.    DeLitta committed fraud by nondisclosure when he concealed from or failed to disclose to\n\nPlaintiff the material facts that he had executed the Regulations of Axiom Medical purporting to\n\ngive himself 100% ownership of Axiom Medical and a Purchase Agreement purporting to sell\n\n99% ofhis alleged ownership interest (50% of which belonged to Plaintiff) in Axiom Medical to\n\nthe Trust. DeLitta knew Plaintiff was ignorant of these facts and did not have an equal opportunity\n\nto discover them. DeLitta was deliberately silent when he had a duty to speak and by failing to\n\ndisclose the facts, he intended to induce Plaintiff to sign the Sale Agreement. Plaintiff relied on\n\nDeLitta's non-disclosure to her detriment and injury.\n\n60.    Because they were procured by fraud, the Axiom Medical Regulations, the Sale Agreement\n\nand the Purchase Agreement should be given no force or effect and should be declared void and\n\nvoidable.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 16\n\n\n                                                                                                        412\n\f61.    DeLitta committed fraud by nondisclosure when he concealed from or failed to disclose to\n\nPlaintiff that Axiom Medical did not own the DeLCom Software and/or Program. DeLitta knew\n\nPlaintiff was ignorant of these facts and did not have an equal opportunity to discover them.\n\nDeLitta was deliberately silent when he had a duty to speak and by failing to disclose the facts, he\n\nintended to induce Plaintiff to take some action or refrain from acting. Plaintiff relied on DeLitta' s\n\nnon-disclosure to her detriment and injury.\n\n62.    Plaintiff's reliance on DeLitta's misrepresentations, nondisclosures and/or omissions was\n\nforeseeable and was the proximate cause of damages to Plaintiff.\n\nE.      Count Five - Breach of Fiduciary Duties By DeLitta\n\n63.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n64.    DeLitta established a personal fiduciary duty to Plaintiff prior to the formation of Axiom\n\nMedical.\n\n65.    DeLitta breached his fiduciary duty to Plaintiffby depriving her of her 50% ownership in\n\nAxiom Medical and as her rights as a Member and Manager of Axiom. DeLitta's breach resulted\n\nin injury to Plaintiff and benefit to DeLitta.\n\n66.    DeLitta owes Axiom fiduciary duties including the duty to refrain from self-dealing.\n\n67.    DeLitta's unilateral refusal to implement the resolutions of the Board and the Board-\n\napproved Panther Creek Proposed Lease, coupled with his unauthorized and unapproved dictate to\n\nAxiom that it will return to and pursue the prior Panther Creek Lease, constitutes self dealing and\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty, such that the alleged Panther Creek Lease should be declared void,\n\nvoidable, and of no further force and effect.\n\n68.    DeLitta's actions misusing Axiom's corporate credit cards for his personal use and for the\n\npersonal use of his family members and causing entries to be made on Axiom's books creating\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 17\n\n\n                                                                                                          413\n\fpayables to himself when such payables were never made in the past and in the absence of an\n\nassignment agreement assigning Axiom Medical's rights in the software to DeLitta constitutes a\n\nbreach ofDeLitta's fiduciary duty to refrain from self-dealing.\n\n69.      DeLitta has breached his fiduciary duty by using corporate assets for his own personal\n\nbenefit when he caused Axiom to pay for personal litigation expenses in this lawsuit.\n\nF.       Count Six -Negligent Misrepresentation by DeLitta\n\n70.      The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n71.      DeLitta made a representation to Plaintiff and provided false information for the guidance\n\nof others. DeLitta did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating\n\nthe information. Plaintiffjustifiably relied on the representation and the representation proximately\n\ncaused Plaintiff's injuries.\n\nG.       Count Seven - Conversion By DeLitta\n\n72.      The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n73.      Plaintiff owns 50% of the interests in Axiom Medical. DeLitta attempted to transfer\n\nPlaintiff's membership interest to the Trust. As a result, Plaintiff suffered injury and has been\n\ndamaged in an amount in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n74.      Axiom Medical owns the DeLCom Software and/or Program. DeLitta attempt to transfer\n\nthis asset to himself without consent of Axiom Medical or Plaintiff. As a result, Plaintiff suffered\n\ninjury and has been damages in an amount in excess of the minimal jurisdictional limits of this\n\nCourt.\n\n75.      Plaintiff would further show that the conduct of DeLitta is the type of conduct for which\n\nPlaintiff is entitled to punitive and/or exemplary damages. Plaintiff hereby requests the trier of fact\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 18\n\n\n                                                                                                          414\n\fto award Plaintiff punitive and/or exemplary damages in an amount of two times her actual\n\ndamages.\n\nI.      Count Eight- Shareholder Oppression by DeLitta\n\n76.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n77.     DeLitta has, in his conduct described above, usurped and deprived (or has sought and\n\npurported to usurp and deprive) Plaintiff of her rights as a Member and Manager of Axiom including\n\nAxiom Medical, and has oppressed her as a Member. DeLitta's conduct was without color of\n\ncorporate authority, and was also intentional and malicious. Plaintiff seeks recovery ofher monetary\n\ndamages in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limits of this Court, and punitive and exemplary\n\ndamages as permitted by Texas law.\n\nJ.      Count Nine- Constructive Trust\n\n78.     The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n79.     To the extent the Trust was the recipient or transferee of any of Plaintiff's interest in Axiom\n\nMedical, the transfer was intended to hinder, delay and defraud Plaintiff, and was or constituted a\n\ntransfer in exchange for which there was no consideration or no fair value to Plaintiff. This\n\ntransaction was, though known to Mr. DeLitta, concealed from Plaintiff and was not known by her\n\nuntil DeLitta filed a motion to implead the Trustee as a necessary party. Plaintiff's interest in\n\nAxiom Medical arose prior to any such transfer, and the transfer to the Trust was an insider\n\ntransaction, and was not made in good faith as to Plaintiff. Pursuant to TEX. Bus. & COMM. CODE\n\n§ 24.001, et seq., the above transfer, if not void or subject or subservient to the interests ofPlaintiff,\n\nis avoidable. Plaintiff is entitled to, and hereby prays for, all such remedies, at law or in equity as are\n\nprovided under Texas law, including TEX. Bus. & COMM. CODE § 24.008, costs and reasonable\n\nattorneys fees as are equitable and just under TEX. Bus. & COMM. CODE§ 24.013, and the imposition\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 19\n\n\n                                                                                                              415\n\fof an equitable lien or constructive trust on the 50% member interest. In the alternative, Plaintiff\n\nprays for damages and such other equitable relief as may be proven at trial.\n\nJ.     Count Ten -Injunctive Relief From All Defendants\n\n80.    The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n81.    Plaintiff incorporates by reference as if fully set out herein Plaintiff's first, second and third\n\nverified applications for temporary restraining order, temporary injunction and permanent\n\ninjunction, Plaintiff's verification filed on Dec. 15, 2014, and Plaintiff's Verified Application for\n\nTemporary and Permanent Injunction to Enjoin Michael J. DeLitta from Misrepresenting Himself\n\nas a Medical Doctor filed December 12, 2014.\n\n82.    Plaintiff seeks to obtain a permanent injunction in this matter consistent with its claims in\n\nthis lawsuit and the Agreed Temporary Injunction.\n\n83.    Plaintiff has demonstrated a viable cause of action against Defendants; Plaintiff has\n\ndemonstrated a probable right to the relief sought; and Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable\n\nimminent and irreparable injury in the interim for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\n84.    If Defendants' conducts is not permanently enjoined, Plaintiff will continue to suffer an\n\nimmediate and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law to her business\n\nrelationships with Axiom employees, an immediate and irreparable injury to her ownership interests\n\nin Axiom, and an immediate and irreparable injury in her ability to manage Axiom including without\n\nlimitation her ability to create, implement and review company policies, hire and fire employees, set\n\nemployee compensation, and train employees.\n\nK.     Count Eleven- Alternative Request for Corporate Judicial Remedies\n\n85.    The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n\n\n\nPLAINTIFF'S FIFTH AMENDED PETITION\nAND JURY DEMAND- Page 20\n\n\n                                                                                                            416\n\f86.    Plaintiff seeks enforcement of the provisions of the Operating Agreement to appoint a\n\nreceiver to rehabilitate, sell and/or seek dissolution of Axiom Medical pursuant to section 64.001 of\n\nthe Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code and/or sections 11.314, 11.402, 11.403, 11.404, and/or\n\n11.405 of the Texas Business Organizations Code. Notwithstanding the appointment of a Provisional\n\nMember and a Receiver, DeLitta continues to refuse to follow the vote by Axiom's Board including\n\nthe Provisional Member and continues to violate the Agreed Temporary Injunction. Given DeLitta's\n\ncontinual refusal to follow the Board's votes and violations of the Agreed Temporary Injunction, a\n\nreceiver should be given the power to sell the company and/or dissolve it as a perpetual deadlock\n\namong the members is not feasible.\n\nL.     Count Twelve-Unjust Enrichment\n\n87.    The foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.\n\n88.    After receiving the benefit ofPlaintiff's goodwill in the industry, DeLitta: (a) ousted Plaintiff\n\nfrom Axiom Medical; (b) sought to deprive her of her membership interests; (c) created an\n\natmosphere of fear and distrust between the two members; and (d) undermined Plaintiff's\n\nlongstanding and cherished business relationship with the Nursing Staff.\n\n89.    DeLitta received the benefit of Plaintiff's goodwill by fraud, duress, or the taking of an\n\nundue advantage. DeLitta wrongfully secured or passively received this benefit and it would be\n\nunconscionable for him to retain it.\n\n                             VI.       CONDITIONS PRECEDENT\n\n90.

DeLitta (\"DeLitta\") from Misrepresenting\n\nHimself as a Medical Doctor.\n\n        After having reviewed the pleadings on file, after having heard the arguments of counsel\n\nand testimony from witnesses, the Court finds that Plaintiff's verified application for temporary\n\ninjunction should be granted.\n\nThe Court finds that:\n\nI.      DeLitta is not a medical doctor.\n\n2.      DeLitta serves as President and CEO of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\").\n\n3.    Axiom provides medical consulting services and advertises that it \"employs Doctors,\n\nPhysician Assistants, Registered Nurses, an a specially trained staff to provide a full suite of\n\n\n\n\n                        Case# D-1-GN-13-003516\n\n                        1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n                        003993332\n                                                                                                    624\n\f                                       DC           BK15113 PG976\n\n\n\n\nmedical management services, ranging from work-related injury case management to a multitude\n\nof customizable exam programs.\"\n\n4.    DeLitta is a licensed physician assistant.\n\n5.    DeLitta has a Ph.D in Psychology from Newport University.\n\n6.    Axiom's company brochures and website to refer to DeLitta as \"Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.\"\n\n7.    DeLitta has referred to himself as a \"doctor\" and uses the titles \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\" in the\n\ncourse of his work for Axiom.\n\n8.    DeLitta has a license plate that reads \"OCC DOC\" which refers to being an Occupational\n\nDoctor.\n\n9.    DeLitta has had a credit card with the term \"M.D.\" after his name.\n\n10.   DeLitta uses the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in writing, including in e-mails\n\nand letters to Axiom employees and Axiom customers.\n\nII.   DeLitta answers and responds to the title \"Doctor\" when the circumstances make it obvious\n\nthat the person addressing him believes that he is a medical doctor, and that DeLitta never\n\ncorrects or clarifies the misunderstanding.\n\n12.   Because Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides medical advice, there is a\n\nsubstantial likelihood that DeLitta's use of the \"Dr.\" title could mislead others into believing that\n\nhe is a medical doctor.\n\n13.   DeLitta's conduct is causing immediate and irreparable harm to Axiom's reputation and may\n\nsubject Axiom to civil and criminal liability thereby diminishing its value and causing damages\n\nthat are not quantifiable.\n\n14.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a viable cause of action against DeLitta.\n\n15.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable right to the relief sought.\n\n\nTemporary Injunction Enjoining Michael J. DeLitta\nFrom Misrepresenting Himself as Medical Doctor\n\n\n                                                                                                        625\n\f                                        DC              BK15113 PG977\n\n\n\n\n16.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable immediate and irreparable injury in the interim that cannot\n\nbe compensated by money damages for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\n17.   If DeLitta's conduct is not enjoined, his conduct will cause immediate and irreparable injury to\n\nAxiom's reputation, not only with its customers and employees but also within the medical industry,\n\nand makes it a party to false advertising and complicit in DeLitta' s wrongful conduct.\n\n        IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, that Defendant MICHAEL J.

DeLitta (\"DeLitta\") from Misrepresenting\n\nHimself as a Medical Doctor.\n\n        After having reviewed the pleadings on file, after having heard the arguments of counsel\n\nand testimony from witnesses, the Court finds that Plaintiff's verified application for temporary\n\ninjunction should be granted.\n\nThe Court finds that:\n\n1.      DeLitta is not a medical doctor.\n\n2.      DeLitta serves as President and CEO of Axiom Medical Consulting, LLC (\"Axiom\").\n\n3.    Axiom provides medical consulting services and advertises that it \"employs Doctors,\n\nPhysician Assistants, Registered Nurses, an a specially trained staff to provide a full suite of\n\n\n\n\nTemporary Injunction Enjoining Michael J.

DeLitta is a licensed physician assistant.\n\n5.     DeLitta has a Ph.D in Psychology from Newport University.\n\n6.    Axiom's company brochures and website to refer to DeLitta as \"Dr. Michael J. DeLitta.\"\n\n7.    DeLitta has referred to himself as a \"doctor\" and uses the titles \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\" in the\n\ncourse of his work for Axiom.\n\n8.    DeLitta has a license plate that reads \"OCC DOC\" which refers to being an Occupational\n\nDoctor.\n\n9.    DeLitta has had a credit card with the term \"M.D.\" after his name.\n\n10.   DeLitta uses the title \"Doctor\" and/or \"Dr.\", both orally and in writing, including in e-mails\n\nand letters to Axiom employees and Axiom customers.\n\n11.   DeLitta answers and responds to the title \"Doctor\" when the circumstances make it obvious\n\nthat the person addressing him believes that he is a medical doctor, and that DeLitta never\n\ncorrects or clarifies the misunderstanding.\n\n12.   Because Axiom is a medical consulting company and provides medical advice, there is a\n\nsubstantial likelihood that DeLitta's use of the \"Dr.\" title could mislead others into believing that\n\nhe is a medical doctor.\n\n13.   DeLitta's conduct is causing immediate and irreparable harm to Axiom's reputation and\n\nmay subject Axiom to civil and criminal liability thereby diminishing its value and causing\n\ndamages that are not quantifiable.\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   2\nTemporary Injunction Enjoining Michael J.

Plaintiff has demonstrated a viable cause of action against DeLitta.\n\n 15.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable right to the relief sought.\n\n 16.   Plaintiff has demonstrated a probable immediate and irreparable injury in the interim that\n\n cannot be compensated by money damages for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\n\n 17.   If DeLitta's conduct is not enjoined, his conduct will cause immediate and irreparable injury\n\nto Axiom's reputation, not only with its customers and employees but also within the medical\n\nindustry, and makes it a party to false advertising and complicit in DeLitta's wrongful conduct.\n\n       IT IS THEREFORE, ORDERED, that Defendant MICHAEL J.
