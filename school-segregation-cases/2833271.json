The Section 8 voucher program is a voluntary program through which\nthe federal government provides rent subsidies to eligible low-income families who rent from\nparticipating landlords. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a). The Fair Housing Act, also known as Title VIII,\nbars discrimination “against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a\ndwelling . . . because of race . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). In this case, Graoch, the owner of Autumn\nRun Apartments in Louisville, seeks a declaratory judgment that it did not violate the FHA by\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 06-5561              Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                     Page 2\n                         County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nwithdrawing from the Section 8 program. Its claim presents two questions regarding the interplay\nbetween Section 8 and the FHA. First, can a landlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program ever\nviolate the FHA solely because it has a disparate impact on members of a protected class? Second,\nif so, what are the standards for measuring disparate impact?\n         The district court answered the first question in the negative and therefore granted summary\njudgment in favor of Graoch without reaching the second question. We reach the same final result,\nbut in a different way. Disagreeing with the position taken by the Second and Seventh Circuits, we\nhold that a plaintiff can, in principle, rely on evidence of some instances of disparate impact to show\nthat a landlord violated the Fair Housing Act by withdrawing from Section 8. We also hold,\nhowever, that in this case the Metro Human Relations Commission did not even allege facts making\nthe statistical comparison necessary to state a prima facie case of disparate-impact discrimination.\nConsequently, we affirm.\n                                                        I\n        The Housing Authority of Jefferson County (“HAJC”) coordinates the local disbursement\nof Section 8 funds in the Louisville area. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(b)(1) (“The Secretary is authorized\nto enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such\nagencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units\nin accordance with this section.”). In March 2003, Graoch notified the HAJC that it intended to\nwithdraw from the Section 8 voucher program, stating that it would honor existing leases by Section\n8 tenants but would not renew those leases or sign any new Section 8 leases.\n         The Kentucky Fair Housing Council (“FHC”) and three Autumn Run tenants receiving\nSection 8 assistance – Joyce McNealy, Tina Gray, and Angela Thornton – filed a complaint with the\nMetro Human Relations Commission. The Commission found probable cause to believe that\nGraoch’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program constituted unlawful racial discrimination because\nit had a disparate impact on blacks. On Graoch’s motion, it then stayed administrative proceedings\nto give Graoch the1opportunity to seek declaratory relief in federal court. Graoch responded by\ninitiating this case.\n        The parties agreed to a series of factual stipulations. Eighteen families receiving Section 8\nassistance lived at Autumn Run when Graoch announced that it was withdrawing from the Section\n8 program. Seventeen of those families were black. As of 2003, 6,270 of the 8,849 Jefferson\nCounty residents receiving Section 8 vouchers were black. Finally, as of the 2000 census, 18.9%\nof Jefferson County residents were black and 24% were members of black households. Absent from\nthe joint stipulations, however, was any information regarding the races of the non-Section 8 tenants\nat Autumn Run. Indeed, the only reference contained in the record to the racial makeup of Autumn\nRun as a whole, or of its non-Section 8 tenants, is a remark by Graoch’s counsel, quoted by the\nCommission in its probable cause finding: “the tenants at Respondent project Autumn Run\nApartments were 90% minority and 10% white.”\n       Graoch stated that it chose to withdraw from the Section 8 program because of disputes with\nthe HAJC regarding rent payments made on behalf of Section 8 tenants. Graoch claimed that the\nHAJC held Graoch “to an impossible standard” in enforcing the quality standards for Section 8,\n“abating rent for conditions which Graoch was either not made aware of prior to inspection, or\nwhich it attempted to fix only to be cited upon re-inspection for not making its repairs to the\n\n\n        1\n          Graoch named only the Commission as a defendant; the FHC moved to intervene as of right, but the district\ncourt denied that motion.\n\fNo. 06-5561                Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                              Page 3\n                           County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\narbitrary satisfaction of the inspector.” See 24 C.F.R. § 982.401 (stating “the housing quality\nstandards . . . for housing assisted” through the Section 8 program).\n        Based on this record, Graoch moved for summary judgment. First, it argued that the\nCommission failed to state a prima facie case that Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 violated the\nFHA because it had a disparate impact on blacks. Second, it argued that its withdrawal from Section\n8 did not violate the FHA even if the Commission did state a prima facie case because the decision\nto withdraw resulted from a “business necessity.” The district court granted summary judgment for\nGraoch, holding that a party offering only evidence that a landlord’s withdrawal from the Section\n8 program had a disparate impact on members of a protected class cannot establish a prima facie\ncase that the landlord violated the FHA.\n         The Commission appealed. We review the district court’s decision de novo. See Trustees\nof the Mich. Laborers’ Health Care Fund v. Gibbons, 209 F.3d 587, 590 (6th Cir. 2000). Summary\njudgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\nOrdinarily, we may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any basis fairly presented by the record,\nas long as the opposing party “is not denied an opportunity to respond to the new theory.” Herm v.\nStafford, 663 F.2d 669, 684 (6th Cir. 1981). In this case, however, both parties agree that we should\nremand the case to the district court if it is necessary to consider the adequacy of Graoch’s business\njustification for its withdrawal from Section 8. As a result, we consider only whether the\nCommission has stated a prima facie case.\n                                                              II\n        Before delving into the specific implications of withdrawal from Section 8 and the even-\nmore-specific details of this case, we must address as a general matter the law governing disparate-\nimpact claims under the FHA. We previously have held that a plaintiff     can establish a violation of\nthe FHA by showing either disparate treatment or disparate impact.2 Larkin v. Mich. Dep’t of Soc.\nServs., 89 F.3d 285, 289 (6th Cir. 1996). We have stated that, to show disparate impact, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that a facially neutral policy or practice has the effect of discriminating against\na protected class of which the plaintiff is a member. Blaz v. Barberton Garden Apartment, No. 91-\n3896, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 18508, at *8 (6th Cir. July 29, 1992) (unpublished). We have not\ndecided, however, what framework we should use to determine whether a plaintiff has done enough\nto survive summary judgment on a disparate-impact claim against a private defendant under the\nFHA.\n        We find it useful to compare the frameworks that we have applied to three similar kinds of\nclaims: disparate-treatment claims against private defendants under the FHA, disparate-impact\nclaims against private defendants under Title VII, and disparate-impact claims against governmental\ndefendants under the FHA. In disparate-treatment cases under the FHA, we apply “the three-part\nburden of proof test established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).”\nSelden Apartments v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 785 F.2d 152, 159 (6th Cir. 1986) (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). First, the plaintiff must state a prima facie case by showing\nthat he is a member of a protected class, that he applied to and was qualified to rent or purchase\ncertain housing, that he was rejected, and that the housing remained available thereafter. Maki v.\n\n\n         2\n           Although Graoch is the plaintiff in this declaratory judgment action, when discussing a generic claim we use\n“plaintiff” to refer to the party alleging a violation of the FHA and “defendant” to refer to the party that allegedly violated\nthe FHA.\n\fNo. 06-5561            Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                              Page 4\n                       County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nLaakko, 88 F.3d 361, 364 (6th Cir. 1996). Second, the defendant may then articulate a legitimate\nnon-discriminatory basis for its challenged decision. Selden Apartments, 785 F.2d at 160. Third,\nif the defendant does proffer such a basis, the plaintiff must establish that the articulated reason is\npretextual. Ibid. The burden of persuasion always remains with the plaintiff.\n       We imported this framework from our disparate-treatment cases under Title VII. See Larkin,\n89 F.3d at 289; compare Daniels v. Bd. of Educ., 805 F.2d 203, 207 (6th Cir. 1986) (addressing a\ndisparate-treatment claim under Title VII) with Selden, 785 F.2d at 159 (applying the same\nframework to a disparate-treatment claim under the FHA). We agreed with the reasoning used by\nthe Second Circuit, which found “persuasive” the “parallel between Title VII and Title VIII”:\n        The two statutes are part of a coordinated scheme of federal civil rights laws enacted\n        to end discrimination; the Supreme Court has held that both statutes must be\n        construed expansively to implement that goal. See, e.g., Trafficante v. Metro. Life\n        Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211-12 (1972) (Fair Housing Act must be generously\n        construed to foster integration); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-36\n        (1971) (Title VII should be interpreted broadly to achieve equal employment\n        opportunity). Courts and commentators have observed that the two statutes require\n        similar proof to establish a violation.\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935 (2d Cir.), aff’d on other\ngrounds, 485 U.S. 18 (1988) (cited in Blaz, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 18508, at *8, and Bangerter v.\nOrem City Corp., 46 F.3d 1491, 1501 (10th Cir. 1995), which in turn was cited in Larkin, 89 F.3d\nat 289). In sum, we concluded that we generally should evaluate claims under the FHA by\nanalogizing them to comparable claims under Title VII. Larkin, 89 F.3d at 289.\n         In disparate-impact cases under Title VII, we apply a different version of the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting framework than in disparate-treatment cases. We follow the same three\nsteps: the plaintiff states a prima facie case; the defendant responds; the plaintiff rebuts the response.\nSee Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ., 224 F.3d 806, 830 (6th Cir. 2000). To state a prima facie case,\nhowever, a Title VII plaintiff basing his claim on disparate impact must “identify[] and challeng[e]\na specific employment practice, and then show an adverse effect by offering statistical evidence of\na kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse effect in\nquestion.” Ibid. To respond, the defendant must articulate a “legitimate business reason” for the\nchallenged decision, rather than simply a non-discriminatory basis. Ibid. Finally, to rebut the\ndefendant’s response, the plaintiff can show “either that the employer's reason is a pretext for\ndiscrimination, or that there exists an alternative employment practice that would achieve the same\nbusiness ends with a less discriminatory impact.” Ibid. Relying on the analogy between Title VII\nand the FHA, several other circuits have applied essentially this approach to disparate-impact claims\nunder the FHA. Hack v. President & Fellows of Yale Coll., 237 F.3d 81, 98-102 (2d Cir. 2000);\nLanglois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 2000); Mountain Side Mobile Estates\nP’ship v. Sec’y of Hous. & Urban Dev. ex rel. VanLoozenoord, 56 F.3d 1243, 1251 (10th Cir. 1995).\nSo has a district court in our circuit. Marbly v. Home Props. of N.Y., 205 F. Supp. 2d 736, 740 (E.D.\nMich. 2002).\n        In a disparate-impact case against a governmental defendant under the FHA, however, we\ndid not mention the burden-shifting framework or the elements of a prima facie case. See Arthur\nv. City of Toledo, 782 F.2d 565, 575-78 (6th Cir. 1986). Instead, we stated that, to determine\n“whether conduct which produces a discriminatory effect but which did not have a discriminatory\nintent” violates the FHA, we must consider three factors: (1) the strength of the plaintiff’s showing\nof discriminatory effect; (2) the strength of the defendant’s interest in taking the challenged action;\nand (3) whether the plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant affirmatively to provide housing for\n\fNo. 06-5561              Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                       Page 5\n                         County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nmembers of minority groups or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual\nproperty owners who wish to provide such housing. Id. at 575 (adopting a modified version of the\nfour-factor standard used in Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.3 v. Village of Arlington\nHeights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1290 (7th Cir. 1977) (“Arlington Heights II”)). Neither our opinion in\nArthur nor the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in Arlington Heights II makes clear whether this three-\nfactor balancing approach is the way to evaluate the claim as a whole after the parties have\ncompleted all three steps in the burden-shifting framework, or whether the burden-shifting\nframework does not apply. Compare 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. Dist. of Columbia, 444\nF.3d 673, 680 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (contrasting “the Seventh Circuit's four-factor inquiry” to “the\nSecond Circuit[’s] . . . burden-shifting framework,” thereby indicating it reads Arlington Heights\nII not to require a prima facie case) with Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 n.32 (3d\nCir. 1977) (“We read the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in Arlington Heights II as requiring no more than\nwe do in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case . . . . To the extent that the Seventh\nCircuit would seem to go beyond this standard in its statement of ‘critical factors,’ our impression\nis that the court is setting forth a standard upon which ultimate Title VIII relief may be predicated,\nrather than indicating the point at which the evidentiary burden of justifying a discriminatory effect\nwill shift to the defendant.”).\n        In formulating a framework to analyze disparate-impact claims against private defendants\nunder the FHA, we think that it is best to merge the approaches we used in Arthur and in our Title\nVII disparate-impact cases by reading the Arthur standard as a supplement, not an alternative, to the\nburden-shifting framework. Treating the Arthur standard as an alternative would conflict with our\nstatement in Larkin that similar claims under Title VII and the FHA generally should receive similar\ntreatment. See Larkin, 89 F.3d at 289. And when applied to private defendants, the Arthur standard\nnicely captures the inquiry that we must perform at the third step in the burden-shifting framework.\nTo determine whether a defendant’s proffered business reason is a pretext for discrimination, or\nwhether an alternative practice exists that would achieve the same business ends with a less\ndiscriminatory impact, we must consider the strength of the plaintiff’s statistical evidence of\ndisparate impact and the strength of the defendant’s interest in maintaining the challenged practice.\nThose are the first two Arthur factors. The third Arthur factor, distinguishing defendants who wish\nonly not to provide housing themselves from those who wish to stop others from providing housing,\nis not relevant to claims against private defendants, who lack the authority to control third-party\nbehavior (though it is relevant when applied to governmental defendants, who through zoning\nregulations or land-use permit requirements might have the authority to control the housing\ndevelopment and allocation decisions of third parties). Consequently, we think that our approaches\nto disparate-impact claims under Title VII and disparate-impact claims against governmental\ndefendants under the FHA are compatible, not inconsistent.\n        Borrowing from our Title VII cases, then, we hold that disparate-impact claims against\nprivate defendants under the FHA should be analyzed using a form of the McDonnell Douglas\nburden-shifting framework:\n        - First, a plaintiff must make a prima facie case of discrimination by “identifying and\nchallenging a specific [housing] practice, and then show[ing] an adverse effect by offering statistical\nevidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse\neffect in question,” Kovacevich, 224 F.3d at 830 (disparate impact claim under Title VII);\n\n         3\n          We followed the same procedure in another case involving a disparate-impact claim against a governmental\ndefendant under the FHA. See Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found. v. City of Cuyahoga Falls, 263 F.3d 627, 640 (6th Cir.\n2001). The Supreme Court subsequently granted certiorari in that case, reversed our decision on other grounds, and\nvacated our decision regarding the plaintiff’s FHA claim because the plaintiff abandoned that claim before the Supreme\nCourt.

In\norder to evaluate the plaintiff’s showing, we consider the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of\ndiscriminatory effect against the strength of the defendant’s interest in taking the challenged action.\nSee Arthur, 782 F.2d at 575 (disparate-impact claim against a governmental defendant under the\nFHA).\n                                                         III\n        Graoch argues that, instead of analyzing the Commission’s claims through this burden-\nshifting framework, we should exempt landlords from any possible  liability under the FHA for a\ncomplete withdrawal from the Section 8 voucher program.4 The Second Circuit, in Salute v.\nStratford Greens Garden Apartments, 136 F.3d 293 (2d Cir. 1998), and the Seventh Circuit, in\nKnapp v. Eagle Property Management Corp., 54 F.3d 1272 (7th Cir. 1995), have created such a\ncategorical exemption for Section 8 withdrawals. We decline to do so.\n        The FHA prohibits discrimination “against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges\nof sale or rental of a dwelling . . . because of race . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). The Supreme Court\nheld that Title VII, which uses similar language, “proscribes not only overt discrimination but also\npractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.” Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S.\n424, 431 (1971). The same analysis justifies the existence of disparate-impact liability under the\nFHA. “What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers\nto [access to housing] when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or\nother impermissible classification.” Ibid. (discussing Title VII).\n        Of course, not every housing practice that has a disparate impact is illegal. We use the\nburden-shifting framework described above – and especially the final inquiry considering the\nstrength of the plaintiff’s statistical evidence and the strength of the defendant’s business reason –\nto distinguish the artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers proscribed by the FHA from valid\npolicies and practices crafted to advance legitimate interests. Our analysis is derived from our\ninterpretation of the statute, and we cannot create categorical exemptions from it without a statutory\nbasis.\n       In Knapp and Salute, our sister circuits seem to have taken a more circumscribed view of\ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA. The Knapp court stated:\n         “[T]he courts must use their discretion in deciding whether, given the particular\n         circumstances of each case, relief should be granted under the statute.” [Arlington\n         Heights II,] 558 F.2d at 1290. . . . [T]his court has recognized that disparate impact\n         analysis is not appropriate in certain contexts. See NAACP v. American Family\n         Mutual Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 287, 290 (7th Cir. 1992) (claim alleging failure to insure\n         in certain areas violated the Act not conducive to disparate-impact analysis), cert.\n         denied, 508 U.S. 907, 113 S. Ct. 2335, 124 L. Ed. 2d 247(1993); Village of Bellwood\n\n\n         4\n         Even were we to accept this argument, landlords still could face liability under a disparate-treatment theory,\nas opposed to a disparate-impact theory, if they refused to accept Section 8 vouchers from some tenants (who were\npredominantly black) but accepted Section 8 vouchers from others (who were predominantly white).\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                              Page 7\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521, 1533 (7th Cir. 1990) (“Some practices lend themselves\n        to disparate impact method, others not.”).\nKnapp, 54 F.3d at 1280. This passage appears to say that some disparate-impact claims should fail\neven if the plaintiff could prevail under the standard burden-shifting framework. We cannot endorse\nthis view.\n        When we adjudicate statutory claims, “our role is limited to interpreting what Congress may\ndo and has done.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 188 (1989). While reasonable\nminds could disagree as to whether the FHA contemplates disparate impact liability, we have\nconcluded that it does. See Larkin, 89 F.3d at 289; Arthur, 782 F.2d at 575. Nothing in the text of\nthe FHA instructs us to create practice-specific exceptions. Absent such instruction, we lack the\nauthority to evaluate the pros and cons of allowing disparate-impact claims challenging a particular\nhousing practice and to prohibit claims that we believe to be unwise as a matter of social policy.\nAccord Salute, 136 F.3d at 312 & n.23 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (expressing “doubt whether the\nSeventh Circuit’s approach” in Knapp is “consistent with” the general use of the burden-shifting\nframework to analyze disparate-impact claims under the FHA).\n         The passage from Knapp also could mean something more limited: that if no disparate-\nimpact challenge to a particular practice ever could succeed under the burden-shifting framework,\nthen a court categorically may bar all disparate-impact challenges to that practice. This reading is\nconsistent with our statement that “at least under some circumstances a violation of [the Fair\nHousing Act] can be established by a showing of discriminatory effect without a showing of\ndiscriminatory intent.” Arthur, 782 F.2d at 574 (quoting Arlington Heights II, 558 F.2d at 1290)\n(alteration in original). It is also consistent with the cases relied on by the Seventh Circuit in Knapp.\nIn NAACP v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co., for example, the court held that insurers never\ncan face disparate-impact liability for “charging higher rates or declining to write insurance for\npeople who live in particular areas,” reasoning that “[i]nsurance works best when the risks in the\npool have similar characteristics.” 978 F.2d at 290. Conducting an inquiry analogous to our inquiry\nat the third step in the burden-shifting framework, it concluded that the strength of the insurer’s\ninterest in declining to insure in certain areas outweighed the strength of any possible disparate\nimpact the policy could have. See id. at 290-91.\n        Likewise, in Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, the court concluded that claims of “racial\nsteering” were not subject to disparate-impact analysis because racial steering necessarily involves\ndisparate treatment, not a facially neutral policy that has a discriminatory effect. 895 F.2d at 1533.\nWe agree that categorical bars are justified when they result from a generalized application of the\nburden-shifting framework. We see no reason to require courts to engage in the Sisyphean task of\nworking through the burden-shifting framework in each individual case when the plaintiff has no\nchance of success (for example, when a plaintiff brings a disparate-impact challenge to a landlord’s\ndecision to charge rent).\n        We do not believe, however, that it is impossible for a disparate-impact challenge to a\nlandlord’s withdrawal from Section 8 to succeed under the burden-shifting framework. Consider\nthe strongest possible disparate-impact challenge to a landlord’s withdrawal from Section 8: All of\nthe non-Section 8 tenants at a housing complex are white. The landlord decides to participate in the\nSection 8 voucher program. A number of Section 8 participants move in, including the plaintiff.\nAll are black. The landlord quickly decides to withdraw from Section 8 and refuses to renew the\nleases of existing Section 8 tenants. He explains his decision by saying simply that he no longer\nwished to participate in the program, without claiming that his participation cost him money, time,\nbusiness opportunities, or any other benefit.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                         Page 8\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        At the first stage of the burden-shifting framework, the hypothetical plaintiff could state a\nprima facie case: she could identify a challenged practice (the landlord’s withdrawal from Section\n8) and present strong statistical evidence that the practice had a disparate impact on blacks. At the\nsecond stage of the burden-shifting framework, the landlord could offer a business reason for his\ndecision: he wanted out of the Section 8 program. At the third stage, then, the plaintiff would have\nto show either that the landlord’s explanation was a pretext for discrimination or that an alternate\npractice would serve the same business ends with less discriminatory effect. To evaluate the\nplaintiff’s showing, we would consider the strength of her evidence of disparate impact and the\nstrength of the business interests stated by the landlord. We have little doubt that a reasonable fact-\nfinder presented with this hypothetical set of facts could conclude that the landlord’s withdrawal\nfrom Section 8 was pretextual, and therefore that the plaintiff’s claim should survive summary\njudgment under the burden-shifting framework.\n        Graoch makes two arguments that could undermine this conclusion. First, it contends that\nbecause Section 8 is a voluntary program we should place exceptional weight on a landlord’s\ninterest in being able to withdraw without the threat of litigation. Yet to say that Section 8\nparticipation is “voluntary” is only to say that a landlord does not break the law by declining to\nparticipate.5 As such, Graoch’s claim proves too much: almost every action that could create\ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA is voluntary. Cf. Buckeye, 263 F.3d at 631-32 (vacated)\n(approving building site plans); Maki, 88 F.3d at 64 (varying of rent based on number of occupants).\nThe mere fact that a landlord often can withdraw from Section 8 without violating the terms of\nSection 8 or the FHA does not mean that withdrawal from Section 8 never can constitute a violation\nof the FHA.\n        Second, Graoch claims that there is no coherent way to permit disparate-impact challenges\nto a landlord’s withdrawal from Section 8 without also permitting such challenges to a landlord’s\nnon-participation in Section 8. It reasons that “[t]he actions of both non-participating and\nparticipating owners have the same impact on minorities” and therefore that “no principled way\nexists” to distinguish the two groups. Knapp, 54 F.3d at 1280. While we agree that a landlord\nshould never face disparate-impact liability for non-participation in Section 8, we do not think that\nwithdrawal and non-participation are functionally identical. Withdrawal affects an identifiable\ngroup: tenants receiving Section 8 assistance. Non-participation could be said to have a theoretical\nimpact on members of a protected class, but the size and composition of the affected group is\nindeterminate.\n        Moreover, the FHA does not impose liability based solely on the existence of a disparate\nimpact. It imposes liability only when a plaintiff can meet the ultimate burden of persuasion by\nshowing either that the landlord’s business reason for a practice is a pretext for discrimination or that\nan alternative practice would serve the same business goal with less discriminatory effect. That\nburden is harder to meet in a challenge to non-participation than in a challenge to withdrawal. A\nnon-participating landlord presumptively can appeal to his interests in not wanting to spend time\nlearning about the program and not wanting to become entangled in government bureaucracy, while\na withdrawing landlord who fails to cite any reason why participation in Section 8 hurt his business\ncannot do so. And an unexplained withdrawal from Section 8, combined with strong evidence of\n\n         5\n           Nothing in the language of Section 8 indicates that, in making the program voluntary, Congress intended to\ndo more than give landlords the option not to participate. Although Congress created the Section 8 program six years\nafter passing the FHA, see Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 653\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437-37f), it did not include language indicating that Section 8 landlords should\nbe exempt from any FHA requirements. Nor did Congress add any exceptions to the FHA when it later amended Section\n8 “to minimize the burdens of Section 8 participation in order to make the program more attractive to landlords.” Salute,\n136 F.3d at 298 (discussing the passage of Pub. L. No. 104-134, § 203(a), (d), 110 Stat. 1321 (1996)).\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                             Page 9\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\ndisparate impact, might permit a fact-finder to infer that a landlord entered Section 8 expecting to\nattract Section 8 tenants of one race, then withdrew based on discriminatory animus when she\ninstead attracted tenants of a different race. Thus, our view that it is possible to bring disparate-\nimpact challenges to withdrawals from Section 8 is consistent with our view that one cannot bring\na disparate-impact challenge to Section 8 non-participation.\n                                                  IV\n         Because we reject a categorical rule against disparate-impact challenges to withdrawals from\nSection 8, we must address whether the Commission can state a prima facie case of disparate impact\ndiscrimination against Graoch in this case. To state a prima facie case of disparate-impact\ndiscrimination under the FHA, a plaintiff must (1) identify and challenge a specific housing practice,\nand then (2) show that the practice had an adverse effect on members of a protected class by offering\nstatistical evidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the\nadverse effect in question. The Commission plainly satisfied the first requirement by identifying\nand challenging Graoch’s practice of no longer accepting Section 8 vouchers. We conclude that it\ndid not satisfy the second requirement, however, because it failed even to allege any facts making\nthe statistical comparison necessary to determine whether Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 had\na disparate impact on blacks.\n        In Arthur, we explained that there are “two types of discriminatory effects which a facially\nneutral housing decision can have”:\n       The first occurs when that decision has a greater adverse impact on one racial group\n       than on another. The second is the effect which the decision has on the community\n       involved; if it perpetuates segregation and thereby prevents interracial association\n       it will be considered invidious under the Fair Housing Act independently of the\n       extent to which it produces a disparate effect on different racial groups.\n782 F.2d at 575 (citing Arlington Heights II, 558 F.2d at 1290). In a disparate-impact case under\nthe FHA, a plaintiff must present statistical evidence showing the existence of at least one of the two\neffects to state a prima facie case. Here, the Commission presented three pieces of data: seventeen\nof the eighteen families who received Section 8 assistance and lived at Autumn Run when Graoch\nannounced its withdrawal are black; as of 2003, 6,270 of the 8,849 Jefferson County residents\nreceiving Section 8 vouchers were black; and as of the 2000 census, 18.9% of Jefferson County\nresidents were black and 24% were members of black households. It made no other allegations\nregarding the racial makeup of Autumn Run or the surrounding community.\n        To determine whether a plaintiff can show the first type of discriminatory effect described\nin Arthur, “[t]he correct inquiry is whether the policy in question had a disproportionate impact on\nthe minorities in the total group to which the policy was applied.” Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs.,\n736 F.2d 983, 987 (4th Cir. 1984) (emphasis added); cf. Isabel v. City of Memphis, 404 F.3d 404,\n412 (6th Cir. 2005) (applying essentially the same inquiry in a Title VII case). In Betsey, a landlord\nmanaging several adjacent buildings adopted a policy banning children from Building Three. 736\nF.2d at 985. The policy led to the eviction of 54.3% of the non-white tenants in Building Three, but\nonly 14.1% of white tenants. Id. at 988. Relying on the discrepancy between those percentages, the\ncourt held that the plaintiffs had made a prima facie case even though “the percentage of blacks at\n[the apartment complex as a whole] continues to exceed by a substantial margin both the percentage\nof black renters in the election district in which [the complex] is located as well as in Montgomery\nCounty as a whole.” Id. at 986-87. This approach respects the common-sense notion that a policy\napplied to a population that is 95 percent black does not have a disproportionate adverse effect on\nblacks even if 90 percent of the people it burdens are black.\n\fNo. 06-5561          Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                         Page 10\n                     County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        Here, Graoch applied its “no Section 8” policy to all residents of Autumn Run.\nConsequently, to determine whether the policy had a greater adverse effect on blacks than whites,\nwe should compare the percentage of blacks among the Section 8 tenants whose leases were not\nrenewed (about 94 percent) to the percentage of blacks among the total pool of tenants at Autumn\nRun. Yet the Commission has not presented any data regarding the total tenant pool and has not\neven alleged that there are more whites among the non-Section 8 tenants than among the Section 8\ntenants. The only information we have about Autumn Run’s non-Section 8 tenants is an isolated\ncomment by Graoch’s lawyer that “the tenants at Respondent project Autumn Run Apartments were\n90% minority and 10% white.” If we consider this information (which the Commission does not\ndispute), it indicates that the racial mix of Autumn Run’s Section 8 and non-Section 8 tenants was\nessentially the same, overwhelmingly non-white. Because the Commission has not even alleged –\nand very likely could not show – that Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 harmed a disproportionate\npercentage of the black tenants at Autumn Run, we conclude that the Commission has not stated a\nprima facie case based on the first type of discriminatory effect. There can be no prima facie case\nof racial disparate impact without a showing of adverse impact on a racial group. For all that the\nCommission alleges, any vacancies caused by non-renewal of Section 8 leases to black tenants will\nbe filled by black non-Section 8 tenants, who already fill the very large majority of Autumn Run’s\napartments.\n        The Commission has not stated a prima facie case based on the second type of discriminatory\neffect either. It has never claimed that Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 had a segregative effect\nnor alleged any facts from which we could infer a segregative effect: it has not provided any\ninformation about the racial makeup of the community surrounding Autumn Run or about the likely\neffect of withdrawal on the racial makeup of Autumn Run itself.\n       Because the Commission cannot meet its burden at the first step of the burden-shifting\nframework, its case cannot go forward. Graoch is not required to present a legitimate business\nreason justifying its decision to withdraw from Section 8.\n                                                 V\n        For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Graoch\nis affirmed.\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v.

I concur in the judgment in this case and in Section\nIV of Judge Boggs’s opinion. I am not sure whether “disparate impact” analysis can “ever” apply\nto refusals to enter or remain in Section 8 housing because I am unable to foresee the full spectrum\nof such cases that could arise in the future. But I agree that there is no valid discrimination case\nhere. The owner apparently became irritated by certain requirements the local housing administrator\nimposed on him, requirements he apparently regarded as too onerous, time consuming and costly.\nSo he withdrew. This apparently angered the administrator and the Commission, and they accused\nhim of discrimination. This seems to be the underlying situation. The local administrative body\nshould have to show either an intent to discriminate based on race or such a significant racial impact\nthat intent can be inferred or that serious harm to a racial minority is likely to occur. None of these\nelements are present here.\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v.

For the\nreasons set forth below, I concur in the lead opinion’s conclusion that a landlord’s withdrawal from\nthe Section 8 program may give rise to a disparate-impact claim under the Fair Housing Act\n(“FHA”), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-\n3631. But I differ in the analytical framework that I think this court should apply to FHA disparate-\nimpact claims against private entities. In the instant case, Graoch has conceded that MHRC has\nestablished a prima facie case of disparate impact under the FHA. I therefore think this court should\nreverse the grant of summary judgment to Graoch. Because the district court offered no reason for\ndenying MHRC’s cross-motion for summary judgment, other than the grant of Graoch’s motion, I\nbelieve this court should vacate the part of the district court’s order denying MHRC’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Insufficient evidence exists for us to rule as a matter of law on whether Graoch\nsuccessfully rebutted MHRC’s prima facie case by showing that withdrawal from the Section 8\nprogram constitutes a business necessity. I therefore believe this court should remand for further\nproceedings.\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n        The Section 8 tenant-based housing-assistance program aids low-income families in\nobtaining housing in the private market. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a). Local public-housing agencies\nreceive federal funds to administer the program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(b)(1). These agencies issue\nvouchers to families who then independently find suitable rental housing provided by private owners\nvoluntarily participating in the program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(6)(B). The local housing agency\npays the housing subsidy directly to the landlord. Participation in the Section 8 program places legal\nduties on owners related to the safety, sanitation, and lease-terms of the rental housing they provide.\n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(d); 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(7)-(8). Public-housing agencies set “the payment\nstandard for each size of dwelling unit in a market area” at not less than ninety percent and not more\nthan 110 percent of “the fair market rental.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B). The monthly assistance\nfor a family is equal to the amount by which the “payment standard” rent determined by the public\nhousing agency exceeds either thirty percent of the monthly adjusted income or ten percent of the\nmonthly income of the family, whichever is greater. A tenant, however, must pay the difference\nbetween his or her subsidy and actual rent, no matter the amount of the payment standard rent. 42\nU.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2)(A); Alfred M. Clark III, Can America Afford to Abandon a National Housing\nPolicy? 6 J. AFFORD. HOUS. & CMTY. DEV. L. 185, 188 (1997).\n        The Housing Authority of Jefferson County administers the Section 8 program in the\nLouisville area. In March 2003, Graoch, the owner of Autumn Run apartments in Louisville,\nnotified the Housing Authority that it would honor existing leases held by Section 8 tenants but\nwould not renew these leases or sign any new Section 8 leases. Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) at 35. Both\nparties have stipulated the following facts: In 2003, 8,849 tenants in Louisville (including Jefferson\nCounty) received Section 8 voucher subsidies, and 6,270 of these tenants were African-Americans.\nAccording to the 2000 census, African-American households comprised approximately twenty-four\npercent and African-Americans comprised approximately nineteen percent of Louisville’s total\npopulation (also including Jefferson County). When Graoch withdrew from the Section 8 program,\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                        Page 13\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nthere were eighteen families at Autumn Run receiving Section 8 vouchers, of which seventeen, or\napproximately ninety-four percent, were African-American families. J.A. at 31-32.\n        The Kentucky Fair Housing Council, Inc. and three Autumn Run tenants receiving financial\nassistance through the Section 8 program filed a complaint with MHRC, which subsequently found\nprobable cause that Graoch’s withdrawal constituted unlawful racial discrimination. J.A. at 56-57,\n86. MHRC stayed administrative proceedings to allow Graoch to seek a declaratory judgment in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky that withdrawal from the Section 8\nprogram cannot constitute a violation of the FHA. J.A. at 65. The current case involves only\nGraoch and MHRC and arises from the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Graoch.1\n                             II. DISPARATE IMPACT UNDER THE FHA\nA. Standard of Review\n        We must review the district court's order granting summary judgment de novo. DiCarlo v.\nPotter, 358 F.3d 408, 414 (6th Cir. 2004). “Summary judgment is proper if the evidence, taken in\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party, shows that there are no genuine issues of material\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Macy v. Hopkins County\nSch. Bd., 484 F.3d 357, 363 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio\nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). We must determine “whether the\nevidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so\none-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Bryson v. Regis Corp., ---F.3d---, No.\n06-5137, 2007 WL 2326046, at *6 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 256 (1986)). Regardless of the evidence put forth by the nonmoving party, the moving party\nhas the burden of establishing that “there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s\ncase.” Patmon v. Mich. Supreme Ct., 224 F.3d 504, 508 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986)). Although both sides in this case made cross-motions for\nsummary judgment before the district court, MHRC now appeals the grant of summary judgment\nto Graoch. Thus, we must view Graoch as the moving party and MHRC as the nonmoving party.\nB. Framework for Analysis\n        Section 3604 of the FHA prohibits discrimination because of, inter alia, race, color, or\nnational origin in the sale or rental of housing by (1) refusing to rent or make available any dwelling;\n(2) offering discriminatory “terms, conditions, or privileges” of rental; (3) making, printing or\npublishing “any notice, statement, or advertisement” indicating a preference, limitation, or\ndiscrimination based on race, color, or national origin; and (4) representing to any person that “any\ndwelling is not available for . . . rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(a)-(d). We have previously held that a plaintiff may establish a violation under the FHA by\nshowing that the defendant has an intent to discriminate (“disparate treatment”) or that an otherwise\nneutral practice has a disparate impact on a protected class (“disparate impact”). Larkin v. Mich.\nDep’t of Soc. Servs., 89 F.3d 285, 289 (6th Cir. 1996). Every one of the ten other circuits to consider\nthe issue has allowed disparate-impact analyses under the FHA. John F. Stanton, The Fair Housing\n\n\n         1\n           The procedural idiosyncracies of this case involving a request for declaratory relief have placed the landlord,\nGraoch, in the position of Plaintiff-Appellee and MHRC in the position of Defendant-Appellant. In a more standard\nFHA claim, tenants or a local fair-housing council would be in the position of plaintiff and private landlords or a\ngovernment entity in the position of defendant. Because Graoch sought declaratory relief on the question whether a\nlandlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program could ever constitute a violation of the FHA, my analysis proceeds\nto consider the appropriate framework for analyzing disparate-impact claims against private defendants. That Graoch\nis here technically plaintiff, rather than defendant, is not significant.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                       Page 14\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nAct and Insurance: An Update and the Question of Disability Discrimination, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV.\n141, 174 n.180 (2002) (listing cases); cf. 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n v. District of Columbia,\n444 F.3d 673, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (assuming without deciding that plaintiffs may bring a disparate-\nimpact claim under the FHA). To prove a disparate-impact claim, a plaintiff need not show any\nintent to discriminate on the part of the defendant. Bacon v. Honda of America Mfg., Inc., 370 F.3d\n565, 576 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 657 (1989)), cert.\ndenied, 543 U.S. 1151 (2005); Nationwide Mut. Ins.Co. v. Cisneros, 52 F.3d 1351, 1362 (6th Cir.\n1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140 (1996).\n        The appropriate framework for analyzing an FHA disparate-impact claim against a private\nentity is an issue of first impression in this circuit. I believe that we should analyze these claims\naccording to a framework derived from that which the Fourth Circuit uses to evaluate FHA\ndisparate-impact claims against private defendants as well as that which we use to evaluate Title VII\ndisparate-impact claims. First, we should require a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case by\nshowing that a challenged housing practice or policy has caused a disparate effect on a protected\nclass. Second, if a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the defendant can avoid liability by\nproving that the challenged practice constituted a business necessity and that there existed no less\ndiscriminatory alternatives that could serve the business interest.\n         1. FHA Disparate-Impact Claims Against Government Defendants\n        In deriving this standard, I have found it helpful to survey how other circuits treat FHA\ndisparate-impact claims against both government and private entities. The circuits evaluate the\nclaim either by applying a multi-factor test, implementing a burden-shifting framework, or\ncombining the two approaches. In Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington\nHeights (Arlington Heights II), 558 F.2d 1283 (7th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1025 (1978),\nthe first court of appeals case concerning disparate impact under the FHA, the Seventh Circuit\nstated: “we2refuse to conclude that every action which produces discriminatory effects is illegal.”\nId. at 1290. The Seventh Circuit accordingly set forth a four-factor test to determine whether an\naction producing a disparate effect violates the FHA. Its factors inquire:\n         (1) how strong is the plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect; (2) is there some\n         evidence of discriminatory intent, though not enough to satisfy the constitutional\n         standard of Washington v. Davis [426 U.S. 229 (1976)]; (3) what is the defendant’s\n         interest in taking the action complained of; and (4) does the plaintiff seek to compel\n         the defendant to affirmatively provide housing for members of minority groups or\n         merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners\n         who wish to provide such housing.\nId. Five years later, the Fourth Circuit adopted the same four factors in considering an FHA\ndisparate-impact claim against a government entity. See Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055,\n1065 (4th Cir. 1982). The Sixth Circuit subsequently applied the Arlington Heights II analysis in\na case involving a defendant government entity, but eliminated the assessment of evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent because it agreed with the Seventh Circuit that this was “the least important\n\n\n         2\n           Arlington Heights II marked the second time the Seventh Circuit had faced the same action concerning\nconstitutional and statutory challenges to Arlington Heights’s zoning law. In Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous.\nDev. Corp. (Arlington Heights I), 429 U.S. 252 (1977), the Supreme Court had overturned the Seventh Circuit’s\nrecognition of a discriminatory-effects violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, holding\nthat the plaintiffs did not show that discriminatory intent motivated the defendants’ challenged rezoning decision. Id.\nat 270-71. The Supreme Court, however, remanded the question of liability under the FHA, which the Seventh Circuit\nhad not earlier addressed. Id. at 271.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                         Page 15\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nof the four factors.” Arthur v. City of Toledo, 782 F.2d 565, 575 (6th Cir. 1986) (citing Arlington\nHeights II, 558 F.2d at 1292). See also Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found. v. City of Cuyahoga Falls, 263\nF.3d 627, 640-41 (6th Cir. 2001) (evaluating the factors articulated in Arthur to conclude that there\nexisted genuine issues of material fact concerning defendants’ liability with respect to a disparate-\nimpact claim under the FHA), vacated on abandonment of claim, 538 U.S. 188, 199-200 (2003).\n        In response to confusion about the stage of litigation at which the Arlington Heights II\nfactors came into play, the Second Circuit clarified that courts should consider the factors as part\nof a “final determination on the merits rather than as a requirement for a prima facie case.”\nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 935 (2d Cir.), aff’d in part, 488\nU.S. 15 (1988). The Second Circuit reasoned: “treating the four factors as steps necessary to make\nout a prima facie case places too    onerous a burden on [plaintiffs].” Id. at 935-36. Drawing on\nearlier Third Circuit precedent,3 the Second Circuit established a burden-shifting framework, which\nconsidered the Arlington Heights II factors “as part of a defendant’s justification for its challenged\naction.” Id. at 935. The Second Circuit held that plaintiffs should first establish a prima facie case\n“by showing that the challenged practice of the defendant ‘actually or predictably results in racial\ndiscrimination; in other words that it has a discriminatory effect.’” Id. at 934 (quoting United States\nv. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, 1184-85 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1042 (1975)).\n“The plaintiff need not show that the decision complained of was made with discriminatory intent.”\nId. Once a plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, a defendant “must prove that its actions\nfurthered, in theory and in practice, a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest and that no\nalternative would serve that interest with less discriminatory effect.” Id. at 936 (citing Resident\nAdvisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148-49 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 908 (1978)).\n        The Tenth Circuit takes the same approach as Huntington Branch in establishing a burden-\nshifting framework and then weighing the government defendant’s justifications against the\nplaintiff’s showing of disparate impact. Reinhart v. Lincoln County, 482 F.3d 1225, 1229 (10th Cir.\n2007). Although the Fifth Circuit has not had occasion to develop    fully the framework for assessing\nFHA disparate-impact claims against government entities,4 at least one district court within the Fifth\nCircuit follows the Huntington Branch analysis. In Dews v. Town of Sunnyvale, 109 F. Supp. 2d\n526, 531-32, 565 (N.D. Tex. 2000), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas held\nthat once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discriminatory effects, the defendant must\nprove that it acted to further a “legitimate, bona fide governmental interest” as well as prove the\nabsence of a less discriminatory alternative. The court then evaluates the disparate-impact claim by\nbalancing the showing of discriminatory effects against that of the defendant’s justifications and by\nassessing whether the plaintiff seeks to compel or to prevent interference with housing provision.\nId.\n       The other circuits that have addressed FHA disparate-impact claims against government\ndefendants have not followed Huntington Branch’s framework for incorporating the Arlington II\n\n\n         3\n           Shortly after the Arlington Heights II decision, the Third Circuit held in Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564\nF.2d 126, 146 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 908 (1978), that a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case under\nthe FHA “by proving that the [defendants’] acts had a discriminatory effect and that the [defendants] have failed to\njustify the discriminatory results of their actions.”\n         4\n          The Fifth Circuit recognizes disparate-impact claims under the FHA but has at least twice found insufficient\nevidence to support plaintiffs’ prima facie cases and, therefore, has not proceeded beyond that stage of analysis. United\nStates v. Mitchell, 580 F.2d 789, 791-92 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding that a plaintiff may produce statistical evidence of\ndiscriminatory effects to establish a disparate-impact claim under the FHA); Bonvillian v. Lawler-Wood Hous., LLC,\nNo. 07-30181, 2007 WL 2083635 (5th Cir. July 13, 2007) (unpublished opinion) (holding that the closing of an\napartment building following Hurricane Katrina did not have a disparate impact on protected classes).\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                        Page 16\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nfactors into an evaluation of the merits of the defendant’s justification for the challenged action. The\nFirst, Third, and Eighth Circuits evaluate FHA disparate-impact claims against government entities\naccording to burden-shifting frameworks and do not employ any final balancing test derived from\nthe Arlington Heights II factors to evaluate the merits of the defendant’s justification. The burden-\nshifting standards employed by these circuits are similar, with the only significant variation being\nthat the Eighth Circuit requires plaintiffs to prove the existence of a less discriminatory alternative,\nwhile the Third Circuit requires defendants to prove the absence of such an alternative; the First\nCircuit has not yet determined the allocation of this burden. See Darst-Webbe Tenant Ass’n Bd. v.\nSt. Louis Hous. Auth., 417 F.3d 898, 902-03 (8th Cir. 2005) (holding that once the plaintiff has\nestablished a prima facie case, the defendant “must demonstrate that the proposed action has ‘a\nmanifest relationship’ to the legitimate, non-discriminatory policy objectives and ‘is justifiable on\nthe ground it is necessary to’ the attainment of these objectives”; the burden then “shifts back to the\nplaintiffs to show that a viable alternative means is available to achieve those legitimate policy\nobjectives without discriminatory effects”) (quoting Oti Kaga, Inc. v. South Dakota Hous. Dev.\nAuth., 342 F.3d 871, 883 (8th Cir. 2003)); Lapid-Laurel, LLC v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 284 F.3d\n442, 467 (3rd Cir. 2002) (holding that once a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact, “then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory\nreason for the action and that no less discriminatory alternatives were available”); Langlois v.\nAbington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 49-51 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding that “practically all of the case\nlaw . . . treats impact as doing no more than creating a prima facie case, forcing the defendant to\nproffer a valid justification” and that further balancing of objectives by judges is inappropriate in\ndisparate-impact cases).\n        The Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have allowed FHA disparate-impact claims against\ngovernment entities but have not specified whether they incorporate the Arlington Heights II multi-\nfactor test into a burden-shifting framework. Gamble v. City of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 306 (9th\nCir. 1997); Jackson v. Okaloosa County, 21 F.3d 1531, 1543 (11th Cir. 1994) (citing United States\nv. Mitchell, 580 F.2d 789, 791 (5th Cir. 1978)); Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467, 483-84 (9th Cir. 1988),\ncert. denied, 493 U.S. 813 (1989).\n         2. FHA Disparate-Impact Claims Against Private Defendants\n        Plaintiffs have brought to the federal courts far fewer FHA disparate-impact claims against\nprivate entities than they have against public entities. The Fifth Circuit acknowledges the\navailability of a disparate-impact claim against a private defendant under the FHA, but has not\ndeveloped a framework for analyzing these claims. See Simms v. First Gibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d\n1546, 1555 (5th Cir.) (citing Hanson v. Veterans Admin., 800 F.2d 1381, 1386 (5th Cir. 1986)), cert.\ndenied, 519 U.S. 1041 (1996). The Fourth and Tenth Circuits, however, have developed    contrasting\nframeworks for evaluating FHA disparate-impact claims against private entities.5 The Fourth\nCircuit has applied a simple burden-shifting framework, holding that “when confronted with a\nshowing of discriminatory impact, defendants must prove a business-necessity sufficiently\ncompelling to justify the challenged practice.” Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., 736 F.2d 983, 988\n(4th Cir. 1984). In applying the business-necessity standard to disparate-impact claims against\nprivate defendants under the FHA, the Fourth Circuit followed the framework for parallel claims\nunder Title VII.\n\n\n\n\n         5\n           In United States v. Starrett City Associates, 840 F.2d 1096, 1101 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 946 (1988),\nthe Second Circuit refrained from deciding whether the defendant was a private or state actor and evaluated the case as\nif the defendant were a state actor.\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                            Page 17\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        The Tenth Circuit, however, created a different framework for evaluating FHA disparate-\nimpact claims against private defendants that departs from the business-necessity test. Instead, the\nTenth Circuit’s evaluation of disparate-impact claims against private defendants follows the\nframework that the Sixth Circuit uses to evaluate disparate-impact claims against public defendants.\nIn Mountain Side Mobile Estates Partnership v. Secretary of Housing & Urban Development, 56\nF.3d 1243, 1252 (10th Cir. 1995), the Tenth Circuit held that “a Title VIII prima facie case, once\nestablished . . . could alone suffice to prove a Title VIII violation unless the defendants justify the\ndiscriminatory effect which has resulted from their challenged actions.” The opinion reiterated that\n“unrebutted proof of discriminatory effect alone may justify a federal equitable response.” Id. To\ndetermine “whether a plaintiff’s prima facie case of disparate impact makes out a violation of Title\nVIII,” the Tenth Circuit assesses the three factors we set forth in Arthur: the strength of the showing\nof discriminatory effect; the defendant’s interest in taking the action; and whether the plaintiff seeks\nto compel the defendant to provide housing or alternatively to restrain the defendant from interfering\nwith the provision of housing. Id.\n       3. Sixth Circuit Treatment of Title VII Disparate-Impact Claims\n        In deciding what framework to apply in the instant case, the lead opinion does not look to\nother circuit courts’ treatment of FHA disparate-impact claims for guidance. Instead, the lead\nopinion integrates the three-factor analysis outlined in Arthur v. City of Toledo with the tripartite\nburden-shifting approach taken in a single Sixth Circuit Title VII disparate-impact case, Kovacevich\nv. Kent State Univ., 224 F.3d 806 (6th Cir. 2000). In particular, the lead opinion suggests that the\nfirst two factors from Arthur—the strength of the showing of disparate effects and the strength of\nthe defendant’s interest in the challenged practice—should be applied at the pretext stage of\nanalysis. I part company with the lead opinion on two grounds. First, I believe that the appropriate\nburden-shifting framework for a disparate-impact case is found not in Kovacevich but in an earlier\nSixth Circuit decision, Alexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ International Union of North America,\n177 F.3d 394 (6th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1154 (2000). Second, I believe that the lead\nopinion improperly applies the factors outlined in Arthur v. City of Toledo to an FHA disparate-\nimpact claim involving a private defendant.\n        The lead opinion is correct in looking to disparate-impact claims against private defendants\nunder Title VII to derive a framework for assessing such claims under the FHA. See Larkin, 89 F.3d\nat 289. The Sixth Circuit’s cases on disparate-impact claims under Title VII, however, conflict.\nKovacevich holds that a once a plaintiff has shown an adverse effect, the burden shifts to the\ndefendants to “articulate a legitimate business reason” for the challenged practice. 224 F.3d at 830.\nOnce the defendant has proffered such a reason, under Kovacevich “the burden shifts back to the\nplaintiff to show either that the [defendant’s] reason is a pretext for discrimination, or that there\nexists an alternative . . . practice that would achieve the same business ends with a less\ndiscriminatory impact.” Id. In contrast, Alexander holds that once a plaintiff has established a prima\nfacie case by showing adverse effect, “the burden shifts to the [defendant] to produce evidence that\nthe challenged practice is a business necessity.” 177 F.3d at 405-06. The difference between the\ntwo opinions lies in the fact that by requiring the plaintiff to prove pretext, Kovacevich both imports\nan intent-oriented principle from the disparate-treatment test into the disparate-impact analysis and\nplaces the ultimate burden of persuasion on the plaintiff rather than on the defendant.\n        Alexander offers the better standard for assessing disparate-impact claims against private\nentities. Moreover, Alexander is the earlier opinion, and “when a later decision of this court\nconflicts with one of our prior published decisions, we are still bound by the holding of the earlier\ncase.” Darrah v. City of Oak Park, 255 F.3d 301, 310 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Sowards v. Loudon\nCounty, 203 F.3d 426, 431 n.1 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 875 (2000), and Brentwood Acad.\nv. Tenn. Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 180 F.3d 758, 765 (6th Cir. 1999), rev’d on other grounds,\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                            Page 18\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n531 U.S. 288 (2001)). Pretext does not belong in a disparate-impact case as a matter of principle.\nAs a general matter, the plaintiff’s burden to prove pretext involves a showing that the defendant’s\nproffered justification for the challenged action masks actual discriminatory intent. Amini v. Oberlin\nColl., 440 F.3d 350, 359-60 (6th Cir. 2006). Because a plaintiff does not need to establish\ndiscriminatory intent in a disparate-impact case, proof of pretext in such a case would be an\nunnecessary and indeed absurd undertaking.\n        Third, the genealogy of the pretext prong in Kovacevich renders it suspect. Kovacevich\ndevised the requirement that a plaintiff prove pretext in a Title VII disparate-impact claim from an\nearlier Sixth Circuit Title VII disparate-impact case, Scales v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 925 F.2d 901\n(6th Cir. 1991). Scales, in turn, derived the pretext requirement from a Supreme Court opinion,\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977 (1988). The relevant portion of Watson,\nhowever, does not make a plaintiff’s proof of pretext a third stage of the burden-shifting in disparate-\nimpact cases. Instead, the opinion merely observes that the factors used to assess a plaintiff’s\nshowing of a less discriminatory alternative in disparate-impact cases are also ones that determine\nwhether “the challenged practice has operated as the functional equivalent of a pretext for\ndiscriminatory treatment.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 998 (emphasis added).\n        Moreover, the section of Watson cited by Scales for the proposition that a plaintiff retains\nthe burden of proof in a disparate-impact claim was issued by a plurality rather than a majority of\nthe Court and is therefore not binding. In this section of the Watson opinion joined only by three\nother Justices, Justice O’Connor wrote that the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion at each\nstage of the burden-shifting inquiry in a disparate-impact case. Id. at 997. Justice White’s majority\nopinion in Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 660, adopted the position taken by the O’Connor plurality in\nWatson. The Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 105, 105 Stat. 1074-1075 (1994) (codified as amended at\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)), however, rejected Wards Cove’s holding regarding the allocation of\nburdens of production and proof in disparate-impact cases. The interpretive memorandum for the\nAct, which Congress declared to be its exclusive legislative history, states: “The terms ‘business\nnecessity’ and ‘job-related’ are intended to reflect the concepts enunciated by the Supreme Court\nin Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), and in the other Supreme Court decisions prior\nto Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio.” 137 Cong. Rec. 28,680 (1991). We have clearly interpreted\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991 to mandate that once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of\ndisparate effects, “the burden of persuasion, not just the burden of production, shifts to the defendant\nto show a business necessity for the practices with disparate impact.” Phillips v. Cohen, 400 F.3d\n388, 398 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)).\n       4. Burdens of Proof and the Business-Necessity Defense\n       “Business necessity” is similarly the appropriate standard for private entities’ defense against\ndisparate-impact claims under the FHA. See 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n, 444 F.2d at 679\n(observing that Griggs is the “seminal case” on the issue of disparate-impact claims and that, in the\nemployment context, Griggs establishes “business necessity” as the sole defense to a showing of\ndisparate effects). The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) takes the position\nthat implementing regulations promulgated in 1989 established a business-necessity defense to\ndisparate-impact claims. The Secretary of HUD’s Regulation of the Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, 60 Fed. Reg. at\n61,866-61,868 (Dec. 1, 1995) (codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 81).\n        “Business necessity” holds defendants to a higher standard than the more lenient “business\njustifications” test set forth in Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 659, which defined “the dispositive issue [to\nbe] whether a challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate [business] goals of the\n[defendant].” Between 1989 and 1991, some courts applied the Wards Cove standard to FHA cases.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                        Page 19\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nCases decided after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, however, implement the “business\nnecessity” test in recognition that the Act overruled the weakened disparate-impact standards set\nforth in Wards Cove. Stanton, The Fair Housing Act and Insurance, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. at 186-87.\nWhile a consensus exists that business necessity is the appropriate test, there remains some\ndisagreement as to the content of that standard. The Fourth Circuit, HUD, and district courts within\nthe Ninth Circuit define business necessity to mean a “compelling” business interest; in their\nallocation of  the burdens of proof, the Second and Third Circuit’s apply a “substantive equivalent”\nof this test.6 Id. at 187. I agree that “when confronted with a showing of discriminatory impact,\ndefendants must prove a business necessity sufficiently compelling to justify the challenged\npractice.” See Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988. Requiring the defendant to prove anything less would\ncontravene the plain meaning of the word “necessity,” defined as “an imperative requirement or\nneed for something.” Random House Dictionary 1284 (Stuart Berg Flexner, ed., 2d ed. 1993).\nMoreover, requiring the defendant to offer a mere business justification would confuse defendants’\nburden of proving business-necessity in disparate-impact cases with defendants’ burden of\nproducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action in disparate-treatment\ncases. Compare Macy, 484 F.3d at 364 (discussing the shifting burdens in disparate-treatment\ncases), with Alexander, 177 F.3d at 405-06 (discussing the shifting burdens in disparate-impact\ncases).\n        In articulating the framework for our evaluation of FHA disparate-impact claims against\nprivate defendants, I believe that we should rely on our earlier precedent Alexander, rather than\nKovacevich, and seek guidance as well from the Fourth Circuit decision in Betsey v. Turtle Creek.\nThus, we should first require that plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of disparate effects. Second,\nupon the showing of a prima facie case, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendants, who\nmust prove that the challenged housing practice constitutes a business necessity and that no less\ndiscriminatory alternatives are available. In the Title VII context, plaintiffs bear the burden of\nproving that a less discriminatory alternative exists. Isabel v. City of Memphis, 404 F.3d 404, 411\n(6th Cir. 2005) (citing Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 432 (1975)). The\nconsensus across the circuits, however, is that in the housing context defendants have the burden of\nproving the absence of a less discriminatory alternative. See Lapid Laurel, LLC, 284 F.3d at 467\n(discussing the defendant’s burden of proof regarding the absence of less discriminatory\nalternatives); Langlois, 207 F.3d at 50 (same); Huntington Branch, NAACP, 844 F.2d at 935 (same);\nDews, 109 F. Supp. 2d at 531-32, 565 (same); see also Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988 (holding that once\nplaintiffs have established a prima facie case, defendants must prove business necessity).\n        Our analysis should stop with an evaluation of whether a private defendant has successfully\nrebutted the plaintiff’s showing of disparate effects by proving “business necessity” and the\nunavailability of a less discriminatory alternative. Considerations of doctrine and policy preclude\nthis court’s use of the Arthur factors for a government defendant to evaluate an FHA disparate-\nimpact claim against a private defendant. First, the lead opinion applies factors from a case\nconcerning a public defendant to cases against private defendants, without explaining why they are\ntransferable. That the lead opinion needed to excise the third Arthur factor from its analysis only\nhighlights the unsuitability of the framework in the context of a case against a private defendant.\nI believe that the Tenth Circuit incorrectly integrated Arthur’s multi-factor test into the “business\nnecessity” framework applicable to private defendants in disparate-impact suits; it did so without\neven acknowledging that the case concerned a private defendant while Arthur concerned a public\n\n         6\n           The Tenth Circuit has rejected an attempt by HUD to define business necessity as a “compelling need or\nnecessity.” Mountain Side, 56 F.3d at 1254. But in making this determination, the Tenth Circuit closely paraphrased\nlanguage from Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion in Watson. Because I believe that relying on the Watson plurality\nis inappropriate following the Civil Rights Act of 1991, I also refrain from following the standard for business necessity\nset forth in Mountain Side.\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                            Page 20\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\ndefendant. See Mountain Side, 56 F.3d at 1252. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit has explicitly stated\nthat the multi-factor analysis derived from Arlington Heights II and its progeny should not apply in\ndisparate-impact claims against private defendants. Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988 n.5.\n        Second, by applying the Arthur factors, the lead opinion converts an inquiry into the business\njustification for a practice bearing a disparate impact on a protected class into a balancing test. The\nlead opinion suggests that this court should weigh the disparate effects of the challenged action\nagainst the strength of the defendant’s interest in taking the challenged action. Courts appropriately\ncountenance governments’ weighing of competing public considerations of deep importance, and\nthey may engage in such balancing acts themselves. See, e.g., Arthur, 782 F.2d at 575 (holding that\nbecause of “the strong policy considerations underlying referendums . . . absent highly unusual\ncircumstances, the discriminatory effect of a referendum cannot establish a violation of the Fair\nHousing Act”). In limited instances, Congress has reduced the burden of fair housing laws on\ngovernment entities, with respect to those entities’ pursuit of important public interests, but\nCongress did not do the same for private landlords. See Pfaff v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev.,\n88 F.3d 739, 746 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that “Congress chose to give special deference to\ngovernment-imposed occupancy limits only . . . [and] made no comparable provision for private\noccupancy policies”). Even if weighing relative strengths of interests were appropriate, we must\nfollow the longstanding rule that the weighing of litigants’ competing interests belongs at trial and\nnot at the summary judgment stage. Crestview Parke Care Ctr. v. Thompson, 373 F.3d 743, 755\n(6th Cir. 2004) (“In evaluating whether summary judgment is proper, we do not weigh the evidence,\nbut rather view the evidence in the light most favorable to [the non-moving party] to divine the\nexistence of a genuine dispute of material fact.”)\n         Third, the lead opinion’s framework mistakenly places the ultimate burden of persuasion on\nthe plaintiff. The lead opinion states that the final step in the burden-shifting analysis involves\nevaluating the plaintiff’s showing by considering “the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of\ndiscriminatory effect against the strength of the defendant’s interest in taking the challenged action.”\nLead Op. at 10. Under the business-necessity test, however, the landlord will successfully defend\nagainst a showing of disparate effects only if he or she proves that the challenged action constitutes\na business necessity. If the landlord fails to carry this burden of proof, then he or she should lose\nonce the plaintiff has established a statistically significant showing of disparate effects regardless\nof its strength. Conversely, if the defendant does indeed prove business necessity, he or she should\nnot be liable under a disparate-impact theory of the FHA no matter how strong the showing of\ndisparate effects.\n        In conclusion, we are bound by the factors set forth in Arthur when evaluating FHA\ndisparate-impact claims against government defendants. But the framework outlined in Arthur is\nnot well suited to the evaluation of FHA disparate-impact claims against private defendants. The\nburden-shifting framework for FHA disparate-impact claims against private defendants is\nstraightforward: first, the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that a challenged\nhousing practice or policy has caused a statistically significant disparate effect on a protected group;\nsecond, the housing owner can assert the affirmative defense that the challenged action constitutes\na business necessity and that there are no less discriminatory alternatives.\nC. Withdrawal from the Section 8 Program and Disparate Impact\n       I concur in the lead opinion’s holding that a landlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8\nprogram, when it has a disparate impact on members of a protected class, may violate the FHA.\nCourts should give the “broad and inclusive” language of the FHA a “generous construction” to\neffectuate its remedial purpose. Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. 409 U.S. 205, 209, 212 (1972).\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                            Page 21\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        No compelling jurisprudential or policy reasons exist to make a categorical exception to our\nrecognition of disparate-impact claims under the FHA for the withdrawal by landlords from the\nSection 8 program. Graoch argues that the voluntary nature of the Section 8 program should counsel\nagainst allowing a plaintiff to bring a disparate-impact claim based on a landlord’s decision to\nwithdraw. Appellee Br. at 11-14. Graoch derives this analysis from the Seventh Circuit opinion in\nKnapp v. Eagle Property Management Corp., 54 F.3d 1272 (7th Cir. 1995), which held that the\nrefusal by a landlord who participated in the Section 8 program to accept a new Section 8 tenant\ncould not give rise to liability under a disparate-impact analysis of the FHA. Id. at 1280. The\nSeventh Circuit found no principled basis upon which to distinguish between a landlord’s decision\nnot to participate in the Section 8 program and the decision of a participating housing owner not to\naccept a new Section 8 tenant. Id. Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit held that because\nnonparticipation is not actionable, neither can a landlord’s withdrawal from the program give rise\nto a disparate-impact claim. Id. (“The actions of both non-participating and participating owners\nhave the same impact on minorities and to hold only the latter liable for racial discrimination for that\nconduct would deter them from joining or remaining involved in the program.”)\n        The voluntary nature of the Section 8 program does caution us to consider carefully whether\na landlord’s decision to withdraw from the program may give rise to liability under the FHA.\nCongress’s revision of the FHA has only reinforced that body’s intent to make Section 8 a voluntary\nprogram. Before 1996, some courts interpreted 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(d)(1)(B), which provided “that\nthe owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and\nconditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good\ncause” to prescribe an “endless lease.” Some courts read this provision to mean that the owner could\nnot refuse to renew a lease at the conclusion of the lease period, except for the specified reasons.\n30 Eastchester LLC v. Healy, Index SP-2002-77, 2002 WL 553709, at *3 (N.Y. City Ct. 2002)\n(unpublished opinion) (citing Salute v. Stratford Greens Garden Apartments, 136 F.3d 293, 300 n.5\n(2d Cir. 1998); Tann Realty Co. v. Thompson, 112 Misc.2d 392, 446 N.Y.S.2d 959 (Civ. Ct., Kings\nCo. 1981)). In 1996, however, Congress amended this section of the FHA as part of the Omnibus\nConsolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-134, § 203, 110 Stat.\n1321, at *1321-281 (1996), by inserting “during the term of the lease” into both clause (ii) and\nclause (iii) of the section. “The effect of the statutory change was to eliminate the ‘endless lease’\ninterpretation of such provision and clarify that a landlord could terminate a Section 8 tenant’s lease\nand, a fortiori, its participation in the Section 8 program with respect to that tenant, when the term\nof the tenant’s lease expires.” 30 Eastchester, 2002 WL 553709, at *4.\n        The same Omnibus Budget Act also repealed the “take one, take all” provision of the United\nStates Housing Act of 1937. Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act § 203.\nThat provision, previously codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(t)(1)(A) was entitled “Nondiscrimination\nAgainst Certificate Holders and Voucher Holders” and provided that no owner who had entered into\na contract for housing assistance payments under the section “shall refuse to lease any available\ndwelling unit in any multifamily housing project of such owner to a holder of a voucher.” Glover\nv. Crestwood Lake Section 1 Holding Corps., 746 F. Supp. 301, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).\n        Ultimately, however, I disagree with the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning that the voluntary\ncharacter of the Section 8 program precludes liability for withdrawal from the program under a\ndisparate-impact theory of the FHA. The repeal of the “endless lease” and “take one, take all”\nprovisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1437f evinced Congress’ intention that a landlord’s decision to participate\nin the Section 8 program should not require him or her to accept any particular Section 8 tenant or\nto renew endlessly the lease of a given tenant. The statutory repeals, however, did not address the\nissue of a complete withdrawal from the program and a decision not to accept any new Section 8\ntenants. The FHA imposes a non-discrimination mandate on actors engaging in many different types\nof voluntary actions. See, e.g., Betsey, 736 F.2d at 986-87 (allowing a disparate-impact claim to\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                       Page 22\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nproceed where a private landlord issued eviction notices to families with children in an effort to\ninstitute an all-adult rental policy). Landlords who choose not to accept any Section 8 vouchers may\ndo so for all kinds of legitimate or biased reasons that remain behind the veil of nonparticipation,\nfar removed from legal scrutiny. Once a landlord decides to enroll in the Section 8 program,\nhowever, he or she necessarily accepts a new set of responsibilities toward tenants under the FHA.\nThese include duties both to refrain from intentional discrimination on the basis of a protected\ncharacteristic and, in the case of a business practice that has a disparate impact on a protected class,\nto implement when possible an alternative business practice with less discriminatory effects. See\nAlexander, 177 F.3d at 405-06. I agree with the lead opinion that the Sixth Circuit should decline\nto follow the Seventh Circuit and should instead allow plaintiffs to use evidence of disparate impact\nto show that a landlord violated the FHA by withdrawing from the Section 8 program.\n          In addition to Knapp, Graoch relies on the Second Circuit’s decision in Salute v. Stratford\nGreens Garden Apartments, 136 F.3d 293 (2d Cir. 1998), to argue against the propriety of allowing\na disparate-impact claim for withdrawal from the Section 8 program. Appellee Br. at 11-12. In\nSalute, however, the majority based its opinion on the fact that the defendant landlord had never\naccepted tenants who, at the time of application, participated in the Section 8 program. Id. at 302\n(“[N]on-participation constitutes a legitimate reason for their refusal to accept section 8 tenants and\n. . . we therefore cannot hold them liable for . . . discrimination under the disparate impact theory.”)\n(quoting Knapp, 54 F.3d at 1280) (alterations in the original). Therefore, Salute is not applicable\nin the instant case because of the distinction between        nonparticipation, at issue in Salute, and\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program, at issue here.7\n         Graoch further suggests that allowing disparate-impact claims based on a landlord’s\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program will deter landlords from entering the program. Appellee\nBr. at 13 (“If a landlord is held to a perpetual lease—and all of the administrative burdens which\nSection 8 compliance entails—once it accepts a Section 8 tenant, many landlords may never agree\nto enter into the program at all, thereby decreasing the available private housing stock for low\nincome tenants.”) (quoting 30 Eastchester LLC, 2002 WL 553709, at *4). The Eastchester case\nupon which Graoch relies, however, did not involve a disparate-impact claim under the FHA.\nInstead, a tenant-plaintiff claimed that her landlord’s allegedly illegal withdrawal from the Section\n8 program, at the termination of her lease, constituted a defense to her own nonpayment of rent. Id.\nat *2. Allowing disparate-impact claims for withdrawal does not yoke landlords to a “perpetual\nlease.” A plaintiff’s showing that a withdrawal from the Section 8 program has a disparate effect\non a protected class merely establishes a plaintiff’s prima facie case and does not automatically\nresult in liability. Such claims require only that a landlord show business necessity. See Green v.\nSunpointe Assocs., Ltd., No. C96-1542C, 1997 WL 1526484, at *4 (W.D. Wash. 1997).\n        Graoch argues that a landlord would incur significant expense defending itself against a\ndisparate-impact claim at the summary-judgment stage. Appellee Br. at 16. But the Supreme Court\nhas not shied away from allowing innovative disparate-impact claims even though newly-recognized\ncauses of action may potentially impose costs on businesses. See, e.g., Smith v. City of Jackson, 544\nU.S. 228, 232 (2005) (holding that a disparate-impact theory is cognizable under the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act). Landlords have a considerable financial incentive to accept\nSection 8 tenants because the federal government’s subsidy of a portion of the market-based rent\nexpands the pool of available tenants. Clark, 6 J. AFFORD. HOUS. & CMTY. DEV. L. at 187. This\n\n         7\n          In his dissent to the majority opinion in Salute, Judge Calabresi argued that the defendant landlord’s\nacceptance of Section 8 vouchers from pre-existing tenants, even though he refused new Section 8 tenants, made the\nlandlord a partial participant in the program rather than a nonparticipant. 136 F.3d at 312 (Calabresi, J., dissenting).\nNevertheless, the majority viewed the landlord as a nonparticipant and based the court’s decision on the view that\nnonparticipation does not incur liability.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                        Page 23\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\neconomic reality makes it less likely that the potential of disparate-impact claims upon withdrawal\nfrom Section 8 will deter landlords from entering the program.\n                             III. MHRC’S DISPARATE-IMPACT CLAIM\nA. Prima Facie Case\n        Because the district court ruled as a matter of law that a landlord’s withdrawal from the\nSection 8 program cannot alone constitute a violation of the FHA, it did not discuss the statistical\nevidence that MHRC would need to produce to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact.\nGraoch appears to have admitted, however, “that the uncontested statistical evidence would in\ntheory support a ‘disparate impact’ claim against Graoch if . . . Graoch’s mere withdrawal from the\nvoluntary Section 8 program could subject it to such a claim . . . and Graoch’s business necessity\ndefense were to be rejected by the Court . . . .” R. 28, Graoch’s Response to MHRC’s Cross-Motion\nfor Summary Judgment, p. 2 n. 2. Because all members of this panel are in agreement that a\nlandlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program can give rise to a disparate-impact claim,\nGraoch’s admission8obligates this court to hold that MHRC has established a prima facie showing\nof disparate effects. As a result of Graoch’s concession in the district court, we need not engage\nin any further assessment of MHRC’s statistical evidence. In the absence of disagreement and\nbriefing on this issue, I think it is unwise to set forth any framework for evaluating the statistical\nevidence necessary to prove disparate effects.\nB. Business Necessity\n        Because Graoch has conceded that its withdrawal from the Section 8 program would have\na disparate effect on African-Americans, to avoid liability under a disparate-impact theory of the\nFHA Graoch needs to prove that the withdrawal amounted to a business necessity and that no less\ndiscriminatory alternatives were available. Graoch stated that it decided to withdraw from the\nSection 8 program because participation had required that Graoch agree to a Housing Assistance\nPayments Contract “which imposed terms and conditions more burdensome than those contained\nin Autumn Run’s standard Lease.” J.A. at 70 (Hamasaki Aff.) In addition, Graoch stated that the\nHousing Authority of Jefferson County held the company “to an impossible standard” in enforcing\nrequirements for the quality of the housing provided. Id. Specifically, according to Graoch the\nHousing Authority abated rental payments “for conditions which Graoch was either not made aware\nof prior to inspection, or which it attempted to fix only to be cited upon re-inspection for not making\nits repairs to the arbitrary satisfaction of the inspector.” Id. Neither party devoted attention on\nappeal to arguing whether a business necessity existed to justify Graoch’s withdrawal from the\nSection 8 program. Insufficient evidence exists for us to rule as a matter of law regarding whether\nbusiness necessity justified Graoch’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program. Under these\ncircumstances, we should remand to the district court for further development of the business\nnecessity factor.\n       Upon remand, the district court should give the parties an opportunity to brief the issue of\nbusiness necessity and to present relevant evidence. To survive any motion that Graoch might make\nfor summary judgment, MHRC would need to create a genuine issue of material fact that Graoch’s\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program did not constitute a business necessity. MHRC would be\n\n         8\n           Graoch’s concession that the statistical evidence would support a disparate-impact claim, if a withdrawal from\nthe Section 8 program could give rise to liability under the FHA and if we rejected Graoch’s business-necessity defense,\nimplicitly concedes that the evidence establishes a prima facie showing of disparate effects. Accordingly, although we\ndo not decide the issue of business necessity today, as I explain below, we must nevertheless assume that Graoch has\nconceded that its withdrawal from the Section 8 program had a disparate effect on African-Americans.\n\fNo. 06-5561          Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                         Page 24\n                     County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nable to discharge this burden by showing “that there is an absence of evidence to support [Graoch’s]\ncase.” Wright v. Murray Guard, Inc., 455 F.3d 702, 706 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Celotex Corp., 477\nU.S. at 322-23). Conversely, to survive a motion for summary judgment made by MHRC, Graoch\nwould need to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the withdrawal constituted a business\nnecessity.\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n        For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the lead opinion’s conclusion that a landlord’s\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program may give rise to liability under the disparate-impact theory\nof the FHA. I believe that the appropriate action for this court to take is to REVERSE the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to Graoch, VACATE the denial of summary judgment to\nMHRC, and REMAND the case for further proceedings.\n\f",

The Section 8 voucher program is a voluntary program through which\nthe federal government provides rent subsidies to eligible low-income families who rent from\nparticipating landlords. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a). The Fair Housing Act, also known as Title VIII,\nbars discrimination “against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a\ndwelling . . . because of race . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b). In this case, Graoch, the owner of Autumn\nRun Apartments in Louisville, seeks a declaratory judgment that it did not violate the FHA by\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 06-5561              Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                     Page 2\n                         County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nwithdrawing from the Section 8 program. Its claim presents two questions regarding the interplay\nbetween Section 8 and the FHA. First, can a landlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program ever\nviolate the FHA solely because it has a disparate impact on members of a protected class? Second,\nif so, what are the standards for measuring disparate impact?\n         The district court answered the first question in the negative and therefore granted summary\njudgment in favor of Graoch without reaching the second question. We reach the same final result,\nbut in a different way. Disagreeing with the position taken by the Second and Seventh Circuits, we\nhold that a plaintiff can, in principle, rely on evidence of some instances of disparate impact to show\nthat a landlord violated the Fair Housing Act by withdrawing from Section 8. We also hold,\nhowever, that in this case the Metro Human Relations Commission did not even allege facts making\nthe statistical comparison necessary to state a prima facie case of disparate-impact discrimination.\nConsequently, we affirm.\n                                                        I\n        The Housing Authority of Jefferson County (“HAJC”) coordinates the local disbursement\nof Section 8 funds in the Louisville area. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(b)(1) (“The Secretary is authorized\nto enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such\nagencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units\nin accordance with this section.”). In March 2003, Graoch notified the HAJC that it intended to\nwithdraw from the Section 8 voucher program, stating that it would honor existing leases by Section\n8 tenants but would not renew those leases or sign any new Section 8 leases.\n         The Kentucky Fair Housing Council (“FHC”) and three Autumn Run tenants receiving\nSection 8 assistance – Joyce McNealy, Tina Gray, and Angela Thornton – filed a complaint with the\nMetro Human Relations Commission. The Commission found probable cause to believe that\nGraoch’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program constituted unlawful racial discrimination because\nit had a disparate impact on blacks. On Graoch’s motion, it then stayed administrative proceedings\nto give Graoch the1opportunity to seek declaratory relief in federal court. Graoch responded by\ninitiating this case.\n        The parties agreed to a series of factual stipulations. Eighteen families receiving Section 8\nassistance lived at Autumn Run when Graoch announced that it was withdrawing from the Section\n8 program. Seventeen of those families were black. As of 2003, 6,270 of the 8,849 Jefferson\nCounty residents receiving Section 8 vouchers were black. Finally, as of the 2000 census, 18.9%\nof Jefferson County residents were black and 24% were members of black households. Absent from\nthe joint stipulations, however, was any information regarding the races of the non-Section 8 tenants\nat Autumn Run. Indeed, the only reference contained in the record to the racial makeup of Autumn\nRun as a whole, or of its non-Section 8 tenants, is a remark by Graoch’s counsel, quoted by the\nCommission in its probable cause finding: “the tenants at Respondent project Autumn Run\nApartments were 90% minority and 10% white.”\n       Graoch stated that it chose to withdraw from the Section 8 program because of disputes with\nthe HAJC regarding rent payments made on behalf of Section 8 tenants. Graoch claimed that the\nHAJC held Graoch “to an impossible standard” in enforcing the quality standards for Section 8,\n“abating rent for conditions which Graoch was either not made aware of prior to inspection, or\nwhich it attempted to fix only to be cited upon re-inspection for not making its repairs to the\n\n\n        1\n          Graoch named only the Commission as a defendant; the FHC moved to intervene as of right, but the district\ncourt denied that motion.\n\fNo. 06-5561                Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                              Page 3\n                           County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\narbitrary satisfaction of the inspector.” See 24 C.F.R. § 982.401 (stating “the housing quality\nstandards . . . for housing assisted” through the Section 8 program).\n        Based on this record, Graoch moved for summary judgment. First, it argued that the\nCommission failed to state a prima facie case that Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 violated the\nFHA because it had a disparate impact on blacks. Second, it argued that its withdrawal from Section\n8 did not violate the FHA even if the Commission did state a prima facie case because the decision\nto withdraw resulted from a “business necessity.” The district court granted summary judgment for\nGraoch, holding that a party offering only evidence that a landlord’s withdrawal from the Section\n8 program had a disparate impact on members of a protected class cannot establish a prima facie\ncase that the landlord violated the FHA.\n         The Commission appealed. We review the district court’s decision de novo. See Trustees\nof the Mich. Laborers’ Health Care Fund v. Gibbons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768343\"><a href=\"/opinion/768343/trustees-of-the-michigan-laborers-health-care-fund-michigan-laborers/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 590 (6th Cir. 2000).

In this case, however, both parties agree that we should\nremand the case to the district court if it is necessary to consider the adequacy of Graoch’s business\njustification for its withdrawal from Section 8. As a result, we consider only whether the\nCommission has stated a prima facie case.\n                                                              II\n        Before delving into the specific implications of withdrawal from Section 8 and the even-\nmore-specific details of this case, we must address as a general matter the law governing disparate-\nimpact claims under the FHA. We previously have held that a plaintiff     can establish a violation of\nthe FHA by showing either disparate treatment or disparate impact.2 Larkin v. Mich. Dep’t of Soc.\nServs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721510\"><a href=\"/opinion/721510/geraldine-larkin-michigan-protection-and-advocacy-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 289 (6th Cir. 1996). We have stated that, to show disparate impact, a plaintiff\nmust demonstrate that a facially neutral policy or practice has the effect of discriminating against\na protected class of which the plaintiff is a member.

We have not\ndecided, however, what framework we should use to determine whether a plaintiff has done enough\nto survive summary judgment on a disparate-impact claim against a private defendant under the\nFHA.\n        We find it useful to compare the frameworks that we have applied to three similar kinds of\nclaims: disparate-treatment claims against private defendants under the FHA, disparate-impact\nclaims against private defendants under Title VII, and disparate-impact claims against governmental\ndefendants under the FHA. In disparate-treatment cases under the FHA, we apply “the three-part\nburden of proof test established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Maki v.\n\n\n         2\n           Although Graoch is the plaintiff in this declaratory judgment action, when discussing a generic claim we use\n“plaintiff” to refer to the party alleging a violation of the FHA and “defendant” to refer to the party that allegedly violated\nthe FHA.\n\fNo. 06-5561            Graoch Associates #33 v.

Third,\nif the defendant does proffer such a basis, the plaintiff must establish that the articulated reason is\npretextual. Ibid. The burden of persuasion always remains with the plaintiff.\n       We imported this framework from our disparate-treatment cases under Title VII. See Larkin,\n89 F.3d at 289; compare Daniels v.

We agreed with the reasoning used by\nthe Second Circuit, which found “persuasive” the “parallel between Title VII and Title VIII”:\n        The two statutes are part of a coordinated scheme of federal civil rights laws enacted\n        to end discrimination; the Supreme Court has held that both statutes must be\n        construed expansively to implement that goal.

In sum, we concluded that we generally should evaluate claims under the FHA by\nanalogizing them to comparable claims under Title VII. Larkin, 89 F.3d at 289.\n         In disparate-impact cases under Title VII, we apply a different version of the McDonnell\nDouglas burden-shifting framework than in disparate-treatment cases. We follow the same three\nsteps: the plaintiff states a prima facie case; the defendant responds; the plaintiff rebuts the response.\nSee Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770180\"><a href=\"/opinion/770180/dorothy-kovacevich-v-kent-state-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (6th Cir. 2000). To state a prima facie case,\nhowever, a Title VII plaintiff basing his claim on disparate impact must “identify[] and challeng[e]\na specific employment practice, and then show an adverse effect by offering statistical evidence of\na kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse effect in\nquestion.” Ibid. To respond, the defendant must articulate a “legitimate business reason” for the\nchallenged decision, rather than simply a non-discriminatory basis. Ibid. Finally, to rebut the\ndefendant’s response, the plaintiff can show “either that the employer's reason is a pretext for\ndiscrimination, or that there exists an alternative employment practice that would achieve the same\nbusiness ends with a less discriminatory impact.” Ibid. Relying on the analogy between Title VII\nand the FHA, several other circuits have applied essentially this approach to disparate-impact claims\nunder the FHA. Hack v.

Treating the Arthur standard as an alternative would conflict with our\nstatement in Larkin that similar claims under Title VII and the FHA generally should receive similar\ntreatment. See Larkin, 89 F.3d at 289. And when applied to private defendants, the Arthur standard\nnicely captures the inquiry that we must perform at the third step in the burden-shifting framework.\nTo determine whether a defendant’s proffered business reason is a pretext for discrimination, or\nwhether an alternative practice exists that would achieve the same business ends with a less\ndiscriminatory impact, we must consider the strength of the plaintiff’s statistical evidence of\ndisparate impact and the strength of the defendant’s interest in maintaining the challenged practice.\nThose are the first two Arthur factors. The third Arthur factor, distinguishing defendants who wish\nonly not to provide housing themselves from those who wish to stop others from providing housing,\nis not relevant to claims against private defendants, who lack the authority to control third-party\nbehavior (though it is relevant when applied to governmental defendants, who through zoning\nregulations or land-use permit requirements might have the authority to control the housing\ndevelopment and allocation decisions of third parties). Consequently, we think that our approaches\nto disparate-impact claims under Title VII and disparate-impact claims against governmental\ndefendants under the FHA are compatible, not inconsistent.\n        Borrowing from our Title VII cases, then, we hold that disparate-impact claims against\nprivate defendants under the FHA should be analyzed using a form of the McDonnell Douglas\nburden-shifting framework:\n        - First, a plaintiff must make a prima facie case of discrimination by “identifying and\nchallenging a specific [housing] practice, and then show[ing] an adverse effect by offering statistical\nevidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the adverse\neffect in question,” Kovacevich, 224 F.3d at 830 (disparate impact claim under Title VII);\n\n         3\n          We followed the same procedure in another case involving a disparate-impact claim against a governmental\ndefendant under the FHA.

The same analysis justifies the existence of disparate-impact liability under the\nFHA. “What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers\nto [access to housing] when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or\nother impermissible classification.” Ibid. (discussing Title VII).\n        Of course, not every housing practice that has a disparate impact is illegal. We use the\nburden-shifting framework described above – and especially the final inquiry considering the\nstrength of the plaintiff’s statistical evidence and the strength of the defendant’s business reason –\nto distinguish the artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers proscribed by the FHA from valid\npolicies and practices crafted to advance legitimate interests. Our analysis is derived from our\ninterpretation of the statute, and we cannot create categorical exemptions from it without a statutory\nbasis.\n       In Knapp and Salute, our sister circuits seem to have taken a more circumscribed view of\ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA.

While reasonable\nminds could disagree as to whether the FHA contemplates disparate impact liability, we have\nconcluded that it does. See Larkin, 89 F.3d at 289; Arthur, 782 F.2d at 575. Nothing in the text of\nthe FHA instructs us to create practice-specific exceptions. Absent such instruction, we lack the\nauthority to evaluate the pros and cons of allowing disparate-impact claims challenging a particular\nhousing practice and to prohibit claims that we believe to be unwise as a matter of social policy.\nAccord Salute, 136 F.3d at 312 & n.23 (Calabresi, J., dissenting) (expressing “doubt whether the\nSeventh Circuit’s approach” in Knapp is “consistent with” the general use of the burden-shifting\nframework to analyze disparate-impact claims under the FHA).\n         The passage from Knapp also could mean something more limited: that if no disparate-\nimpact challenge to a particular practice ever could succeed under the burden-shifting framework,\nthen a court categorically may bar all disparate-impact challenges to that practice. This reading is\nconsistent with our statement that “at least under some circumstances a violation of [the Fair\nHousing Act] can be established by a showing of discriminatory effect without a showing of\ndiscriminatory intent.” Arthur, 782 F.2d at 574 (quoting Arlington Heights II, 558 F.2d at 1290)\n(alteration in original). It is also consistent with the cases relied on by the Seventh Circuit in Knapp.\nIn NAACP v. American Family Mutual Insurance Co., for example, the court held that insurers never\ncan face disparate-impact liability for “charging higher rates or declining to write insurance for\npeople who live in particular areas,” reasoning that “[i]nsurance works best when the risks in the\npool have similar characteristics.” 978 F.2d at 290. Conducting an inquiry analogous to our inquiry\nat the third step in the burden-shifting framework, it concluded that the strength of the insurer’s\ninterest in declining to insure in certain areas outweighed the strength of any possible disparate\nimpact the policy could have. See id. at 290-91.\n        Likewise, in Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, the court concluded that claims of “racial\nsteering” were not subject to disparate-impact analysis because racial steering necessarily involves\ndisparate treatment, not a facially neutral policy that has a discriminatory effect. 895 F.2d at 1533.\nWe agree that categorical bars are justified when they result from a generalized application of the\nburden-shifting framework. We see no reason to require courts to engage in the Sisyphean task of\nworking through the burden-shifting framework in each individual case when the plaintiff has no\nchance of success (for example, when a plaintiff brings a disparate-impact challenge to a landlord’s\ndecision to charge rent).\n        We do not believe, however, that it is impossible for a disparate-impact challenge to a\nlandlord’s withdrawal from Section 8 to succeed under the burden-shifting framework. Consider\nthe strongest possible disparate-impact challenge to a landlord’s withdrawal from Section 8: All of\nthe non-Section 8 tenants at a housing complex are white. The landlord decides to participate in the\nSection 8 voucher program. A number of Section 8 participants move in, including the plaintiff.\nAll are black. The landlord quickly decides to withdraw from Section 8 and refuses to renew the\nleases of existing Section 8 tenants. He explains his decision by saying simply that he no longer\nwished to participate in the program, without claiming that his participation cost him money, time,\nbusiness opportunities, or any other benefit.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                         Page 8\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        At the first stage of the burden-shifting framework, the hypothetical plaintiff could state a\nprima facie case: she could identify a challenged practice (the landlord’s withdrawal from Section\n8) and present strong statistical evidence that the practice had a disparate impact on blacks. At the\nsecond stage of the burden-shifting framework, the landlord could offer a business reason for his\ndecision: he wanted out of the Section 8 program. At the third stage, then, the plaintiff would have\nto show either that the landlord’s explanation was a pretext for discrimination or that an alternate\npractice would serve the same business ends with less discriminatory effect. To evaluate the\nplaintiff’s showing, we would consider the strength of her evidence of disparate impact and the\nstrength of the business interests stated by the landlord. We have little doubt that a reasonable fact-\nfinder presented with this hypothetical set of facts could conclude that the landlord’s withdrawal\nfrom Section 8 was pretextual, and therefore that the plaintiff’s claim should survive summary\njudgment under the burden-shifting framework.\n        Graoch makes two arguments that could undermine this conclusion. First, it contends that\nbecause Section 8 is a voluntary program we should place exceptional weight on a landlord’s\ninterest in being able to withdraw without the threat of litigation. Yet to say that Section 8\nparticipation is “voluntary” is only to say that a landlord does not break the law by declining to\nparticipate.5 As such, Graoch’s claim proves too much: almost every action that could create\ndisparate-impact liability under the FHA is voluntary. Cf. Buckeye, 263 F.3d at 631-32 (vacated)\n(approving building site plans); Maki, 88 F.3d at 64 (varying of rent based on number of occupants).\nThe mere fact that a landlord often can withdraw from Section 8 without violating the terms of\nSection 8 or the FHA does not mean that withdrawal from Section 8 never can constitute a violation\nof the FHA.\n        Second, Graoch claims that there is no coherent way to permit disparate-impact challenges\nto a landlord’s withdrawal from Section 8 without also permitting such challenges to a landlord’s\nnon-participation in Section 8. It reasons that “[t]he actions of both non-participating and\nparticipating owners have the same impact on minorities” and therefore that “no principled way\nexists” to distinguish the two groups. Knapp, 54 F.3d at 1280. While we agree that a landlord\nshould never face disparate-impact liability for non-participation in Section 8, we do not think that\nwithdrawal and non-participation are functionally identical. Withdrawal affects an identifiable\ngroup: tenants receiving Section 8 assistance. Non-participation could be said to have a theoretical\nimpact on members of a protected class, but the size and composition of the affected group is\nindeterminate.\n        Moreover, the FHA does not impose liability based solely on the existence of a disparate\nimpact. It imposes liability only when a plaintiff can meet the ultimate burden of persuasion by\nshowing either that the landlord’s business reason for a practice is a pretext for discrimination or that\nan alternative practice would serve the same business goal with less discriminatory effect. That\nburden is harder to meet in a challenge to non-participation than in a challenge to withdrawal. A\nnon-participating landlord presumptively can appeal to his interests in not wanting to spend time\nlearning about the program and not wanting to become entangled in government bureaucracy, while\na withdrawing landlord who fails to cite any reason why participation in Section 8 hurt his business\ncannot do so. And an unexplained withdrawal from Section 8, combined with strong evidence of\n\n         5\n           Nothing in the language of Section 8 indicates that, in making the program voluntary, Congress intended to\ndo more than give landlords the option not to participate. Although Congress created the Section 8 program six years\nafter passing the FHA, see Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 653\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437-37f), it did not include language indicating that Section 8 landlords should\nbe exempt from any FHA requirements. Nor did Congress add any exceptions to the FHA when it later amended Section\n8 “to minimize the burdens of Section 8 participation in order to make the program more attractive to landlords.” Salute,\n136 F.3d at 298 (discussing the passage of Pub. L. No. 104-134, § 203(a), (d), 110 Stat. 1321 (1996)).\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                             Page 9\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\ndisparate impact, might permit a fact-finder to infer that a landlord entered Section 8 expecting to\nattract Section 8 tenants of one race, then withdrew based on discriminatory animus when she\ninstead attracted tenants of a different race. Thus, our view that it is possible to bring disparate-\nimpact challenges to withdrawals from Section 8 is consistent with our view that one cannot bring\na disparate-impact challenge to Section 8 non-participation.\n                                                  IV\n         Because we reject a categorical rule against disparate-impact challenges to withdrawals from\nSection 8, we must address whether the Commission can state a prima facie case of disparate impact\ndiscrimination against Graoch in this case. To state a prima facie case of disparate-impact\ndiscrimination under the FHA, a plaintiff must (1) identify and challenge a specific housing practice,\nand then (2) show that the practice had an adverse effect on members of a protected class by offering\nstatistical evidence of a kind or degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the\nadverse effect in question. The Commission plainly satisfied the first requirement by identifying\nand challenging Graoch’s practice of no longer accepting Section 8 vouchers. We conclude that it\ndid not satisfy the second requirement, however, because it failed even to allege any facts making\nthe statistical comparison necessary to determine whether Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 had\na disparate impact on blacks.\n        In Arthur, we explained that there are “two types of discriminatory effects which a facially\nneutral housing decision can have”:\n       The first occurs when that decision has a greater adverse impact on one racial group\n       than on another. The second is the effect which the decision has on the community\n       involved; if it perpetuates segregation and thereby prevents interracial association\n       it will be considered invidious under the Fair Housing Act independently of the\n       extent to which it produces a disparate effect on different racial groups.\n782 F.2d at 575 (citing Arlington Heights II, 558 F.2d at 1290). In a disparate-impact case under\nthe FHA, a plaintiff must present statistical evidence showing the existence of at least one of the two\neffects to state a prima facie case. Here, the Commission presented three pieces of data: seventeen\nof the eighteen families who received Section 8 assistance and lived at Autumn Run when Graoch\nannounced its withdrawal are black; as of 2003, 6,270 of the 8,849 Jefferson County residents\nreceiving Section 8 vouchers were black; and as of the 2000 census, 18.9% of Jefferson County\nresidents were black and 24% were members of black households. It made no other allegations\nregarding the racial makeup of Autumn Run or the surrounding community.\n        To determine whether a plaintiff can show the first type of discriminatory effect described\nin Arthur, “[t]he correct inquiry is whether the policy in question had a disproportionate impact on\nthe minorities in the total group to which the policy was applied.” Betsey v.

In Betsey, a landlord\nmanaging several adjacent buildings adopted a policy banning children from Building Three. 736\nF.2d at 985. The policy led to the eviction of 54.3% of the non-white tenants in Building Three, but\nonly 14.1% of white tenants. Id. at 988. Relying on the discrepancy between those percentages, the\ncourt held that the plaintiffs had made a prima facie case even though “the percentage of blacks at\n[the apartment complex as a whole] continues to exceed by a substantial margin both the percentage\nof black renters in the election district in which [the complex] is located as well as in Montgomery\nCounty as a whole.” Id. at 986-87. This approach respects the common-sense notion that a policy\napplied to a population that is 95 percent black does not have a disproportionate adverse effect on\nblacks even if 90 percent of the people it burdens are black.\n\fNo. 06-5561          Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                         Page 10\n                     County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\n        Here, Graoch applied its “no Section 8” policy to all residents of Autumn Run.\nConsequently, to determine whether the policy had a greater adverse effect on blacks than whites,\nwe should compare the percentage of blacks among the Section 8 tenants whose leases were not\nrenewed (about 94 percent) to the percentage of blacks among the total pool of tenants at Autumn\nRun. Yet the Commission has not presented any data regarding the total tenant pool and has not\neven alleged that there are more whites among the non-Section 8 tenants than among the Section 8\ntenants. The only information we have about Autumn Run’s non-Section 8 tenants is an isolated\ncomment by Graoch’s lawyer that “the tenants at Respondent project Autumn Run Apartments were\n90% minority and 10% white.” If we consider this information (which the Commission does not\ndispute), it indicates that the racial mix of Autumn Run’s Section 8 and non-Section 8 tenants was\nessentially the same, overwhelmingly non-white. Because the Commission has not even alleged –\nand very likely could not show – that Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 harmed a disproportionate\npercentage of the black tenants at Autumn Run, we conclude that the Commission has not stated a\nprima facie case based on the first type of discriminatory effect. There can be no prima facie case\nof racial disparate impact without a showing of adverse impact on a racial group. For all that the\nCommission alleges, any vacancies caused by non-renewal of Section 8 leases to black tenants will\nbe filled by black non-Section 8 tenants, who already fill the very large majority of Autumn Run’s\napartments.\n        The Commission has not stated a prima facie case based on the second type of discriminatory\neffect either. It has never claimed that Graoch’s withdrawal from Section 8 had a segregative effect\nnor alleged any facts from which we could infer a segregative effect: it has not provided any\ninformation about the racial makeup of the community surrounding Autumn Run or about the likely\neffect of withdrawal on the racial makeup of Autumn Run itself.\n       Because the Commission cannot meet its burden at the first step of the burden-shifting\nframework, its case cannot go forward. Graoch is not required to present a legitimate business\nreason justifying its decision to withdraw from Section 8.\n                                                 V\n        For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Graoch\nis affirmed.\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v.

The owner apparently became irritated by certain requirements the local housing administrator\nimposed on him, requirements he apparently regarded as too onerous, time consuming and costly.\nSo he withdrew. This apparently angered the administrator and the Commission, and they accused\nhim of discrimination. This seems to be the underlying situation.

For the\nreasons set forth below, I concur in the lead opinion’s conclusion that a landlord’s withdrawal from\nthe Section 8 program may give rise to a disparate-impact claim under the Fair Housing Act\n(“FHA”), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-\n3631. But I differ in the analytical framework that I think this court should apply to FHA disparate-\nimpact claims against private entities. In the instant case, Graoch has conceded that MHRC has\nestablished a prima facie case of disparate impact under the FHA. I therefore think this court should\nreverse the grant of summary judgment to Graoch. Because the district court offered no reason for\ndenying MHRC’s cross-motion for summary judgment, other than the grant of Graoch’s motion, I\nbelieve this court should vacate the part of the district court’s order denying MHRC’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Insufficient evidence exists for us to rule as a matter of law on whether Graoch\nsuccessfully rebutted MHRC’s prima facie case by showing that withdrawal from the Section 8\nprogram constitutes a business necessity. I therefore believe this court should remand for further\nproceedings.\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n        The Section 8 tenant-based housing-assistance program aids low-income families in\nobtaining housing in the private market. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a). Local public-housing agencies\nreceive federal funds to administer the program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(b)(1). These agencies issue\nvouchers to families who then independently find suitable rental housing provided by private owners\nvoluntarily participating in the program. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(6)(B). The local housing agency\npays the housing subsidy directly to the landlord. Participation in the Section 8 program places legal\nduties on owners related to the safety, sanitation, and lease-terms of the rental housing they provide.\n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(d); 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(7)-(8). Public-housing agencies set “the payment\nstandard for each size of dwelling unit in a market area” at not less than ninety percent and not more\nthan 110 percent of “the fair market rental.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(B). The monthly assistance\nfor a family is equal to the amount by which the “payment standard” rent determined by the public\nhousing agency exceeds either thirty percent of the monthly adjusted income or ten percent of the\nmonthly income of the family, whichever is greater. A tenant, however, must pay the difference\nbetween his or her subsidy and actual rent, no matter the amount of the payment standard rent. 42\nU.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2)(A); Alfred M. Clark III, Can America Afford to Abandon a National Housing\nPolicy? 6 J. AFFORD. HOUS. & CMTY. DEV. L. 185, 188 (1997).\n        The Housing Authority of Jefferson County administers the Section 8 program in the\nLouisville area. In March 2003, Graoch, the owner of Autumn Run apartments in Louisville,\nnotified the Housing Authority that it would honor existing leases held by Section 8 tenants but\nwould not renew these leases or sign any new Section 8 leases.

MHRC stayed administrative proceedings to allow Graoch to seek a declaratory judgment in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky that withdrawal from the Section 8\nprogram cannot constitute a violation of the FHA.

Framework for Analysis\n        Section 3604 of the FHA prohibits discrimination because of, inter alia, race, color, or\nnational origin in the sale or rental of housing by (1) refusing to rent or make available any dwelling;\n(2) offering discriminatory “terms, conditions, or privileges” of rental; (3) making, printing or\npublishing “any notice, statement, or advertisement” indicating a preference, limitation, or\ndiscrimination based on race, color, or national origin; and (4) representing to any person that “any\ndwelling is not available for . . . rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(a)-(d). We have previously held that a plaintiff may establish a violation under the FHA by\nshowing that the defendant has an intent to discriminate (“disparate treatment”) or that an otherwise\nneutral practice has a disparate impact on a protected class (“disparate impact”).

In a more standard\nFHA claim, tenants or a local fair-housing council would be in the position of plaintiff and private landlords or a\ngovernment entity in the position of defendant. Because Graoch sought declaratory relief on the question whether a\nlandlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program could ever constitute a violation of the FHA, my analysis proceeds\nto consider the appropriate framework for analyzing disparate-impact claims against private defendants.

I believe that we should analyze these claims\naccording to a framework derived from that which the Fourth Circuit uses to evaluate FHA\ndisparate-impact claims against private defendants as well as that which we use to evaluate Title VII\ndisparate-impact claims. First, we should require a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case by\nshowing that a challenged housing practice or policy has caused a disparate effect on a protected\nclass. Second, if a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the defendant can avoid liability by\nproving that the challenged practice constituted a business necessity and that there existed no less\ndiscriminatory alternatives that could serve the business interest.\n         1. FHA Disparate-Impact Claims Against Government Defendants\n        In deriving this standard, I have found it helpful to survey how other circuits treat FHA\ndisparate-impact claims against both government and private entities. The circuits evaluate the\nclaim either by applying a multi-factor test, implementing a burden-shifting framework, or\ncombining the two approaches. In Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v.

The Seventh Circuit accordingly set forth a four-factor test to determine whether an\naction producing a disparate effect violates the FHA. Its factors inquire:\n         (1) how strong is the plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect; (2) is there some\n         evidence of discriminatory intent, though not enough to satisfy the constitutional\n         standard of Washington v. Davis [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976)]; (3) what is the defendant’s\n         interest in taking the action complained of; and (4) does the plaintiff seek to compel\n         the defendant to affirmatively provide housing for members of minority groups or\n         merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners\n         who wish to provide such housing.\nId. Five years later, the Fourth Circuit adopted the same four factors in considering an FHA\ndisparate-impact claim against a government entity. See Smith v. Town of Clarkton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406173\"><a href=\"/opinion/406173/james-smith-v-the-town-of-clarkton-north-carolina-and-j-dwight-fort/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1065 (4th Cir. 1982).

Drawing on\nearlier Third Circuit precedent,3 the Second Circuit established a burden-shifting framework, which\nconsidered the Arlington Heights II factors “as part of a defendant’s justification for its challenged\naction.” Id. at 935. The Second Circuit held that plaintiffs should first establish a prima facie case\n“by showing that the challenged practice of the defendant ‘actually or predictably results in racial\ndiscrimination; in other words that it has a discriminatory effect.’” Id. at 934 (quoting United States\nv.

The court then evaluates the disparate-impact claim by\nbalancing the showing of discriminatory effects against that of the defendant’s justifications and by\nassessing whether the plaintiff seeks to compel or to prevent interference with housing provision.\nId.\n       The other circuits that have addressed FHA disparate-impact claims against government\ndefendants have not followed Huntington Branch’s framework for incorporating the Arlington II\n\n\n         3\n           Shortly after the Arlington Heights II decision, the Third Circuit held in Resident Advisory Board v.

Instead, the\nTenth Circuit’s evaluation of disparate-impact claims against private defendants follows the\nframework that the Sixth Circuit uses to evaluate disparate-impact claims against public defendants.\nIn Mountain Side Mobile Estates Partnership v. Secretary of Housing & Urban Development, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697375\"><a href=\"/opinion/697375/mountain-side-mobile-estates-partnership-robert-dalke-marilyn-dalke-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1252 (10th Cir. 1995), the Tenth Circuit held that “a Title VIII prima facie case, once\nestablished . . . could alone suffice to prove a Title VIII violation unless the defendants justify the\ndiscriminatory effect which has resulted from their challenged actions.” The opinion reiterated that\n“unrebutted proof of discriminatory effect alone may justify a federal equitable response.” Id. To\ndetermine “whether a plaintiff’s prima facie case of disparate impact makes out a violation of Title\nVIII,” the Tenth Circuit assesses the three factors we set forth in Arthur: the strength of the showing\nof discriminatory effect; the defendant’s interest in taking the action; and whether the plaintiff seeks\nto compel the defendant to provide housing or alternatively to restrain the defendant from interfering\nwith the provision of housing. Id.\n       3. Sixth Circuit Treatment of Title VII Disparate-Impact Claims\n        In deciding what framework to apply in the instant case, the lead opinion does not look to\nother circuit courts’ treatment of FHA disparate-impact claims for guidance. Instead, the lead\nopinion integrates the three-factor analysis outlined in Arthur v. City of Toledo with the tripartite\nburden-shifting approach taken in a single Sixth Circuit Title VII disparate-impact case, Kovacevich\nv. Kent State Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770180\"><a href=\"/opinion/770180/dorothy-kovacevich-v-kent-state-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2000). In particular, the lead opinion suggests that the\nfirst two factors from Arthur—the strength of the showing of disparate effects and the strength of\nthe defendant’s interest in the challenged practice—should be applied at the pretext stage of\nanalysis. I part company with the lead opinion on two grounds. First, I believe that the appropriate\nburden-shifting framework for a disparate-impact case is found not in Kovacevich but in an earlier\nSixth Circuit decision, Alexander v. Local 496, Laborers’ International Union of North America,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764161\"><a href=\"/opinion/764161/davine-alexander-plaintiffs-appelleescross-appellants-96-3858-v-local/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). Second, I believe that the lead\nopinion improperly applies the factors outlined in Arthur v. City of Toledo to an FHA disparate-\nimpact claim involving a private defendant.\n        The lead opinion is correct in looking to disparate-impact claims against private defendants\nunder Title VII to derive a framework for assessing such claims under the FHA. See Larkin, 89 F.3d\nat 289. The Sixth Circuit’s cases on disparate-impact claims under Title VII, however, conflict.\nKovacevich holds that a once a plaintiff has shown an adverse effect, the burden shifts to the\ndefendants to “articulate a legitimate business reason” for the challenged practice. 224 F.3d at 830.\nOnce the defendant has proffered such a reason, under Kovacevich “the burden shifts back to the\nplaintiff to show either that the [defendant’s] reason is a pretext for discrimination, or that there\nexists an alternative . . . practice that would achieve the same business ends with a less\ndiscriminatory impact.” Id. In contrast, Alexander holds that once a plaintiff has established a prima\nfacie case by showing adverse effect, “the burden shifts to the [defendant] to produce evidence that\nthe challenged practice is a business necessity.” 177 F.3d at 405-06. The difference between the\ntwo opinions lies in the fact that by requiring the plaintiff to prove pretext, Kovacevich both imports\nan intent-oriented principle from the disparate-treatment test into the disparate-impact analysis and\nplaces the ultimate burden of persuasion on the plaintiff rather than on the defendant.\n        Alexander offers the better standard for assessing disparate-impact claims against private\nentities. Moreover, Alexander is the earlier opinion, and “when a later decision of this court\nconflicts with one of our prior published decisions, we are still bound by the holding of the earlier\ncase.” Darrah v.

Pretext does not belong in a disparate-impact case as a matter of principle.\nAs a general matter, the plaintiff’s burden to prove pretext involves a showing that the defendant’s\nproffered justification for the challenged action masks actual discriminatory intent. Amini v. Oberlin\nColl., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793573\"><a href=\"/opinion/793573/saeid-b-amini-v-oberlin-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359-60 (6th Cir. 2006). Because a plaintiff does not need to establish\ndiscriminatory intent in a disparate-impact case, proof of pretext in such a case would be an\nunnecessary and indeed absurd undertaking.\n        Third, the genealogy of the pretext prong in Kovacevich renders it suspect. Kovacevich\ndevised the requirement that a plaintiff prove pretext in a Title VII disparate-impact claim from an\nearlier Sixth Circuit Title VII disparate-impact case, Scales v. J.C. Bradford & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555822\"><a href=\"/opinion/555822/deniece-scales-v-jc-bradford-and-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(6th Cir. 1991). Scales, in turn, derived the pretext requirement from a Supreme Court opinion,\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112145\"><a href=\"/opinion/112145/watson-v-fort-worth-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988). The relevant portion of Watson,\nhowever, does not make a plaintiff’s proof of pretext a third stage of the burden-shifting in disparate-\nimpact cases. Instead, the opinion merely observes that the factors used to assess a plaintiff’s\nshowing of a less discriminatory alternative in disparate-impact cases are also ones that determine\nwhether “the challenged practice has operated as the functional equivalent of a pretext for\ndiscriminatory treatment.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 998 (emphasis added).\n        Moreover, the section of Watson cited by Scales for the proposition that a plaintiff retains\nthe burden of proof in a disparate-impact claim was issued by a plurality rather than a majority of\nthe Court and is therefore not binding. In this section of the Watson opinion joined only by three\nother Justices, Justice O’Connor wrote that the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion at each\nstage of the burden-shifting inquiry in a disparate-impact case. Id. at 997. Justice White’s majority\nopinion in Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 660, adopted the position taken by the O’Connor plurality in\nWatson. The Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 105, 105 Stat. 1074-1075 (1994) (codified as amended at\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)), however, rejected Wards Cove’s holding regarding the allocation of\nburdens of production and proof in disparate-impact cases. The interpretive memorandum for the\nAct, which Congress declared to be its exclusive legislative history, states: “The terms ‘business\nnecessity’ and ‘job-related’ are intended to reflect the concepts enunciated by the Supreme Court\nin Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108284\"><a href=\"/opinion/108284/griggs-v-duke-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), and in the other Supreme Court decisions prior\nto Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio.” 137 Cong. Rec. 28,680 (1991). We have clearly interpreted\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991 to mandate that once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of\ndisparate effects, “the burden of persuasion, not just the burden of production, shifts to the defendant\nto show a business necessity for the practices with disparate impact.” Phillips v. Cohen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789472\"><a href=\"/opinion/789472/willie-s-phillips-curtissene-anderson-todd-brooks-yulander-edwards-emma/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 398 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)).\n       4. Burdens of Proof and the Business-Necessity Defense\n       “Business necessity” is similarly the appropriate standard for private entities’ defense against\ndisparate-impact claims under the FHA. See 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’ Ass’n, 444 F.2d at 679\n(observing that Griggs is the “seminal case” on the issue of disparate-impact claims and that, in the\nemployment context, Griggs establishes “business necessity” as the sole defense to a showing of\ndisparate effects). The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) takes the position\nthat implementing regulations promulgated in 1989 established a business-necessity defense to\ndisparate-impact claims. The Secretary of HUD’s Regulation of the Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, 60 Fed. Reg. at\n61,866-61,868 (Dec. 1, 1995) (codified at 24 C.F.R. Part 81).\n        “Business necessity” holds defendants to a higher standard than the more lenient “business\njustifications” test set forth in Wards Cove, 490 U.S. at 659, which defined “the dispositive issue [to\nbe] whether a challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate [business] goals of the\n[defendant].” Between 1989 and 1991, some courts applied the Wards Cove standard to FHA cases.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                        Page 19\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nCases decided after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, however, implement the “business\nnecessity” test in recognition that the Act overruled the weakened disparate-impact standards set\nforth in Wards Cove. Stanton, The Fair Housing Act and Insurance, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. at 186-87.\nWhile a consensus exists that business necessity is the appropriate test, there remains some\ndisagreement as to the content of that standard. The Fourth Circuit, HUD, and district courts within\nthe Ninth Circuit define business necessity to mean a “compelling” business interest; in their\nallocation of  the burdens of proof, the Second and Third Circuit’s apply a “substantive equivalent”\nof this test.6 Id. at 187. I agree that “when confronted with a showing of discriminatory impact,\ndefendants must prove a business necessity sufficiently compelling to justify the challenged\npractice.” See Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988. Requiring the defendant to prove anything less would\ncontravene the plain meaning of the word “necessity,” defined as “an imperative requirement or\nneed for something.” Random House Dictionary 1284 (Stuart Berg Flexner, ed., 2d ed. 1993).\nMoreover, requiring the defendant to offer a mere business justification would confuse defendants’\nburden of proving business-necessity in disparate-impact cases with defendants’ burden of\nproducing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action in disparate-treatment\ncases. Compare Macy, 484 F.3d at 364 (discussing the shifting burdens in disparate-treatment\ncases), with Alexander, 177 F.3d at 405-06 (discussing the shifting burdens in disparate-impact\ncases).\n        In articulating the framework for our evaluation of FHA disparate-impact claims against\nprivate defendants, I believe that we should rely on our earlier precedent Alexander, rather than\nKovacevich, and seek guidance as well from the Fourth Circuit decision in Betsey v. Turtle Creek.\nThus, we should first require that plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of disparate effects. Second,\nupon the showing of a prima facie case, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendants, who\nmust prove that the challenged housing practice constitutes a business necessity and that no less\ndiscriminatory alternatives are available. In the Title VII context, plaintiffs bear the burden of\nproving that a less discriminatory alternative exists. Isabel v. City of Memphis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789900\"><a href=\"/opinion/789900/sharon-isabel-richard-parker-gregory-sanders-walter-williams-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411\n(6th Cir. 2005) (citing Albemarle Paper Co. v.

The\nconsensus across the circuits, however, is that in the housing context defendants have the burden of\nproving the absence of a less discriminatory alternative. See Lapid Laurel, LLC, 284 F.3d at 467\n(discussing the defendant’s burden of proof regarding the absence of less discriminatory\nalternatives); Langlois, 207 F.3d at 50 (same); Huntington Branch, NAACP, 844 F.2d at 935 (same);\nDews, 109 F. Supp. 2d at 531-32, 565 (same); see also Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988 (holding that once\nplaintiffs have established a prima facie case, defendants must prove business necessity).\n        Our analysis should stop with an evaluation of whether a private defendant has successfully\nrebutted the plaintiff’s showing of disparate effects by proving “business necessity” and the\nunavailability of a less discriminatory alternative. Considerations of doctrine and policy preclude\nthis court’s use of the Arthur factors for a government defendant to evaluate an FHA disparate-\nimpact claim against a private defendant. First, the lead opinion applies factors from a case\nconcerning a public defendant to cases against private defendants, without explaining why they are\ntransferable. That the lead opinion needed to excise the third Arthur factor from its analysis only\nhighlights the unsuitability of the framework in the context of a case against a private defendant.\nI believe that the Tenth Circuit incorrectly integrated Arthur’s multi-factor test into the “business\nnecessity” framework applicable to private defendants in disparate-impact suits; it did so without\neven acknowledging that the case concerned a private defendant while Arthur concerned a public\n\n         6\n           The Tenth Circuit has rejected an attempt by HUD to define business necessity as a “compelling need or\nnecessity.” Mountain Side, 56 F.3d at 1254. But in making this determination, the Tenth Circuit closely paraphrased\nlanguage from Justice O’Connor’s plurality opinion in Watson. Because I believe that relying on the Watson plurality\nis inappropriate following the Civil Rights Act of 1991, I also refrain from following the standard for business necessity\nset forth in Mountain Side.\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                            Page 20\n                      County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\ndefendant. See Mountain Side, 56 F.3d at 1252. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit has explicitly stated\nthat the multi-factor analysis derived from Arlington Heights II and its progeny should not apply in\ndisparate-impact claims against private defendants. Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988 n.5.\n        Second, by applying the Arthur factors, the lead opinion converts an inquiry into the business\njustification for a practice bearing a disparate impact on a protected class into a balancing test. The\nlead opinion suggests that this court should weigh the disparate effects of the challenged action\nagainst the strength of the defendant’s interest in taking the challenged action. Courts appropriately\ncountenance governments’ weighing of competing public considerations of deep importance, and\nthey may engage in such balancing acts themselves. See, e.g., Arthur, 782 F.2d at 575 (holding that\nbecause of “the strong policy considerations underlying referendums . . . absent highly unusual\ncircumstances, the discriminatory effect of a referendum cannot establish a violation of the Fair\nHousing Act”). In limited instances, Congress has reduced the burden of fair housing laws on\ngovernment entities, with respect to those entities’ pursuit of important public interests, but\nCongress did not do the same for private landlords. See Pfaff v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721398\"><a href=\"/opinion/721398/karl-pfaff-elizabeth-pfaff-v-us-department-of-housing-and-urban/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that “Congress chose to give special deference to\ngovernment-imposed occupancy limits only . . . [and] made no comparable provision for private\noccupancy policies”). Even if weighing relative strengths of interests were appropriate, we must\nfollow the longstanding rule that the weighing of litigants’ competing interests belongs at trial and\nnot at the summary judgment stage. Crestview Parke Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786733\"><a href=\"/opinion/786733/crestview-parke-care-center-v-tommy-thompson-united-states-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755\n(6th Cir. 2004) (“In evaluating whether summary judgment is proper, we do not weigh the evidence,\nbut rather view the evidence in the light most favorable to [the non-moving party] to divine the\nexistence of a genuine dispute of material fact.”)\n         Third, the lead opinion’s framework mistakenly places the ultimate burden of persuasion on\nthe plaintiff. The lead opinion states that the final step in the burden-shifting analysis involves\nevaluating the plaintiff’s showing by considering “the strength of the plaintiff’s showing of\ndiscriminatory effect against the strength of the defendant’s interest in taking the challenged action.”\nLead Op. at 10. Under the business-necessity test, however, the landlord will successfully defend\nagainst a showing of disparate effects only if he or she proves that the challenged action constitutes\na business necessity. If the landlord fails to carry this burden of proof, then he or she should lose\nonce the plaintiff has established a statistically significant showing of disparate effects regardless\nof its strength. Conversely, if the defendant does indeed prove business necessity, he or she should\nnot be liable under a disparate-impact theory of the FHA no matter how strong the showing of\ndisparate effects.\n        In conclusion, we are bound by the factors set forth in Arthur when evaluating FHA\ndisparate-impact claims against government defendants. But the framework outlined in Arthur is\nnot well suited to the evaluation of FHA disparate-impact claims against private defendants. The\nburden-shifting framework for FHA disparate-impact claims against private defendants is\nstraightforward: first, the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by showing that a challenged\nhousing practice or policy has caused a statistically significant disparate effect on a protected group;\nsecond, the housing owner can assert the affirmative defense that the challenged action constitutes\na business necessity and that there are no less discriminatory alternatives.\nC. Withdrawal from the Section 8 Program and Disparate Impact\n       I concur in the lead opinion’s holding that a landlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8\nprogram, when it has a disparate impact on members of a protected class, may violate the FHA.\nCourts should give the “broad and inclusive” language of the FHA a “generous construction” to\neffectuate its remedial purpose.

Co. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108640\"><a href=\"/opinion/108640/trafficante-v-metropolitan-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209, 212 (1972).\n\fNo. 06-5561           Graoch Associates #33 v.

Graoch argues that the voluntary nature of the Section 8 program should counsel\nagainst allowing a plaintiff to bring a disparate-impact claim based on a landlord’s decision to\nwithdraw. Appellee Br. at 11-14. Graoch derives this analysis from the Seventh Circuit opinion in\nKnapp v. Eagle Property Management Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1995), which held that the\nrefusal by a landlord who participated in the Section 8 program to accept a new Section 8 tenant\ncould not give rise to liability under a disparate-impact analysis of the FHA. Id. at 1280. The\nSeventh Circuit found no principled basis upon which to distinguish between a landlord’s decision\nnot to participate in the Section 8 program and the decision of a participating housing owner not to\naccept a new Section 8 tenant. Id. Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit held that because\nnonparticipation is not actionable, neither can a landlord’s withdrawal from the program give rise\nto a disparate-impact claim. Id. (“The actions of both non-participating and participating owners\nhave the same impact on minorities and to hold only the latter liable for racial discrimination for that\nconduct would deter them from joining or remaining involved in the program.”)\n        The voluntary nature of the Section 8 program does caution us to consider carefully whether\na landlord’s decision to withdraw from the program may give rise to liability under the FHA.\nCongress’s revision of the FHA has only reinforced that body’s intent to make Section 8 a voluntary\nprogram. Before 1996, some courts interpreted 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(d)(1)(B), which provided “that\nthe owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and\nconditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good\ncause” to prescribe an “endless lease.” Some courts read this provision to mean that the owner could\nnot refuse to renew a lease at the conclusion of the lease period, except for the specified reasons.\n30 Eastchester LLC v.

No. 104-134, § 203, 110 Stat.\n1321, at *1321-281 (1996), by inserting “during the term of the lease” into both clause (ii) and\nclause (iii) of the section. “The effect of the statutory change was to eliminate the ‘endless lease’\ninterpretation of such provision and clarify that a landlord could terminate a Section 8 tenant’s lease\nand, a fortiori, its participation in the Section 8 program with respect to that tenant, when the term\nof the tenant’s lease expires.” 30 Eastchester, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">553709</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n        The same Omnibus Budget Act also repealed the “take one, take all” provision of the United\nStates Housing Act of 1937. Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act § 203.\nThat provision, previously codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(t)(1)(A) was entitled “Nondiscrimination\nAgainst Certificate Holders and Voucher Holders” and provided that no owner who had entered into\na contract for housing assistance payments under the section “shall refuse to lease any available\ndwelling unit in any multifamily housing project of such owner to a holder of a voucher.” Glover\nv.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).\n        Ultimately, however, I disagree with the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning that the voluntary\ncharacter of the Section 8 program precludes liability for withdrawal from the program under a\ndisparate-impact theory of the FHA. The repeal of the “endless lease” and “take one, take all”\nprovisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1437f evinced Congress’ intention that a landlord’s decision to participate\nin the Section 8 program should not require him or her to accept any particular Section 8 tenant or\nto renew endlessly the lease of a given tenant. The statutory repeals, however, did not address the\nissue of a complete withdrawal from the program and a decision not to accept any new Section 8\ntenants. The FHA imposes a non-discrimination mandate on actors engaging in many different types\nof voluntary actions. See, e.g., Betsey, 736 F.2d at 986-87 (allowing a disparate-impact claim to\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                       Page 22\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nproceed where a private landlord issued eviction notices to families with children in an effort to\ninstitute an all-adult rental policy). Landlords who choose not to accept any Section 8 vouchers may\ndo so for all kinds of legitimate or biased reasons that remain behind the veil of nonparticipation,\nfar removed from legal scrutiny. Once a landlord decides to enroll in the Section 8 program,\nhowever, he or she necessarily accepts a new set of responsibilities toward tenants under the FHA.\nThese include duties both to refrain from intentional discrimination on the basis of a protected\ncharacteristic and, in the case of a business practice that has a disparate impact on a protected class,\nto implement when possible an alternative business practice with less discriminatory effects. See\nAlexander, 177 F.3d at 405-06. I agree with the lead opinion that the Sixth Circuit should decline\nto follow the Seventh Circuit and should instead allow plaintiffs to use evidence of disparate impact\nto show that a landlord violated the FHA by withdrawing from the Section 8 program.\n          In addition to Knapp, Graoch relies on the Second Circuit’s decision in Salute v. Stratford\nGreens Garden Apartments, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751627\"><a href=\"/opinion/751627/richard-salute-long-island-housing-services-marie-kravette-v-stratford/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1998), to argue against the propriety of allowing\na disparate-impact claim for withdrawal from the Section 8 program. Appellee Br. at 11-12. In\nSalute, however, the majority based its opinion on the fact that the defendant landlord had never\naccepted tenants who, at the time of application, participated in the Section 8 program. Id. at 302\n(“[N]on-participation constitutes a legitimate reason for their refusal to accept section 8 tenants and\n. . . we therefore cannot hold them liable for . . . discrimination under the disparate impact theory.”)\n(quoting Knapp, 54 F.3d at 1280) (alterations in the original). Therefore, Salute is not applicable\nin the instant case because of the distinction between        nonparticipation, at issue in Salute, and\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program, at issue here.7\n         Graoch further suggests that allowing disparate-impact claims based on a landlord’s\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program will deter landlords from entering the program. Appellee\nBr. at 13 (“If a landlord is held to a perpetual lease—and all of the administrative burdens which\nSection 8 compliance entails—once it accepts a Section 8 tenant, many landlords may never agree\nto enter into the program at all, thereby decreasing the available private housing stock for low\nincome tenants.”) (quoting 30 Eastchester LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">553709</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4). The Eastchester case\nupon which Graoch relies, however, did not involve a disparate-impact claim under the FHA.\nInstead, a tenant-plaintiff claimed that her landlord’s allegedly illegal withdrawal from the Section\n8 program, at the termination of her lease, constituted a defense to her own nonpayment of rent. Id.\nat *2. Allowing disparate-impact claims for withdrawal does not yoke landlords to a “perpetual\nlease.” A plaintiff’s showing that a withdrawal from the Section 8 program has a disparate effect\non a protected class merely establishes a plaintiff’s prima facie case and does not automatically\nresult in liability. Such claims require only that a landlord show business necessity. See Green v.\nSunpointe Assocs., Ltd., No. C96-1542C, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1526484</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (W.D. Wash. 1997).\n        Graoch argues that a landlord would incur significant expense defending itself against a\ndisparate-impact claim at the summary-judgment stage. Appellee Br. at 16. But the Supreme Court\nhas not shied away from allowing innovative disparate-impact claims even though newly-recognized\ncauses of action may potentially impose costs on businesses. See, e.g., Smith v. City of Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (2005) (holding that a disparate-impact theory is cognizable under the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act). Landlords have a considerable financial incentive to accept\nSection 8 tenants because the federal government’s subsidy of a portion of the market-based rent\nexpands the pool of available tenants. Clark, 6 J. AFFORD. HOUS. & CMTY. DEV. L. at 187. This\n\n         7\n          In his dissent to the majority opinion in Salute, Judge Calabresi argued that the defendant landlord’s\nacceptance of Section 8 vouchers from pre-existing tenants, even though he refused new Section 8 tenants, made the\nlandlord a partial participant in the program rather than a nonparticipant. 136 F.3d at 312 (Calabresi, J., dissenting).\nNevertheless, the majority viewed the landlord as a nonparticipant and based the court’s decision on the view that\nnonparticipation does not incur liability.\n\fNo. 06-5561               Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                                        Page 23\n                          County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\neconomic reality makes it less likely that the potential of disparate-impact claims upon withdrawal\nfrom Section 8 will deter landlords from entering the program.\n                             III. MHRC’S DISPARATE-IMPACT CLAIM\nA. Prima Facie Case\n        Because the district court ruled as a matter of law that a landlord’s withdrawal from the\nSection 8 program cannot alone constitute a violation of the FHA, it did not discuss the statistical\nevidence that MHRC would need to produce to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact.\nGraoch appears to have admitted, however, “that the uncontested statistical evidence would in\ntheory support a ‘disparate impact’ claim against Graoch if . . . Graoch’s mere withdrawal from the\nvoluntary Section 8 program could subject it to such a claim . . . and Graoch’s business necessity\ndefense were to be rejected by the Court . . . .” R. 28, Graoch’s Response to MHRC’s Cross-Motion\nfor Summary Judgment, p. 2 n. 2. Because all members of this panel are in agreement that a\nlandlord’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program can give rise to a disparate-impact claim,\nGraoch’s admission8obligates this court to hold that MHRC has established a prima facie showing\nof disparate effects. As a result of Graoch’s concession in the district court, we need not engage\nin any further assessment of MHRC’s statistical evidence. In the absence of disagreement and\nbriefing on this issue, I think it is unwise to set forth any framework for evaluating the statistical\nevidence necessary to prove disparate effects.\nB. Business Necessity\n        Because Graoch has conceded that its withdrawal from the Section 8 program would have\na disparate effect on African-Americans, to avoid liability under a disparate-impact theory of the\nFHA Graoch needs to prove that the withdrawal amounted to a business necessity and that no less\ndiscriminatory alternatives were available. Graoch stated that it decided to withdraw from the\nSection 8 program because participation had required that Graoch agree to a Housing Assistance\nPayments Contract “which imposed terms and conditions more burdensome than those contained\nin Autumn Run’s standard Lease.” J.A. at 70 (Hamasaki Aff.) In addition, Graoch stated that the\nHousing Authority of Jefferson County held the company “to an impossible standard” in enforcing\nrequirements for the quality of the housing provided. Id. Specifically, according to Graoch the\nHousing Authority abated rental payments “for conditions which Graoch was either not made aware\nof prior to inspection, or which it attempted to fix only to be cited upon re-inspection for not making\nits repairs to the arbitrary satisfaction of the inspector.” Id. Neither party devoted attention on\nappeal to arguing whether a business necessity existed to justify Graoch’s withdrawal from the\nSection 8 program. Insufficient evidence exists for us to rule as a matter of law regarding whether\nbusiness necessity justified Graoch’s withdrawal from the Section 8 program. Under these\ncircumstances, we should remand to the district court for further development of the business\nnecessity factor.\n       Upon remand, the district court should give the parties an opportunity to brief the issue of\nbusiness necessity and to present relevant evidence. To survive any motion that Graoch might make\nfor summary judgment, MHRC would need to create a genuine issue of material fact that Graoch’s\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program did not constitute a business necessity. MHRC would be\n\n         8\n           Graoch’s concession that the statistical evidence would support a disparate-impact claim, if a withdrawal from\nthe Section 8 program could give rise to liability under the FHA and if we rejected Graoch’s business-necessity defense,\nimplicitly concedes that the evidence establishes a prima facie showing of disparate effects. Accordingly, although we\ndo not decide the issue of business necessity today, as I explain below, we must nevertheless assume that Graoch has\nconceded that its withdrawal from the Section 8 program had a disparate effect on African-Americans.\n\fNo. 06-5561          Graoch Associates #33 v. Louisville/Jefferson                         Page 24\n                     County Metro Human Relations Comm’n\n\n\nable to discharge this burden by showing “that there is an absence of evidence to support [Graoch’s]\ncase.” Wright v. Murray Guard, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795105\"><a href=\"/opinion/795105/cornelius-wright-v-murray-guard-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Celotex Corp., 477\nU.S. at 322-23). Conversely, to survive a motion for summary judgment made by MHRC, Graoch\nwould need to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the withdrawal constituted a business\nnecessity.\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n        For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the lead opinion’s conclusion that a landlord’s\nwithdrawal from the Section 8 program may give rise to liability under the disparate-impact theory\nof the FHA. I believe that the appropriate action for this court to take is to REVERSE the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to Graoch, VACATE the denial of summary judgment to\nMHRC, and REMAND the case for further proceedings.\n\f</pre>",
