(Harris) appeals a judgment awarding one\nmillion dollars to F.W. Spencer & Son, Inc. (Spencer) in this action to recover delay\ndamages based on breach of contract and common counts. Harris contends the jury\nverdict in Spencer’s favor resulted from the trial court’s errors in (1) severing Spencer’s\n\fdamage claims for trial after Spencer completed its case-in-chief, (2) allowing jury\ninstructions and a verdict form on legal theories not before the jury that served only to\nconfuse the jurors, (3) excluding percipient testimony from Harris’s witnesses on the\nground it constituted expert testimony and allowing Spencer’s experts to testify on the\nreasonableness of any delay, (4) exhibiting bias against Harris’s trial counsel in front of\nthe jury, and (5) denying Harris’s new trial motion on the issue of excessive damages.\nHarris further contends the trial court erred in awarding Spencer prejudgment interest\nunder Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a)1 and in failing to reduce the amount of\nattorney fees awarded to Spencer.\n       We find no merit in Harris’s arguments as to the jury’s verdict and to the award of\nattorney fees. We do, however, find the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment\ninterest under section 3287, subdivision (a). Since Harris conceded below that\nprejudgment interest was awardable under section 3287, subdivision (b), the alternative\nground on which Spencer sought prejudgment interest, we will reduce the prejudgment\ninterest accordingly. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment and post-judgment\norder awarding attorney fees.\n                                           FACTS\n       In 2004, the Modesto City Schools entered into a $79,197,000 contract with\nHarris, a general contractor, for the construction of James C. Enochs High School (the\nProject). In June 2004, Harris entered into a subcontract with Spencer, a mechanical\ncontractor, to perform the plumbing and HVAC work on the Project for $7,545,000. The\nscope of Spencer’s work included furnishing and installing a wet chemical fire\nsuppression system, plumbing, heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and a direct\ndigital control and energy management system. The work was to be completed in\n\n\n       1   Subsequent statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\faccordance with the “Harris Baseline Schedule[,]” which Spencer assumed gave it\n“reasonable time to install work in a reasonable manner with a reasonable flow.”\n      The Project originally was scheduled to finish on April 24, 2006. As the Project\nprogressed, the baseline schedule changed a number of times for a variety of reasons,\nincluding weather and design issues. In June 2005, Harris notified Spencer that the\nProject owner had granted a non-compensable time extension on the Project from April\n2006 to June 24, 2006, as the “exceptionally bad” winter weather had a definite impact\non the schedule progress. Spencer signed a change order agreeing to the time extension\nwithout additional compensation.\n      Spencer claimed Harris caused numerous problems on the site with supervision,\ncoordination of the various trades, weatherization, and access issues. When Spencer\nagreed to accept the no cost change order in 2005, Spencer informed Harris of its\nconcerns regarding Harris’s management of the project and the financial impact to\nSpencer should the schedule continue to change. In response, Harris agreed to address\nfinancial impacts as they materialized. In February 2006, Spencer’s president, Bruce\nBonar, wrote Harris, expressing concerns that the schedule was continuing to slip.\n      In May 2006, Bonar wrote Harris with an estimated cost of the impact the delays\nwere having on Spencer. Bonar estimated the project would be at least 120 days late and,\non that basis, believed Spencer would incur additional costs of $626,847, which included\nextension costs for the project manager, assistant project manager and plumbing\nsuperintendant, and rental costs and home office overhead, as well as an efficiency factor\ndue to the extension/delay. Bonar also advised Harris that Spencer had incurred costs\ndue to lack of flow and efficiency factors which had not yet been quantified.\n      Most of the buildings in the Project were not substantially completed until\nDecember 2006. The entire Project was completed on April 20, 2007, with a notice of\ncompletion submitted on May 17, 2007.\n\n\n\n                                            3.\n\f       On December 21, 2006, Bonar wrote Harris with an update of the additional costs\nSpencer incurred due to the delays in construction. At that time, Spencer still was\nworking on the Project. Bonar estimated the delay and impact costs Spencer incurred\ntotaled $870,969.20. Harris did not pay the claim.\n       This Lawsuit\n       Spencer filed this lawsuit against Harris in December 2007. The complaint\nalleged causes of action for breach of contract, common counts, quantum meruit and to\ncollect on a payment bond. In its breach of contract cause of action, Spencer alleged\nHarris breached the subcontract by failing and refusing to pay Spencer the value of\nvarious items of work performed and materials Spencer supplied under the subcontract,\nor for changes to the work, including delays, impacts and constructive changes. Damages\nwere alleged to include additional direct and indirect expenses, additional costs as a result\nof Harris’s retention of funds, and amounts due under the subcontract, in a sum exceeding\n$850,000 plus interest and attorney fees. In its common counts cause of action, Spencer\nsought to recover the reasonable value of the labor, equipment, materials and services it\nprovided on the project, which it alleged exceeded $850,000.\n       In a hearing held on September 24, 2010, the trial court granted Spencer’s motion\nto exclude the expert opinion of any witness offered by Harris, as Harris did not disclose\nits expert witnesses after being served with a demand for exchange of expert witnesses.\nAlso at that hearing, the trial court found that Harris’s trial counsel, Deb C. Pedersdotter,\nhad lied to and misled the court in every statement she had made about the disclosure of\nexpert witnesses. Accordingly, the court decided to send a transcript of the hearing, as\nwell as a transcript of the August 24, 2010 hearing at which the statements were made, to\nthe State Bar for further investigation.2\n\n       2August 24, 2010 was to have been the first day of the jury trial. Pedersdotter\ninformed the court she had been involved in a traffic accident at the end of July 2010,\nwhich led to her experiencing “some problems.” The trial was continued so Spencer\n\n\n                                              4.\n\f       Motions in Limine\n       A jury trial commenced on April 19, 2011.3 In pretrial proceedings, the trial court\nmade several in limine rulings. Based on the trial court’s earlier order precluding Harris\nfrom offering expert testimony, Spencer filed motion in limine number one to bar Harris\nfrom introducing testimony in support of its defenses that are matters only within the\nknowledge of experts. Harris filed a written opposition, asserting the motion should be\ndenied and the trial court’s prior order applied “as appropriate to the evidence in fact\noffered at trial.” At the hearing, Pedersdotter explained that while she agreed Harris did\nnot have a designated expert witness, percipient witnesses, such as Harris’s president,\nshould be able to testify, for example, regarding what was wrong with a claim from a\ncontractor’s perspective. The trial court explained its earlier ruling: “Any testimony that\nyou would have had to designate an expert on and did not, you are barred. That’s the\nextent of my ruling.” Pedersdotter agreed that was “acceptable.” The court warned that\nthe ruling was “very broad” and she would be barred from having her witness testify\nabout the matters she was just talking about.\n       Pedersdotter responded that the president would not be testifying as an expert;\ninstead, he would be testifying regarding his evaluation of the claim as Harris’s president.\nPedersdotter explained: “If he can’t say how he evaluated the claim, I mean, that’s\npercipient testimony about what happened during the course of construction and during\nthe evaluation of this claim. It’s not expert testimony. It’s not something that we ever\nwould have designated somebody for. He has to explain what Harris did and why it was\nreasonable.” The court answered that it would not rule on “every little bit,” but, “to make\n\n\n\ncould file a motion to bar Harris from offering expert testimony. Pedersdotter was to\nprovide the court with medical reports from her two doctors within a week.\n       3   Subsequent references to dates are to dates in 2011 unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n                                              5.\n\fit plain[,] [i]f I consider it as something you would have had to designate an expert on,\nthey’re not going to testify about it.”\n       Spencer’s motion in limine number three sought to exclude the testimony of any\nHarris personnel regarding the reasonableness of Spencer’s bid estimate as Harris’s\nperson most knowledgeable was not qualified as an expert on the reasonableness of bid\nestimates and Harris was barred from introducing expert testimony. In opposing the\nmotion, Pedersdotter argued that a blanket prohibition of any witness testimony\nconcerning Spencer’s bid would be improper and pointed out that should Spencer object\nto the qualifications of any witness Harris might offer, it must challenge those\nqualifications through the “appropriate process.” In addressing this motion at the pretrial\nhearing, Pedersdotter told the court Harris was not talking about expert testimony, but\nabout “percipient testimony as to what the bids were.” The court responded that it had\nnot found “a percipient testimony exception in the expert disclosure rules.” The court\nstated that percipient witnesses can testify on factual matters, but not expert ones.\nPedersdotter asserted Harris’s witnesses only were going to testify that Harris received a\nset number of bids, what the bids were and that they called Spencer because its bid was\nlow. The court responded that was okay, but the witnesses could not testify the bid\nshould have been higher, and as long as they did not do that, Harris would be fine, “but\nother than that, they cannot give expert opinions, and that would take an expert opinion.”\nThe court stated that the witnesses could testify about factual, “layperson kind of stuff.”\n       Spencer’s motion in limine number five sought to preclude Harris from presenting\ntestimony that delay damages Spencer incurred were not recoverable under the\nsubcontract, which provides that Spencer’s sole remedy should Harris delay, interfere\nwith, disrupt or hinder Spencer’s work is an extension of time to complete work and\nunder no circumstances would Harris be liable to pay Spencer compensation or damages\nfor delay. Spencer asserted in its in limine motion that this “no damages for delay”\nprovision is unenforceable in public works projects under Public Contracts Code\n\n                                             6.\n\fsection 7102, which allows for the recovery of delay damages by a subcontractor where\nthe contractee is responsible for the delay, and the delay is unreasonable under the\ncircumstances and not within the parties’ contemplation. Based on this provision,\nSpencer argued Harris should be barred from arguing or offering testimony that delay\ndamages were not recoverable pursuant to the subcontract.\n       In discussing this motion at the pretrial hearing, the court stated that an expert\ncould testify as to whether the delay was reasonable or unreasonable, but a witness could\nnot interpret the clause itself. In opposing the motion, Pedersdotter argued Harris should\nbe able to testify about the no-damages-for-delay clause because that was the basis for the\nparties’ actions. Pedersdotter agreed that the court ultimately would determine the\ninterpretation or application of the clause, but that would be done best with the facts\nintroduced. The court responded that no one would be interpreting the clause for the jury\nexcept itself, but an expert could testify regarding the terms “reasonable” and\n“unreasonable.” The court, however, recognized that they would “have to cross it when\nwe get there, because, you, know, I can’t make every ruling that possibly will come up in\nthe trial right now.” The court asked counsel not to go into this area at trial until it ruled\non the issue, and when it got to that point, counsel could come to the side bar and it\nwould rule at that point. Pedersdotter put the court and counsel on notice that she\nplanned to have Harris’s president, who oversaw the “claims process,” testify about this\nsubject matter. The court responded that if she was going to go into that during opening\nstatement, she could talk in terms of delay, but it did not want her to go into the contract\nterm itself. The court clarified that a witness could testify that he relied on that paragraph\nin the contract, but the witness could not interpret the provision.\n       Harris’s Opening Statement\n       During her opening statement, Pedersdotter asserted that Spencer had developed\nan attitude on the Project that if something went wrong, they should be compensated for\nit, which was not a “contract-supported approach” to the Project. Pedersdotter pointed\n\n                                              7.\n\fout that the subcontract provided that “[i]f you are delayed in the performance of the\nwork, we will compensate you by giving you additional time to perform. But we are not\ngoing to give you any money.” Spencer’s counsel objected based on the discussion\nduring in limine motions about contract interpretation. The court overruled the objection.\n       After the opening statements concluded, the court explained, outside the jury’s\npresence, that it overruled the objection because it had ruled in the in limine motions that\nno witness was going to interpret the no-damages-for-delay clause. The court read Public\nContract Code section 7102 and stated that because the issue was raised in opening\nstatement, he would have to instruct the jury about this code section. Spencer’s counsel\nhad given the court such a proposed instruction, but the court did not think it was\ncomplete. Accordingly, the court asked Spencer’s counsel to rewrite the instruction and\nprovide it to the court in the morning; if the court did not like the instruction, it would\nsimply read the code section to the jury. The court also invited Pedersdotter to write an\ninstruction if she so desired.\n       At the outset of trial the following day, the court explained to the jury that it had\nheard about a no-damages-for-delay clause in the subcontract; it was the court’s duty to\ninterpret contract language for the jury; and therefore, the court would instruct them on\nthe contract clause in question, which had to be read in conjunction with Public Contract\nCode section 7102. The court read the following: “Under California law, a no damages\nfor delay clause in a contract on a public works project will not bar a contractor from\nrecovering damages for delay where the parties sought to be charged for the delay was\n[sic] responsible for the delay, and where the delay is unreasonable, under the\ncircumstances. And where the delay was not within the contemplation of the parties at\nthe time the parties entered into the contract in question.”4 The record is silent regarding\n\n       4The court’s instruction was not the same as the one Spencer proposed, which\nread: “Under California law, a ‘no damages for delay’ clause in a contract on a public\nworks project will not bar a contractor from recovering damages for delay where the\n\n\n                                              8.\n\fwhether one or both parties prepared this instruction, whether any party objected to it, or\nwhether the court itself prepared it.\n       Evidence on Damages\n       By its lawsuit, Spencer sought to recover the amount Harris owed it for undisputed\nbut unpaid change orders, along with prompt payment penalties (the change order claim),\nas well as delay and impact damages, including inefficiency costs, extra costs and extra\noverhead, incurred on the Project (the delay claim). In its trial brief, Spencer itemized its\ndamages on the change order claim to include $120,210 for unpaid change orders and\n$112,997 for penalties, and its damages on the delay claim at $803,113.\n       As pertinent to this appeal, three of Spencer’s witnesses testified about the delay\nand impact damages, namely Bonar, Spencer’s CEO William Spencer, and expert witness\nChristopher Anderson. Bonar testified he notified Harris in December 2006 that Spencer\nhad incurred an estimated $870,969 in delay costs. This was comprised of extension\ncosts for the project manager, assistant project manager and plumbing superintendent;\nrental charges; four months of home office overhead; an efficiency factor for six\nadditional plumbers and six additional sheet metal workers on site; and additional costs\nfor responding to punch lists.\n       According to Bonar, Spencer was “out of pocket” almost $1.1 million, meaning\nthey spent much more on material, labor and equipment than they were paid. That\nnumber did not include overhead or profit. Bonar testified the amount owed on the\nchange orders totaled $120,787, and his calculation of the impact claim was around\n$860,000. Bonar confirmed, however, that this was not the precise amount Spencer was\nseeking at trial, as Spencer’s expert came up with a different number. Spencer’s loss was\nmuch bigger.\n\n\ndelay is unreasonable under the circumstances and not within the contemplation of the\nparties.”\n\n\n\n                                             9.\n\f       On cross-examination, Bonar testified the amount of money he believed Spencer\nwas entitled to be paid by Harris in connection with all the claims in the lawsuit, not\nincluding attorney fees and interest, was $1,232,000. That number reflected what\nSpencer lost on the job, $1.1 million, plus the 12 percent markup for overhead and profit\nthat was part of Spencer’s original bid. Bonar testified Spencer had taken the position\nwith Harris it was willing to negotiate using the $870,000 delay claim without going\nthrough a recalculation, because the number would have been much bigger. Bonar\nacknowledged the expert Spencer hired calculated the impact damages as $803,000,\nwhich number he thought Spencer was using “at this point.”\n       On redirect, Bonar testified that Spencer had reduced the dollar figure of its impact\nclaim to $803,000 based on the expert’s analysis, but, in his view, the $870,000 figure\nwas still a good one and his company was out a lot more than that, namely over\n$1.1 million out-of-pocket. When asked if he was only seeking $803,000 for the impact\nclaim, Bonar responded: “We put 870 out there. We stood by the 870. When the expert\ncame back and came up with 803, it’s, again, as I said earlier, relatively close, and it’s a\nmore conservative number, but we’re sticking with that number at this point.” Bonar\ntestified that $870,000 of its approximately $1.4 million stop notice, served on Modesto\nCity Schools in April 2007, constituted Spencer’s impact claim, and in an August 2007\nletter to Pedersdotter, Spencer mentioned its outstanding impact claim of $870,000,\nwhich figure had not differed since December 2006.\n       Anderson, a construction management consultant who testified as an expert\nwitness, conducted a detailed analysis of Spencer’s cost accounting information, which\nwas an independent evaluation of the delay and impact damages. Based on that analysis,\nhe opined Spencer was entitled to delay and impact damages totaling $803,113. In\nconducting his analysis, Anderson prepared a graphic comparing Spencer’s actual costs\nincurred during the course of construction, $8,833,994, to the total payments it had\n\n\n\n                                             10.\n\freceived, $7,721.976, which resulted in an out-of-pocket loss of $1,112,018. This loss\ndoes not include the markup Spencer planned to make on the Project.\n       Anderson also prepared a chart summarizing his analysis of Spencer’s delay and\nimpact costs. He performed his own independent calculation based on Spencer’s\naccounting information to determine what he believed was the reasonable amount due\nSpencer on the Project. The $803,113 figure is comprised of three components:\n(1) $518,232 for labor inefficiency or loss of productivity; (2) $180,127 in delay costs,\nwhich are time-driven costs associated with the project schedule extension; and (3) a 15\npercent markup of $104,754, which percentage is based on the subcontract’s terms and is\nvery standard for the industry.\n       Anderson reached the $518,232 figure by looking at three factors from a\nMechanical Contractors Association of America (MCA) study, namely stacking of trades,\ncrew size inefficiency and ripple effect. Anderson explained that the MCA study\nquantifies the impact in each area as either minor, a 10 percent impact; average, a\n20 percent impact; or severe, a 30 percent impact. Anderson utilized the minor factor in\neach area so he could be as conservative as possible. Totaling the three factors up\nresulted in a 30 percent anticipated inefficiency pursuant to the MCA industry studies he\nutilized based in part on his experience and review of the contemporaneous documents on\nthe Project. Anderson reduced the 30 percent factor to 25 percent total inefficiency, since\nhis goal was to be conservative in his calculations and he believed that represented a\nconservative estimate. Multiplying 25 percent times the estimated total man hours spent\non the Project – 36,240 – results in an inefficiency of 9,060 man hours. He then\nmultiplied the 9,060 man hours by the average pay rate of $57.20 to reach a labor\ninefficiency of $518,232.\n       The delay costs of $180,127 include time driven costs, namely labor costs for the\nproject and assistant project managers and plumbing superintendant, and delay rental\n\n\n\n                                            11.\n\fcosts. To get the contractual markup, Anderson totaled the labor inefficiency and delay\ncosts and multiplied that by 15 percent to get $104,754.\n       Anderson had reviewed Spencer’s December 2006 request for compensation,\nwhich he said was submitted in a format that is not unusual or different than most\nprojects. Anderson would call the request a “change order request, in essence, where\nSpencer is attempting to estimate its cost associated with the delay and impact on the\nproject.” He did not see anything unreasonable or unusual in the request. In Anderson’s\nmind, Bonar’s request was a reasonable estimate of Spencer’s costs associated with the\ndelay and impact on the Project. According to Anderson, the variation between his total\nof $803,000 and Spencer’s $870,000 request was due to Anderson’s methodology.\nAnderson tried to rely as little as possible on estimates and to support the calculations\nbased on actual data. Spencer’s estimate relied on certain rates for certain people based\non Bonar’s judgment, while in preparing his estimate, Anderson extracted and used only\nthose costs he could reasonably support with the cost report document itself. Anderson\nalso believed the rates Bonar used included markup and “things of that nature[,]” whereas\nhis rates were bare rates, with the markup added at bottom line.\n       Spencer’s CEO and owner, William Spencer, also testified that the company lost\nover one million dollars. He believed the company’s delay and disruption claim was\napproximately $806,000. He helped look over the $870,000 figure his company had\npresented to Harris, which was higher than the trial expert’s figure. When asked to\nexplain the difference, he responded that three people could look at anything and get a\ndifferent opinion.\n       Severance of Damage Claims\n       At the outset of the tenth day of trial, May 4, after Spencer had completed its case-\nin-chief and several of Harris’s witnesses had testified, the trial court informed counsel,\noutside the jury’s presence, that it was proposing, on its own motion, to “bifurcate” the\ncase pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1048, subdivision (b) and 592. Trial\n\n                                             12.\n\fwould continue only on the claim for impact or delay damages, and issues concerning\nchange orders, penalties and interest would be arbitrated or tried to a separate jury in the\nfuture. The court believed this was necessary because the trial was moving slower than\nanticipated. It previously had informed the parties that the court would be dark from\nMay 12 to June 2, therefore the jury needed to reach a verdict before Wednesday,\nMay 11.\n       The court further explained it was also concerned as a result of the conference on\nproposed jury instructions and verdicts held after testimony concluded the prior day. The\ncourt did not believe they had usable jury verdicts, despite twice having asked counsel to\nsubmit both jury instructions and verdicts; they were due the first time just before trial\nand the second time by Friday, April 29. Defense counsel, however, did not submit any\ninstructions until about 4 p.m. on May 3, just prior to the conference. The proposed\ninstructions were inadequate to instruct the jury on any issue. Noting that the jurors had\ninvested many days of their lives in this case and were never told the case could extend\ninto June, the court expressed its concern that if the case had to be finished in June, a\nmistrial might result from lost jurors. The court believed that since the delay claim was\nthe major issue in the case, proceeding on that claim may result in a settlement of the\nother claims. The court asked counsel for their thoughts at the noon break.\n       The trial proceeded with the continued testimony of a defense witness. At the\nnoon break, the court allowed counsel to address its proposal. Spencer’s counsel asked\nthe court to consider an alternative to bifurcation, arguing any delay in prosecuting the\ncase was not Spencer’s fault, as it had filed a motion for directed verdict and submitted\nrevised instructions and verdict forms that he believed substantially complied with the\ncourt’s comments. Pedersdotter stated Harris was opposed to bifurcation, pointing out\nthat Harris had less time to present its defense than Spencer had to present its case-in-\nchief. The court stated it was going to bifurcate the case because it was the only way to\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\fhave a chance of finishing, and it would advise the jurors when they returned that the\nonly issue they would hear was delay and impact damages.\n       After the lunch break, but before the jury was brought in, Spencer’s counsel\nrestated Spencer’s objection to bifurcation. The court did not change its mind. Once the\njurors returned, the court explained to the jury it had decided to exercise its discretion\ngranted to it as the trial judge by the Code of Civil Procedure to bifurcate certain issues in\nthe case, so the only issue for the jury to decide in the trial was “whether Harris is legally\nresponsible for some delay or delays to Spencer. That is, delays as far as Spencer is\nconcerned and if so, what damages, if any, Spencer may have sustained.” The court\nfurther explained that no one was responsible for the decision except the court.5\n       Jury Instructions and Verdict\n       After testimony concluded, the jury was instructed on two theories of recovery,\nbreach of contract and common counts, using CACI Nos. 303, 350, and 371. The jury\nalso was given CACI No. 3934, which advised that Spencer sought damages from Harris\nunder more than one legal theory, but each item of damage could be awarded only once,\nregardless of the number of legal theories alleged. The jury also was given special\ninstructions regarding the issues the jury would be deciding and additional findings it\nneeded to make for Spencer to recover delay damages and causation.\n       On May 10, the jury returned a $1,000,000 verdict against Harris on a verdict form\nthat presented only the following question: “As to the issue of delays and impacts\npresented to us, we the jury find in favor of the Plaintiff, F.W. SPENCER & SON, INC.\nand against Defendant, HARRIS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, INC. in the amount of\n$__________.” Polling of the jurors revealed the verdict was 10 to 2.\n\n       5 After trial in this case concluded, the parties settled Spencer’s change order\nclaim. Harris agreed to pay Spencer $188,000 in exchange for a release of all claims\nbetween the parties except Spencer’s delay/impact claim and related interest, judgment\nand attorney fees from this trial.\n\n\n\n                                             14.\n\f       Motion for Prejudgment Interest\n       Two weeks after the jury’s verdict, Spencer filed and served its motion for\n$384,678 in prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3287, subdivision (a) or, in the\nalternative, $341,667 in prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3287, subdivision (b).\nSpencer asserted it was entitled to prejudgment interest from December 21, 2006 to\nMay 2011 under section 3287, subdivision (a), based on the amount it claimed Harris\nowed it for delay and impact damages in Bonar’s December 21, 2006 letter to Harris,\nnamely $870,969.20. Alternatively, Spencer asked the trial court to exercise its\ndiscretion under section 3287, subdivision (b), to award it prejudgment interest on the\njury’s verdict of $1,000,000 from the date the complaint was filed, December 28, 2007,\nto May 2011.\n       Two days later, May 27, Pedersdotter became ineligible to practice law because of\ndisciplinary proceedings unrelated to this case. On May 31, Spencer served on Harris’s\ncorporate offices a notice to appoint attorney pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section\n286,6 asking Harris to appoint another attorney to represent it in this action. On June 15,\nSpencer served on Harris’s corporate offices a second notice to appoint attorney pursuant\nto Code of Civil Procedure, section 286, along with Spencer’s motion for prejudgment\ninterest. Harris failed to file or serve an opposition to the motion for prejudgment\ninterest.\n       The trial court posted a tentative ruling on the motion, but a hearing was not\nrequested. Accordingly, the trial court confirmed the tentative ruling and issued an order\ngranting the motion and awarding prejudgment interest in the amount of $384,678.\n\n       6 Code of Civil Procedure section 286 provides: “When an attorney dies, or is\nremoved or suspended, or ceases to act as such, a party to an action, for whom he was\nacting as attorney, must, before any further proceedings are had against him, be required\nby the adverse party, by written notice, to appoint another attorney, or to appear in\nperson.”\n\n\n\n                                            15.\n\f       On August 9, Harris filed a substitution of attorney, substituting Frank J. Lozoya\nIV in place of Pedersdotter.\n       New Trial Motion\n       As pertinent here, Harris filed a motion for new trial in which it argued a new trial\nshould be granted because the trial court erred in severing the delay and impact damages\nafter Spencer presented its case-in-chief, and then giving erroneous and ambiguous jury\ninstructions that allowed the jury to consider damages other than damages for delay and\nimpact. Harris also requested the court issue a remittitur under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 662.5, subdivision (b), to reduce damages from $1,000,000 to $803,000, as\nSpencer’s witnesses admitted at trial they were seeking to recover only $803,000 in delay\nand impact damages. Finally, Harris asserted the trial court’s order granting prejudgment\ninterest was erroneous in part because Spencer “is not entitled to pre-judgment interest\nuntil such time as the complaint was filed. Civil Code § 3287(b) and Lewis C. Nelson &\nSons, Inc. v. Clovis Unified School Dist. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 64, 72 (Lewis C. Nelson\n& Sons). Throughout pre-trial and trial [Harris] could not determine pre-judgment\ninterest on its contingent unliquidated claim. In addition, under C.C.P. § 662.5(b)[,] the\ncourt should also disallow all prejudgment interest prior to the filing of Spencer’s\ncomplaint.”\n       Spencer opposed the motion. With respect to Harris’s argument regarding\nprejudgment interest, Spencer argued Harris was asking the court to reconsider the\nunopposed motion without satisfying the requirements under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1008 for a motion for reconsideration or justifying its tardiness in appointing\nreplacement counsel, noting that Harris should have raised the argument that interest\nshould have been calculated under section 3287, subdivision (b), in an opposition to the\noriginal motion. In its reply, Harris reiterated its argument that prejudgment interest can\nonly be granted from the filing of the complaint.\n\n\n\n                                            16.\n\f       Following oral argument, the trial court took the matter under submission and\nsubsequently entered a written order denying the new trial motion.\n       Motion for Attorney Fees\n       Spencer subsequently filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to section 1717,\nbased on an attorney fee provision in its subcontract with Harris. As relevant here,\nSpencer sought to recover $562,344.50 in fees incurred by its trial counsel, Flynn\nWilliams, and $15,733 in fees and costs incurred by its prior counsel, McInerney &\nDillon (McInerney). Harris opposed the motion, arguing Flynn Williams’s fees should be\nreduced because it engaged in block billing, Spencer improperly included fees in its\nrequest that the parties had agreed in their settlement of the Change Order Claim Spencer\nwould not recover, and it was impossible to tell from the invoice of McInerney whether\nthat firm’s fees were reasonable.\n       In reply, Spencer argued its fees were reasonable, the fees Spencer had forfeited\nwere not included in its request, and an unredacted copy of McInerney’s invoice, attached\nto a declaration of an attorney from Flynn Williams, showed the fees were reasonable.\nHarris filed an objection to the trial court’s consideration of the unredacted invoice from\nMcInerney.\n       Following oral argument on the motion, the trial court took the matter under\nsubmission. The trial court subsequently issued a written order reducing the fees\nrequested by $20,865. A formal order was entered awarding Spencer $557,212.50 in\nattorney fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                            17.\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n   I. Severance7 and Jury Instructions\n       Harris challenges the trial court’s decision to sever the delay claim from Spencer’s\nother claims. It is within the trial court’s discretion to order severance or bifurcation of\nclaims. (Royal Surplus Lines Inc. Co. v. Ranger Ins. Co. (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 193,\n205.) We review the trial court’s ruling for abuse of that discretion. (Downey Savings &\nLoan Assn. v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1072, 1086.) The trial\ncourt’s “ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion.”\n(Ibid.) Here, the trial court decided to sever the delay claim from Spencer’s other claims\nbecause the case was proceeding slower than anticipated and it wanted to ensure the trial\nwould be completed within the timeframe set out at the beginning of trial. The court\nreasoned it made more sense to proceed solely on the delay claim than the other claims,\nas that claim was the major portion of Spencer’s case and its resolution could lead to a\nlater resolution of the severed claims. These were valid considerations and the court’s\ndecision to sever the claims was well within its discretion.\n       Harris does not contend otherwise. Instead, Harris contends it was prejudiced by\nthe timing of the trial court’s order, made after Spencer had completed its case-in-chief,\nas Harris had no way to deal with Spencer’s opening statement or “now ‘irrelevant’”\nevidence Spencer had already presented to the jury. Harris further asserts it was ordered\nnot to revisit irrelevant facts, issues or testimony, and the severance order prevented it\n\n\n       7 As Spencer points out, while the trial court referred to “bifurcation” in ordering\nseparate trials of the delay claim and the change order claim pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1048, subdivision (b), the effect of the trial court’s order was to sever\nthese claims so separate trials could be held on them. (See, e.g., Bly-Magee v. Budget\nRent-A-Car Corp. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 318, 323 & fn. 5; Wegner, Fairbank, Epstein &\nChernow, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The Rutter Group 2012) ¶ 4:327\nto 4:328, p. 4-81.) Accordingly, we will refer to the court’s ruling as severance rather\nthan bifurcation.\n\n\n\n                                             18.\n\ffrom being able to rebut all of Spencer’s claimed damage evidence, which went\nunopposed for the jury to consider.\n       Harris’s argument, however, is completely devoid of any references to the record.\nHarris does not cite to where in the proceedings it was prevented from producing\nevidence or to facts that show the severance was prejudicial. It also does not cite to the\nevidence it claims it was unable to rebut. Without adequate citations to the record, we\ndeem the argument forfeited. (Duarte v. Chino Community Hosp. (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th\n849, 856; see also Nielsen v. Gibson (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 318, 324 (Nielsen) [“On\nappeal, we must presume the trial court’s judgment is correct. . . . [¶] . . . Thus, an\nappellant must not only present an analysis of the facts and legal authority on each point\nmade, but must also support arguments with appropriate citations to the material facts in\nthe record. If he fails to do so, the argument is forfeited.”].)\n       Moreover, the trial court ameliorated any possible prejudice from the timing of the\nseverance by telling the jury when it first made the decision that the only issue for the\njury to decide was “whether Harris is legally responsible for some delay or delays to\nSpencer. That is, delays as far as Spencer is concerned and if so, what damages, if any,\nSpencer may have sustained.” The court further explained the decision would take\n“certain issues” out of the case, allowing the case to get to the jury in time to finish it by\nthe following Wednesday. While instructing the jury, the trial court gave the following\nspecial instruction: “The only issue[s] that you will be deciding in this trial are the issues\nof delay and any damages that may have been caused by the delay. I have removed\ncertain other issues from this trial, as I have previously explained to you. The claims I\nhave removed will be determined in later court proceedings. Do not speculate about the\nmerits of the removed claims, nor discuss them in your deliberations.” (Special\nInstruction No. 1.)\n       Harris contends this instruction was deficient because it failed to give the jury any\ndirection as to what specific evidence, whether as to liability or damages, that it was not\n\n                                              19.\n\fto consider as a result of the severance. Harris also asserts the instruction was\ninsufficient in light of other instructions given, which it contends were either erroneous,\nlegally incomplete, or ambiguous. Specifically, Harris contends the trial court erred in\ninstructing the jury with (1) CACI No. 371 (Common Counts)8 because delay damages\nare not recoverable under that theory, (2) CACI No. 3934 (Damages on Multiple Legal\nTheories)9 because there was only one legal theory at issue, namely delay damages, and\n(3) CACI No. 303 (Breach of Contract –Essential Factual Elements)10 because it did not\nspecifically limit the type of damages to the delay claim and allowed Spencer to recover\non a “non-delay impact claim, under different set of required elements th[a]n the three\nimpact/delay instructions, and allowed different damages ‘harm.’”11\n\n       8 The jury was instructed with CACI No. 371 as follows: “Spencer claims that\nHarris owes it[] money . . . for labor, equipment, materials and services provided. To\nestablish this claim, Spencer must prove all of the following: One, that Harris requested,\nby words or conduct, that Spencer provide labor, equipment, materials and services for\nthe benefit of Harris. Two, that Spencer provided the labor, equipment, materials and\nservices as requested. Three, that Harris has not paid Spencer for the labor, equipment,\nmaterials and services. Four, the reasonable value of the labor, equipment, materials and\nservices that were provided.”\n       9The jury was instructed with CACI No. 3934 as follows: “Spencer seeks\ndamages from Harris under more than one legal theory. However, each item of damages\nmay be awarded only once, regardless of the number of legal theories.”\n       10 The jury was instructed with CACI No. 303 as follows: “To recover damages\nfrom Harris for breach of contract, Spencer must prove all of the following: That\nSpencer and Harris entered into a contract. That Spencer did all or substantially all of the\nsignificant things that the contract required it to do, or that it was excused from having to\ndo those things[.] [T]hat all conditions required for Harris[’s] performance had\noccurred[.] [T]hat Harris failed to do something that the contract required it to do, and\nthat Spencer was harmed by that failure.”\n       11 In making these arguments, Harris is operating under the misconception that a\nclaim for delay damages constitutes a separate and distinct cause of action from breach of\ncontract or common counts. The term “delay damages,” however, refers to consequential\ndamages recoverable on a breach of contract claim that stem from the defendant’s delay\nin performing its contractual obligations. (See Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. (2002)\n28 Cal.4th 888, 906 [describing “delay damages” as “damages for delay in the\n\n\n                                             20.\n\f       Along with Special Instruction No. 1, Harris also complains about the following\nspecial instructions: (1) an instruction setting forth the findings the jury must make for\nSpencer to recover delay damages from Harris, which incorporates the elements of Public\nContract Code section 7102 (Special Instruction No. 2);12 and (2) an instruction which\nstates that if the jury finds Harris impacted and delayed Spencer’s work on the project, it\nmust determine whether the delay caused Spencer “to incur costs that it would not\notherwise have incurred except for the delay” (Special Instruction No. 3). Harris asserts\nSpecial Instruction No. 2 is incomplete because it does not have a damage element and\nSpecial Instruction No. 3 improperly fails to use the word “unreasonable” with regard to\nimpact or delay, fails to state what damages may be recovered because of the delay, and\nuses the word “costs.”\n       Harris asserts it was substantially prejudiced by the above CACI and special jury\ninstructions because they were vague and ambiguous. Harris explains the “failure to\nclarify” what liability and damages evidence the jury could consider “left a substantial\nand huge ambiguity wherein the jury could (and given the verdict itself – did) speculate\n\ncommencement of the defendant’s performance”]; accord Lambert v. Superior Court\n(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 383, 389 [stating that mechanic’s lien statute “does not permit a\nlien for delay damages,” because “[t]he function of the mechanic’s lien is to secure\nreimbursement for services and materials actually contributed to a construction site, not\nto facilitate recovery of consequential damages”].) Harris does not cite any authority to\nshow that the delay damages sought in this case are not recoverable under the theories of\nbreach of contract or common counts.\n       12 The jury was instructed on this as follows: “In construction contracts involving\npublic agencies, such as the Modesto School District contract, any provision in the\ncontract, or any subcontracts, such as the subcontract between Spencer and Harris,\nprohibiting monetary damages for delay does not bar a subcontractor, such as Spencer,\nfrom recovering for damages for delay from a general contractor, such as Harris[,] . . . [i]f\nSpencer proves the following: One, the delay or delays were not within the contemplation\nof Spencer and Harris when the subcontract was executed. Two, Harris was responsible\nfor the delay or delays. And, three, the delay or delays were unreasonable under the\ncircumstances involved.”\n\n\n\n                                            21.\n\fas to what liability evidence was for impact/delay claims and what evidence was\nnot[,] . . . [and] as to what damages evidence was for delay/impact claims and what\ndamages evidence was not.” Harris claims the “prejudice was obvious and substantial”\ngiven the trial court’s use of a general verdict form that gave no direction to the jury on\nhow to reach its verdict, and the severance coupled with the instructions resulted in a\nverdict that was greater than the delay damages Spencer’s expert admitted at trial were\n$803,000. Harris reasons that, given the instructional errors, the jury was confused and\nimproperly included $197,000 in damages that were not part of Spencer’s delay damages.\n       A claim that the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction is not reviewable on\nappeal where the appellant requested the particular instruction or a substantially similar\none. Under the doctrine of invited error, a party in a civil case may not complain of error\nin instructions that it has requested. (Metcalf v. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th\n1121, 1130-1131; Stevens v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th\n1645, 1653-1655; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Trial, § 316, p. 369.) “The\ninvited error doctrine is based on estoppel. ‘“Where a party by his conduct induces the\ncommission of error, he is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal” on\nappeal.’” (Huffman v. Interstate Brands Corp. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 679, 706\n(Huffman), italics omitted.)\n       Moreover, an appellant may not claim that a jury instruction correct in law was too\ngeneral or incomplete, or lacked clarity, unless it requested an additional or qualifying\ninstruction. (Agarwal v. Johnson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 948-949, disapproved on another\nground in White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 574, fn. 4; Conservatorship of\nGregory (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 514, 520-521.) While under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 647 an appellant need not object to an erroneous instruction for purposes of\nappeal, this “‘automatic exception’ rule” does not apply where the instruction correctly\nstates the law and the complaint is only that it is incomplete or too general. (7 Witkin,\nCal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Trial, § 304, p. 356.) In the absence of any indication\n\n                                             22.\n\fwhich party requested an instruction, we presume it was given at the appellant’s request.\n(Lynch v. Birdwell (1955) 44 Cal.2d 839, 846-847; Morehouse v. Taubman Co. (1970)\n5 Cal.App.3d 548, 559.)\n       Spencer contends that Harris is barred from challenging the CACI instructions on\nappeal because it requested each of these instructions. We agree. The record, augmented\nat Spencer’s request with the instructions proposed by Harris and Spencer, shows that\nHarris proposed the CACI instructions which it now complains were given erroneously.13\nWhile Harris acknowledges it presented these instructions to the court, it argues the\ninvited error doctrine does not apply because the instructions the court ultimately gave\nwere those requested by Spencer, as shown by the jury instruction number at the top of\nthe instructions included in the clerk’s transcript as the “Instructions Given.” This\ncontention is meritless, as the invited error doctrine applies where the party asserting\nerror acquiesces in a particular jury instruction. By proposing the exact same\ninstructional language the court used, Harris acquiesced in the instructions and cannot\ncomplain about them on appeal. (See, e.g., Transport Ins. Co. v. TIG Ins. Co. (2012) 202\nCal.App.4th 984, 1000 [noting “numerous cases have held that a party who requests, or\nacquiesces in, a particular jury instruction cannot appeal the giving of that instruction”].)\n       Harris also contends the error is not invited because it submitted its proposed\ninstructions before the trial court severed the delay claim from the other claims. Harris\nreasons that after the court ordered severance, not all of the instructions would be used,\nand asserts the court did not use Harris’s proposed instructions because Harris withdrew\nthem after the court issued the severance order. There is nothing in the record, however,\n\n\n\n\n       13 While the Common Count instruction Harris proposed was labeled “CACI 373\n(Modified),” the proposed language of that instruction mirrors verbatim the CACI No.\n371 instruction the trial court gave.\n\n\n\n                                             23.\n\fto support the assertion that Harris withdrew its proposed instructions.14 Jury instruction\nconferences were held both before and after the severance order, neither of which were\nreported. It was incumbent on Harris, as the appellant, to provide a record sufficient to\nsupport its claim of error. (Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th\n121, 132.) Without a record of what occurred at the jury instruction conferences, we\ncannot presume that Harris withdrew the instructions. (Faulk v. Soberanes (1961) 56\nCal.2d 466, 471 [Explaining that the appellant “has the burden to present a record\nsufficiently complete to establish that the claimed errors were not invited by her, and in\nthe absence of such a showing she may not properly complain.”].)\n       This leaves the special instructions, which were not included in the packet of\nproposed instructions Harris or Spencer submitted. It is unclear from the record who\ndrafted the special instructions. There is nothing on the special instructions themselves to\nindicate whether they were requested by either party, or whether the trial court proposed\nthem on its own motion. It appears that a modified version of an instruction on delay and\nimpact damages Spencer requested became the third special instruction Harris challenges.\nSince we cannot tell who requested the instructions, we may presume that Harris\nrequested them.\n\n       14 The record does show that after Spencer completed its case-in-chief,\nPedersdotter told the court that, unless there was a dispute about whether a contract\nexisted between the parties, Spencer’s alternative causes of action for quantum meruit\nand common counts could be dismissed, so as not to confuse the jury with three types of\ndamages. Spencer’s counsel responded that would be right if Harris conceded the\ncontract provided the basis for entitlement, but was concerned that the construction\ndoctrine called “Cardinal Change” might apply to make the common counts causes of\naction relevant. However, in light of the evidence, Spencer’s counsel was content to go\nwith the breach of contract cause of action. The court, however, denied the motion at that\npoint, because “they can do whatever they want in that regards,” and advised counsel to\ngive it some thought. The record is silent on whether any subsequent discussion occurred\non this issue or whether Pedersdotter lodged further objections regarding the common\ncounts claim.\n\n\n\n                                            24.\n\f       But even if Harris did not request the instructions, its claim of error fails because\nthere is nothing in the record to show that Harris requested clarification of the\ninstructions. Harris’s complaints about these instructions are not that they incorrectly\nstate the law, but rather that they are incomplete and confusing. As we have already\nstated, Harris contends: Special Instruction No. 1 is deficient because it fails to specify\nthe evidence of liability and damages it could consider after the severance; Special\nInstruction No. 2 is incomplete because it fails to include a damage element; and Special\nInstruction No. 3 fails to use the word “unreasonable” with respect to delay or impact, or\nstate what damages may be recovered, and uses the word “costs.” The substance of\nHarris’s argument is that the jury instructions needed to be clarified because they would\nconfuse the jury. Harris cites absolutely no legal authority to show that any of these\ninstructions contained incorrect statements of the law. It is Harris’s burden to present\nadequate argument and legal authority on each point raised. (People v. Stanley (1995)\n10 Cal.4th 764, 793 (Stanley); Guthrey v. State of California (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th\n1108, 1115 (Guthrey); Muega v. Menocal (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 868, 877 (Muega).)\nAbsent a request for clarification from Harris, which is not apparent on this record, the\nissue is not preserved for review.\n       Finally, Harris also asserts the verdict form contributed to the prejudice from the\nseverance order. Harris contends the court erred in refusing to use a special verdict form.\nAlthough Harris recognizes a special verdict form was not required, it asserts the court\nshould have used one to allow the jury to “fix the proper liability and damages ‘caused’\nby the alleged ‘unreasonable’ delay.”\n       The argument is frivolous. Although in its brief Harris states the court refused to\nuse a special verdict form, there is no indication in the record of any such refusal or that\nHarris objected to the verdict form that ultimately was used. Furthermore, there is no\nsuggestion that Harris proposed a special verdict form – there is not one in the record.\n\n\n\n                                             25.\n\fAnd finally, Harris cites absolutely no law for its proposition that a special verdict form\nwas required under these circumstances.\n   II. Evidentiary Issues\n       Harris raises two evidentiary issues on appeal. Harris contends the trial court\nerroneously applied its order precluding Harris from offering expert testimony when it\nsustained Spencer’s objections to testimony Harris claims was regarding percipient\nevents, thereby resulting “in a broad elimination of evidence under the alleged umbrella\nof ‘expert testimony.’” Harris also contends the trial court erred in ruling in limine that\nSpencer’s experts could testify whether any delay by Harris was reasonable or\nunreasonable.\n       We review a trial court’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of\ndiscretion. (San Lorenzo Valley Community Advocates for Responsible Education v. San\nLorenzo Valley Unified School Dist. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1419.) A trial court\ndoes not abuse its discretion unless it acts in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd\nmanner. (Ibid.)\n       A judgment or order cannot be reversed based on the erroneous admission or\nexclusion of evidence unless the appellant shows that there was a miscarriage of justice.\n(Evid. Code, §§ 353, subd. (b), 354; Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13.) “In civil cases, a\nmiscarriage of justice should be declared only when the reviewing court, after an\nexamination of the entire cause, including the evidence, is of the opinion that it is\nreasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been\nreached in the absence of the error.” (Huffman, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 692.)\n       The burden is on the appellant to establish both an abuse of discretion and a\nmiscarriage of justice. (Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 566.) “‘A\njudgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct. All intendments and\npresumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent, and\nerror must be affirmatively shown. This is not only a general principle of appellate\n\n                                             26.\n\fpractice but an ingredient of the constitutional doctrine of reversible error.’” (Id. at p.\n564.)\n        We begin with the exclusion of expert testimony. Harris does not contend the trial\ncourt erred in its ruling before trial which barred Harris from offering any expert\ntestimony due to its failure to disclose expert witnesses. Instead, Harris asserts the trial\ncourt misapplied the order by excluding percipient witness testimony during trial, thereby\ndepriving it of “offering all the material and relevant testimony regarding what [its] own\npercipient witnesses perceived, did and analyzed as well as what conduct they engaged in\nregarding how the Project was run, what Spencer did, and how [it] dealt with Spencer’s\nsubsequent claim.”\n        In support of its argument, Harris cites cases in which witnesses were permitted to\ntestify regarding their observations and, in some cases, to give an opinion based on those\nobservations. (See People v. Chatman (2006) 38 Cal.4th 344, 374-376 [trial court\nproperly precluded psychologist who administered psychological testing to a prosecution\nwitness to determine her credibility from testifying about the test results and his opinion,\nalthough he was permitted to testify that he administered the tests]; People v. Hinton\n(2006) 37 Cal.4th 839, 889 [noting, without deciding, that police officer’s opinion\ntestimony based on his observations of the defendant’s conduct was admitted properly if\nit was helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony]; People v. McAlpin (1991) 53\nCal.3d 1289, 1308-1309 [lay witnesses could testify regarding their observations of the\ndefendant’s conduct and their opinion based on those personal perceptions]; Manney v.\nHousing Authority of City of Richmond (1947) 79 Cal.App.2d 453, 459-461 [expert\npermitted to testify on cause of fire].) Harris also asserts that where there is a dispute\nbetween parties to a contract regarding the meaning of a contract term, the parties’\nconduct after the execution of the contract is admissible to ascertain their intentions,\nciting Oceanside 84, Ltd. v. Fidelity Federal Bank (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1449-\n1450.\n\n                                              27.\n\f       While Harris argues generally from these cases that the trial court erred in\nexcluding “substantial highly material percipient witness testimony” regarding various\nsubjects, it fails to offer any argument on specific testimony it claims the court\nerroneously excluded. Instead, Harris lists a lengthy string of citations to the reporter’s\ntranscript without explanation or argument.\n       It is an appellant’s burden to establish error through reasoned arguments, not\nconclusory assertions. (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th\n1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned\nargument.”]; cf. Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles\n(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1265 [rejecting argument raised in conclusory fashion].)\nWe need not consider points unsupported by legal analysis or authority. (Badie v. Bank\nof America (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 779, 784–785 (Badie); In re Marriage of Nichols\n(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 661, 672–673, fn. 3.) Nor need we consider points supported by\ncitation to general legal principles or legal authority without application of those\nprinciples or authorities to the case at hand. (Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist.\n(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 691, 699 [“plaintiffs ... cit[e] only general principles governing\n[reconsideration] ... motions without applying those principles to the circumstances\nbefore the court”].) “When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to\nsupport it with reasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived\n[forfeited].” (Badie, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784–785.)\n       Harris fails to meet its appellate burden. Harris cites general principles concerning\nthe admission of lay testimony and opinion, but utterly fails to explain how those\nprinciples apply to the specific testimony it claims the trial court erroneously excluded.\nHarris does not analyze particular questions, objections or rulings. Although Harris lists\napproximately 52 excerpts of testimony from the reporter’s transcript, citing only the\npage and line numbers, it makes no coherent legal argument relevant to any particular\n\n\n\n                                              28.\n\fruling. We thus conclude Harris forfeited its argument regarding the exclusion of\npercipient witness testimony on appeal. (Badie, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784–785.)\n       Harris does not fare much better in its assertion the trial court erroneously allowed\nSpencer’s expert witnesses to render their opinions concerning the reasonableness of\nHarris’s delay. Harris asserts the trial court’s in limine ruling on this issue improperly\npermitted the experts to give opinion testimony on ultimate issues. In support of this\nargument, Harris cites cases which state or apply the legal principle that experts may not\nopine on pure questions of law. (See, e.g., Summers v. A.L. Gilbert Co. (1999)\n69 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1178; Devin v. United Services Auto. Assn. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th\n1149, 1158 fn. 5 [expert could not opine on legal issues such as the interpretation of an\ninsurance policy’s scope or whether an insured reasonably could expect a defense under\nthe policy]; Ferreira v. Workmen’s Comp. Appeals Bd. (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 120, 125-\n126 [physician’s statement in his report that the insurance company should not be held\nliable for the plaintiff’s injury because it was not industrially related was a legal\nconclusion not subject to expert opinion].)\n       Spencer contends we must reject this argument because Harris did not object to\nthe admission of such testimony in the trial court. We agree Harris has forfeited this\nchallenge by failing to make an objection below that satisfies the requirements of\nEvidence Code section 353.15 (SCI Cal. Funeral Services, Inc. v. Five Bridges\nFoundation (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 549, 563-565; see also Duronslet v. Kamps (2012)\n203 Cal.App.4th 717, 725-726.) As Spencer points out, Harris has not presented a single\n\n\n\n       15 Evidence Code section 353 provides in relevant part: “A verdict or finding\nshall not be set aside, nor shall the judgment or decision based thereon be reversed, by\nreason of the erroneous admission of evidence unless: [¶] (a) There appears of record an\nobjection to or a motion to exclude or to strike the evidence that was timely made and so\nstated as to make clear the specific ground of the objection or motion ....”\n\n\n\n                                              29.\n\fcitation to the record showing it objected to the introduction of testimony by Spencer’s\nexpert witnesses.\n       Harris contends it preserved its right to challenge the testimony because it objected\nin argument during an in limine motion, citing the general rule that in certain situations\nan objection made during in limine motions can satisfy the requirements of Evidence\nCode section 353 and thereby preserve appellate review of the issue. (People v. Morris\n(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 189, disapproved on another point by People v. Stansbury (1995)\n9 Cal.4th. 824, 830 fn. 1; Sacramento and San Joaquin Drainage Dist. v. Reed (1963)\n215 Cal.App.2d 60, 67-68.) In the portion of the reporter’s transcript Harris cites to,\nhowever, there is no objection lodged by Harris’s counsel. The court and counsel were\ndiscussing Spencer’s motion to preclude Harris from offering testimony that Spencer\ncould not recover delay damages under the subcontract. While Harris’s counsel argued\nthat Harris should be allowed to present evidence that it relied on the no-damages-for-\ndelay clause, she never objected to, or disagreed with, the court’s statements that an\nexpert could testify regarding whether the delay was “‘reasonable’” or “‘unreasonable,’”\nor that it was for the court to interpret the clause for the jury. Without a specific\nobjection on that ground, the argument is forfeited.\n       The argument also is forfeited because it is conclusory without meaningful legal\nanalysis. Harris cites general principles concerning the limits of expert opinion, but\ncompletely fails to explain how those principles apply to the specific testimony it claims\nthe trial court should not have admitted. Harris does not analyze particular questions,\nobjections or rulings. Although Harris lists approximately 27 excerpts of testimony from\nthe reporter’s transcript, citing only the page and line numbers, it makes no coherent legal\nargument relevant to any particular testimony or ruling. We thus conclude Harris\nforfeited its argument regarding the admission of expert testimony on appeal. (Badie,\nsupra, 67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784–785.)\n\n\n\n                                              30.\n\f       Moreover, even assuming the trial court erroneously excluded or admitted\nevidence, Harris fails to present facts or legal support, or make any reasoned argument, to\nsubstantiate its assertion that it was prejudiced by these purported errors. Accordingly, it\ndid not meet its burden of showing there was a miscarriage of justice resulting from the\ntrial court’s evidentiary rulings.\n   III. Judicial Bias\n\n       Harris contends the trial transcript reveals that the trial judge regarded its trial\ncounsel, Pedersdotter, “in a most negative fashion” and “did not portend to hide or\nminimize its negative and biased feelings” toward her. Harris asserts the judge made\nthese feelings clear to the jury in both his “regular stream of rulings” against Harris and\nhis negative comments, thereby undermining Harris’s position with the jury throughout\nthe trial. Harris cites to five passages from the trial transcript to support its contention\nthat reversal is warranted.\n       On the fourth day of trial, during Pedersdotter’s cross-examination of Bonar, the\njudge suggested she point out the paragraph rather than have Bonar read the entire\nsubcontract; told her how to mark a defense exhibit; advised her to “forget all the chatter\nhere and just ask questions and go on or we’ll be here all day chattering about things”;\nasked if there was “a question in there someplace” as she was making speeches; and\nagain told her to refer to the specific provision in the subcontract she wanted Bonar to\nreview. Thereafter, outside the jury’s presence, Pedersdotter told the judge she felt his\ninstructions to her were excessive, belittling, and undermined her authority in front of the\njurors. The judge said he was not belittling her in front of the jury and explained he was\ntrying to get her to do what she was supposed to do, such as to ask direct questions and\nnot make speeches or chatter, and even when he made suggestions, she did not correct the\nproblems. The judge denied berating her or being mad at her; instead, he was doing his\njob of stopping improper questioning.\n\n\n\n                                              31.\n\f        On the sixth day of trial, a conference was held outside the jury’s presence at\nPedersdotter’s request. Pedersdotter was concerned about the tenor of the judge’s\ncommunications with her and her client versus opposing counsel and his client. She\ncomplained that the judge had openly expressed “tremendous impatience and\nunhappiness” with her; when her client was on the stand that day, the judge interrupted\nhim and “chastised him”; she and her clients were concerned the judge was\ncommunicating something to the jury; the judge was quick to “cite numerous reasons”\nwhy defense exhibits should be kept out in a “greatly unpleasant” way; and she was\nconcerned the totality of these instances, and what she and her client perceived to be the\n“growing animosity” toward Harris, threatened to undermine Harris’s right to a fair trial.\nSpencer’s counsel said he disagreed with everything Pedersdotter said.\n        The judge then asked Harris’s witness, Tim Marsh, whether he thought the court\nwas chastising him when it made a comment to him during his testimony; Marsh\nanswered “No. I’m new with this.” The judge admitted having a difficult time with\nPedersdotter due to her speeches, gratuitous comments, leading of witnesses, and her\ninability to accept the judge’s ruling excluding expert testimony and the instruction to the\njury on the no-damages-for-delay clause, both of which she kept trying to get around.\nPedersdotter responded it was obvious the judge disliked how she conducted herself in\nthe courtroom and she believed his personal feelings were coming out in front of the jury.\nPedersdotter said she would try not to commit more infractions and insisted the judge\nexpress his criticisms and dislike outside the jury’s presence. The judge responded that\nhe had been fair to her and her client, and the transgressions she was talking about were\nhers.\n        At the beginning of trial the following day outside the jury’s presence,\nPedersdotter reargued the effect of the ruling excluding expert testimony. The judge\npointed out she was relying on an overruled case. Pedersdotter said she could cite other\ncases and asked if she could finish. The judge said she could. Pedersdotter responded,\n\n                                             32.\n\f“But you’re shrugging your shoulders and you are exhibiting – as I typically see, you\nannounce your impatience and your lack of interest in whatever I have to say. So\nplease –” The judge interjected, “I find you to be very discourteous, but go ahead. Go\nahead. I’m listening to you.” Pedersdotter complained that the rulings on expert\ntestimony had taken away Harris’s ability to defend itself. She further complained that\nher client was convinced there was a double standard in the case as to the court’s rulings\nand asked how this could be a fair trial. She said “three client persons” who were in the\ncourtroom the previous day all observed that when the judge began to “dress me down in\nfront of them, the jury began laughing.” The judge responded that this was not the first\ntime she had argued this, he was confident of his ruling on the expert witness issue, and\nno further argument was required because he was not going to change his mind.\nPedersdotter moved for a mistrial, which the judge denied.\n       At the lunch break on the tenth day of trial, which the judge set aside to discuss\nwith counsel his proposal to sever Spencer’s case, Pedersdotter explained her opposition\nto the proposal. She then began to reargue the expert testimony issue. The judge\ninterrupted her, stating they were not there to discuss that issue, which had been\ndiscussed at least ten times. When Pedersdotter said she understood that, he told her to\n“be quiet about that.” Pedersdotter continued to argue on the subject; the judge warned\nher, “Counsel, we’re done on that. We’re done. Be quiet. Be quiet. I’ll hold you in\ncontempt. I don’t want to do that. But when I tell you to be quiet, be quiet. We have\nother issues we’ve got to decide. We’re not going to go back to decide every issue that’s\never occurred in this case – ” When Pedersdotter interrupted to ask if she could have “60\nseconds[,]” the judge responded, “Be quiet. I don’t want to hold you in contempt, but I\nwill if you don’t start obeying. You disobeyed every order I’ve given in this case.”\n       Judicial misconduct merits reversal of a civil judgment when it has been shown to\nbe prejudicial as a miscarriage of justice, or intentional and sufficiently heinous to\nwarrant reversal as a punishment or because it reveals bias on the part of the court.\n\n                                             33.\n\f(Mathew Zaheri Corp. v. New Motor Vehicle Bd. (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1314-\n1315.) Harris contends the above passages show the trial court was overly critical of its\ntrial counsel and conveyed that bias to the jury. While these passages, the majority of\nwhich occurred outside the jury’s presence, show the court was exasperated with defense\ncounsel, it appears the genesis of the court’s actions and comments was defense counsel’s\nfailure to follow the court’s rulings and directions. As Spencer points out, the record\nshows the trial court, in acting as it did, was exercising reasonable control over the\npresentation of evidence to provide the orderly conduct of the proceedings. (Code Civ.\nProc., § 128, subd. (a)(3); Evid. Code, § 765.)\n       Harris has not established a miscarriage of justice, intentional or heinous\nmisconduct, or partiality or bias on the part of the trial court. Nor does the record in this\ncase reveal conduct comparable to the criminal cases on which it relies, People v. Brock\n(1967) 66 Cal.2d 645, 649, 655-656 [trial judge instructed jury that, in his opinion, the\ndefendant’s guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt], overruled on another point\nby People v. Cook (1983) 33 Cal.3d 400, 413 fn. 13, People v. Perkins (2003)\n109 Cal.App.4th 1562, 1567 [trial judge’s examination of the defendant was intemperate,\nthe judge acted as though he sided with the People and he prejudicially interfered with\nthe defense], and People v. Flores (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 579, 583-585 [court erred in\nmaking comments to jury, when advised the jury was divided, regarding the evidence, the\ncredibility of witnesses and its convictions as to the defendant’s guilt].\n       Finally, absent exceptional circumstances, comments of the trial judge will not\namount to reversible error, particularly where the jury was admonished to disregard the\ncomment. (Aguayo v. Crompton & Knowles Corp. (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1043;\nMercado v. Hoefler (1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 12, 23-24 [no prejudice from trial judge’s\ncomment during trial that the appellants were partners where the judge admonished the\njury that his statement did not constitute evidence and they were to consider only the\nwitnesses’ testimony, and instructed the jury that it was the sole trier of fact].) Here, the\n\n                                             34.\n\fjudge specifically instructed with CACI No. 5000, which states in part: “You must decide\nwhat the facts are. You must consider all the evidence and then decide what you think\nhappened. You must decide the facts based on the evidence admitted in this trial. . . . [¶]\nIn reaching your verdict, do not guess what I think your verdict should be from\nsomething I may have said or done.” The conduct of the trial judge does not warrant\nreversal.\n   IV. Damages\n       Harris contends the trial court erred by denying Harris’s motion for new trial, or\nalternatively remittitur, on the issue of damages. Harris argues the court should have\ngranted a new trial on damages or issued a remittitur under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 662.5, subdivision (b) reducing the judgment from $1,000,000 to $803,000,\nbecause Spencer “admitted at trial” that its delay and impact damages were $803,000.\nHarris asserts these admissions were made by Spencer’s expert, who quantified the delay\ndamages as $803,000, and its president, Bonar, who testified Spencer was “sticking with”\nthe expert’s figure of $803,000. Without citation to any relevant authority, Harris asserts\nSpencer’s admission that the impact claim was $803,000 is “binding substantial\nevidence” that requires reduction of the judgment to that amount pursuant to Code of\nCivil Procedure section 662.5, subdivision (b).16\n       If a trial court grants a new trial on the ground of excessive damages, it has\ndiscretion to issue an order conditionally granting the new trial unless the party in whose\nfavor the verdict was rendered consents to a reduction of damages. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\n       16  The sole case Harris cites in this section of its opening brief, Horsford v. Board\nof Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, provides no\nguidance on an appeal from a denial of a motion for new trial on excessive damages, as\nHorsford involved an appeal from an order conditionally granting a new trial unless the\nplaintiffs consented to a remittitur of excessive damages; the decision did not address\nappellate review of denials of new trial motions based on excessive damages or whether\ntestimony at trial constitutes a binding admission. (Id. at pp. 372, 379, 386-390.)\n\n\n\n                                             35.\n\f§ 662.5, subd. (a)(2).)17 On a motion for new trial claiming excessive damages or\ninsufficient evidence (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds. 5-6), the trial court sits as an\nindependent trier of fact. (Lane v. Hughes Aircraft Co. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 405, 412.) If\nthe motion is granted, we apply a “highly deferential standard” (id. at p. 409), upholding\nall factual determinations with “the same deference that an appellate court would\nordinarily accord a jury’s factual determinations” (id. at p. 412); pertinent evidentiary\nconflicts place the new trial order “beyond review” (id. at p. 416). A denial of the\nmotion, on the other hand, requires deference to the jury verdict, as in any claim of\ninsufficient evidence. We affirm if any substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, supports the judgment. (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior\nCourt (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 571 (Western States).)\n       In our review of the evidence: “‘[A]ll conflicts must be resolved in favor of the\n[prevailing party], and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the\n[finding] if possible. It is an elementary, but often overlooked principle of law, that when\na [finding] is attacked as being unsupported, the power of the appellate court begins and\nends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, which will support the [finding]. When two or more inferences can be\nreasonably deduced from the facts, the reviewing court is without power to substitute its\ndeductions for those of the trial court.’” (Western States, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 571,\nquoting Crawford v. Southern Pac. Co. (1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429.) The same is true for a\ndamages award; we affirm if the record, viewed most favorably to the award, discloses\n\n       17 In its argument, Harris cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 662.5,\nsubdivision (b), rather than section 662.5, subdivision (a)(2). Section 662.5, subdivision\n(b) provides: “If a deadline for acceptance or rejection of the addition or reduction of\ndamages is not set forth in the conditional order, the deadline is 30 days from the date the\nconditional order is served by the clerk of the court. Failure to respond to the order in\naccordance with this section shall be deemed a rejection of the addition or reduction of\ndamages and a new trial limited to the issue of damages shall be granted automatically.”\n\n\n\n                                             36.\n\fsubstantial evidence to support it. (Fassberg Construction Co. v. Housing Authority of\nCity of Los Angeles (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 720, 746.)\n       This review necessarily places a burden on an appellant: “‘[A] reviewing court\nmust presume that the record contains evidence to support every finding of fact, and an\nappellant who contends that some particular finding is not supported is required to set\nforth in his brief a summary of the material evidence upon that issue. Unless this is done,\nthe error assigned is deemed to be waived. [Citation.] It is incumbent upon appellants to\nstate fully, with transcript references, the evidence which is claimed to be insufficient to\nsupport the findings.’” (In re Marriage of Fink (1979) 25 Cal.3d 877, 887.) A recitation\nof only the appellant’s evidence does not suffice. (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon\n(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 881 (Foreman & Clark Corp.).) An attack on the evidence without\nsuch briefing is entitled to no consideration when it is apparent that a substantial amount\nof evidence was received on a respondent’s behalf. (Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122\nCal.App.4th 1229, 1246.) “It is neither practical nor appropriate for us to comb the\nrecord on [an appellant’s] behalf.” (In re Marriage of Fink, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 888.)\n       Harris attacks the damages award on the basis of the trial testimony of Spencer’s\npresident, expert and CEO regarding the amount of delay damages. Harris asserts\nSpencer is bound by testimony that it was seeking $803,000 in delay damages at trial.\nHarris, however, cites absolutely no legal authority in support of its contention that such\ntrial testimony constitutes what it terms “binding substantial evidence” that requires\nreduction of the damage award from $1 million to $803,000. By failing to cite any legal\nauthority, Harris has not satisfied its appellate burden to present adequate argument and\nlegal authority, and we may summarily reject its claim of error. (Stanley, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 793; Guthrey, supra, 63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1115; Muega, supra,\n50 Cal.App.4th at p. 877.)\n       Moreover, as Spencer points out, the testimony Harris points to does not constitute\nbinding judicial admissions. A “judicial admission” – generally distinguished from an\n\n                                             37.\n\f“evidentiary admission” – is an admission of fact by a party that is treated as a “‘waiver\nof proof,’” in that the admission is taken to establish the fact conclusively. (Valerio v.\nAndrew Youngquist Construction (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1271-1272; see also\nTroche v. Daley (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 403, 409 [a “‘“judicial admission is not merely\nevidence of a fact; it is a conclusive concession of the truth of a matter which has the\neffect of removing it from the issues. . . . ”’”]; Walker v. Dorn (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d\n118, 120.) The testimony to which Harris cites, such as Anderson’s calculation of delay\ndamages at $803,113 and Bonar’s testimony that he calculated delay damages of\n$870,000, are not clear concessions that Spencer was entitled to recover only $803,000.\nInstead, Bonar testified that Spencer’s damages were much greater than the $803,000 in\ndelay damages Anderson calculated and the $870,000 it asked Harris for before filing this\nlawsuit. It is apparent from the trial testimony on damages that Spencer, through its\nwitnesses, was telling the jury that while its damages exceeded $1 million, it was asking\nonly that the jury award the lower figure. In no way was the testimony of Spencer’s\nwitnesses a judicial admission that its delay damages totaled only $803,000.\n       Harris contends that because the $1 million jury award exceeded the amount of\ndelay damages testified to by Bonar ($870,000) and Anderson ($803,000), it necessarily\nincluded an award for the unpaid change orders that were severed from this trial. In\nmaking this argument, Harris essentially is contending the delay damages the jury\nawarded are not supported by substantial evidence. Harris, however, fails to recite all of\nthe material evidence on delay damages, thereby forfeiting review of the purported error.\n(Foreman & Clark Corp., supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 881.)\n       Alternatively, our review of the record shows there was substantial evidence to\nsupport the jury’s award of $1 million for Spencer’s delay and impact damages. As\nSpencer’s counsel explained during closing argument, there were three different ways to\ncalculate the delay damages in the case, all of which had been presented to the jury:\n(1) Anderson’s calculation of $803,113, (2) Bonar’s calculation of $870,000, and\n\n                                             38.\n\f(3) $1,112,018, which is what Anderson calculated Spencer paid out of pocket for labor,\nmaterials and subcontractors, which was exclusive of any markup Spencer planned to\nmake on the Project. There was testimony to support each of these figures. The jury was\ninstructed that if it found Harris “impacted and delayed” Spencer’ s work on the project,\nit was required to determine whether that delay caused Spencer “to incur costs that it\nwould not otherwise have incurred except for the delay.” In deciding the value of the\nadditional costs Spencer incurred due the impacts of Harris’s delays, the jury chose to\naward Spencer $1 million, which is close to the out-of-pocket loss of $1,112,018 less the\n$120,787 Bonar testified Spencer was owed on the change orders. Harris does not argue\nthat out-of-pocket cost is an incorrect measure of delay damages. Substantial evidence\nsupports the jury’s determination that Spencer’s delay damages, without regard to the\nchange order claim, were $1 million.\n       It is true, as Harris points out, that an appellate court may reverse an award of\ndamages “[w]hen the award, as a matter of law appears excessive, or where the recovery\nis so grossly disproportionate as to raise a presumption that it is the result of passion or\nprejudice, . . . ” (Cunningham v. Simpson (1969) 1 Cal.3d 301, 308-309.) Here, the\naward was not excessive or disproportionate to the claimed delay damages, and therefore\ndoes not raise a presumption the award resulted from passion or prejudice. (Little v.\nStuyvesant Life Ins. Co. (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 451, 465-466.)\n   V. Prejudgment Interest\n       In granting Spencer’s post-trial motion for prejudgment interest, the trial court\nawarded Spencer prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3287, subdivision (a), which\nprovides, in pertinent part: “A person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or\ncapable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in\nthe person upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that\nday . . .”. Prejudgment interest is allowable under section 3287, subdivision (a), “‘where\nthe amount due plaintiff is fixed by the terms of the contract, or is readily ascertainable\n\n                                             39.\n\fby reference to well-established market values. [Citations.] On the other hand, interest is\nnot allowable where the amount of the damages depends upon a judicial determination\nbased on conflicting evidence.’” (Great Western Drywall, Inc. v. Roel Construction Co.,\nInc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 761, 767.) Prejudgment interest is an element of\ncompensatory damages, which compensates the injured party for loss of use of the money\nduring the prejudgment period. (Id. at pp. 767-768.)\n       Although Harris did not file an opposition to Spencer’s motion, it raised the\npropriety of the award under this subdivision in its motion for a new trial, which the trial\ncourt denied. On appeal, Harris contends the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment\ninterest under this subdivision because Spencer’s delay damages both were uncertain and\nincapable of being made certain by calculation.\n       We first address Spencer’s contention that Harris does not have “standing” to\ncontest the ruling because it did not oppose the motion or seek reconsideration. Without\ncitation to authority, Spencer contends Harris “forfeited and waived” its opportunity to\ncontest the award of prejudgment interest. We disagree, as Harris raised the issue of the\namount of the award in its motion for a new trial. Since prejudgment interest is an\nelement of damages and may be sought as part of a motion for new trial on the ground of\ninadequate damages, it follows the award of prejudgment interest may be challenged in a\nmotion for new trial on the ground of excessive damages. (See North Oakland Medical\nClinic v. Rogers (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 824, 830; Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. 5.) That\nis precisely what Harris requested in its new trial motion, namely reduction of the\nprejudgment interest previously awarded.\n       Whether section 3287, subdivision (a) applies to a particular action is a question of\nlaw that we review de novo. (Utility Audit Co., Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2003)\n112 Cal.App.4th 950, 956.) However, where the facts are in dispute as to whether\ndamages are “liquidated” so as to entitle a party to prejudgment interest under that\nsection, we review the court’s determination under the substantial evidence standard of\n\n                                             40.\n\freview. (SFPP v. Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 452,\n462.)\n        Here, Spencer sought prejudgment interest under section 3287, subdivision (a) on\nthe ground that its delay and impact costs were certain or capable of being made certain\nby calculation when Spencer submitted to Harris its claim for payment in the amount of\n$870,969.20 on December 21, 2006. In granting the motion based on subdivision (a), the\ntrial court impliedly agreed. This implied finding, however, is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\n        “‘The test for recovery of prejudgment interest under [Civil Code] section 3287,\nsubdivision (a) is whether defendant actually know[s] the amount owed or from\nreasonably available information could the defendant have computed that amount.\n[Citation.]’ [Citations.] ‘The statute [Civil Code section 3287] does not authorize\nprejudgment interest where the amount of damage, as opposed to the determination of\nliability, “depends upon a judicial determination based upon conflicting evidence and is\nnot ascertainable from truthful data supplied by the claimant to his debtor.” [Citations.]’\n[Citation.] Thus, where the amount of damages cannot be resolved except by verdict or\njudgment, prejudgment interest is not appropriate.” (Wisper Corp. v. Cal. Commerce\nBank (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 948, 960 (Wisper Corp.).)\n        The evidence in this case shows that the delay damages claimed in Bonar’s\nDecember 2006 letter were an estimate, and the damages were uncertain and incapable of\nbeing made certain within the meaning of section 3287, subdivision (a). Bonar testified\nthat he sent Harris the December 21, 2006 letter to update Harris on Spencer’s estimated\ncosts incurred due to the delays. When asked how he arrived at his first estimate of delay\ncosts in June 2006, Bonar explained that how he came up with the number was not an\n“exact science”; he took the hourly cost for certain managers and a superintendent, along\nwith fixed costs, and extended them out 120 days, and then used an “efficiency factor[,]”\nto reach a very conservative number. In determining the December 2006 number, Bonar\n\n                                            41.\n\fstarted with the June 2006 estimate, changed the number of workers to reflect what\nactually happened and added punch list items.\n       Bonar admitted the December 2006 number was an estimate, explaining that it is\n“very, very difficult in a time extension claim or impact claim to determine exactly the\nnumber of extra hours that you spent. It’s virtually impossible.” Bonar further explained\nthe calculation was based on an estimate of the impact of the time and the access of the\nout-of-sequence work. It was not based on the number of hours spent on the project, as\nthis “was not a total cost claim.”\n       Spencer’s expert, Anderson, testified he believed Bonar’s December 2006 claim\nwas “reasonable and adequate for the purposes of setting forth their damages.” He also\nbelieved the number was an estimate. Anderson explained it fell within seven percent of\nhis calculations and “[i]f you sat four other experts down here in this seat, they would\nhave four different other numbers. You’re not going to come to the same number.”\n       Thus the testimony of Bonar and Anderson establishes that the December 2006\ndelay damage figure was an estimate, it was “virtually impossible” to quantify the extra\nhours upon which the figure was based, and no two people would come up with the same\nfigure. The letter itself shows the uncertainty of the amount claimed, as it states it is an\nestimate which was based on a “conservative method,” Bonar encouraged Harris to call\nto discuss rather than to demand it to pay a sum certain, and the figure was not fixed, as\nBonar stated Spencer had incurred costs due to “lack of flow” and “efficiency factors,”\nwhich would follow.\n       Where damages cannot be ascertained by calculation, prejudgment interest may\nnot be awarded under section 3287, subdivision (a). (MacIsaac & Menke Co. v. Cardox\nCorp. (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 661, 673 (MacIsaac).) MacIsaac is instructive. There, a\nsubcontractor was not paid for extra work it performed on a project pursuant to an oral\nmodification of the original subcontract. (Id. at pp. 664-665.) After finding that the\ncontractor was liable to the subcontractor for the extra work, the trial court awarded the\n\n                                             42.\n\fsubcontractor the reasonable cost of the work actually performed under the existing\ncircumstances and conditions. (Id. at p. 671.) The trial court ultimately determined the\nsubcontractor was not entitled to prejudgment interest on the unpaid amount. (Id. at\np. 672.)\n        The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that the additional work was not performed\nunder normal conditions, as there were delays, changes and deviations that substantially\nincreased the cost of performance and were not subject to computation. (MacIsaac,\nsupra, 193 Cal.App.2d at p. 673.) The appellate court further explained the extent to\nwhich the delays and interruptions added to the cost of the work could only be\nascertained by a judicial determination, arrived at from a consideration of all the\nconditions under which the work was done. (Id. at p. 673.) Since the amount of damages\nawarded did not represent what the work would have cost under normal conditions, the\ncost of the work could not be ascertained by computation and rendered section 3287,\nsubdivision (a) inapplicable. (Id. at p. 673.) Similarly, in Macomber v. State of\nCalifornia (1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 391, where the plaintiff was entitled only to the\nreasonable value of the extra work performed, before trial the value was based only on\nthe plaintiff’s estimate, and the details of the cost breakdown could only be determined\nafter cross-examination, prejudgment interest was improper because damages could only\nbe ascertained by the trial court after consideration of conflicting evidence. (Id. at p.\n401.)\n        Here, the evidence showed that the delay damages Spencer claimed in Bonar’s\nDecember 2006 letter could not be ascertained by computation as they were based on\nestimates the accuracy of which was “virtually impossible” to determine. Spencer\ncontends the delay damages were capable of being made certain because the letter\nsupplied the data necessary for Harris to determine the amount due, citing Maurice L.\nBein, Inc. v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 670\n(Bein). In Bein, a general contractor who had contracted with the Housing Authority to\n\n                                             43.\n\fbuild a low-rent housing complex sued for damages arising from a delay caused by the\nHousing Authority. (Bein, supra, 157 Cal.App.2d at pp. 674-675, 678.) The Court of\nAppeal held the contractor was entitled to prejudgment interest because, from the\ninception of its claim for damages, it had supplied the Housing Authority with detailed\nstatements of the data necessary to determine the amount due and the Housing Authority\nnever actually denied the damages claimed. (Id. at pp. 686-687.)\n       In contrast to Bein, in this case Spencer did not supply Harris with invoices from\nwhich it could calculate the delay damages. Instead, it submitted Bonar’s estimation of\nits delay damages, which he admitted was not an “exact science” and it was “virtually\nimpossible” to determine the extra hours since the claim was not a total cost claim.\nSpencer asserts Harris did not dispute its calculation of the delay damages because it did\nnot present any testimony rebutting Bonar’s and Anderson’s computations. Harris,\nhowever, did urge the jury in its closing statement to reject both Anderson’s calculation\nas unreliable and Bonar’s estimate as Harris was never provided backup to substantiate\nthe amount claimed in the December 2006 letter. Spencer does not point to any invoices\nor other documents it submitted to Harris from which Harris could itself determine by\ncalculation the delay damages. For that reason, Spencer’s reliance on Bien is misplaced.\n       The policy underlying the requirement for prejudgment interest “is that in\nsituations where the defendant could have timely paid that amount and has thus deprived\nthe plaintiff of the economic benefit of those funds, the defendant should therefore\ncompensate with appropriate interest.” (Wisper Corp., supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at p. 962.)\nThis is not such a case. Spencer did not present a clear and unequivocal statement of\ndamages and Spencer’s own expert tested that no two experts would come to the same\nvaluation as his. Given these facts, we conclude that the court erred in determining that\nSpencer’s damages were certain or capable of being made certain prior to the jury’s\ndetermination. The trial court should have granted a new trial on the issue of\nprejudgment interest.\n\n                                            44.\n\f       The issue, then, is the remedy. In moving for prejudgment interest in the trial\ncourt, Spencer alternatively requested the court exercise its discretion to award\nprejudgment interest under section 3287, subdivision (b), which provides “[e]very person\nwho is entitled under any judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in\ncontract where the claim was unliquidated, may also recover interest thereon from a date\nprior to the entry of judgment as the court may, in its discretion, fix, but in no event\nearlier than the date the action was filed.” Subdivision (b) creates “a limited exception to\nthe prevailing general rule that prejudgment interest is not allowed on unliquidated\nobligations.” (Lewis C. Nelson & Sons, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 69.) By its terms,\nsubdivision (b) “was designed to allow trial courts flexibility in circumstances . . . where\nthe exact amount of damage is in dispute.” (A & M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp. (1982)\n135 Cal.App.3d 473, 496.) Spencer asked the court to award prejudgment interest under\nthis subdivision on the one million dollar jury verdict from the date the complaint was\nfiled to May 2011.\n       Harris contends Spencer is barred from recovering prejudgment interest under\nsubdivision (b) because the trial court specifically denied Spencer’s request for\nprejudgment interest under subdivision (b) in its order granting the motion under\nsubdivision (a). The record, however, does not support this assertion, as the court’s\nminute order does not specify under what subdivision the motion was granted and its\nwritten order, while stating that Spencer’s “motion for an order awarding it prejudgment\ninterest is granted in the amount of $384,678[,]” does not state that it denied, or would\nhave denied, the motion under subdivision (b).\n       Spencer contends the trial court could have awarded $341,667 in prejudgment\ninterest under subdivision (b), calculated on the jury’s verdict from the date of complaint.\nSignificantly, in moving for a new trial on prejudgment interest, Harris did not argue that\nprejudgment interest should not be awarded at all. Instead, Harris argued, citing\nsubdivision (b) and Lewis C. Nelson & Sons, that Spencer only was entitled to\n\n                                             45.\n\fprejudgment interest from the date the complaint was filed, as the damages were\nunliquidated. Harris presented no argument below, and makes none in its opening brief\non appeal, that Spencer should not be awarded prejudgment interest under subdivision\n(b). While Harris makes a passing statement in its reply brief that there is no basis to\naward interest, it presents no argument and cites no authority in support of this assertion.\nSince Harris essentially conceded that the trial court should award prejudgment interest\nunder subdivision (b), we will order the prejudgment interest in the judgment be reduced\nfrom $384,678 to $341,667.\n   VI. Attorney Fees\n       Harris challenges the amount of attorney fees the trial court awarded. Specifically,\nHarris asserts the trial court (1) was required to reduce the fees of Spencer’s attorneys,\nFlynn Williams, because the majority of their bills contained block billing, (2) should\nhave stricken fees requested from September 13 to November 9 based on the parties’\nsettlement agreement regarding the change order claims, and (3) should have disallowed\nfees for Spencer’s prior counsel, McInerney, because their time records were incomplete\nand not supported by a declaration.\n       The standard of review of an award of attorney fees after trial is abuse of\ndiscretion. (Connerly v. State Personnel Bd. (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1169, 1175.) The trial\njudge is considered the best assessor of the value of professional services in his or her\ncourt. (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 148.) As a\nresult, the decision will not be disturbed unless it is shown that it is clearly wrong or is\ninconsistent with applicable legal principles. (Ibid.) “In challenging attorney fees as\nexcessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging\nparty to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to\nthe evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or\nunrelated do not suffice.” (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins.\nGuarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)\n\n                                              46.\n\f       An appellate court will reverse an award of attorney fees as excessive only where\nthere has been a manifest abuse of discretion. (EnPalm, LCC v. Teitler Family Trust\n(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.) Reasonable attorney fees authorized by contract shall\nbe awarded to the prevailing party as “fixed by the court,” giving the trial court broad\ndiscretion to determine the amount considered reasonable, governed by equitable\nprinciples. (Ibid.) The pleadings, pretrial motions, and other evidence of actual work\nperformed by Spencer’s attorneys are before the court, and upon this evidence, the court\nalone has the discretion to set the fee award. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d\n618, 624.)\n       In some instances, an award of attorney fees may be made solely on the basis of\nthe experience and knowledge of the trial judge without the need to consider any\nevidence. (Fed-Mart Corp. v. Pell Enterprises, Inc. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 215, 226.)\nMoreover, it is well established detailed billing records are not required to affirm an\nattorney fees award. “In California, an attorney need not submit contemporaneous time\nrecords in order to recover attorney fees .... Testimony of an attorney as to the number of\nhours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney\nfees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Martino v. Denevi (1986)\n182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559; see also Steiny & Co., Inc. v. California Electric Supply Co.\n(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.)\n       We begin with the block billing. Many of the billing statements from the law firm\nFlynn Williams that Spencer submitted as part of its supporting evidence were in block or\ndaily billing format. If an attorney performed multiple tasks on the case on a single day,\nthe billing statement lists the tasks performed and the total time spent by the attorney on\nall legal services performed on that day, but does not specify the time spent on each task.\nAccording to Harris’s expert, David A. Robinson, Esq., whose declaration it submitted in\nopposition to the attorney fees motion, block billing accounted for 88 percent of the time\nentries.\n\n                                            47.\n\f       Harris contends block billing is “improper” because it “obscure[s] the nature of the\nwork claimed,” and asserts that where an attorney’s bill is dominated by block billing,\ntrial courts will apply a 10 to 30 percent reduction to the entire bill. Harris argues\nreduction of the Flynn Williams fees was mandated here because the time records were\n“woefully inadequate” due to the block billing and the failure to record time records in\nanything less than .2 of an hour. Harris urges us not to give deference to the trial court’s\nruling due to its failure to account for the block billing in the attorney fees award, and\nasks us to reverse the award and remand the matter to the trial court to rule on the\nreasonableness of the block billing.\n       As one appellate court has explained, block billing “is not objectionable ‘per se,’\nthough it certainly does increase the risk that the trial court, in a reasonable exercise of its\ndiscretion, will discount a fee request.” (Jaramillo v. County of Orange (2011) 200\nCal.App.4th 811, 830 (Jaramillo).) “Blockbilling is particularly problematic in cases\nwhere there is a need to separate out work that qualifies for compensation under\n[Government Code] section 1021.5 from work that doesn’t. (See Bell v. Vista Unified\nSchool Dist. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 689 (Bell) [blockbilling made it ‘virtually\nimpossible’ to separate out compensable Brown Act violation work from other work].)”\n(Jaramillo, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at p. 830.) In Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America\n(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, the appellate court upheld the reasonableness of a fee award\nsupported in part by block billed entries, explaining that the trial court was in a position\nto determine whether the tasks described in the statements reasonably required the total\namount of time billed each month. (Id. at pp. 102-103.)\n       Harris cites no California case or statutory authority prohibiting block billing. The\ncases it does cite are either ones where, like Bell, block billing rendered it impossible to\napportion attorney fees between claims on which attorney fees could or could not be\nawarded, or in which the appellate court found no abuse of discretion in reducing fees\ndue to block billing. (See Track Mortgage Group, Inc. v. Crusader Ins. Co. (2002)\n\n                                              48.\n\f98 Cal.App.4th 857, 867-868 [finding no abuse of discretion in trial court’s reduction of\nattorney fees where, due to the attorney’s billing system, it was nearly impossible to\nsegregate fees between claim upon which attorney fees was recoverable and claims on\nwhich fees were not]; ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020\n[after appellate court determined defendants were entitled to recover attorney fees and\ncosts in moving to strike some, but not all, of the plaintiff’s claims, it noted that on\nremand, it was defendants’ burden to produce records sufficient to provide a basis for\ndetermining how much time was spent on particular claims and the court properly could\nreduce compensation for any failure to maintain appropriate time records]; Lahiri v.\nUniversal Music and Video Distribution Corp. (9th Cir. 2010) 606 F.3d 1216, 1222-1223\n[trial court did not abuse its discretion in reducing block billed fees by 30 percent].)\n       Here, unlike Bell and the other cases upon which Harris relies, there was no need\nto separate out covered from uncovered work. While trial courts retain discretion to\npenalize block billing when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are\ncompensable and which are not (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165\nCal.App.4th 1315, 1324–1325; Bell, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 689), the trial court\nidentified no such problem here. Moreover, whatever form of billing is used, the\nquestion is whether the billing provides the trial court with a reasonable basis for\nawarding attorney fees. In this case, the trial court did reduce the Flynn Williams bills by\n$20,865 where redactions “failed to provide the [c]ourt with a reasonable basis for\nevaluating certain claimed fees[,]” and otherwise had no difficulty with Spencer’s\nattorneys’ billings. We find no abuse of discretion in failing to further reduce the bills\ndue to block billing.\n\n\n\n\n                                              49.\n\f       Harris next contends the trial court improperly awarded Spencer $4,964 in fees for\nthe period of September 13 through November 3.18 As Spencer has explained, both\nbelow and on appeal, these fees were not included in the total fees it sought. In a\ndeclaration, Spencer’s attorney states that when his office generated the total fees, its\naccounting database excluded any fees accrued between September 13 through\nNovember 3, and while one of the invoices submitted in support of the motion contains\nunredacted fee entries on November 1, 2 and 3, these fees were not included in the total\nfees Spencer sought to recover. In reply, Harris asserts the trial court erred because it did\nnot indicate the fees were stricken in its order. The trial court, however, awarded Spencer\nthe fees it requested, less reductions for redacted work, which Spencer verified did not\ninclude the prohibited fees. Since the trial court’s award did not include the prohibited\nfees, it was not necessary for the trial court to state in its order that they were stricken.\n       Finally, Harris contends the trial court should have stricken the fees of Spencer’s\nprior counsel, McInerney, because it was impossible to figure out what work was done\nfrom the invoice submitted in support of the motion and the fees were not supported by a\ndeclaration from a McInerney attorney. In its motion, Spencer requested $15,733 in fees\nand costs for work performed by McInerney. In support, it submitted a declaration from\nWilliam J. McGahan, who performed work on the case, in which he stated that true and\ncorrect copies of the McInerney attorney billing ledger containing the fees and costs\nMcInerney incurred in representing Spencer were attached to the declaration, and\nexplained that client bills were generated after time spent on all matters was entered into\nthe computer and summarized on the ledger. McGahan further stated that “[t]he\n\n       18 Although Harris uses November 9, 2011 in its appellate briefs, both Harris and\nSpencer agree on appeal that, in settling the change order claim, Spencer released its\nclaim for attorney fees between September 13, 2011 and November 3, 2011, and\ntherefore the November 9 date that appears on one version of the settlement agreement is\nincorrect.\n\n\n\n                                              50.\n\fdescriptive matter in the billing ledger has been redacted but will be made available\nwithout the redactions for the Court’s in camera review, if necessary.” The attached\nbilling ledger shows that 57.60 hours were billed totaling $14,740. Spencer also\nsubmitted an expert witness declaration from an attorney who reviewed McInerney’s\nattorney fee billing ledger and opined the fees were reasonable under the circumstances.\n       In opposing the motion, Harris objected to the McInerney fees because the tasks\nperformed were redacted from the ledger. In reply, Spencer submitted a declaration from\nFlynn Williams attorney Sloan C. Bailey, who stated that a true and correct unredacted\ncopy of McInerney’s invoice was attached as an exhibit, which reflected total attorney\nfees of $14,740. The unredacted invoice, however, is not attached to Bailey’s declaration\nin the clerk’s transcript and it does not appear to be included there, as neither party points\nus to where it is located in the 12,585 page clerk’s transcript and we could not locate it.\n       Harris filed an objection to the invoice on the grounds that it was presented too\nlate and lacked a declaration from a McInerney attorney authenticating it. At oral\nargument on the motion, Harris’s attorney again objected to the original McInerney bill\nas unreasonable, and the new bill submitted with the reply as untimely and\nunaccompanied by a declaration authenticating it. In response, Spencer’s attorney stated\nthe bill was not new, as it had been submitted several times with Spencer’s papers, and\nthe hours and fees had always been available for opposing counsel’s analysis. Spencer’s\nattorney admitted that Bailey would not have personal knowledge of the work that\nappeared on McInerney’s bill, but Bailey knew the bill was the same one McGahan had\ndeclared under oath was accurate.\n       As appellant, Harris bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating error.\n(Winograd v. American Broadcasting Co. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 624, 631-632; Ketchum\nv. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1140 (Ketchum).) Harris failed to include in the record\nthe McInerney invoice submitted with Bailey’s reply declaration that purportedly details\nthe work McInerney performed. While Harris contends McInerney’s invoices did not\n\n                                             51.\n\fprovide sufficient detail for the trial court to determine whether the fees claimed were\nreasonable, we presume the invoice submitted with the reply brief provided the necessary\ndetail. On at least two occasions, our Supreme Court has articulated this principle, which\nis particularly applicable here: “‘It is the burden of the party challenging the fee award on\nappeal to provide an adequate record to assess error. [Citations.] Here, [Harris] should\nhave augmented the record with [the missing document]. [Citations.] Because [it] failed\nto furnish an adequate record of the attorney fee proceedings, [Harris’s] claim must be\nresolved against [it].’” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp. 1140–1141; Maria P. v. Riles\n(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1295–1296.)\n       Harris complains that the McInerney invoice was not authenticated. Harris,\nhowever, cites no authority to show that Bailey could not authenticate the unredacted\ninvoice as being the same redacted invoice McInerney attorney McGahan previously\nauthenticated. Therefore, Harris has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in\nadmitting the unredacted invoice and relying upon it to determine the reasonableness of\nthe requested fees. (Nielsen, supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 324; Badie, supra,\n67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784–785.)\n       In sum, Harris has not shown that the trial court erred in its award of attorney fees\nto Spencer.\n\n\n\n\n                                             52.\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n      The judgment against Harris is modified to reduce the award of prejudgment\ninterest from $384,678 to $341,667. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Costs on\nappeal are awarded to Spencer.\n\n\n\n                                                            _____________________\n                                                                  Gomes, Acting P.J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\nFranson, J.\n\n\n _____________________\nPeña, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         53.\n\f",

(Harris) appeals a judgment awarding one\nmillion dollars to F.W. Spencer & Son, Inc. (Spencer) in this action to recover delay\ndamages based on breach of contract and common counts. Harris contends the jury\nverdict in Spencer’s favor resulted from the trial court’s errors in (1) severing Spencer’s\n\fdamage claims for trial after Spencer completed its case-in-chief, (2) allowing jury\ninstructions and a verdict form on legal theories not before the jury that served only to\nconfuse the jurors, (3) excluding percipient testimony from Harris’s witnesses on the\nground it constituted expert testimony and allowing Spencer’s experts to testify on the\nreasonableness of any delay, (4) exhibiting bias against Harris’s trial counsel in front of\nthe jury, and (5) denying Harris’s new trial motion on the issue of excessive damages.\nHarris further contends the trial court erred in awarding Spencer prejudgment interest\nunder Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a)1 and in failing to reduce the amount of\nattorney fees awarded to Spencer.\n       We find no merit in Harris’s arguments as to the jury’s verdict and to the award of\nattorney fees. We do, however, find the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment\ninterest under section 3287, subdivision (a). Since Harris conceded below that\nprejudgment interest was awardable under section 3287, subdivision (b), the alternative\nground on which Spencer sought prejudgment interest, we will reduce the prejudgment\ninterest accordingly. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment and post-judgment\norder awarding attorney fees.\n                                           FACTS\n       In 2004, the Modesto City Schools entered into a $79,197,000 contract with\nHarris, a general contractor, for the construction of James C. Enochs High School (the\nProject). In June 2004, Harris entered into a subcontract with Spencer, a mechanical\ncontractor, to perform the plumbing and HVAC work on the Project for $7,545,000. The\nscope of Spencer’s work included furnishing and installing a wet chemical fire\nsuppression system, plumbing, heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and a direct\ndigital control and energy management system. The work was to be completed in\n\n\n       1   Subsequent statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\faccordance with the “Harris Baseline Schedule[,]” which Spencer assumed gave it\n“reasonable time to install work in a reasonable manner with a reasonable flow.”\n      The Project originally was scheduled to finish on April 24, 2006. As the Project\nprogressed, the baseline schedule changed a number of times for a variety of reasons,\nincluding weather and design issues. In June 2005, Harris notified Spencer that the\nProject owner had granted a non-compensable time extension on the Project from April\n2006 to June 24, 2006, as the “exceptionally bad” winter weather had a definite impact\non the schedule progress. Spencer signed a change order agreeing to the time extension\nwithout additional compensation.\n      Spencer claimed Harris caused numerous problems on the site with supervision,\ncoordination of the various trades, weatherization, and access issues. When Spencer\nagreed to accept the no cost change order in 2005, Spencer informed Harris of its\nconcerns regarding Harris’s management of the project and the financial impact to\nSpencer should the schedule continue to change. In response, Harris agreed to address\nfinancial impacts as they materialized. In February 2006, Spencer’s president, Bruce\nBonar, wrote Harris, expressing concerns that the schedule was continuing to slip.\n      In May 2006, Bonar wrote Harris with an estimated cost of the impact the delays\nwere having on Spencer. Bonar estimated the project would be at least 120 days late and,\non that basis, believed Spencer would incur additional costs of $626,847, which included\nextension costs for the project manager, assistant project manager and plumbing\nsuperintendant, and rental costs and home office overhead, as well as an efficiency factor\ndue to the extension/delay. Bonar also advised Harris that Spencer had incurred costs\ndue to lack of flow and efficiency factors which had not yet been quantified.\n      Most of the buildings in the Project were not substantially completed until\nDecember 2006. The entire Project was completed on April 20, 2007, with a notice of\ncompletion submitted on May 17, 2007.\n\n\n\n                                            3.\n\f       On December 21, 2006, Bonar wrote Harris with an update of the additional costs\nSpencer incurred due to the delays in construction. At that time, Spencer still was\nworking on the Project. Bonar estimated the delay and impact costs Spencer incurred\ntotaled $870,969.20. Harris did not pay the claim.\n       This Lawsuit\n       Spencer filed this lawsuit against Harris in December 2007. The complaint\nalleged causes of action for breach of contract, common counts, quantum meruit and to\ncollect on a payment bond. In its breach of contract cause of action, Spencer alleged\nHarris breached the subcontract by failing and refusing to pay Spencer the value of\nvarious items of work performed and materials Spencer supplied under the subcontract,\nor for changes to the work, including delays, impacts and constructive changes. Damages\nwere alleged to include additional direct and indirect expenses, additional costs as a result\nof Harris’s retention of funds, and amounts due under the subcontract, in a sum exceeding\n$850,000 plus interest and attorney fees. In its common counts cause of action, Spencer\nsought to recover the reasonable value of the labor, equipment, materials and services it\nprovided on the project, which it alleged exceeded $850,000.\n       In a hearing held on September 24, 2010, the trial court granted Spencer’s motion\nto exclude the expert opinion of any witness offered by Harris, as Harris did not disclose\nits expert witnesses after being served with a demand for exchange of expert witnesses.\nAlso at that hearing, the trial court found that Harris’s trial counsel, Deb C. Pedersdotter,\nhad lied to and misled the court in every statement she had made about the disclosure of\nexpert witnesses. Accordingly, the court decided to send a transcript of the hearing, as\nwell as a transcript of the August 24, 2010 hearing at which the statements were made, to\nthe State Bar for further investigation.2\n\n       2August 24, 2010 was to have been the first day of the jury trial. Pedersdotter\ninformed the court she had been involved in a traffic accident at the end of July 2010,\nwhich led to her experiencing “some problems.” The trial was continued so Spencer\n\n\n                                              4.\n\f       Motions in Limine\n       A jury trial commenced on April 19, 2011.3 In pretrial proceedings, the trial court\nmade several in limine rulings. Based on the trial court’s earlier order precluding Harris\nfrom offering expert testimony, Spencer filed motion in limine number one to bar Harris\nfrom introducing testimony in support of its defenses that are matters only within the\nknowledge of experts. Harris filed a written opposition, asserting the motion should be\ndenied and the trial court’s prior order applied “as appropriate to the evidence in fact\noffered at trial.” At the hearing, Pedersdotter explained that while she agreed Harris did\nnot have a designated expert witness, percipient witnesses, such as Harris’s president,\nshould be able to testify, for example, regarding what was wrong with a claim from a\ncontractor’s perspective. The trial court explained its earlier ruling: “Any testimony that\nyou would have had to designate an expert on and did not, you are barred. That’s the\nextent of my ruling.” Pedersdotter agreed that was “acceptable.” The court warned that\nthe ruling was “very broad” and she would be barred from having her witness testify\nabout the matters she was just talking about.\n       Pedersdotter responded that the president would not be testifying as an expert;\ninstead, he would be testifying regarding his evaluation of the claim as Harris’s president.\nPedersdotter explained: “If he can’t say how he evaluated the claim, I mean, that’s\npercipient testimony about what happened during the course of construction and during\nthe evaluation of this claim. It’s not expert testimony. It’s not something that we ever\nwould have designated somebody for. He has to explain what Harris did and why it was\nreasonable.” The court answered that it would not rule on “every little bit,” but, “to make\n\n\n\ncould file a motion to bar Harris from offering expert testimony. Pedersdotter was to\nprovide the court with medical reports from her two doctors within a week.\n       3   Subsequent references to dates are to dates in 2011 unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n                                              5.\n\fit plain[,] [i]f I consider it as something you would have had to designate an expert on,\nthey’re not going to testify about it.”\n       Spencer’s motion in limine number three sought to exclude the testimony of any\nHarris personnel regarding the reasonableness of Spencer’s bid estimate as Harris’s\nperson most knowledgeable was not qualified as an expert on the reasonableness of bid\nestimates and Harris was barred from introducing expert testimony. In opposing the\nmotion, Pedersdotter argued that a blanket prohibition of any witness testimony\nconcerning Spencer’s bid would be improper and pointed out that should Spencer object\nto the qualifications of any witness Harris might offer, it must challenge those\nqualifications through the “appropriate process.” In addressing this motion at the pretrial\nhearing, Pedersdotter told the court Harris was not talking about expert testimony, but\nabout “percipient testimony as to what the bids were.” The court responded that it had\nnot found “a percipient testimony exception in the expert disclosure rules.” The court\nstated that percipient witnesses can testify on factual matters, but not expert ones.\nPedersdotter asserted Harris’s witnesses only were going to testify that Harris received a\nset number of bids, what the bids were and that they called Spencer because its bid was\nlow. The court responded that was okay, but the witnesses could not testify the bid\nshould have been higher, and as long as they did not do that, Harris would be fine, “but\nother than that, they cannot give expert opinions, and that would take an expert opinion.”\nThe court stated that the witnesses could testify about factual, “layperson kind of stuff.”\n       Spencer’s motion in limine number five sought to preclude Harris from presenting\ntestimony that delay damages Spencer incurred were not recoverable under the\nsubcontract, which provides that Spencer’s sole remedy should Harris delay, interfere\nwith, disrupt or hinder Spencer’s work is an extension of time to complete work and\nunder no circumstances would Harris be liable to pay Spencer compensation or damages\nfor delay. Spencer asserted in its in limine motion that this “no damages for delay”\nprovision is unenforceable in public works projects under Public Contracts Code\n\n                                             6.\n\fsection 7102, which allows for the recovery of delay damages by a subcontractor where\nthe contractee is responsible for the delay, and the delay is unreasonable under the\ncircumstances and not within the parties’ contemplation. Based on this provision,\nSpencer argued Harris should be barred from arguing or offering testimony that delay\ndamages were not recoverable pursuant to the subcontract.\n       In discussing this motion at the pretrial hearing, the court stated that an expert\ncould testify as to whether the delay was reasonable or unreasonable, but a witness could\nnot interpret the clause itself. In opposing the motion, Pedersdotter argued Harris should\nbe able to testify about the no-damages-for-delay clause because that was the basis for the\nparties’ actions. Pedersdotter agreed that the court ultimately would determine the\ninterpretation or application of the clause, but that would be done best with the facts\nintroduced. The court responded that no one would be interpreting the clause for the jury\nexcept itself, but an expert could testify regarding the terms “reasonable” and\n“unreasonable.” The court, however, recognized that they would “have to cross it when\nwe get there, because, you, know, I can’t make every ruling that possibly will come up in\nthe trial right now.” The court asked counsel not to go into this area at trial until it ruled\non the issue, and when it got to that point, counsel could come to the side bar and it\nwould rule at that point. Pedersdotter put the court and counsel on notice that she\nplanned to have Harris’s president, who oversaw the “claims process,” testify about this\nsubject matter. The court responded that if she was going to go into that during opening\nstatement, she could talk in terms of delay, but it did not want her to go into the contract\nterm itself. The court clarified that a witness could testify that he relied on that paragraph\nin the contract, but the witness could not interpret the provision.\n       Harris’s Opening Statement\n       During her opening statement, Pedersdotter asserted that Spencer had developed\nan attitude on the Project that if something went wrong, they should be compensated for\nit, which was not a “contract-supported approach” to the Project. Pedersdotter pointed\n\n                                              7.\n\fout that the subcontract provided that “[i]f you are delayed in the performance of the\nwork, we will compensate you by giving you additional time to perform. But we are not\ngoing to give you any money.” Spencer’s counsel objected based on the discussion\nduring in limine motions about contract interpretation. The court overruled the objection.\n       After the opening statements concluded, the court explained, outside the jury’s\npresence, that it overruled the objection because it had ruled in the in limine motions that\nno witness was going to interpret the no-damages-for-delay clause. The court read Public\nContract Code section 7102 and stated that because the issue was raised in opening\nstatement, he would have to instruct the jury about this code section. Spencer’s counsel\nhad given the court such a proposed instruction, but the court did not think it was\ncomplete. Accordingly, the court asked Spencer’s counsel to rewrite the instruction and\nprovide it to the court in the morning; if the court did not like the instruction, it would\nsimply read the code section to the jury. The court also invited Pedersdotter to write an\ninstruction if she so desired.\n       At the outset of trial the following day, the court explained to the jury that it had\nheard about a no-damages-for-delay clause in the subcontract; it was the court’s duty to\ninterpret contract language for the jury; and therefore, the court would instruct them on\nthe contract clause in question, which had to be read in conjunction with Public Contract\nCode section 7102. The court read the following: “Under California law, a no damages\nfor delay clause in a contract on a public works project will not bar a contractor from\nrecovering damages for delay where the parties sought to be charged for the delay was\n[sic] responsible for the delay, and where the delay is unreasonable, under the\ncircumstances. And where the delay was not within the contemplation of the parties at\nthe time the parties entered into the contract in question.”4 The record is silent regarding\n\n       4The court’s instruction was not the same as the one Spencer proposed, which\nread: “Under California law, a ‘no damages for delay’ clause in a contract on a public\nworks project will not bar a contractor from recovering damages for delay where the\n\n\n                                              8.\n\fwhether one or both parties prepared this instruction, whether any party objected to it, or\nwhether the court itself prepared it.\n       Evidence on Damages\n       By its lawsuit, Spencer sought to recover the amount Harris owed it for undisputed\nbut unpaid change orders, along with prompt payment penalties (the change order claim),\nas well as delay and impact damages, including inefficiency costs, extra costs and extra\noverhead, incurred on the Project (the delay claim). In its trial brief, Spencer itemized its\ndamages on the change order claim to include $120,210 for unpaid change orders and\n$112,997 for penalties, and its damages on the delay claim at $803,113.\n       As pertinent to this appeal, three of Spencer’s witnesses testified about the delay\nand impact damages, namely Bonar, Spencer’s CEO William Spencer, and expert witness\nChristopher Anderson. Bonar testified he notified Harris in December 2006 that Spencer\nhad incurred an estimated $870,969 in delay costs. This was comprised of extension\ncosts for the project manager, assistant project manager and plumbing superintendent;\nrental charges; four months of home office overhead; an efficiency factor for six\nadditional plumbers and six additional sheet metal workers on site; and additional costs\nfor responding to punch lists.\n       According to Bonar, Spencer was “out of pocket” almost $1.1 million, meaning\nthey spent much more on material, labor and equipment than they were paid. That\nnumber did not include overhead or profit. Bonar testified the amount owed on the\nchange orders totaled $120,787, and his calculation of the impact claim was around\n$860,000. Bonar confirmed, however, that this was not the precise amount Spencer was\nseeking at trial, as Spencer’s expert came up with a different number. Spencer’s loss was\nmuch bigger.\n\n\ndelay is unreasonable under the circumstances and not within the contemplation of the\nparties.”\n\n\n\n                                             9.\n\f       On cross-examination, Bonar testified the amount of money he believed Spencer\nwas entitled to be paid by Harris in connection with all the claims in the lawsuit, not\nincluding attorney fees and interest, was $1,232,000. That number reflected what\nSpencer lost on the job, $1.1 million, plus the 12 percent markup for overhead and profit\nthat was part of Spencer’s original bid. Bonar testified Spencer had taken the position\nwith Harris it was willing to negotiate using the $870,000 delay claim without going\nthrough a recalculation, because the number would have been much bigger. Bonar\nacknowledged the expert Spencer hired calculated the impact damages as $803,000,\nwhich number he thought Spencer was using “at this point.”\n       On redirect, Bonar testified that Spencer had reduced the dollar figure of its impact\nclaim to $803,000 based on the expert’s analysis, but, in his view, the $870,000 figure\nwas still a good one and his company was out a lot more than that, namely over\n$1.1 million out-of-pocket. When asked if he was only seeking $803,000 for the impact\nclaim, Bonar responded: “We put 870 out there. We stood by the 870. When the expert\ncame back and came up with 803, it’s, again, as I said earlier, relatively close, and it’s a\nmore conservative number, but we’re sticking with that number at this point.” Bonar\ntestified that $870,000 of its approximately $1.4 million stop notice, served on Modesto\nCity Schools in April 2007, constituted Spencer’s impact claim, and in an August 2007\nletter to Pedersdotter, Spencer mentioned its outstanding impact claim of $870,000,\nwhich figure had not differed since December 2006.\n       Anderson, a construction management consultant who testified as an expert\nwitness, conducted a detailed analysis of Spencer’s cost accounting information, which\nwas an independent evaluation of the delay and impact damages. Based on that analysis,\nhe opined Spencer was entitled to delay and impact damages totaling $803,113. In\nconducting his analysis, Anderson prepared a graphic comparing Spencer’s actual costs\nincurred during the course of construction, $8,833,994, to the total payments it had\n\n\n\n                                             10.\n\freceived, $7,721.976, which resulted in an out-of-pocket loss of $1,112,018. This loss\ndoes not include the markup Spencer planned to make on the Project.\n       Anderson also prepared a chart summarizing his analysis of Spencer’s delay and\nimpact costs. He performed his own independent calculation based on Spencer’s\naccounting information to determine what he believed was the reasonable amount due\nSpencer on the Project. The $803,113 figure is comprised of three components:\n(1) $518,232 for labor inefficiency or loss of productivity; (2) $180,127 in delay costs,\nwhich are time-driven costs associated with the project schedule extension; and (3) a 15\npercent markup of $104,754, which percentage is based on the subcontract’s terms and is\nvery standard for the industry.\n       Anderson reached the $518,232 figure by looking at three factors from a\nMechanical Contractors Association of America (MCA) study, namely stacking of trades,\ncrew size inefficiency and ripple effect. Anderson explained that the MCA study\nquantifies the impact in each area as either minor, a 10 percent impact; average, a\n20 percent impact; or severe, a 30 percent impact. Anderson utilized the minor factor in\neach area so he could be as conservative as possible. Totaling the three factors up\nresulted in a 30 percent anticipated inefficiency pursuant to the MCA industry studies he\nutilized based in part on his experience and review of the contemporaneous documents on\nthe Project. Anderson reduced the 30 percent factor to 25 percent total inefficiency, since\nhis goal was to be conservative in his calculations and he believed that represented a\nconservative estimate. Multiplying 25 percent times the estimated total man hours spent\non the Project – 36,240 – results in an inefficiency of 9,060 man hours. He then\nmultiplied the 9,060 man hours by the average pay rate of $57.20 to reach a labor\ninefficiency of $518,232.\n       The delay costs of $180,127 include time driven costs, namely labor costs for the\nproject and assistant project managers and plumbing superintendant, and delay rental\n\n\n\n                                            11.\n\fcosts. To get the contractual markup, Anderson totaled the labor inefficiency and delay\ncosts and multiplied that by 15 percent to get $104,754.\n       Anderson had reviewed Spencer’s December 2006 request for compensation,\nwhich he said was submitted in a format that is not unusual or different than most\nprojects. Anderson would call the request a “change order request, in essence, where\nSpencer is attempting to estimate its cost associated with the delay and impact on the\nproject.” He did not see anything unreasonable or unusual in the request. In Anderson’s\nmind, Bonar’s request was a reasonable estimate of Spencer’s costs associated with the\ndelay and impact on the Project. According to Anderson, the variation between his total\nof $803,000 and Spencer’s $870,000 request was due to Anderson’s methodology.\nAnderson tried to rely as little as possible on estimates and to support the calculations\nbased on actual data. Spencer’s estimate relied on certain rates for certain people based\non Bonar’s judgment, while in preparing his estimate, Anderson extracted and used only\nthose costs he could reasonably support with the cost report document itself. Anderson\nalso believed the rates Bonar used included markup and “things of that nature[,]” whereas\nhis rates were bare rates, with the markup added at bottom line.\n       Spencer’s CEO and owner, William Spencer, also testified that the company lost\nover one million dollars. He believed the company’s delay and disruption claim was\napproximately $806,000. He helped look over the $870,000 figure his company had\npresented to Harris, which was higher than the trial expert’s figure. When asked to\nexplain the difference, he responded that three people could look at anything and get a\ndifferent opinion.\n       Severance of Damage Claims\n       At the outset of the tenth day of trial, May 4, after Spencer had completed its case-\nin-chief and several of Harris’s witnesses had testified, the trial court informed counsel,\noutside the jury’s presence, that it was proposing, on its own motion, to “bifurcate” the\ncase pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1048, subdivision (b) and 592. Trial\n\n                                             12.\n\fwould continue only on the claim for impact or delay damages, and issues concerning\nchange orders, penalties and interest would be arbitrated or tried to a separate jury in the\nfuture. The court believed this was necessary because the trial was moving slower than\nanticipated. It previously had informed the parties that the court would be dark from\nMay 12 to June 2, therefore the jury needed to reach a verdict before Wednesday,\nMay 11.\n       The court further explained it was also concerned as a result of the conference on\nproposed jury instructions and verdicts held after testimony concluded the prior day. The\ncourt did not believe they had usable jury verdicts, despite twice having asked counsel to\nsubmit both jury instructions and verdicts; they were due the first time just before trial\nand the second time by Friday, April 29. Defense counsel, however, did not submit any\ninstructions until about 4 p.m. on May 3, just prior to the conference. The proposed\ninstructions were inadequate to instruct the jury on any issue. Noting that the jurors had\ninvested many days of their lives in this case and were never told the case could extend\ninto June, the court expressed its concern that if the case had to be finished in June, a\nmistrial might result from lost jurors. The court believed that since the delay claim was\nthe major issue in the case, proceeding on that claim may result in a settlement of the\nother claims. The court asked counsel for their thoughts at the noon break.\n       The trial proceeded with the continued testimony of a defense witness. At the\nnoon break, the court allowed counsel to address its proposal. Spencer’s counsel asked\nthe court to consider an alternative to bifurcation, arguing any delay in prosecuting the\ncase was not Spencer’s fault, as it had filed a motion for directed verdict and submitted\nrevised instructions and verdict forms that he believed substantially complied with the\ncourt’s comments. Pedersdotter stated Harris was opposed to bifurcation, pointing out\nthat Harris had less time to present its defense than Spencer had to present its case-in-\nchief. The court stated it was going to bifurcate the case because it was the only way to\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\fhave a chance of finishing, and it would advise the jurors when they returned that the\nonly issue they would hear was delay and impact damages.\n       After the lunch break, but before the jury was brought in, Spencer’s counsel\nrestated Spencer’s objection to bifurcation. The court did not change its mind. Once the\njurors returned, the court explained to the jury it had decided to exercise its discretion\ngranted to it as the trial judge by the Code of Civil Procedure to bifurcate certain issues in\nthe case, so the only issue for the jury to decide in the trial was “whether Harris is legally\nresponsible for some delay or delays to Spencer. That is, delays as far as Spencer is\nconcerned and if so, what damages, if any, Spencer may have sustained.” The court\nfurther explained that no one was responsible for the decision except the court.5\n       Jury Instructions and Verdict\n       After testimony concluded, the jury was instructed on two theories of recovery,\nbreach of contract and common counts, using CACI Nos. 303, 350, and 371. The jury\nalso was given CACI No. 3934, which advised that Spencer sought damages from Harris\nunder more than one legal theory, but each item of damage could be awarded only once,\nregardless of the number of legal theories alleged. The jury also was given special\ninstructions regarding the issues the jury would be deciding and additional findings it\nneeded to make for Spencer to recover delay damages and causation.\n       On May 10, the jury returned a $1,000,000 verdict against Harris on a verdict form\nthat presented only the following question: “As to the issue of delays and impacts\npresented to us, we the jury find in favor of the Plaintiff, F.W. SPENCER & SON, INC.\nand against Defendant, HARRIS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, INC. in the amount of\n$__________.” Polling of the jurors revealed the verdict was 10 to 2.\n\n       5 After trial in this case concluded, the parties settled Spencer’s change order\nclaim. Harris agreed to pay Spencer $188,000 in exchange for a release of all claims\nbetween the parties except Spencer’s delay/impact claim and related interest, judgment\nand attorney fees from this trial.\n\n\n\n                                             14.\n\f       Motion for Prejudgment Interest\n       Two weeks after the jury’s verdict, Spencer filed and served its motion for\n$384,678 in prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3287, subdivision (a) or, in the\nalternative, $341,667 in prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3287, subdivision (b).\nSpencer asserted it was entitled to prejudgment interest from December 21, 2006 to\nMay 2011 under section 3287, subdivision (a), based on the amount it claimed Harris\nowed it for delay and impact damages in Bonar’s December 21, 2006 letter to Harris,\nnamely $870,969.20. Alternatively, Spencer asked the trial court to exercise its\ndiscretion under section 3287, subdivision (b), to award it prejudgment interest on the\njury’s verdict of $1,000,000 from the date the complaint was filed, December 28, 2007,\nto May 2011.\n       Two days later, May 27, Pedersdotter became ineligible to practice law because of\ndisciplinary proceedings unrelated to this case. On May 31, Spencer served on Harris’s\ncorporate offices a notice to appoint attorney pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section\n286,6 asking Harris to appoint another attorney to represent it in this action. On June 15,\nSpencer served on Harris’s corporate offices a second notice to appoint attorney pursuant\nto Code of Civil Procedure, section 286, along with Spencer’s motion for prejudgment\ninterest. Harris failed to file or serve an opposition to the motion for prejudgment\ninterest.\n       The trial court posted a tentative ruling on the motion, but a hearing was not\nrequested. Accordingly, the trial court confirmed the tentative ruling and issued an order\ngranting the motion and awarding prejudgment interest in the amount of $384,678.\n\n       6 Code of Civil Procedure section 286 provides: “When an attorney dies, or is\nremoved or suspended, or ceases to act as such, a party to an action, for whom he was\nacting as attorney, must, before any further proceedings are had against him, be required\nby the adverse party, by written notice, to appoint another attorney, or to appear in\nperson.”\n\n\n\n                                            15.\n\f       On August 9, Harris filed a substitution of attorney, substituting Frank J. Lozoya\nIV in place of Pedersdotter.\n       New Trial Motion\n       As pertinent here, Harris filed a motion for new trial in which it argued a new trial\nshould be granted because the trial court erred in severing the delay and impact damages\nafter Spencer presented its case-in-chief, and then giving erroneous and ambiguous jury\ninstructions that allowed the jury to consider damages other than damages for delay and\nimpact. Harris also requested the court issue a remittitur under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 662.5, subdivision (b), to reduce damages from $1,000,000 to $803,000, as\nSpencer’s witnesses admitted at trial they were seeking to recover only $803,000 in delay\nand impact damages. Finally, Harris asserted the trial court’s order granting prejudgment\ninterest was erroneous in part because Spencer “is not entitled to pre-judgment interest\nuntil such time as the complaint was filed. Civil Code § 3287(b) and Lewis C. Nelson &\nSons, Inc. v. Clovis Unified School Dist. (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256222\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256222/lewis-c-nelson-sons-inc-v-clovis-unified-sch-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Throughout pre-trial and trial [Harris] could not determine pre-judgment\ninterest on its contingent unliquidated claim. In addition, under C.C.P. § 662.5(b)[,] the\ncourt should also disallow all prejudgment interest prior to the filing of Spencer’s\ncomplaint.”\n       Spencer opposed the motion. With respect to Harris’s argument regarding\nprejudgment interest, Spencer argued Harris was asking the court to reconsider the\nunopposed motion without satisfying the requirements under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1008 for a motion for reconsideration or justifying its tardiness in appointing\nreplacement counsel, noting that Harris should have raised the argument that interest\nshould have been calculated under section 3287, subdivision (b), in an opposition to the\noriginal motion. In its reply, Harris reiterated its argument that prejudgment interest can\nonly be granted from the filing of the complaint.\n\n\n\n                                            16.\n\f       Following oral argument, the trial court took the matter under submission and\nsubsequently entered a written order denying the new trial motion.\n       Motion for Attorney Fees\n       Spencer subsequently filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to section 1717,\nbased on an attorney fee provision in its subcontract with Harris. As relevant here,\nSpencer sought to recover $562,344.50 in fees incurred by its trial counsel, Flynn\nWilliams, and $15,733 in fees and costs incurred by its prior counsel, McInerney &\nDillon (McInerney). Harris opposed the motion, arguing Flynn Williams’s fees should be\nreduced because it engaged in block billing, Spencer improperly included fees in its\nrequest that the parties had agreed in their settlement of the Change Order Claim Spencer\nwould not recover, and it was impossible to tell from the invoice of McInerney whether\nthat firm’s fees were reasonable.\n       In reply, Spencer argued its fees were reasonable, the fees Spencer had forfeited\nwere not included in its request, and an unredacted copy of McInerney’s invoice, attached\nto a declaration of an attorney from Flynn Williams, showed the fees were reasonable.\nHarris filed an objection to the trial court’s consideration of the unredacted invoice from\nMcInerney.\n       Following oral argument on the motion, the trial court took the matter under\nsubmission. The trial court subsequently issued a written order reducing the fees\nrequested by $20,865. A formal order was entered awarding Spencer $557,212.50 in\nattorney fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                            17.\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n   I. Severance7 and Jury Instructions\n       Harris challenges the trial court’s decision to sever the delay claim from Spencer’s\nother claims. It is within the trial court’s discretion to order severance or bifurcation of\nclaims. (Royal Surplus Lines Inc. Co. v. Ranger Ins. Co.

We review the trial court’s ruling for abuse of that discretion. (Downey Savings &\nLoan Assn. v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co.

Here, the trial court decided to sever the delay claim from Spencer’s other claims\nbecause the case was proceeding slower than anticipated and it wanted to ensure the trial\nwould be completed within the timeframe set out at the beginning of trial. The court\nreasoned it made more sense to proceed solely on the delay claim than the other claims,\nas that claim was the major portion of Spencer’s case and its resolution could lead to a\nlater resolution of the severed claims. These were valid considerations and the court’s\ndecision to sever the claims was well within its discretion.\n       Harris does not contend otherwise. Instead, Harris contends it was prejudiced by\nthe timing of the trial court’s order, made after Spencer had completed its case-in-chief,\nas Harris had no way to deal with Spencer’s opening statement or “now ‘irrelevant’”\nevidence Spencer had already presented to the jury. Harris further asserts it was ordered\nnot to revisit irrelevant facts, issues or testimony, and the severance order prevented it\n\n\n       7 As Spencer points out, while the trial court referred to “bifurcation” in ordering\nseparate trials of the delay claim and the change order claim pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1048, subdivision (b), the effect of the trial court’s order was to sever\nthese claims so separate trials could be held on them. (See, e.g., Bly-Magee v. Budget\nRent-A-Car Corp. (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Accordingly, we will refer to the court’s ruling as severance rather\nthan bifurcation.\n\n\n\n                                             18.\n\ffrom being able to rebut all of Spencer’s claimed damage evidence, which went\nunopposed for the jury to consider.\n       Harris’s argument, however, is completely devoid of any references to the record.\nHarris does not cite to where in the proceedings it was prevented from producing\nevidence or to facts that show the severance was prejudicial. It also does not cite to the\nevidence it claims it was unable to rebut. Without adequate citations to the record, we\ndeem the argument forfeited. (Duarte v. Chino Community Hosp.

If he fails to do so, the argument is forfeited.”].)\n       Moreover, the trial court ameliorated any possible prejudice from the timing of the\nseverance by telling the jury when it first made the decision that the only issue for the\njury to decide was “whether Harris is legally responsible for some delay or delays to\nSpencer. That is, delays as far as Spencer is concerned and if so, what damages, if any,\nSpencer may have sustained.” The court further explained the decision would take\n“certain issues” out of the case, allowing the case to get to the jury in time to finish it by\nthe following Wednesday. While instructing the jury, the trial court gave the following\nspecial instruction: “The only issue[s] that you will be deciding in this trial are the issues\nof delay and any damages that may have been caused by the delay. I have removed\ncertain other issues from this trial, as I have previously explained to you. The claims I\nhave removed will be determined in later court proceedings. Do not speculate about the\nmerits of the removed claims, nor discuss them in your deliberations.” (Special\nInstruction No. 1.)\n       Harris contends this instruction was deficient because it failed to give the jury any\ndirection as to what specific evidence, whether as to liability or damages, that it was not\n\n                                              19.\n\fto consider as a result of the severance. Harris also asserts the instruction was\ninsufficient in light of other instructions given, which it contends were either erroneous,\nlegally incomplete, or ambiguous. Specifically, Harris contends the trial court erred in\ninstructing the jury with (1) CACI No. 371 (Common Counts)8 because delay damages\nare not recoverable under that theory, (2) CACI No. 3934 (Damages on Multiple Legal\nTheories)9 because there was only one legal theory at issue, namely delay damages, and\n(3) CACI No. 303 (Breach of Contract –Essential Factual Elements)10 because it did not\nspecifically limit the type of damages to the delay claim and allowed Spencer to recover\non a “non-delay impact claim, under different set of required elements th[a]n the three\nimpact/delay instructions, and allowed different damages ‘harm.’”11\n\n       8 The jury was instructed with CACI No. 371 as follows: “Spencer claims that\nHarris owes it[] money . . . for labor, equipment, materials and services provided. To\nestablish this claim, Spencer must prove all of the following: One, that Harris requested,\nby words or conduct, that Spencer provide labor, equipment, materials and services for\nthe benefit of Harris. Two, that Spencer provided the labor, equipment, materials and\nservices as requested. Three, that Harris has not paid Spencer for the labor, equipment,\nmaterials and services. Four, the reasonable value of the labor, equipment, materials and\nservices that were provided.”\n       9The jury was instructed with CACI No. 3934 as follows: “Spencer seeks\ndamages from Harris under more than one legal theory. However, each item of damages\nmay be awarded only once, regardless of the number of legal theories.”\n       10 The jury was instructed with CACI No. 303 as follows: “To recover damages\nfrom Harris for breach of contract, Spencer must prove all of the following: That\nSpencer and Harris entered into a contract. That Spencer did all or substantially all of the\nsignificant things that the contract required it to do, or that it was excused from having to\ndo those things[.] [T]hat all conditions required for Harris[’s] performance had\noccurred[.] [T]hat Harris failed to do something that the contract required it to do, and\nthat Spencer was harmed by that failure.”\n       11 In making these arguments, Harris is operating under the misconception that a\nclaim for delay damages constitutes a separate and distinct cause of action from breach of\ncontract or common counts. The term “delay damages,” however, refers to consequential\ndamages recoverable on a breach of contract claim that stem from the defendant’s delay\nin performing its contractual obligations.

Harris reasons that, given the instructional errors, the jury was confused and\nimproperly included $197,000 in damages that were not part of Spencer’s delay damages.\n       A claim that the trial court gave an erroneous jury instruction is not reviewable on\nappeal where the appellant requested the particular instruction or a substantially similar\none. Under the doctrine of invited error, a party in a civil case may not complain of error\nin instructions that it has requested. (Metcalf v.

We agree. The record, augmented\nat Spencer’s request with the instructions proposed by Harris and Spencer, shows that\nHarris proposed the CACI instructions which it now complains were given erroneously.13\nWhile Harris acknowledges it presented these instructions to the court, it argues the\ninvited error doctrine does not apply because the instructions the court ultimately gave\nwere those requested by Spencer, as shown by the jury instruction number at the top of\nthe instructions included in the clerk’s transcript as the “Instructions Given.” This\ncontention is meritless, as the invited error doctrine applies where the party asserting\nerror acquiesces in a particular jury instruction. By proposing the exact same\ninstructional language the court used, Harris acquiesced in the instructions and cannot\ncomplain about them on appeal. (See, e.g., Transport Ins. Co. v. TIG Ins. Co. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1000 [noting “numerous cases have held that a party who requests, or\nacquiesces in, a particular jury instruction cannot appeal the giving of that instruction”].)\n       Harris also contends the error is not invited because it submitted its proposed\ninstructions before the trial court severed the delay claim from the other claims. Harris\nreasons that after the court ordered severance, not all of the instructions would be used,\nand asserts the court did not use Harris’s proposed instructions because Harris withdrew\nthem after the court issued the severance order. There is nothing in the record, however,\n\n\n\n\n       13 While the Common Count instruction Harris proposed was labeled “CACI 373\n(Modified),” the proposed language of that instruction mirrors verbatim the CACI No.\n371 instruction the trial court gave.\n\n\n\n                                             23.\n\fto support the assertion that Harris withdrew its proposed instructions.14 Jury instruction\nconferences were held both before and after the severance order, neither of which were\nreported. It was incumbent on Harris, as the appellant, to provide a record sufficient to\nsupport its claim of error. (Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1428244\"><a href=\"/opinion/1428244/aguilar-v-avis-rent-a-car-system-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132.) Without a record of what occurred at the jury instruction conferences, we\ncannot presume that Harris withdrew the instructions. (Faulk v. Soberanes (1961) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155251\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155251/faulk-v-soberanes/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 471 [Explaining that the appellant “has the burden to present a record\nsufficiently complete to establish that the claimed errors were not invited by her, and in\nthe absence of such a showing she may not properly complain.”].)\n       This leaves the special instructions, which were not included in the packet of\nproposed instructions Harris or Spencer submitted. It is unclear from the record who\ndrafted the special instructions. There is nothing on the special instructions themselves to\nindicate whether they were requested by either party, or whether the trial court proposed\nthem on its own motion. It appears that a modified version of an instruction on delay and\nimpact damages Spencer requested became the third special instruction Harris challenges.\nSince we cannot tell who requested the instructions, we may presume that Harris\nrequested them.\n\n       14 The record does show that after Spencer completed its case-in-chief,\nPedersdotter told the court that, unless there was a dispute about whether a contract\nexisted between the parties, Spencer’s alternative causes of action for quantum meruit\nand common counts could be dismissed, so as not to confuse the jury with three types of\ndamages. Spencer’s counsel responded that would be right if Harris conceded the\ncontract provided the basis for entitlement, but was concerned that the construction\ndoctrine called “Cardinal Change” might apply to make the common counts causes of\naction relevant. However, in light of the evidence, Spencer’s counsel was content to go\nwith the breach of contract cause of action. The court, however, denied the motion at that\npoint, because “they can do whatever they want in that regards,” and advised counsel to\ngive it some thought. The record is silent on whether any subsequent discussion occurred\non this issue or whether Pedersdotter lodged further objections regarding the common\ncounts claim.\n\n\n\n                                            24.\n\f       But even if Harris did not request the instructions, its claim of error fails because\nthere is nothing in the record to show that Harris requested clarification of the\ninstructions. Harris’s complaints about these instructions are not that they incorrectly\nstate the law, but rather that they are incomplete and confusing. As we have already\nstated, Harris contends: Special Instruction No. 1 is deficient because it fails to specify\nthe evidence of liability and damages it could consider after the severance; Special\nInstruction No. 2 is incomplete because it fails to include a damage element; and Special\nInstruction No. 3 fails to use the word “unreasonable” with respect to delay or impact, or\nstate what damages may be recovered, and uses the word “costs.” The substance of\nHarris’s argument is that the jury instructions needed to be clarified because they would\nconfuse the jury. Harris cites absolutely no legal authority to show that any of these\ninstructions contained incorrect statements of the law. It is Harris’s burden to present\nadequate argument and legal authority on each point raised. (People v. Stanley (1995)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1213708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1213708/people-v-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793 (Stanley); Guthrey v.

Harris contends the court erred in refusing to use a special verdict form.\nAlthough Harris recognizes a special verdict form was not required, it asserts the court\nshould have used one to allow the jury to “fix the proper liability and damages ‘caused’\nby the alleged ‘unreasonable’ delay.”\n       The argument is frivolous. Although in its brief Harris states the court refused to\nuse a special verdict form, there is no indication in the record of any such refusal or that\nHarris objected to the verdict form that ultimately was used. Furthermore, there is no\nsuggestion that Harris proposed a special verdict form – there is not one in the record.\n\n\n\n                                             25.\n\fAnd finally, Harris cites absolutely no law for its proposition that a special verdict form\nwas required under these circumstances.\n   II. Evidentiary Issues\n       Harris raises two evidentiary issues on appeal. Harris contends the trial court\nerroneously applied its order precluding Harris from offering expert testimony when it\nsustained Spencer’s objections to testimony Harris claims was regarding percipient\nevents, thereby resulting “in a broad elimination of evidence under the alleged umbrella\nof ‘expert testimony.’” Harris also contends the trial court erred in ruling in limine that\nSpencer’s experts could testify whether any delay by Harris was reasonable or\nunreasonable.\n       We review a trial court’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of\ndiscretion. (San Lorenzo Valley Community Advocates for Responsible Education v. San\nLorenzo Valley Unified School Dist. (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2303503\"><a href=\"/opinion/2303503/slv-care-v-san-lorenzo-valley-unified/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

A trial court\ndoes not abuse its discretion unless it acts in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd\nmanner. (Ibid.)\n       A judgment or order cannot be reversed based on the erroneous admission or\nexclusion of evidence unless the appellant shows that there was a miscarriage of justice.\n(Evid. Code, §§ 353, subd. (b), 354; Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13.) “In civil cases, a\nmiscarriage of justice should be declared only when the reviewing court, after an\nexamination of the entire cause, including the evidence, is of the opinion that it is\nreasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been\nreached in the absence of the error.” (Huffman, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 692.)\n       The burden is on the appellant to establish both an abuse of discretion and a\nmiscarriage of justice. (Denham v. Superior Court (1970) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403311/denham-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566.) “‘A\njudgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.

Harris does not contend the trial\ncourt erred in its ruling before trial which barred Harris from offering any expert\ntestimony due to its failure to disclose expert witnesses. Instead, Harris asserts the trial\ncourt misapplied the order by excluding percipient witness testimony during trial, thereby\ndepriving it of “offering all the material and relevant testimony regarding what [its] own\npercipient witnesses perceived, did and analyzed as well as what conduct they engaged in\nregarding how the Project was run, what Spencer did, and how [it] dealt with Spencer’s\nsubsequent claim.”\n        In support of its argument, Harris cites cases in which witnesses were permitted to\ntestify regarding their observations and, in some cases, to give an opinion based on those\nobservations.

Instead, Harris lists a lengthy string of citations to the reporter’s\ntranscript without explanation or argument.\n       It is an appellant’s burden to establish error through reasoned arguments, not\nconclusory assertions.

Harris cites general principles concerning\nthe admission of lay testimony and opinion, but utterly fails to explain how those\nprinciples apply to the specific testimony it claims the trial court erroneously excluded.\nHarris does not analyze particular questions, objections or rulings. Although Harris lists\napproximately 52 excerpts of testimony from the reporter’s transcript, citing only the\npage and line numbers, it makes no coherent legal argument relevant to any particular\n\n\n\n                                              28.\n\fruling.

Harris asserts the trial court’s in limine ruling on this issue improperly\npermitted the experts to give opinion testimony on ultimate issues. In support of this\nargument, Harris cites cases which state or apply the legal principle that experts may not\nopine on pure questions of law. (See, e.g., Summers v. A.L. Gilbert Co.

In the portion of the reporter’s transcript Harris cites to,\nhowever, there is no objection lodged by Harris’s counsel. The court and counsel were\ndiscussing Spencer’s motion to preclude Harris from offering testimony that Spencer\ncould not recover delay damages under the subcontract. While Harris’s counsel argued\nthat Harris should be allowed to present evidence that it relied on the no-damages-for-\ndelay clause, she never objected to, or disagreed with, the court’s statements that an\nexpert could testify regarding whether the delay was “‘reasonable’” or “‘unreasonable,’”\nor that it was for the court to interpret the clause for the jury. Without a specific\nobjection on that ground, the argument is forfeited.\n       The argument also is forfeited because it is conclusory without meaningful legal\nanalysis. Harris cites general principles concerning the limits of expert opinion, but\ncompletely fails to explain how those principles apply to the specific testimony it claims\nthe trial court should not have admitted. Harris does not analyze particular questions,\nobjections or rulings. Although Harris lists approximately 27 excerpts of testimony from\nthe reporter’s transcript, citing only the page and line numbers, it makes no coherent legal\nargument relevant to any particular testimony or ruling. We thus conclude Harris\nforfeited its argument regarding the admission of expert testimony on appeal. (Badie,\nsupra, 67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784–785.)\n\n\n\n                                              30.\n\f       Moreover, even assuming the trial court erroneously excluded or admitted\nevidence, Harris fails to present facts or legal support, or make any reasoned argument, to\nsubstantiate its assertion that it was prejudiced by these purported errors. Accordingly, it\ndid not meet its burden of showing there was a miscarriage of justice resulting from the\ntrial court’s evidentiary rulings.\n   III. Judicial Bias\n\n       Harris contends the trial transcript reveals that the trial judge regarded its trial\ncounsel, Pedersdotter, “in a most negative fashion” and “did not portend to hide or\nminimize its negative and biased feelings” toward her. Harris asserts the judge made\nthese feelings clear to the jury in both his “regular stream of rulings” against Harris and\nhis negative comments, thereby undermining Harris’s position with the jury throughout\nthe trial. Harris cites to five passages from the trial transcript to support its contention\nthat reversal is warranted.\n       On the fourth day of trial, during Pedersdotter’s cross-examination of Bonar, the\njudge suggested she point out the paragraph rather than have Bonar read the entire\nsubcontract; told her how to mark a defense exhibit; advised her to “forget all the chatter\nhere and just ask questions and go on or we’ll be here all day chattering about things”;\nasked if there was “a question in there someplace” as she was making speeches; and\nagain told her to refer to the specific provision in the subcontract she wanted Bonar to\nreview. Thereafter, outside the jury’s presence, Pedersdotter told the judge she felt his\ninstructions to her were excessive, belittling, and undermined her authority in front of the\njurors. The judge said he was not belittling her in front of the jury and explained he was\ntrying to get her to do what she was supposed to do, such as to ask direct questions and\nnot make speeches or chatter, and even when he made suggestions, she did not correct the\nproblems. The judge denied berating her or being mad at her; instead, he was doing his\njob of stopping improper questioning.\n\n\n\n                                              31.\n\f        On the sixth day of trial, a conference was held outside the jury’s presence at\nPedersdotter’s request. Pedersdotter was concerned about the tenor of the judge’s\ncommunications with her and her client versus opposing counsel and his client. She\ncomplained that the judge had openly expressed “tremendous impatience and\nunhappiness” with her; when her client was on the stand that day, the judge interrupted\nhim and “chastised him”; she and her clients were concerned the judge was\ncommunicating something to the jury; the judge was quick to “cite numerous reasons”\nwhy defense exhibits should be kept out in a “greatly unpleasant” way; and she was\nconcerned the totality of these instances, and what she and her client perceived to be the\n“growing animosity” toward Harris, threatened to undermine Harris’s right to a fair trial.\nSpencer’s counsel said he disagreed with everything Pedersdotter said.\n        The judge then asked Harris’s witness, Tim Marsh, whether he thought the court\nwas chastising him when it made a comment to him during his testimony; Marsh\nanswered “No. I’m new with this.” The judge admitted having a difficult time with\nPedersdotter due to her speeches, gratuitous comments, leading of witnesses, and her\ninability to accept the judge’s ruling excluding expert testimony and the instruction to the\njury on the no-damages-for-delay clause, both of which she kept trying to get around.\nPedersdotter responded it was obvious the judge disliked how she conducted herself in\nthe courtroom and she believed his personal feelings were coming out in front of the jury.\nPedersdotter said she would try not to commit more infractions and insisted the judge\nexpress his criticisms and dislike outside the jury’s presence. The judge responded that\nhe had been fair to her and her client, and the transgressions she was talking about were\nhers.\n        At the beginning of trial the following day outside the jury’s presence,\nPedersdotter reargued the effect of the ruling excluding expert testimony. The judge\npointed out she was relying on an overruled case. Pedersdotter said she could cite other\ncases and asked if she could finish. The judge said she could. Pedersdotter responded,\n\n                                             32.\n\f“But you’re shrugging your shoulders and you are exhibiting – as I typically see, you\nannounce your impatience and your lack of interest in whatever I have to say. So\nplease –” The judge interjected, “I find you to be very discourteous, but go ahead. Go\nahead. I’m listening to you.” Pedersdotter complained that the rulings on expert\ntestimony had taken away Harris’s ability to defend itself. She further complained that\nher client was convinced there was a double standard in the case as to the court’s rulings\nand asked how this could be a fair trial. She said “three client persons” who were in the\ncourtroom the previous day all observed that when the judge began to “dress me down in\nfront of them, the jury began laughing.” The judge responded that this was not the first\ntime she had argued this, he was confident of his ruling on the expert witness issue, and\nno further argument was required because he was not going to change his mind.\nPedersdotter moved for a mistrial, which the judge denied.\n       At the lunch break on the tenth day of trial, which the judge set aside to discuss\nwith counsel his proposal to sever Spencer’s case, Pedersdotter explained her opposition\nto the proposal. She then began to reargue the expert testimony issue. The judge\ninterrupted her, stating they were not there to discuss that issue, which had been\ndiscussed at least ten times. When Pedersdotter said she understood that, he told her to\n“be quiet about that.” Pedersdotter continued to argue on the subject; the judge warned\nher, “Counsel, we’re done on that. We’re done. Be quiet. Be quiet. I’ll hold you in\ncontempt. I don’t want to do that. But when I tell you to be quiet, be quiet. We have\nother issues we’ve got to decide. We’re not going to go back to decide every issue that’s\never occurred in this case – ” When Pedersdotter interrupted to ask if she could have “60\nseconds[,]” the judge responded, “Be quiet. I don’t want to hold you in contempt, but I\nwill if you don’t start obeying. You disobeyed every order I’ve given in this case.”\n       Judicial misconduct merits reversal of a civil judgment when it has been shown to\nbe prejudicial as a miscarriage of justice, or intentional and sufficiently heinous to\nwarrant reversal as a punishment or because it reveals bias on the part of the court.\n\n                                             33.\n\f(Mathew Zaheri Corp. v.

Harris contends the above passages show the trial court was overly critical of its\ntrial counsel and conveyed that bias to the jury. While these passages, the majority of\nwhich occurred outside the jury’s presence, show the court was exasperated with defense\ncounsel, it appears the genesis of the court’s actions and comments was defense counsel’s\nfailure to follow the court’s rulings and directions. As Spencer points out, the record\nshows the trial court, in acting as it did, was exercising reasonable control over the\npresentation of evidence to provide the orderly conduct of the proceedings. (Code Civ.\nProc., § 128, subd. (a)(3); Evid. Code, § 765.)\n       Harris has not established a miscarriage of justice, intentional or heinous\nmisconduct, or partiality or bias on the part of the trial court.

Damages\n       Harris contends the trial court erred by denying Harris’s motion for new trial, or\nalternatively remittitur, on the issue of damages. Harris argues the court should have\ngranted a new trial on damages or issued a remittitur under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 662.5, subdivision (b) reducing the judgment from $1,000,000 to $803,000,\nbecause Spencer “admitted at trial” that its delay and impact damages were $803,000.\nHarris asserts these admissions were made by Spencer’s expert, who quantified the delay\ndamages as $803,000, and its president, Bonar, who testified Spencer was “sticking with”\nthe expert’s figure of $803,000. Without citation to any relevant authority, Harris asserts\nSpencer’s admission that the impact claim was $803,000 is “binding substantial\nevidence” that requires reduction of the judgment to that amount pursuant to Code of\nCivil Procedure section 662.5, subdivision (b).16\n       If a trial court grants a new trial on the ground of excessive damages, it has\ndiscretion to issue an order conditionally granting the new trial unless the party in whose\nfavor the verdict was rendered consents to a reduction of damages. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\n       16  The sole case Harris cites in this section of its opening brief, Horsford v. Board\nof Trustees of California State University (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, provides no\nguidance on an appeal from a denial of a motion for new trial on excessive damages, as\nHorsford involved an appeal from an order conditionally granting a new trial unless the\nplaintiffs consented to a remittitur of excessive damages; the decision did not address\nappellate review of denials of new trial motions based on excessive damages or whether\ntestimony at trial constitutes a binding admission. (Id. at pp. 372, 379, 386-390.)\n\n\n\n                                             35.\n\f§ 662.5, subd. (a)(2).)17 On a motion for new trial claiming excessive damages or\ninsufficient evidence (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subds. 5-6), the trial court sits as an\nindependent trier of fact. (Lane v. Hughes Aircraft Co. (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1161594/lane-v-hughes-aircraft-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412.) If\nthe motion is granted, we apply a “highly deferential standard” (id. at p. 409), upholding\nall factual determinations with “the same deference that an appellate court would\nordinarily accord a jury’s factual determinations” (id. at p. 412); pertinent evidentiary\nconflicts place the new trial order “beyond review” (id. at p. 416). A denial of the\nmotion, on the other hand, requires deference to the jury verdict, as in any claim of\ninsufficient evidence. We affirm if any substantial evidence, contradicted or\nuncontradicted, supports the judgment. (Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior\nCourt (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1347356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1347356/western-states-petroleum-assn-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 (Western States).)\n       In our review of the evidence: “‘[A]ll conflicts must be resolved in favor of the\n[prevailing party], and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the\n[finding] if possible.

When two or more inferences can be\nreasonably deduced from the facts, the reviewing court is without power to substitute its\ndeductions for those of the trial court.’” (Western States, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 571,\nquoting Crawford v.

The same is true for a\ndamages award; we affirm if the record, viewed most favorably to the award, discloses\n\n       17 In its argument, Harris cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 662.5,\nsubdivision (b), rather than section 662.5, subdivision (a)(2). Section 662.5, subdivision\n(b) provides: “If a deadline for acceptance or rejection of the addition or reduction of\ndamages is not set forth in the conditional order, the deadline is 30 days from the date the\nconditional order is served by the clerk of the court. Failure to respond to the order in\naccordance with this section shall be deemed a rejection of the addition or reduction of\ndamages and a new trial limited to the issue of damages shall be granted automatically.”\n\n\n\n                                             36.\n\fsubstantial evidence to support it.

Unless this is done,\nthe error assigned is deemed to be waived. [Citation.] It is incumbent upon appellants to\nstate fully, with transcript references, the evidence which is claimed to be insufficient to\nsupport the findings.’” (In re Marriage of Fink (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 887.) A recitation\nof only the appellant’s evidence does not suffice. (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon\n(1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158810\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158810/foreman-clark-corp-v-fallon/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881 (Foreman & Clark Corp.).) An attack on the evidence without\nsuch briefing is entitled to no consideration when it is apparent that a substantial amount\nof evidence was received on a respondent’s behalf. (Nwosu v. Uba (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1246.) “It is neither practical nor appropriate for us to comb the\nrecord on [an appellant’s] behalf.” (In re Marriage of Fink, supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 888.)\n       Harris attacks the damages award on the basis of the trial testimony of Spencer’s\npresident, expert and CEO regarding the amount of delay damages. Harris asserts\nSpencer is bound by testimony that it was seeking $803,000 in delay damages at trial.\nHarris, however, cites absolutely no legal authority in support of its contention that such\ntrial testimony constitutes what it terms “binding substantial evidence” that requires\nreduction of the damage award from $1 million to $803,000. By failing to cite any legal\nauthority, Harris has not satisfied its appellate burden to present adequate argument and\nlegal authority, and we may summarily reject its claim of error. (Stanley, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 793; Guthrey, supra, 63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1115; Muega, supra,\n50 Cal.App.4th at p. 877.)\n       Moreover, as Spencer points out, the testimony Harris points to does not constitute\nbinding judicial admissions. A “judicial admission” – generally distinguished from an\n\n                                             37.\n\f“evidentiary admission” – is an admission of fact by a party that is treated as a “‘waiver\nof proof,’” in that the admission is taken to establish the fact conclusively.

The testimony to which Harris cites, such as Anderson’s calculation of delay\ndamages at $803,113 and Bonar’s testimony that he calculated delay damages of\n$870,000, are not clear concessions that Spencer was entitled to recover only $803,000.\nInstead, Bonar testified that Spencer’s damages were much greater than the $803,000 in\ndelay damages Anderson calculated and the $870,000 it asked Harris for before filing this\nlawsuit. It is apparent from the trial testimony on damages that Spencer, through its\nwitnesses, was telling the jury that while its damages exceeded $1 million, it was asking\nonly that the jury award the lower figure. In no way was the testimony of Spencer’s\nwitnesses a judicial admission that its delay damages totaled only $803,000.\n       Harris contends that because the $1 million jury award exceeded the amount of\ndelay damages testified to by Bonar ($870,000) and Anderson ($803,000), it necessarily\nincluded an award for the unpaid change orders that were severed from this trial. In\nmaking this argument, Harris essentially is contending the delay damages the jury\nawarded are not supported by substantial evidence. Harris, however, fails to recite all of\nthe material evidence on delay damages, thereby forfeiting review of the purported error.\n(Foreman & Clark Corp., supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 881.)\n       Alternatively, our review of the record shows there was substantial evidence to\nsupport the jury’s award of $1 million for Spencer’s delay and impact damages. As\nSpencer’s counsel explained during closing argument, there were three different ways to\ncalculate the delay damages in the case, all of which had been presented to the jury:\n(1) Anderson’s calculation of $803,113, (2) Bonar’s calculation of $870,000, and\n\n                                             38.\n\f(3) $1,112,018, which is what Anderson calculated Spencer paid out of pocket for labor,\nmaterials and subcontractors, which was exclusive of any markup Spencer planned to\nmake on the Project. There was testimony to support each of these figures. The jury was\ninstructed that if it found Harris “impacted and delayed” Spencer’ s work on the project,\nit was required to determine whether that delay caused Spencer “to incur costs that it\nwould not otherwise have incurred except for the delay.” In deciding the value of the\nadditional costs Spencer incurred due the impacts of Harris’s delays, the jury chose to\naward Spencer $1 million, which is close to the out-of-pocket loss of $1,112,018 less the\n$120,787 Bonar testified Spencer was owed on the change orders. Harris does not argue\nthat out-of-pocket cost is an incorrect measure of delay damages. Substantial evidence\nsupports the jury’s determination that Spencer’s delay damages, without regard to the\nchange order claim, were $1 million.\n       It is true, as Harris points out, that an appellate court may reverse an award of\ndamages “[w]hen the award, as a matter of law appears excessive, or where the recovery\nis so grossly disproportionate as to raise a presumption that it is the result of passion or\nprejudice, . . . ” (Cunningham v. Simpson (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1159456\"><a href=\"/opinion/1159456/cunningham-v-simpson/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308-309.) Here, the\naward was not excessive or disproportionate to the claimed delay damages, and therefore\ndoes not raise a presumption the award resulted from passion or prejudice.

Prejudgment Interest\n       In granting Spencer’s post-trial motion for prejudgment interest, the trial court\nawarded Spencer prejudgment interest pursuant to section 3287, subdivision (a), which\nprovides, in pertinent part: “A person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or\ncapable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in\nthe person upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that\nday . . .”. Prejudgment interest is allowable under section 3287, subdivision (a), “‘where\nthe amount due plaintiff is fixed by the terms of the contract, or is readily ascertainable\n\n                                             39.\n\fby reference to well-established market values. [Citations.] On the other hand, interest is\nnot allowable where the amount of the damages depends upon a judicial determination\nbased on conflicting evidence.’” (Great Western Drywall, Inc. v. Roel Construction Co.,\nInc. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247310\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247310/great-western-drywall-inc-v-roel-construction-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767.) Prejudgment interest is an element of\ncompensatory damages, which compensates the injured party for loss of use of the money\nduring the prejudgment period. (Id. at pp. 767-768.)\n       Although Harris did not file an opposition to Spencer’s motion, it raised the\npropriety of the award under this subdivision in its motion for a new trial, which the trial\ncourt denied. On appeal, Harris contends the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment\ninterest under this subdivision because Spencer’s delay damages both were uncertain and\nincapable of being made certain by calculation.\n       We first address Spencer’s contention that Harris does not have “standing” to\ncontest the ruling because it did not oppose the motion or seek reconsideration. Without\ncitation to authority, Spencer contends Harris “forfeited and waived” its opportunity to\ncontest the award of prejudgment interest. We disagree, as Harris raised the issue of the\namount of the award in its motion for a new trial. Since prejudgment interest is an\nelement of damages and may be sought as part of a motion for new trial on the ground of\ninadequate damages, it follows the award of prejudgment interest may be challenged in a\nmotion for new trial on the ground of excessive damages.

Bonar testified\nthat he sent Harris the December 21, 2006 letter to update Harris on Spencer’s estimated\ncosts incurred due to the delays. When asked how he arrived at his first estimate of delay\ncosts in June 2006, Bonar explained that how he came up with the number was not an\n“exact science”; he took the hourly cost for certain managers and a superintendent, along\nwith fixed costs, and extended them out 120 days, and then used an “efficiency factor[,]”\nto reach a very conservative number. In determining the December 2006 number, Bonar\n\n                                            41.\n\fstarted with the June 2006 estimate, changed the number of workers to reflect what\nactually happened and added punch list items.\n       Bonar admitted the December 2006 number was an estimate, explaining that it is\n“very, very difficult in a time extension claim or impact claim to determine exactly the\nnumber of extra hours that you spent. It’s virtually impossible.” Bonar further explained\nthe calculation was based on an estimate of the impact of the time and the access of the\nout-of-sequence work. It was not based on the number of hours spent on the project, as\nthis “was not a total cost claim.”\n       Spencer’s expert, Anderson, testified he believed Bonar’s December 2006 claim\nwas “reasonable and adequate for the purposes of setting forth their damages.” He also\nbelieved the number was an estimate. Anderson explained it fell within seven percent of\nhis calculations and “[i]f you sat four other experts down here in this seat, they would\nhave four different other numbers. You’re not going to come to the same number.”\n       Thus the testimony of Bonar and Anderson establishes that the December 2006\ndelay damage figure was an estimate, it was “virtually impossible” to quantify the extra\nhours upon which the figure was based, and no two people would come up with the same\nfigure. The letter itself shows the uncertainty of the amount claimed, as it states it is an\nestimate which was based on a “conservative method,” Bonar encouraged Harris to call\nto discuss rather than to demand it to pay a sum certain, and the figure was not fixed, as\nBonar stated Spencer had incurred costs due to “lack of flow” and “efficiency factors,”\nwhich would follow.\n       Where damages cannot be ascertained by calculation, prejudgment interest may\nnot be awarded under section 3287, subdivision (a).

There, a\nsubcontractor was not paid for extra work it performed on a project pursuant to an oral\nmodification of the original subcontract. (Id. at pp. 664-665.) After finding that the\ncontractor was liable to the subcontractor for the extra work, the trial court awarded the\n\n                                             42.\n\fsubcontractor the reasonable cost of the work actually performed under the existing\ncircumstances and conditions. (Id. at p. 671.) The trial court ultimately determined the\nsubcontractor was not entitled to prejudgment interest on the unpaid amount. (Id. at\np. 672.)\n        The Court of Appeal affirmed, noting that the additional work was not performed\nunder normal conditions, as there were delays, changes and deviations that substantially\nincreased the cost of performance and were not subject to computation. (MacIsaac,\nsupra, 193 Cal.App.2d at p. 673.) The appellate court further explained the extent to\nwhich the delays and interruptions added to the cost of the work could only be\nascertained by a judicial determination, arrived at from a consideration of all the\nconditions under which the work was done. (Id. at p. 673.) Since the amount of damages\nawarded did not represent what the work would have cost under normal conditions, the\ncost of the work could not be ascertained by computation and rendered section 3287,\nsubdivision (a) inapplicable. (Id. at p. 673.) Similarly, in Macomber v. State of\nCalifornia (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2216857\"><a href=\"/opinion/2216857/macomber-v-state-of-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Id. at p.\n401.)\n        Here, the evidence showed that the delay damages Spencer claimed in Bonar’s\nDecember 2006 letter could not be ascertained by computation as they were based on\nestimates the accuracy of which was “virtually impossible” to determine. Spencer\ncontends the delay damages were capable of being made certain because the letter\nsupplied the data necessary for Harris to determine the amount due, citing Maurice L.\nBein, Inc. v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (1958) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606941\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606941/maurice-l-bein-inc-v-housing-authority-of-city-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Bein). In Bein, a general contractor who had contracted with the Housing Authority to\n\n                                             43.\n\fbuild a low-rent housing complex sued for damages arising from a delay caused by the\nHousing Authority. (Bein, supra, 157 Cal.App.2d at pp. 674-675, 678.) The Court of\nAppeal held the contractor was entitled to prejudgment interest because, from the\ninception of its claim for damages, it had supplied the Housing Authority with detailed\nstatements of the data necessary to determine the amount due and the Housing Authority\nnever actually denied the damages claimed. (Id. at pp. 686-687.)\n       In contrast to Bein, in this case Spencer did not supply Harris with invoices from\nwhich it could calculate the delay damages. Instead, it submitted Bonar’s estimation of\nits delay damages, which he admitted was not an “exact science” and it was “virtually\nimpossible” to determine the extra hours since the claim was not a total cost claim.\nSpencer asserts Harris did not dispute its calculation of the delay damages because it did\nnot present any testimony rebutting Bonar’s and Anderson’s computations. Harris,\nhowever, did urge the jury in its closing statement to reject both Anderson’s calculation\nas unreliable and Bonar’s estimate as Harris was never provided backup to substantiate\nthe amount claimed in the December 2006 letter. Spencer does not point to any invoices\nor other documents it submitted to Harris from which Harris could itself determine by\ncalculation the delay damages. For that reason, Spencer’s reliance on Bien is misplaced.\n       The policy underlying the requirement for prejudgment interest “is that in\nsituations where the defendant could have timely paid that amount and has thus deprived\nthe plaintiff of the economic benefit of those funds, the defendant should therefore\ncompensate with appropriate interest.” (Wisper Corp., supra, 49 Cal.App.4th at p. 962.)\nThis is not such a case. Spencer did not present a clear and unequivocal statement of\ndamages and Spencer’s own expert tested that no two experts would come to the same\nvaluation as his. Given these facts, we conclude that the court erred in determining that\nSpencer’s damages were certain or capable of being made certain prior to the jury’s\ndetermination. The trial court should have granted a new trial on the issue of\nprejudgment interest.\n\n                                            44.\n\f       The issue, then, is the remedy. In moving for prejudgment interest in the trial\ncourt, Spencer alternatively requested the court exercise its discretion to award\nprejudgment interest under section 3287, subdivision (b), which provides “[e]very person\nwho is entitled under any judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in\ncontract where the claim was unliquidated, may also recover interest thereon from a date\nprior to the entry of judgment as the court may, in its discretion, fix, but in no event\nearlier than the date the action was filed.” Subdivision (b) creates “a limited exception to\nthe prevailing general rule that prejudgment interest is not allowed on unliquidated\nobligations.” (Lewis C. Nelson & Sons, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at p. 69.) By its terms,\nsubdivision (b) “was designed to allow trial courts flexibility in circumstances . . . where\nthe exact amount of damage is in dispute.” (A & M Produce Co. v. FMC Corp. (1982)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2131732\"><a href=\"/opinion/2131732/a-m-produce-co-v-fmc-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496.) Spencer asked the court to award prejudgment interest under\nthis subdivision on the one million dollar jury verdict from the date the complaint was\nfiled to May 2011.\n       Harris contends Spencer is barred from recovering prejudgment interest under\nsubdivision (b) because the trial court specifically denied Spencer’s request for\nprejudgment interest under subdivision (b) in its order granting the motion under\nsubdivision (a). The record, however, does not support this assertion, as the court’s\nminute order does not specify under what subdivision the motion was granted and its\nwritten order, while stating that Spencer’s “motion for an order awarding it prejudgment\ninterest is granted in the amount of $384,678[,]” does not state that it denied, or would\nhave denied, the motion under subdivision (b).\n       Spencer contends the trial court could have awarded $341,667 in prejudgment\ninterest under subdivision (b), calculated on the jury’s verdict from the date of complaint.\nSignificantly, in moving for a new trial on prejudgment interest, Harris did not argue that\nprejudgment interest should not be awarded at all. Instead, Harris argued, citing\nsubdivision (b) and Lewis C. Nelson & Sons, that Spencer only was entitled to\n\n                                             45.\n\fprejudgment interest from the date the complaint was filed, as the damages were\nunliquidated. Harris presented no argument below, and makes none in its opening brief\non appeal, that Spencer should not be awarded prejudgment interest under subdivision\n(b). While Harris makes a passing statement in its reply brief that there is no basis to\naward interest, it presents no argument and cites no authority in support of this assertion.\nSince Harris essentially conceded that the trial court should award prejudgment interest\nunder subdivision (b), we will order the prejudgment interest in the judgment be reduced\nfrom $384,678 to $341,667.\n   VI. Attorney Fees\n       Harris challenges the amount of attorney fees the trial court awarded. Specifically,\nHarris asserts the trial court (1) was required to reduce the fees of Spencer’s attorneys,\nFlynn Williams, because the majority of their bills contained block billing, (2) should\nhave stricken fees requested from September 13 to November 9 based on the parties’\nsettlement agreement regarding the change order claims, and (3) should have disallowed\nfees for Spencer’s prior counsel, McInerney, because their time records were incomplete\nand not supported by a declaration.\n       The standard of review of an award of attorney fees after trial is abuse of\ndiscretion.

Reasonable attorney fees authorized by contract shall\nbe awarded to the prevailing party as “fixed by the court,” giving the trial court broad\ndiscretion to determine the amount considered reasonable, governed by equitable\nprinciples. (Ibid.) The pleadings, pretrial motions, and other evidence of actual work\nperformed by Spencer’s attorneys are before the court, and upon this evidence, the court\nalone has the discretion to set the fee award.

Testimony of an attorney as to the number of\nhours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney\nfees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Martino v. Denevi (1986)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293.)\n       We begin with the block billing. Many of the billing statements from the law firm\nFlynn Williams that Spencer submitted as part of its supporting evidence were in block or\ndaily billing format. If an attorney performed multiple tasks on the case on a single day,\nthe billing statement lists the tasks performed and the total time spent by the attorney on\nall legal services performed on that day, but does not specify the time spent on each task.\nAccording to Harris’s expert, David A. Robinson, Esq., whose declaration it submitted in\nopposition to the attorney fees motion, block billing accounted for 88 percent of the time\nentries.\n\n                                            47.\n\f       Harris contends block billing is “improper” because it “obscure[s] the nature of the\nwork claimed,” and asserts that where an attorney’s bill is dominated by block billing,\ntrial courts will apply a 10 to 30 percent reduction to the entire bill. Harris argues\nreduction of the Flynn Williams fees was mandated here because the time records were\n“woefully inadequate” due to the block billing and the failure to record time records in\nanything less than .2 of an hour. Harris urges us not to give deference to the trial court’s\nruling due to its failure to account for the block billing in the attorney fees award, and\nasks us to reverse the award and remand the matter to the trial court to rule on the\nreasonableness of the block billing.\n       As one appellate court has explained, block billing “is not objectionable ‘per se,’\nthough it certainly does increase the risk that the trial court, in a reasonable exercise of its\ndiscretion, will discount a fee request.” (Jaramillo v. County of Orange (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (Jaramillo).) “Blockbilling is particularly problematic in cases\nwhere there is a need to separate out work that qualifies for compensation under\n[Government Code] section 1021.5 from work that doesn’t.

(Id. at pp. 102-103.)\n       Harris cites no California case or statutory authority prohibiting block billing. The\ncases it does cite are either ones where, like Bell, block billing rendered it impossible to\napportion attorney fees between claims on which attorney fees could or could not be\nawarded, or in which the appellate court found no abuse of discretion in reducing fees\ndue to block billing. (See Track Mortgage Group, Inc. v. Crusader Ins. Co.

Moreover, whatever form of billing is used, the\nquestion is whether the billing provides the trial court with a reasonable basis for\nawarding attorney fees. In this case, the trial court did reduce the Flynn Williams bills by\n$20,865 where redactions “failed to provide the [c]ourt with a reasonable basis for\nevaluating certain claimed fees[,]” and otherwise had no difficulty with Spencer’s\nattorneys’ billings. We find no abuse of discretion in failing to further reduce the bills\ndue to block billing.\n\n\n\n\n                                              49.\n\f       Harris next contends the trial court improperly awarded Spencer $4,964 in fees for\nthe period of September 13 through November 3.18 As Spencer has explained, both\nbelow and on appeal, these fees were not included in the total fees it sought. In a\ndeclaration, Spencer’s attorney states that when his office generated the total fees, its\naccounting database excluded any fees accrued between September 13 through\nNovember 3, and while one of the invoices submitted in support of the motion contains\nunredacted fee entries on November 1, 2 and 3, these fees were not included in the total\nfees Spencer sought to recover. In reply, Harris asserts the trial court erred because it did\nnot indicate the fees were stricken in its order. The trial court, however, awarded Spencer\nthe fees it requested, less reductions for redacted work, which Spencer verified did not\ninclude the prohibited fees. Since the trial court’s award did not include the prohibited\nfees, it was not necessary for the trial court to state in its order that they were stricken.\n       Finally, Harris contends the trial court should have stricken the fees of Spencer’s\nprior counsel, McInerney, because it was impossible to figure out what work was done\nfrom the invoice submitted in support of the motion and the fees were not supported by a\ndeclaration from a McInerney attorney. In its motion, Spencer requested $15,733 in fees\nand costs for work performed by McInerney. In support, it submitted a declaration from\nWilliam J. McGahan, who performed work on the case, in which he stated that true and\ncorrect copies of the McInerney attorney billing ledger containing the fees and costs\nMcInerney incurred in representing Spencer were attached to the declaration, and\nexplained that client bills were generated after time spent on all matters was entered into\nthe computer and summarized on the ledger. McGahan further stated that “[t]he\n\n       18 Although Harris uses November 9, 2011 in its appellate briefs, both Harris and\nSpencer agree on appeal that, in settling the change order claim, Spencer released its\nclaim for attorney fees between September 13, 2011 and November 3, 2011, and\ntherefore the November 9 date that appears on one version of the settlement agreement is\nincorrect.\n\n\n\n                                              50.\n\fdescriptive matter in the billing ledger has been redacted but will be made available\nwithout the redactions for the Court’s in camera review, if necessary.” The attached\nbilling ledger shows that 57.60 hours were billed totaling $14,740. Spencer also\nsubmitted an expert witness declaration from an attorney who reviewed McInerney’s\nattorney fee billing ledger and opined the fees were reasonable under the circumstances.\n       In opposing the motion, Harris objected to the McInerney fees because the tasks\nperformed were redacted from the ledger. In reply, Spencer submitted a declaration from\nFlynn Williams attorney Sloan C. Bailey, who stated that a true and correct unredacted\ncopy of McInerney’s invoice was attached as an exhibit, which reflected total attorney\nfees of $14,740. The unredacted invoice, however, is not attached to Bailey’s declaration\nin the clerk’s transcript and it does not appear to be included there, as neither party points\nus to where it is located in the 12,585 page clerk’s transcript and we could not locate it.\n       Harris filed an objection to the invoice on the grounds that it was presented too\nlate and lacked a declaration from a McInerney attorney authenticating it. At oral\nargument on the motion, Harris’s attorney again objected to the original McInerney bill\nas unreasonable, and the new bill submitted with the reply as untimely and\nunaccompanied by a declaration authenticating it. In response, Spencer’s attorney stated\nthe bill was not new, as it had been submitted several times with Spencer’s papers, and\nthe hours and fees had always been available for opposing counsel’s analysis. Spencer’s\nattorney admitted that Bailey would not have personal knowledge of the work that\nappeared on McInerney’s bill, but Bailey knew the bill was the same one McGahan had\ndeclared under oath was accurate.\n       As appellant, Harris bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating error.\n(Winograd v. American Broadcasting Co. (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631-632; Ketchum\nv.

Harris failed to include in the record\nthe McInerney invoice submitted with Bailey’s reply declaration that purportedly details\nthe work McInerney performed. While Harris contends McInerney’s invoices did not\n\n                                             51.\n\fprovide sufficient detail for the trial court to determine whether the fees claimed were\nreasonable, we presume the invoice submitted with the reply brief provided the necessary\ndetail. On at least two occasions, our Supreme Court has articulated this principle, which\nis particularly applicable here: “‘It is the burden of the party challenging the fee award on\nappeal to provide an adequate record to assess error. [Citations.] Here, [Harris] should\nhave augmented the record with [the missing document]. [Citations.] Because [it] failed\nto furnish an adequate record of the attorney fee proceedings, [Harris’s] claim must be\nresolved against [it].’” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp. 1140–1141; Maria P. v. Riles\n(1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604077\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604077/maria-p-v-riles/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1295–1296.)\n       Harris complains that the McInerney invoice was not authenticated. Harris,\nhowever, cites no authority to show that Bailey could not authenticate the unredacted\ninvoice as being the same redacted invoice McInerney attorney McGahan previously\nauthenticated. Therefore, Harris has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in\nadmitting the unredacted invoice and relying upon it to determine the reasonableness of\nthe requested fees. (Nielsen, supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at p. 324; Badie, supra,\n67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 784–785.)\n       In sum, Harris has not shown that the trial court erred in its award of attorney fees\nto Spencer.\n\n\n\n\n                                             52.\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n      The judgment against Harris is modified to reduce the award of prejudgment\ninterest from $384,678 to $341,667. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. Costs on\nappeal are awarded to Spencer.\n\n\n\n                                                            _____________________\n                                                                  Gomes, Acting P.J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\nFranson, J.\n\n\n _____________________\nPeña, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         53.\n\f</pre>",
