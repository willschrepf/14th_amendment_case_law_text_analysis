(hereafter\n\ncollectively the \"church defendants\") failed to protect her from sexual abuse by a fellow\n\nmember of the Toppenish congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Because Ms. Castro\n\nfailed to demonstrate genuinely disputed material facts in response to the church\n\fNo. 321487-II1\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\ndefendants' evidence that they were unaware of the abuser's propensities and owed no\n\nduty to protect her, summary judgment was proper. We affirm.\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROlmD\n\n       Because Belen Castro's complaint was dismissed on summary judgment, we\n\nreview the evidence in the light most favorable to her.\n\n       Ms. Castro, now in her twenties, claims she was sexually abused by Virgil\n\nBushman when she was eleven and twelve years old. Ms. Castro's contact with Mr.\n\nBushman arose because she, her mother, and Mr. Bushman all attended the Toppenish\n\nCongregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Mr. Bushman and his wife had become close\n\nfriends with Ms. Castro's family and they would often do things together outside of\n\nchurch.\n\n       According to Ms. Castro, Mr. Bushman began making suggestive remarks to her\n\nwhen she was 11 years old, including that he wanted to have sex with her and\n\n\"encouraging her to think about him in a sexual manner.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 7. He\n\nmade these comments when nobody else was around, and Ms. Castro did not tell anyone\n\nabout them.\n\n      Mr. Bushman's attentions became physical in May 2003, when Ms. Castro was 12\n\nyears old. She claims that Mr. Bushman first kissed and intimately held her during a\n\nMemorial Day weekend camping outing with several families in the Toppenish\n\nCongregation. Mr. Bushman next had sexual contact with her at his parents' home,\n\n                                               2\n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nwhere he had invited her, her brother, and several other children to go swimming.\n\nAccording to Ms. Castro, Mr. Bushman touched her vagina with his fingers while they\n\nwere all in the hot tub, and later kissed her in his parents' kitchen. Finally, she alleges\n\nthat Mr. Bushman had unwanted sexual contact with her during a sleepover party at his\n\nhome on June 21,2003, while his wife was out of town.\n\n       In addition to this abuse alleged in a complaint that Ms. Castro filed in January\n\n2012, Ms. Castro testified in deposition that there were several times where Mr. Bushman\n\nwould touch her or \"try to talk me into something\" during church related events,\n\nincluding at the Toppenish Kingdom Hall. CP at 140. By way of example, she testified\n\nhe would come behind her and \"grab [her] butt\" behind the large sound box in the back\n\ncorner of the room. CP at 30. Although there were always people in the room, Ms.\n\nCastro maintains that Mr. Bushman would touch her in a way that nobody would see.\n\n       A few weeks after the June 21 sleepover at Mr. Bushman's house, Ms. Castro\n\nconfided in her cousin about the abuse. A member of the congregation learned about the\n\ndisclosure and notified church elders. Elders are the teachers of the congregation, and are\n\nassigned to \"shepherd and protect the flock.\" CP at 198. 1 The elders asked Ms. Castro's\n\n\n       1 Congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses have three appointed positions: elders,\nministerial servants, and pioneers. To be eligible to be appointed as an elder, an\nindividual must serve as a ministerial servant for a period of time. Ministerial servants\nlead in the field of ministry and assist the elders, who can assign them to various tasks.\nWhile they may playa role in the service meeting, a ministerial servant possesses less\nqualifications than an elder, and therefore is assigned only to \"lighter teaching parts.\" CP\n\n                                               3\n\n\fNo. 32 I 487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nmother to come in with her daughter to discuss the allegations. A meeting between Ms.\n\nCastro, her mother, and two elders took place on July 4, 2003. Ms. Castro revealed at\n\nleast some of Mr. Bushman's actions to the elders. Mr. Bushman never again molested\n\nMs. Castro following that meeting.\n\n      Ms. Castro brought the action below against the Bushmans, the Toppenish\n\nCongregation, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., and the Watch\n\nTower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. The two Watchtower entities are\n\nreligious organizations whose corporate members (the number has ranged from 30 to\n\n300) have historically been elders living and serving at the United States branch offices\n\nof Jehovah's Witnesses in New York. Ms. Castro's complaint accused the congregation\n\nand the two Watchtower entities of failing to \"take timely action\" and to \"properly\n\npolic[e] its membership.\" CP at 8.\n\n      Following discovery, the church defendants moved for summary judgment,2\n\npresenting evidence that Mr. Bushman held no position with the Toppenish Congregation\n\nor Watchtower entities, and that no official or employee of the church defendants had\n\n\n\n\nat 197. A regular pioneer is someone who has agreed to serve in \"full-time ministry\" in\ntheir local congregation. Id. To become a regular pioneer, an individual must submit an\napplication, which is considered locally and by the church's world headquarters in New\nYork before approval.\n        2 Ms. Castro settled her claims against the Bushmans.\n\n                                               4\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nnotice of his propensities or his conduct toward Ms. Castro until after she confided in her\n\ncousin.\n\n       The trial court granted the church defendants' motion for summary judgment on\n\nthe basis, in part, that they had no special relationship with either Mr. Bushman or Ms.\n\nCastro that would give rise to a duty to protect her from his conduct. Ms. Castro appeals.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n       Ms. Castro implicitly recognizes that the church defendants cannot be liable for all\n\nof the injury alleged by her complaint, because she makes only one assignment of error\n\non appeal: she contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment \"when\n\nthere were contested questions of material fact whether or not the plaintiff was molested\n\non the defendants' premises.\" Br. of Appellant at 1. She focuses on her allegations that\n\nMr. Bushman touched her sexually in Kingdom Hall, during church meetings, where, she\n\nargues, \"security was so lax that even with the Watchtower officials in the very same\n\nroom, Virgil Bushman would come up to Belen Castro, grab her buttocks, and fondle\n\nher.\" Id. at 2.\n\n                  Standard ofreview and burden on summary judgment\n\n       In reviewing an order for summary judgment, this court engages in the same\n\ninquiry as the trial court. Folsom v. Burger King, 135 Wn.2d 658, 663, 958 P.2d 301\n\n(1998). Summary judgment is properly granted when there is \"no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter oflaw.\" CR\n\n                                               5\n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\n56(c). \"[T]he court must consider the material evidence and all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom most favorably for the nonmoving party.\" Jacobsen v. State, 89 Wn.2d 104,\n\n108,569 P.2d 1152 (1977).\n\n       A moving defendant may meet its initial burden of demonstrating no genuine issue\n\nof material fact by pointing out that there is an absence of evidence to support the\n\nplaintiffs case. If a moving defendant makes this initial showing, then the inquiry shifts\n\nto the party with the burden of proof at trial, the plaintiff. Young v. Key Pharm., Inc., 112\n\nWn.2d 216,225 & n. 1, 770 P.2d 182 (1989). The plaintiff must then set forth specific\n\nfacts demonstrating a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 225. Mere allegations or conclusory\n\nstatements of facts, unsupported by evidence, do not establish such a genuine issue.\n\nBaldwin v. Sisters o/Providence in Wash., Inc., 112 Wn.2d 127, 132,769 P.2d 298\n\n(1989). The nonmoving party \"may not rely on speculation, argumentative assertions\n\nthat unresolved factual issues remain, or in having its affidavits considered at face value.\"\n\nSeven Gables Corp. v. MGMlUA Entm 't Co., 106 Wn.2d 1, 13, 721 P.2d 1 (1986).\n\n                                            Duty\n\n       The threshold question in any negligence action is whether the defendant owed a\n\nduty of care to the injured plaintiff. Schooley v. Pinch's Deli Mkt., Inc., 134 Wn.2d 468,\n\n474,951 P.2d 749 (1998). Generally, a person has no duty to prevent a third party from\n\ncausing physical injury to another. Petersen v. State, 100 Wn.2d 421, 426, 671 P.2d 230\n\n(1983). Exceptions to this rule apply \"where a special relationship exists between the\n\n                                               6\n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\ndefendant and either the third party or the foreseeable yictim of the third party's\n\nconduct.\" ld. at 426. The Restatement (Second) o/Torts identifies the exceptions to the\n\ngeneral absence of duty as existing where\n\n       (a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which\n       imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person's conduct, or\n       (b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to\n       the other a right to protection\n\nRESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 315 (1965).\n\n       The knowledge a defendant must have of the risk of harm differs depending on\n\nwhether its special relationship is with the third party who causes injury, whom the\n\ndefendant has a duty to control, or is with a victim, whom the defendant has a duty to\n\nprotect. A duty arising from a special relationship with the third party causing harm\n\nrequires proof \"that the defendant was aware of the tortfeasor's dangerous propensities.\"\n\nNK. v. Corp. o/Presiding Bishop, 175 Wn. App. 517, 535,348 P.3d 1237 (2015).\n\nWhere the defendant's special relationship is with a victim, \"a duty predicated on a\n\nprotective relationship requires knowledge only of the 'general field of danger' within\n\nwhich the harm occurred.\" ld. at 526 (quoting McLeod v. Grant County Sch. Dist. No.\n\n128,42 Wn.2d 316,321,255 P.2d 360 (1953)).\n\n       In moving for summary judgment, the church defendants met their initial summary\n\njudgment burden of presenting evidence that they had no special relationship with Mr.\n\nBushman giving rise to a duty to control his conduct, were unaware at material times that\n\n\n                                               7\n\n\fNo. 321487-111\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nhe had any dangerous propensity, and had no special relationship with Ms. Castro giving\n\nrise to a duty to protect her. The burden then shifted to Ms. Castro to present evidence\n\nraising a genuine issue of fact as to those matters.\n\n       Ms. Castro's briefing on appeal does not focus our attention on which special\n\nrelationship she claims existed on the part of the church defendants. Instead, she cites\n\ngenerally to   c.J.c.   v. Corp. ofCatholic Bishop ofYakima, 138 Wn.2d 699, 722, 985 P.2d\n\n262 (1999), an appeal of consolidated cases that presented and discussed both special\n\nrelationships. We therefore address the sufficiency of her summary judgment showing\n\non the three matters identified.\n\n                   The church defendants' relationship with Mr. Bushman\n\n       The church defendants presented evidence in support of their motion for summary\n\njudgment that Mr. Bushman never held any appointed position in the Toppenish\n\nCongregation and was never an officer, director, member, or employee of either of the\n\nWatchtower organizations. Ms. Castro's complaint alleged only that Mr. Bushman was a\n\nmember of the Toppenish Congregation. She provides no authority or argument that the\n\nchurch defendants had the right or ability to control Mr. Bushman's conduct based upon\n\nhis membership alone.\n\n       The relations between a defendant and a third person causing harm that can give\n\nrise to a duty to control the third person's conduct are set forth in § § 316-319 of the\n\nRestatement, § 315 cmt. c. They are the relationships between a parent and a minor child,\n\n                                               8\n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\na master and a servant acting outside the scope of employment, a possessor of property\n\nand a licensee, and a person who has taken charge of a third party he knows or should\n\nknow has dangerous propensities. Ms. Castro does not argue that any of these\n\nrelationships existed between the church defendants and Mr. Bushman.\n\n       In each case Ms. Castro cites that involves duty arising out of a special\n\nrelationship with the third person causing harm, the third person was employed by the\n\ndefendant in some capacity. See   c.Jc., 138 Wn.2d at 720 (abuser was made a deacon\nand \"entrusted with various leadership positions\" within the church); La Lone v. Smith,\n\n39 Wn.2d 167, 168,234 P.2d 893 (1951) (landlord and apartment manager were liable\n\nwhere tenant was assaulted by a janitor whom they had employed); Scott v. Blanchet\n\nHigh Sch., 50 Wn. App. 37,43, 747 P.2d 1124 (1987) (school was not liable for sexual\n\nrelationship between student and teacher in its employ because, even \"assuming the\n\ndoctrine of negligent hiring applies to schools,\" its hiring process \"appears sufficient as a\n\nmatter of law to discover whether an individual is fit to teach\").\n\n       Ms. Castro fails to demonstrate any genuinely disputed issue of a special\n\nrelationship between the church defendants and Mr. Bushman that requires trial.\n\n                         Lack ofnotice ofdangerous propensities\n\n       The church defendants also presented evidence in support of their motion for\n\nsummary judgment that they had no notice of any dangerous propensity on Mr.\n\nBushman's part until after the abuse stopped. The existence of a duty to control the\n\n                                               9\n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nconduct of a third person with whom a defendant has a special relationship depends on\n\nproof that the defendant was aware of the tortfeasor's dangerous propensities. N.K, 175\n\nWn. App. at 535.\n\n       Rather than demonstrate a dispute of fact, Ms. Castro's evidence actually supports\n\nthe church defendants' evidence on this score. According to Ms. Castro, no one ever\n\nwitnessed the abuse because Mr. Bushman \"never did it when anyone was around.\" CP\n\nat 41. Although there were other people in the room, including church elders, she\n\nexplained that Mr. Bushman would always touch her in a way that nobody could see it.\n\n       There is no disputed issue of notice of dangerous propensities; on this additional\n\nbasis, it was proper to grant summary judgment dismissing any claim based on a special\n\nrelationship between the church defendants and Mr. Bushman.\n\n                   The church defendants' relationship with Ms. Castro\n\n       Turning to the duty that can arise out of a special relationship with a victim, \"The\n\nduty to protect another person from the intentional or criminal actions of third parties\n\narises where one party is entrusted with the wellbeing of another.\" N.K, 175 Wn. App. at\n\n532 (quoting Niece v. Elmview Group Home, 131 Wn.2d 39, 50,929 P.2d 420 (1997)).\n\n       For example, Washington law recognizes a special relationship between a hospital\n\nor group home and its patients. See, e.g., Hunt v. King County, 4 Wn. App. 14,20,481\n\nP.2d 593 (1971); Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 44 (special relationship between group home and\n\nits vulnerable residents gives rise to duty of reasonable care to protect residents from\n\n                                               10 \n\n\fNo. 321487-111\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nforeseeable harm). Similarly, jailors owe a special duty of care to their inmates.\n\nGregoire v. City ofOak Harbor, 170 Wn.2d 628, 639-31, 244 P.3d 924 (2010) Gailor has\n\nspecial relationship with inmates which includes protecting inmate against self-\n\ndestructive acts); see also Bishop v. Miche, 137 Wn.2d 518, 973 P.2d 465 (1999) (county\n\nprobation officer owed duty to exercise reasonable care to control parolee to prevent\n\nforeseeable harm to other resulting from parolee's dangerous propensities).\n\n       It is also well settled that a school district has a special relationship with students\n\nas a result of its role as a substitute parent. Christensen v. Royal Sch. Dist. No. 160, 156\n\nWn.2d 62, 70, 124 P.3d 283 (2005). Because a child is compelled to attend school, \"the\n\nprotective custody of teachers is mandatorily substituted for that of the parent.\" McLeod,\n\n42 Wn.2d at 319; Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 44 (\"The rationale for such a duty [is] the\n\nplacement of the student in the care of the defendant with the resulting loss of the\n\nstudent's ability to protect himself or herself.\"); RESTATEMENT, supra, § 320 cmt. b (\"[A]\n\nchild while in school is deprived of the protection of his parents or guardian. Therefore,\n\nthe actor who takes custody of ... a child is properly required to give him the protection\n\nwhich the custody or the manner in which it is taken has deprived him.\").\n\n       In CJ. C, the court held that the relationship between a church and children within\n\nits custody analogous to that between a school and its pupils, noting that\n\n       [t]he children of a congregation may be delivered into the custody and care\n       of a church and its workers, whether it be on the premises for services and\n       Sunday school, or off the premises at church sponsored activities or youth\n\n                                               11 \n\n\fNo. 321487-II1\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\n       camps.

It therefore held that the duties owed by a church to protect the\n\nchildren within its \"custody and care\" are similar to those owed by a school to its\n\nstudents. Id.; cf S.H.C. v. Lu, 113 Wn.

Ms. Castro presented\n\nno countervailing evidence. \"Without a custodial relationship, typically involving on­\n\nthe-ground control of day-to-day operations, an institutional defendant is not in a position\n\nto provide protection from physical danger as a school or church group does for\n\nchildren.\" N.K, 175 Wn.

(hereafter\n\ncollectively the \"church defendants\") failed to protect her from sexual abuse by a fellow\n\nmember of the Toppenish congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\ndefendants' evidence that they were unaware of the abuser's propensities and owed no\n\nduty to protect her, summary judgment was proper. We affirm.\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROlmD\n\n       Because Belen Castro's complaint was dismissed on summary judgment, we\n\nreview the evidence in the light most favorable to her.\n\n       Ms. Castro, now in her twenties, claims she was sexually abused by Virgil\n\nBushman when she was eleven and twelve years old. Ms. Castro's contact with Mr.\n\nBushman arose because she, her mother, and Mr. Bushman all attended the Toppenish\n\nCongregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Mr. Bushman and his wife had become close\n\nfriends with Ms. Castro's family and they would often do things together outside of\n\nchurch.\n\n       According to Ms. Castro, Mr. Bushman began making suggestive remarks to her\n\nwhen she was 11 years old, including that he wanted to have sex with her and\n\n\"encouraging her to think about him in a sexual manner.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 7. He\n\nmade these comments when nobody else was around, and Ms. Castro did not tell anyone\n\nabout them.\n\n      Mr. Bushman's attentions became physical in May 2003, when Ms. Castro was 12\n\nyears old. She claims that Mr. Bushman first kissed and intimately held her during a\n\nMemorial Day weekend camping outing with several families in the Toppenish\n\nCongregation. Mr. Bushman next had sexual contact with her at his parents' home,\n\n                                               2\n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nwhere he had invited her, her brother, and several other children to go swimming.\n\nAccording to Ms. Castro, Mr. Bushman touched her vagina with his fingers while they\n\nwere all in the hot tub, and later kissed her in his parents' kitchen. Finally, she alleges\n\nthat Mr. Bushman had unwanted sexual contact with her during a sleepover party at his\n\nhome on June 21,2003, while his wife was out of town.\n\n       In addition to this abuse alleged in a complaint that Ms. Castro filed in January\n\n2012, Ms. Castro testified in deposition that there were several times where Mr. Bushman\n\nwould touch her or \"try to talk me into something\" during church related events,\n\nincluding at the Toppenish Kingdom Hall. CP at 140. By way of example, she testified\n\nhe would come behind her and \"grab [her] butt\" behind the large sound box in the back\n\ncorner of the room. CP at 30. Although there were always people in the room, Ms.\n\nCastro maintains that Mr. Bushman would touch her in a way that nobody would see.\n\n       A few weeks after the June 21 sleepover at Mr. Bushman's house, Ms. Castro\n\nconfided in her cousin about the abuse. A member of the congregation learned about the\n\ndisclosure and notified church elders. Elders are the teachers of the congregation, and are\n\nassigned to \"shepherd and protect the flock.\" CP at 198. 1 The elders asked Ms. Castro's\n\n\n       1 Congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses have three appointed positions: elders,\nministerial servants, and pioneers. To be eligible to be appointed as an elder, an\nindividual must serve as a ministerial servant for a period of time. Ministerial servants\nlead in the field of ministry and assist the elders, who can assign them to various tasks.\nWhile they may playa role in the service meeting, a ministerial servant possesses less\nqualifications than an elder, and therefore is assigned only to \"lighter teaching parts.\" CP\n\n                                               3\n\n\fNo. 32 I 487-III\nBelen Castro v. Virgil Bushman, et ux, et al\n\n\nmother to come in with her daughter to discuss the allegations. A meeting between Ms.\n\nCastro, her mother, and two elders took place on July 4, 2003. Ms. Castro revealed at\n\nleast some of Mr. Bushman's actions to the elders. Mr. Bushman never again molested\n\nMs. Castro following that meeting.\n\n      Ms. Castro brought the action below against the Bushmans, the Toppenish\n\nCongregation, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., and the Watch\n\nTower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. The two Watchtower entities are\n\nreligious organizations whose corporate members (the number has ranged from 30 to\n\n300) have historically been elders living and serving at the United States branch offices\n\nof Jehovah's Witnesses in New York. Ms. Castro's complaint accused the congregation\n\nand the two Watchtower entities of failing to \"take timely action\" and to \"properly\n\npolic[e] its membership.\" CP at 8.\n\n      Following discovery, the church defendants moved for summary judgment,2\n\npresenting evidence that Mr. Bushman held no position with the Toppenish Congregation\n\nor Watchtower entities, and that no official or employee of the church defendants had\n\n\n\n\nat 197. A regular pioneer is someone who has agreed to serve in \"full-time ministry\" in\ntheir local congregation. Id. To become a regular pioneer, an individual must submit an\napplication, which is considered locally and by the church's world headquarters in New\nYork before approval.\n        2 Ms. Castro settled her claims against the Bushmans.\n\n                                               4\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v.

Ms. Castro appeals.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n       Ms. Castro implicitly recognizes that the church defendants cannot be liable for all\n\nof the injury alleged by her complaint, because she makes only one assignment of error\n\non appeal: she contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment \"when\n\nthere were contested questions of material fact whether or not the plaintiff was molested\n\non the defendants' premises.\" Br. of Appellant at 1. She focuses on her allegations that\n\nMr. Bushman touched her sexually in Kingdom Hall, during church meetings, where, she\n\nargues, \"security was so lax that even with the Watchtower officials in the very same\n\nroom, Virgil Bushman would come up to Belen Castro, grab her buttocks, and fondle\n\nher.\" Id. at 2.\n\n                  Standard ofreview and burden on summary judgment\n\n       In reviewing an order for summary judgment, this court engages in the same\n\ninquiry as the trial court.

According to Ms. Castro, no one ever\n\nwitnessed the abuse because Mr. Bushman \"never did it when anyone was around.\" CP\n\nat 41. Although there were other people in the room, including church elders, she\n\nexplained that Mr. Bushman would always touch her in a way that nobody could see it.\n\n       There is no disputed issue of notice of dangerous propensities; on this additional\n\nbasis, it was proper to grant summary judgment dismissing any claim based on a special\n\nrelationship between the church defendants and Mr. Bushman.\n\n                   The church defendants' relationship with Ms. Castro\n\n       Turning to the duty that can arise out of a special relationship with a victim, \"The\n\nduty to protect another person from the intentional or criminal actions of third parties\n\narises where one party is entrusted with the wellbeing of another.\" N.K, 175 Wn.

Because a child is compelled to attend school, \"the\n\nprotective custody of teachers is mandatorily substituted for that of the parent.\" McLeod,\n\n42 Wn.2d at 319; Niece, 131 Wn.2d at 44 (\"The rationale for such a duty [is] the\n\nplacement of the student in the care of the defendant with the resulting loss of the\n\nstudent's ability to protect himself or herself.\"); RESTATEMENT, supra, § 320 cmt. b (\"[A]\n\nchild while in school is deprived of the protection of his parents or guardian. Therefore,\n\nthe actor who takes custody of ... a child is properly required to give him the protection\n\nwhich the custody or the manner in which it is taken has deprived him.\").\n\n       In CJ. C, the court held that the relationship between a church and children within\n\nits custody analogous to that between a school and its pupils, noting that\n\n       [t]he children of a congregation may be delivered into the custody and care\n       of a church and its workers, whether it be on the premises for services and\n       Sunday school, or off the premises at church sponsored activities or youth\n\n                                               11 \n\n\fNo. 321487-II1\nBelen Castro v.

As in other agency relationships, a church chooses its officials,\n       directs their activities, and may restrict and control their conduct.\n\n138 Wn.2d at 722. It therefore held that the duties owed by a church to protect the\n\nchildren within its \"custody and care\" are similar to those owed by a school to its\n\nstudents. Id.; cf S.H.C. v. Lu, 113 Wn. App. 511,525-26,54 P.3d 174 (2002 (no special\n\nrelationship exists between an adult victim of sexual abuse and a religious organization\n\nassociated with the alleged abuser).\n\n       Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Ms. Castro, she has not\n\nshown that she was within the custody of any of the church defendants at the time of the\n\nalleged abuse.\n\n       We begin with the Watchtower defendants, who demonstrated that they have had\n\nno input into the activities of congregations since March of 2001. Ms. Castro presented\n\nno countervailing evidence. \"Without a custodial relationship, typically involving on­\n\nthe-ground control of day-to-day operations, an institutional defendant is not in a position\n\nto provide protection from physical danger as a school or church group does for\n\nchildren.\" N.K, 175 Wn. App. at 535.\n\n       Nor has Ms. Castro shown that she was delivered into the \"custody and care\" of\n\nthe Toppenish Congregation when she attended meetings at Kingdom Hall. The\n\nToppenish Congregation demonstrated that it does not have a separate program for\n\nchildren and does not segregate children from their parents during church sponsored\n\n\n                                               12 \n\n\fNo. 321487·III\nBelen Castro v.

It does not operate nursery schools, day·care centers, or summer camps.\n\nRather than being \"deprived of the protection of[a] parent[] or guardian\" as occurs when\n\na child is delivered into the custody and care of another, Restatement, §320 cmt. b, Ms.\n\nCastro admitted in deposition that she always attended church events at the Kingdom\n\nHall with her mother.\n\n       It is not enough for Ms. Castro to argue, as she does in her assignment of error,\n\nthat there is a dispute \"whether ... plaintiff was molested on the defendants' premises.\"\n\nThe exception to the rule of nonliability for defendants having a special relationship with\n\na victim is not a type of premises liability, it arises from the entrustment that gives rise to\n\na duty of protection. Because there was no disputed issue of Ms. Castro's having been in\n\nthe \"custody or care\" of the church defendants, there is no disputed issue of a special\n\nrelationship between those defendants and Ms. Castro that requires trial.\n\n       The summary judgment dismissal of Ms. Castro's complaint is affirmed.\n\n       A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\n\n\n\n                                               13 \n\n\fNo. 321487-III\nBelen Castro v.
