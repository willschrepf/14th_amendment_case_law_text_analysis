Plaintiffs-Appellants David\nPatterson and Dena Patterson (collectively referred to as “the Pattersons”), appeal the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Hudson Area\nSchools (“Hudson”) on the Pattersons’ claim that Hudson violated Title IX by allowing\ntheir son, DP,1 to be harassed by other students. The Pattersons’ sole argument is that\nthe district court erred in finding that, as a matter of law, Hudson was not deliberately\nindifferent to the alleged sexual harassment of DP.\n\n            Because we believe that the Pattersons have established that there is a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether Hudson was deliberately indifferent to the student-\non-student sexual harassment of DP, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n\n            Because this case involves a motion for summary judgment, we will detail the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Pattersons. DP was a\nstudent of Hudson schools during all relevant time periods. Beginning in 2002, during\nDP’s sixth-grade year, various classmates of DP began teasing DP, calling him names,\nand pushing and shoving him in the hallways. DP was pushed into lockers and called\nnames such as “queer,” “faggot,” and “pig” by various students on a daily basis. Joint\nAppendix (“J.A.”) at 668-70 (DP Dep. at 28-30). DP reported at least some of these\ninstances to the school and was told “kids will be kids, it’s middle school.” J.A. at 672\n(DP Dep. at 33). DP also began receiving psychological treatment from Dr. Gretchen\n\n\n\n\n            1\n                All individuals who were minors during the events described herein will be referred to by\ninitials.\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                         Page 3\n\n\nWarwick, Ph.D.2 According to Dr. Warwick, this harassment caused DP to be\ndistraught, anxious, and angry.\n\n        The type of harassment DP faced in sixth grade escalated during DP’s seventh-\ngrade year, when he was called names such as “fat,” “faggot,” “gay,” “queer,” “pig,” and\n“man boobs” on a daily basis. J.A. at 672-74 (DP Dep. at 33, 36-37). DP believes he\nwas called these names more than 200 times during his seventh-grade year. He also was\nfrequently pushed in the hallways. Additionally, DP was called “Mr. Clean” by his\npeers, a derogatory term that referred to DP’s supposed lack of pubic hair.\n\n        On one occasion, DP attempted to stop a female classmate, BC, from tormenting\nanother student. In response, BC slapped DP. Though, upon learning about the incident,\nband teacher Crystal Bough, told DP she “w[ould] take care of it,” the Pattersons were\nnever contacted by the school, nor did Ms. Bough report the incident to the principal.\nJ.A. at 678-79 (DP Dep. at 44-45). The Pattersons learned from DP that he had been\nassaulted at school. This incident led to further teasing, including teasing from\ngeography teacher John Redding, who asked DP later that same day in front of a full\nclass of students: “[H]ow does it feel to be hit by a girl[?]” J.A. at 680 (DP Dep. at 46).\nThe class laughed at DP.\n\n        DP wanted to quit school by the end of the first semester of seventh grade.\nPrincipal Greg Rozeveld3 offered to mentor DP through this hard time. However,\naccording to Mrs. Patterson, when DP first began to meet with Principal Rozeveld, DP\nwas released from class early to attend the meeting. The first visit went smoothly, but\nPrincipal Rozeveld was not in his office when DP arrived for the next three visits. On\nthese occasions, DP would return to class, which caused the teacher to decide to stop\nsending DP early to meet with Principal Rozeveld. Instead, she waited until she released\nthe problem students to go to the office to have their planners signed at the end of the\n\n\n        2\n          Dr. Warwick also treated DP when he was ten years old for problems stemming from his family\nlife. DP was no longer suffering from those problems when the teasing began in sixth grade.\n        3\n         The principal’s name is repeatedly misspelled in Hudson’s brief and the depositions as\n“Roosevelt.”\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                   Page 4\n\n\nschool day. After only a couple of weeks, DP expressed to Mrs. Patterson that he no\nlonger wanted to go with the problem students because other students were beginning\nto think he was a trouble-maker. DP stopped going to meet with Principal Rozeveld\nshortly thereafter.\n\n       These incidents caused DP to withdraw to the point that he began eating lunch\nin the bandroom by himself to avoid his tormentors. His interim grades were also low;\nhowever, DP did receive higher final grades.\n\n       The Pattersons and DP repeatedly reported several incidents of harassment to\nHudson. As the district court accurately detailed, DP and the Pattersons reported the\nfollowing incidents:\n\n       1. Sixth Grade:\n\n               a.        Dave Patterson spoke to a teacher about teasing directed\n                         at [DP] and how [DP] felt upset and humiliated.\n               b.        [The Pattersons] attended parent teacher conferences to\n                         talk about the name calling, etc.\n               c.        [The Pattersons] met with Principal Rozeveld to discuss\n                         the pushing, shoving and name calling of [DP].\n       2. Seventh Grade:\n               a.        [The Pattersons] and school counselor Susan Mansfield\n                         (“Ms. Mansfield”) discussed the fact that [DP] was\n                         having a hard time at school in November and/or\n                         December, 2002.\n               b.        [The Pattersons] and several teachers met to discuss\n                         [DP]’s anxiety about being (i) bullied and teased, (ii) the\n                         victim of sexually offensive name calling, and (iii)\n                         pushed into lockers.\n               c.        [The Pattersons] met with Principal Rozeveld just before\n                         Christmas 2002 about [DP] not wanting to come back to\n                         school because of teasing, bullying, and being called\n                         “gay”, “fag”, “queer.” [The Pattersons] also discussed\n                         the impact of those things on [DP]’s schooling, his\n                         feelings of being ostracized and his suffering grades.\n                         Names of perpetrators allegedly were provided. They\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 5\n\n\n                       also discussed the incident of [DP] being slapped by [BC]\n                       and Mr. Redding teasing [DP] about it.\n               d.      During the second semester of seventh grade, [the\n                       Pattersons] discussed problems [DP] endured with Ms.\n                       Mansfield and other staff.\n               e.      [The Pattersons] communicated with school staff\n                       throughout [DP]’s seventh grade year over academic and\n                       social issues. The [Pattersons] asked staff what, if\n                       anything, [DP] was doing to cause his peers to tease and\n                       taunt him. [The Pattersons] claim that they were told\n                       consistently that [DP] was doing nothing wrong.\nPatterson v. Hudson Area Schools, No. 05-74439, 2007 WL 4201137, *1-2 (E.D. Mich.\nNov. 28, 2007) (unpublished opinion and order).\n\n       During the summer between seventh grade and eighth grade, Ms. Mansfield,\nalong with social worker Tammy Cates, filled out a referral form to have DP evaluated\nfor special education services. This evaluation established that DP is emotionally\nimpaired as defined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400\net seq. An Individual Education Placement Team was convened and an individual\neducation program was developed. Pursuant to the program, DP was assigned to attend\nteacher Ted Adams’s resource room during one period of the day for all of the eighth-\ngrade year. Mr. Adams was helpful in teaching DP how to cope with his peers. All\nparties agree that DP had a successful eighth-grade year; by using the resource room, DP\nwas able to learn effectively.\n\n       However, DP’s ninth-grade year was not successful. DP’s individual education\nprogram was altered by Hudson. Notably, Hudson High School Principal Michael\nOsborne refused to allow DP to continue in Mr. Adams’s resource room because Mr.\nAdams was a middle-school resource-room teacher. Because DP’s eighth-grade year\nwas so successful, the Pattersons begged Hudson to allow DP to continue in Mr.\nAdams’s resource room, and even offered to have DP go to the middle school to meet\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                             Page 6\n\n\nwith Mr. Adams in Mr. Adams’s room, but this request was to no avail.4 Principal\nOsborne also “didn’t think that [the high school resource room] was the place for [DP].”\nJ.A. at 856 (Mrs. Patterson Dep. at 138). Thus, DP was not placed in any resource room\nfor his ninth-grade year.\n\n         The beginning of his ninth-grade year brought a return of the type of harassment\nDP faced in sixth and seventh grade. DP was again called names such as “gay,” “fat,”\n“fag,” and “queer” and was pushed and shoved in the hallways on a near daily basis.\nJ.A. at 729-30 (DP Dep. at 106-07). That fall, DP also was called “Mr. Clean” by three\nstudents. Those students were forced to meet with DP and Ms. Mansfield. The students\napologized, but DP did not think their apology was sincere. Those three students never\nbothered DP again.\n\n         DP also experienced new types of harassment during his ninth-grade year.\nDuring oral presentations in history class, a fellow student, SE, wrote a series of words\non the back of his note cards. These words created the phrase: “[DP] is a fag.” J.A. at\n708 (DP Dep. at 85). The entire class saw this phrase as the student used the cards for\nhis presentation, which caused the students to laugh at DP. SE was reported to Ms.\nMansfield and the history teacher, both of whom verbally reprimanded SE. SE never\nbothered DP again.\n\n         Shortly after the oral presentation incident, another student, JR, defaced DP’s\nplanner with the sexual phrases “I Æ penis,” “I lick it in the Ass,” “I Æ cock,” and “I’m\na mamma’s boy/I suck on her Nipple” and drawings of buttocks and a penis. J.A. at 311\n(Planner); J.A. at 721-24 (DP Dep. at 98-101). DP reported this incident to both the\nteacher and Principal Osborne. JR was verbally reprimanded by Ms. Mansfield and did\nnot bother DP again after this incident.\n\n\n\n\n         4\n          Though Mr. Adams worked for the middle school, the middle school and high school are housed\nin the same building, segregated into separate wings. According to DP, it was possible for him to stop by\nand meet with Mr. Adams in Mr. Adams’s room even after DP began high school. Mr. Adams did\nvolunteer to counsel DP for 25-30 minutes per week after DP began his ninth-grade year.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 7\n\n\n       In March 2005, unknown students broke into DP’s gym locker, removed his\nclothes and urinated on them, and threw his tennis shoes in the toilet. The locker was\nalso “covered with shaving cream spelling out sexually oriented words.” J.A. at 152\n(TW Aff. ¶ 14). Later that spring, two students, KM and JL, hung a “Mr. Clean” poster\non DP’s locker in the main hallway. Principal Osborne verbally reprimanded KM, and\nsuspended JL for one day. JL’s tougher punishment was due to the fact that he had\npreviously violated school rules in a manner unrelated to the “Mr. Clean” incident.\nNeither student bothered DP thereafter.\n\n       At some point after the “Mr. Clean” incident, DP’s locker in the main hallway\nwas vandalized by unknown students. These students used permanent markers and\nwrote words such as “gay,” “faggot,” and “queer” up and down the locker. J.A. at 805\n(Mr. Patterson Dep. at 55). Additionally, a picture of a penis being inserted into a\nrectum was drawn on the locker. The inside of the locker was also defaced with various\nderogatory phrases, such as “suck your mother’s tits” and “you suck dicks.” Id. After\nthe Pattersons reported the incident, Hudson officials cleaned the outside of the locker;\nDP had to ask Mr. Adams to help him clean the inside of the locker. Hudson conducted\nan investigation, but no individuals were ever punished.\n\n       The final incident of harassment occurred in late May 2005. After Friday night\njunior-varsity baseball practice, DP was sexually assaulted by a fellow teammate, LP,\nin the locker room. LP stripped naked, forced DP into a corner, jumped on DP’s\nshoulders, and rubbed his penis and scrotum on DP’s neck and face. While the assault\nwas occurring, another student, NH, blocked the exit so DP could not escape. DP\ninformed the Pattersons that evening about the attack. DP also informed Andy Wade,\nhis older brother and coach of the junior-varsity baseball team. The Pattersons informed\nPrincipal Osborne about the event on Saturday, during a baseball double-header. Both\nDP and LP played in the double-header, but DP claims he participated in the game only\nin order to prevent the team from having to forfeit.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 8\n\n\n       LP was allowed to attend school on Monday morning while Hudson officials\nbegan investigating the incident. At some point on Monday, LP was suspended for the\nremainder of the school year (just over eight days). However, LP was permitted to\nattend the annual spring sports banquet, one week after the assault. Principal Osborne\ntold Mr. Wade “to treat [LP] like any other player, to shake his hand as [Mr. Wade]\nwould other players and to act like nothing happened.” J.A. at 233 (Wade Aff. ¶ 23).\nOn June 10, 2005, LP was charged with assault with intent to commit a felony and\ncriminal sexual conduct in the second degree. He ultimately pleaded guilty to disorderly\nconduct. He was formally expelled from Hudson in August 2005 and has not been\npermitted to re-enter the Hudson school system. NH was verbally reprimanded for his\nrole in the assault. No criminal charges were filed against NH.\n\n       After the sexual assault, the varsity baseball coach, Jeremy Beal, held a team\nmeeting with both the junior varsity and the varsity baseball players. At the meeting,\nMr. Beal informed the players that they should “‘not joke around with guys who can’t\ntake a man joke.’” J.A. at 153 (TW Aff. ¶ 24 (quoting Mr. Beal)). DP was present at\nthe meeting.\n\n       Due to the continued harassment at Hudson, culminating in a sexual assault, DP\nclaims that he has been psychologically unable to set foot into a Hudson school building\nsince the end of his ninth-grade year. At the end of ninth grade, DP’s individual\neducation program was modified. For his tenth-grade year, “[DP] began receiving\ninstructional services from [Hudson] in the Sacred Heart School building,” a preschool-\nthrough-sixth-grade Catholic elementary school. J.A. at 160 (Johnston Aff. ¶ 36). DP’s\nhigh-school teachers would visit him occasionally to discuss his assignments, even\nthough “[DP] made numerous attempts to e-mail teachers and did not get responses.”\nJ.A. at 157 (Johnston Aff. ¶ 17). This year was not successful for DP.\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                            Page 9\n\n\n         For his eleventh- and twelfth-grade years, Hudson allowed DP to take college\nplacement courses at the local college. Originally, Hudson decided that one semester\nof college coursework would equal one semester of high school course work. However,\nafter Hudson was required to pay tuition, “[t]he standard changed to one semester\ncollege class equals one year high school class . . . .” J.A. at 197 (Mrs. Patterson Aff.\n¶ 7). This facilitated DP’s early graduation.\n\n         The Pattersons filed suit against Hudson and Kathy Malnar, Superintendent of\nSchools for Hudson, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan on November 22, 2005. The complaint alleged the following federal claims:\n(1) Hudson violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; (2) Hudson violated\nDP’s equal-protection rights; and (3) Ms. Malnar “failed to implement and enforce\nmeaningful procedures to ensure compliance with federal law and the policies of\n[Hudson] and failed to ensure the proper education and training of staff as to harassment\nissues.” J.A. at 17 (Compl. ¶¶ 28-30). The complaint also alleged various state claims.\n\n         Hudson and Malnar moved for summary judgment with respect to all claims,\nwhich the district court granted. Patterson, 2007 WL 4201137, at *13. With respect to\nthe Title IX claim against Hudson,5 the district court applied the three-part test expressed\nin Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), as articulated by\nthis court in Vance v. Spencer County Public School District, 231 F.3d 253 (6th Cir.\n2000). Patterson, 2007 WL 4201137, at *12. The district court determined that the\nPattersons had met their burden with regard to the first two parts of the test, but that the\nPattersons failed to show, as a matter of law, that Hudson’s responses to DP’s reported\nattacks were “clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.” Id. The district\ncourt concluded that, absent such a showing, the Pattersons could not prove that Hudson\nwas “deliberately indifferent to the alleged sexual harassment,” and thus summary\njudgment was appropriate. Id. The district court stressed that each time DP or the\nPattersons reported an incident and Hudson knew who the perpetrators were, Hudson\n\n         5\n          The district court dismissed the Title IX claim against Superintendent Malnar with the\nobservation that “there is no individual liability for a Title IX claim.” Patterson, 2007 WL 4201137, at\n*5 n.2. The Pattersons do not appeal this dismissal.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                  Page 10\n\n\nreprimanded or punished those individuals, who later did not bother DP. Id. at *8-9.\nThe district court further credited Hudson with implementing several proactive programs\nto combat harassment and bullying and with “assist[ing DP] in dealing with the issues\nhe faced in their schools.” Id. at *10. The Pattersons timely appealed, arguing only that\nthe district court erred in determinating that, as a matter of law, Hudson was not\ndeliberately indifferent. Thus, on appeal, we consider only the Title IX claim against\nHudson.\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Summary Judgment Standard of Review\n\n        We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. DiCarlo v.\nPotter, 358 F.3d 408, 414 (6th Cir. 2004). Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment is\nproper “if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any\naffidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “In deciding upon a\nmotion for summary judgment, we must view the factual evidence and draw all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.” Nat’l Enters., Inc. v. Smith,\n114 F.3d 561, 563 (6th Cir. 1997). “‘We examine the grant of summary judgment to\ndetermine whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission\nto a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.’”\nDiCarlo, 358 F.3d at 414 (quoting C.T. Massey v. Exxon Corp., 942 F.2d 340, 342 (6th\nCir.1991)) (second set of internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nB. Title IX Claim\n\n        Title IX provides that, “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial\nassistance . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1681. Title IX can support a cause of action for a student’s\nclaim of student-on-student sexual harassment against a recipient of federal funds.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                  Page 11\n\n\nDavis, 526 U.S. at 633. To establish a prima facie case of student-on-student sexual\nharassment, the plaintiff must demonstrate each of the following elements:\n\n        (1)     the sexual harassment was so severe, pervasive, and objectively\n                offensive that it could be said to deprive the plaintiff of access to\n                the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school,\n        (2)     the funding recipient had actual knowledge of the sexual\n                harassment, and\n        (3)     the funding recipient was deliberately indifferent to the\n                harassment.\nVance, 231 F.3d at 258-59 (quoting Soper v. Hoben, 195 F.3d 845, 854 (6th Cir. 1999)\n(citing Davis, 526 U.S. at 633)).\n\n        The district court found that the Pattersons met their burden with regard to parts\none and two of the test, but that, as a matter of law, the Pattersons did not establish that\nHudson was “deliberately indifferent to the alleged sexual harassment against [DP].”\nPatterson, 2007 WL 4201137, at *12. The only issue on appeal is whether Hudson’s\nactions require us to hold, as a matter of law, that Hudson has not acted with deliberate\nindifference. We conclude that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                              Page 12\n\n\nPattersons,6 the Pattersons have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding\nwhether Hudson’s actions were deliberately indifferent.\n\n         A recipient of federal funds that remains “deliberately indifferent to known acts\nof harassment” is liable for damages under Title IX. Vance, 231 F.3d at 260. “[T]he\ndeliberate indifference must, at a minimum, ‘cause [students] to undergo’ harassment or\n‘make them liable or vulnerable’ to it.” Id. (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 645) (first\nalteration in Vance, second alteration in Davis). “[A] plaintiff may demonstrate [a]\ndefendant’s deliberate indifference to discrimination ‘only where the recipient’s\nresponse to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known\ncircumstances.’” Vance, 231 F.3d at 260 (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 648). A recipient\nneed not “[purge its] schools of actionable peer harassment” or “engage in particular\n\n\n         6\n           This is a diametrically different approach than the one taken by the dissent. Although the dissent\nprofesses to be using the correct legal standard, it repeatedly weighs evidence and decides controverted\nissues in favor of Hudson, the moving party. See, e.g., Dissent at 24-25 (deciding that the resource room\nis nothing more than “the equivalent of study hall” and, therefore, could not cause a reduction of\nharassment); 25-26 (belittling the Pattersons’ evidence in regard to the lack of and effectiveness of\nproactive programs). When we review a grant of summary judgment, we are forbidden to weigh the\nevidence or to draw the inferences the dissent insists upon drawing. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 255 (1986) (“Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of\nlegitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether he is ruling on a\nmotion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict. The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed,\nand all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” (emphasis added)). Our job is to look at the\nfacts and consider them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, regardless of our own personal\nviews of how much credence we would give a particular piece of evidence if we were on a jury. The\ndissent’s steadfast determination to act as a juror is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.\n          A clear example of the dissent’s misunderstanding and misapplication of the governing standard\nis found in the assertion that the undisputed facts support a conclusion that the resource room itself did\nnothing to reduce the harassment of DP. The record clearly shows and both parties admit that, when the\nresource room was used, DP suffered less harassment. Whether it was the use of the room or the person\nwho ran the room that caused this undisputed decreased harassment is a question of interpretation.\nBecause we must draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, it is legally incorrect for the dissent\nto infer that Mr. Adams himself, and not the use of the resource room in general, aided DP. This same\nevidence supports the inference that it was the use of the resource room itself that was beneficial to DP\nand, because that inference favors the Pattersons, that is the inference the Supreme Court demands we\ndraw. The dissent’s repeated claim, unsupported by the record, that all the inferences it draws in Hudson’s\nfavor are “established by the undisputed facts,” see, e.g., Dissent at 24, does not magically give the dissent\ncarte blanche to view controverted issues in the light most favorable to Hudson.\n          Furthermore, even assuming that the inference that the dissent insists upon drawing was legally\npermissible, we believe that a reasonable juror could still find that Hudson was deliberately indifferent.\nAlthough Mr. Adams worked for the middle school, the middle school and the high school were housed\nin the same building, “connected by a short hall.” J.A. at 697 (DP Dep. at 74). DP testified that, during\nhis ninth-grade year, it was possible for him to meet Mr. Adams on the same basis he did while in middle\nschool. Additionally, Mrs. Patterson testified that the Pattersons “begged” Hudson to allow DP to meet\nwith Mr. Adams and even offered to have DP meet with Mr. Adams in Mr. Adams’s room in the middle\nschool. J.A. at 855 (Mrs. Patterson Dep. at 137). Given the effectiveness of the eighth-grade resource\nroom and the willingness of the Pattersons to have DP go back to the middle school to utilize Mr. Adams’s\nservices, a reasonable juror could conclude that Hudson’s refusal to continue the resource room program\nfor DP constitutes deliberate indifference.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                  Page 13\n\n\ndisciplinary action” to avoid Title IX liability. Vance, 231 F.3d at 260. “Furthermore,\ncourts should not second guess the disciplinary decisions that school administrators\nmake.” Id. at 260. However:\n\n       where a school district has knowledge that its remedial action is\n       inadequate and ineffective, it is required to take reasonable action in light\n       of those circumstances to eliminate the behavior. Where a school district\n       has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective, and it\n       continues to use those same methods to no avail, such district has failed\n       to act reasonably in light of the known circumstances.\nId. at 261 (emphasis added).\n\n       Relying on this language, one district court determined that, where a student\nsuffered four years of harassment from various other students, a school district’s “tactic\nof merely talking to and warning students who harassed plaintiff,” with occasional\ninvestigation into “some of the more significant incidents and even eventually\nproactively sp[eaking] to students and teachers in an effort to prevent further incidents\n. . . raised a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to withstand summary judgment.”\nTheno v. Tonganoxie Unified Sch. Dist. No. 464, 377 F. Supp. 2d 952, 966 (D. Kan.\n2005). Theno is illustrative. In Theno, the plaintiff was repeatedly harassed beginning\nin his seventh-grade year and ending only when he left school during his eleventh-grade\nyear. Id. at 954-61. The harassment consisted of name calling (“faggot,” “queer,”\n“pussy,” “jack-off boy,” etc.), persistent joking regarding plaintiff being caught\nmasturbating in the school bathroom (which was untrue), and some physical altercations\n(pushing, shoving, tripping, fistfights). Id. Most student harassers were merely given\nverbal warnings or reprimanded by the school; however, a few of the more serious\noffenders were more severely disciplined. Id. Importantly, “each time the school\ndisciplined a known harasser, to the best of the school’s knowledge that particular\nharasser ceased harassing plaintiff (with limited exceptions).” Id. at 965. The school\nalso began to speak proactively with students and teachers regarding harassment during\nthe plaintiff’s tenth-grade year. Id. at 959-60.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 14\n\n\n        The school district in Theno argued that, as a matter of law, its responses could\nnot be deemed clearly unreasonable. Id. at 965. The district court disagreed, stressing\nthat\n\n        this is not a case that involved a few discrete incidents of harassment. It\n        involved severe and pervasive harassment that lasted for years, with\n        other students engaging in the same form of harassment after those who\n        were counseled had stopped, and the school rarely took any disciplinary\n        measures above and beyond merely talking to and warning the harassers.\nId. at 966. Though the school took more aggressive measures in the later years of the\nharassment, the district court noted that\n\n        [b]y that time, the harassment had been going on for a number of years\n        without the school handing out any meaningful disciplinary measures to\n        deter other students from perpetuating the cycle of harassment. While\n        the court recognizes that the school was not legally obligated to put an\n        end to the harassment, a reasonable jury certainly could conclude that\n        at some point during the four-year period of harassment the school\n        district’s standard and ineffective response to the known harassment\n        became clearly unreasonable.\nId. (emphasis added). The district court cited Vance to support this determination. Id.\nIt also concluded that Vance supported a finding that “whether the school’s belatedly\nstepped-up efforts were ‘too little, too late’ is a question for the jury.” Id.\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                                Page 15\n\n\n         Theno’s reliance on Vance is persuasive.7 In Vance, when confronted with a\npost-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court upheld the jury\nverdict in favor of the plaintiff, a female student who suffered harassment over many\nschool years perpetrated by various students, and we affirmed. Vance, 231 F.3d at 256-\n58. The school district responded to the plaintiff’s harassment complaints by talking to\nthe perpetrators, to no avail. Id. at 262. We rejected the defendant’s argument that a\n\n\n         7\n            Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, we rely on Vance in making our holding. However, one\ncannot escape the striking similarities between the instant case and Theno, a case that also relied on Vance.\nThe dissent’s attempt to minimize the usefulness of district court opinions does not change this fact. We\ntherefore believe that Theno is a helpful tool to illustrate why the holding in Vance supports our holding\ntoday.\n           More important, the case the dissent cites as “very similar and persuasive,” Dissent at 29, Doe\nv. Bellefonte Area School District, 106 F. App’x 798 (3d Cir. 2004), an unpublished Third Circuit opinion,\nis different from this case in two material respects. First, in Doe, the school district did more to prevent\nthe systematic harassment of Doe than Hudson did in instant case. Specifically, the school district gave\nDoe “a special means of reporting any additional harassment,” circulated memoranda specific to Doe’s\nharassment issues to the faculty in the hopes of preventing future harassment, and “held assemblies and\nenacted policies addressing peer-to-peer harassment.” Doe, 106 F. App’x at 800. As outlined above, when\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Pattersons, we observe that Hudson did not perform any\nof these services during DP’s ninth-grade year. Thus, Doe is distinguishable from the instant case by the\neffort the school district devoted to preventing future harassment.\n           Second, and of greater weight, is the fact that the Third Circuit is not bound by Vance, and thus\nDoe is of little value. Moreover, the dissent’s contention that Doe tacitly rejected our interpretation of\nVance is unavailing, given that the actual opinion in Doe makes no mention of Vance. Therefore, even\nif the Doe panel thoroughly considered and rejected this interpretation of Vance, Doe provides no\nreasoning regarding why it hypothetically rejected that interpretation that we may consider and evaluate.\n           Furthermore, the dissent’s assertion that “a decision of a three-judge panel from a sister court of\nappeals has to be more persuasive than a single district judge’s opinion from outside this circuit,” Dissent\nat 29 n.7, is completely unfounded and demeaning to district court jurists. Under such a theory, a decision\nfrom Learned Hand while sitting on the bench in the Southern District of New York would be categorically\ninferior to any differing opinion rendered by a random three-judge panel from any circuit. Judges and\ncases differ, and such a bright-line rule that imports inferiority without regard to the depth of analysis\npresent in an opinion or to the similarity of facts with the case at bar is unwarranted and disrespectful to\nthe numerous talented district judges.\n           Additionally, the dissent’s reliance on S.S. v. Eastern Kentucky University, 532 F.3d 445 (6th Cir.\n2008), is misplaced. S.S. involved a student claiming peer-on-peer harassment in violation of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794. The panel\napplied the Davis test to the claim and held that the school district was not deliberately indifferent as a\nmatter of law. However, the school district in S.S., like the school district in Doe, did more than Hudson\ndid in this case to prevent future harassment: The school district “arrang[ed] for outside speakers to talk\nto the students about name-calling, identif[ied] related topics for discussion at school assemblies and in\nsmall groups,” “call[ed] the police,” and “call[ed] the other students’ . . . parents to discuss the disciplinary\nproblems.” S.S., 532 F.3d at 455. The dissent insists that both Doe and S.S. are factually identical to this\ncase, claiming that Hudson has done everything that the school districts in those two cases have done.\nDissent at 29-33 & n.8. However, that is true only if one views the evidence in the light most favorable\nto Hudson, not when one views the evidence in the light most favorable to the Pattersons. Because the\nlatter is the legally correct view, Hudson is not on par with the school districts in Doe and S.S.\n           Moreover, the panel in S.S. stressed that “[e]ven viewing the record in the light most favorable\nto S.S., proof is lacking as to what [the defendant] could have or should have done differently in order to\nbring the peer-on-peer harassment to a stop.” Id. As explained below, that is not the case in the instant\nappeal; it is undisputed that Hudson was fully aware that use of the resource room in eighth grade impacted\nthe amount of harassment that DP suffered and discontinuing the resource room in ninth grade correlated\nwith a return to high levels of harassment. Hudson Br. at 8-22. Thus, a reasonable jury could find that\nHudson knew how to combat the harassment of DP and simply chose not to implement that known method\nof success. Thus, S.S. is distinguishable.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                   Page 16\n\n\nschool district is not deliberately indifferent “as long as a school district does something\nin response to harassment,” id. at 260, emphasizing that “once [a school district] had\nknowledge that its response was inadequate, it was required to take further reasonable\naction in light of the circumstances to avoid new liability,” id. at 262. We believe this\nlanguage makes clear that, even though a school district takes some action in response\nto known harassment, if further harassment continues, a jury is not precluded by law\nfrom finding that the school district’s response is clearly unreasonable. We cannot say\nthat, as a matter of law, a school district is shielded from liability if that school district\nknows that its methods of response to harassment, though effective against an individual\nharasser, are ineffective against persistent harassment against a single student. Such a\nsituation raises a genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide.\n\n        Furthermore, when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Pattersons,\nwe conclude that there are striking similarities between the instant case and Theno.\nHere, as in Theno, DP was repeatedly harassed over a number of years. Hudson\nresponded to this harassment largely by giving verbal reprimands to the perpetrators.\nThough typically reprimands largely stopped harassment by the reprimanded student,\nthey did not stop other students from harassing DP. This pervasive harassment escalated\nto criminal sexual assault. Moreover, Hudson was aware that the verbal reprimands\nregarding a few students were not stopping the overall harassment of DP; it is undisputed\nthat DP continued to have problems with other students, even after some were\nreprimanded or even disciplined, and DP reported those continuing problems to Hudson.\nHudson Br. at 8-22 (detailing DP’s reported harassment).\n\n        One key difference between Theno and this case is that Hudson did at one point\nemploy a system that successfully combated the harassment of DP, i.e., the use of the\nresource room during eighth grade. In the instant case, a reasonable jury could thus\nconclude that Hudson not only was aware of what did not work, but also was aware of\nwhat had worked to insulate DP from the harassment. However, in ninth grade, Hudson\ndiscontinued the use of the resource room. The cycle of harassment then intensified, and\nHudson’s only response was to employ the same type of verbal reprimands that it had\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                            Page 17\n\n\nused unsuccessfully in response to the sixth- and seventh-grade harassment. Given that\nHudson knew that its methods were ineffective, but did not change those methods, “a\nreasonable jury certainly could conclude that at some point during the . . . period of\nharassment[,] the school district’s standard and ineffective response to the known\nharassment became clearly unreasonable.” Theno, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 966.\n\n         Hudson makes several arguments claiming that its actions were not clearly\nunreasonable as a matter of law, none of which are persuasive. Notably, Hudson does\nnot attempt to distinguish Theno from the instant case, but rather cites four different\ndistrict court cases it believes are more instructive.                     Each of these cases is\ndistinguishable from the instant case or espouses law contrary to our precedent.8\n\n         The thrust of Hudson’s argument is that Hudson dealt successfully with each\nidentified perpetrator; therefore, it asserts that it cannot be liable under Title IX as a\nmatter of law. This argument misses the point.9 As explained above, Hudson’s success\nwith individual students did not prevent the overall and continuing harassment of DP,\na fact of which Hudson was fully aware, and thus Hudson’s isolated success with\nindividual perpetrators cannot shield Hudson from liability as a matter of law. Theno,\n\n\n\n         8\n            Johnson v. Independent School District No. 47, 194 F. Supp. 2d 939 (D. Minn. 2002), involved\nan inappropriate phrase (“one time at band camp”) placed next to a picture in the school yearbook of\nplaintiff playing her flute. Id. at 941-43. When the school became aware of the sexual nature of the\nphrase, it attempted to cover the phrase with nonremovable stickers, a technique that was successful in the\npast. Id. at 942-43. Unfortunately, the stickers proved to be easily removable. Id. Johnson is\ndistinguishable from the instant case because Hudson, when confronted with harassment of DP in ninth\ngrade, implemented a system that it knew from past experience did not work.\n          Hudson also cites Johnson and Wilson v. Beaumont Independent School District, 144 F. Supp.\n2d 690 (E.D. Tex. 2001), for the proposition that so long as a school district takes some action, that is\nenough to show that the school district was not deliberately indifferent. Hudson Br. at 30-31. We rejected\nthis proposition in Vance. Vance, 231 F.3d at 260.\n          Finally, Hudson cites KF’s Father v. Marriott, No. CA 00-0215-C, 2007 WL 228353 (S.D. Ala.\nFeb. 23, 2001), and Vaird v. School District of Philadelphia, No. CIV. A. 99-2727, 2000 WL 576441 (E.D.\nPa. May 12, 2000), as examples of what does not constitute deliberate indifference; however, these cases\nare both distinguishable because both involved only one perpetrator, not harassment by several individuals\naimed at a single student. KF’s Father, 2007 WL 228353, at *16; Vaird, 2000 WL 576441, at *1.\n         9\n          The dissent likewise misses this point. On four separate occasions, the dissent claims that\nHudson was “100% effective” in dealing with the harassment of DP. Dissent at 22, 28, 29, 33. However,\none can make such a statement only if he ignores the realities of DP’s situation. The reprimands of a few\nindividual harassers did not stop harassment by the many, and it is undisputed that Hudson was aware of\nthis fact. Hudson Br. at 8-22 (detailing DP’s reported harassment). Vance teaches that, in such\ncircumstances, a jury may legally find that a school district has “failed to act reasonably in light of the\nknown circumstances.” Vance, 231 F.3d at 261.\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                            Page 18\n\n\n377 F. Supp. 2d at 966. It is for a jury to decide whether Hudson’s actions were “clearly\nunreasonable.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 649.\n\n         Hudson also asserts that it proactively dealt with the issue of harassment and\nbullying through a sexual-harassment policy in the student handbook, from which\nteachers and students were instructed, and school-wide programing dealing with\nharassment and bullying. However, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the\nPattersons, we cannot consider any of Hudson’s claimed programs.10\n\n         Although Hudson’s brief and oral argument before us attempted to minimize the\nharassment suffered by DP, Hudson does not argue that the district court improperly\nfound that the Pattersons had met their burden of showing that the harassment of DP was\nsevere and pervasive. Thus, we do not consider this issue. Therefore, we hold that,\nbecause Hudson had knowledge that its methods for dealing with the overall student-on-\nstudent sexual harassment of DP were ineffective, but continued to employ only those\nmethods, the Pattersons have shown a genuine issue of material fact as to the third part\nof the Davis test that is sufficient to defeat Hudson’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n         We emphasize that, at this stage of the litigation, the Pattersons are not required\nto prove that Hudson is actually liable for the continued harassment of DP (i.e., that\nHudson’s actions were clearly unreasonable), but only that there is a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether Hudson was deliberately indifferent to the harassment. In\n\n\n         10\n            First, the Pattersons presented evidence that the sexual-harassment policy was not explained\nto every student and teacher. See, e.g., J.A. at 145 (Kline Aff. ¶ 10); J.A. at 228 (Wade Aff. ¶¶ 9.a-9.b).\nSecond, of the programs listed by Hudson—“Character Counts,” “40 Developmental Assets,” “Bang,\nBang, You’re Dead,” the speakers series, the individual and group counseling sessions, “Flirting and\nHurting Program,” “Concerned About Teen Sexuality (‘CATS’) Program,” “Peer Mediation Program,”\nand “Positive Peers”—the only ones that actually dealt with student-on-student sexual harassment and\nbullying (as opposed to sexual relationships between males and females) and were actually implemented\nwere “Bang, Bang, You’re Dead” and “Flirting and Hurting.” See J.A. at 285 (Stutzky Aff. ¶ 7.c.vii); J.A.\nat 493-98 (Mansfield Dep. at 27-32). Third, the Pattersons’ expert explained that one-time events such\nas “Bang, Bang, You’re Dead,” “no matter how powerfully presented, have not been demonstrated to have\na significant lasting impact on a school’s climate or culture or reducing or eliminating bullying or\nharassment.” J.A. at 285 (Stutzky Aff. ¶ 7.c.viii). Fourth, the Pattersons presented evidence that the\n“Flirting and Hurting” program was not always taught to students. Compare J.A. at 228-230 (Wade Aff.\n¶¶ 9 and 9.e) (stating that Wade taught health during the 2004-2005 school year and did not teach the\n“Flirting and Hurting” program), with J.A. at 495-97 (Mansfield Dep. at 29-31) (explaining that “Flirting\nand Hurting” was integrated into health classes in the 2003-2004 school year). Thus, when viewing these\nprograms in the light most favorable to the Pattersons, we must assume that Hudson was not engaged in\nany proactive activities.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.               Page 19\n\n\nother words, the Pattersons must show only that a reasonably jury could find that Hudson\nviolated Title IX. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Pattersons, we\nbelieve the Pattersons have met this burden.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       Because we conclude that the Pattersons have demonstrated that there is a\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether Hudson’s responses to DP’s reported\nstudent-on-student sexual harassment were clearly unreasonable in light of the known\ncircumstances, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment and REMAND for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v.

I disagree. The single issue in this appeal\nis whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant, Hudson\nArea Schools, was deliberately indifferent to the harassment directed at DP. A school\ndistrict is not deliberately indifferent unless it knows of and disregards an excessive risk\nto the student’s health or safety. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S. Ct.\n1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994).1 It must be aware of facts from which the inference\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and, further, it must actually\ndraw that inference. See id. Deliberate indifference presupposes that the school knows\nof a Title IX violation, but it “refuses to take action to bring the recipient into\ncompliance. The premise, in other words, is an official decision by the recipient not to\nremedy the violation.” Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. School Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290, 118\nS. Ct. 1989, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1998); see also, e.g., Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of\nEduc., 526 U.S. 629, 651, 654, 119 S. Ct. 1661, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1999) (deliberate\nindifference established when school district knows of peer harassment, but it “refus[es]\nto take any action” and “ma[kes] no effort whatsoever” to end the harassment); accord\nHorner v. Kentucky High School Athletic Ass’n, 206 F.3d 685, 692 (6th Cir. 2000)\n(noting that deliberate indifference is shown when “school officials are aware of the\nmisconduct but do nothing to stop it. . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n        This standard “does not mean a collection of sloppy, or even reckless, oversights;\nit means evidence showing an obvious, deliberate indifference to [the] abuse.” See Doe\nv. Claiborne County, Tenn., 103 F.3d 495, 508 (6th Cir. 1996). Ultimately, a Title IX\nrecipient is deliberately indifferent to peer-on-peer harassment “only where the\nrecipient’s response to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of\nthe known circumstances.” See Davis, supra, 526 U.S. at 648. The response must be of\n\n\n        1\n          Farmer is an Eighth Amendment prisoner case, but the standard is “applicable to the school\ncontext.” Williams ex rel. Hart v. Paint Valley Local School Dist., 400 F.3d 360, 368 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                               Page 21\n\n\nsuch a degree that it facilitated or “subjected” the victim to harassment. See id. at 644-\n47. Although this is a sad case, the plaintiffs have clearly not met the high legal standard\nfor deliberate indifference. See Gebser, supra, 524 U.S. at 304 (Stevens, J., dissenting)\n(noting that only “few Title IX plaintiffs . . . will be able to recover damages under this\nexceedingly high standard”).2\n\n         The relevant inquiry in determining whether the school district was deliberately\nindifferent is to examine its responses to the known instances of harassment. DP claims\nthat he was harassed almost every day, but the record reflects that he did not report much\nof the harassment.3 When he did report the harassment at times throughout the years, he\nsometimes could not identify the harassers.4 Obviously, the school district is not\nresponsible for failing to stop harassment of which it was not made aware, nor can it be\nheld responsible for failing to punish harassment by unknown individuals.\n\n         When DP complained and the harassers were identified, however, the defendant\nresponded to each incident with action appropriate to the nature and severity of the\nharassment. The students who called DP “Mr. Clean” were taken to the school\ncounselor’s office for a meeting with DP, where they were counseled and then\napologized. The student who wrote the offensive remarks on the back of his note cards\n\n\n\n         2\n           The Supreme Court has emphasized that courts “must bear in mind that schools are unlike the\nadult workplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that would be unacceptable among\nadults. Indeed, at least early on, students are still learning how to interact appropriately with their peers.”\nSee Davis, supra, 526 U.S. at 651 (citation omitted). I do not minimize the harassment at issue for it was\nvery serious, but it appears that at least some of DP’s peer-related problems were caused by his heightened\nsensitivity to the unfortunate reality that “in the school setting, students often engage in insults, banter,\nteasing, shoving, pushing, and gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students subjected to it.” See\nid. at 651-52. According to his teachers, DP was at times highly sensitive and had poor social skills which\nmade it difficult for him to “distinguish[] between camaraderie and being picked on,” which, in turn,\nalienated him from the other students. See Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) at 553-54; accord id. at 102. It should\nbe noted that these socialization and peer-related problems existed long before he entered the Hudson\nschool district, apparently even dating back to daycare. See id. at 532.\n         3\n          To point to one example, the majority states that DP was teased, called names, and pushed and\nshoved “on a daily basis” while he was in the sixth grade. Maj. Op. at 2. Despite the daily nature of this\nharassment, DP admits that he made only “a total of a couple reports regarding [the] incidents that took\nplace” during that school year: one or two reports to Principal Greg Rozeveld and teacher Gwen Marry.\nSee J.A. at 648.\n         4\n           DP was unable to say, for example, who vandalized his hall locker. The school conducted an\ninvestigation into the matter, as the majority acknowledges, see Maj. Op. at 7, but it was unable to\ndetermine who was responsible.\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                              Page 22\n\n\nwas swiftly reprimanded and he, too, apologized. The student who defaced DP’s planner\nwas orally reprimanded, while a student who taped the “Mr. Clean” poster to his locker\nwas suspended from school for one day. With respect to the locker room assault after\nbaseball practice, NH was reprimanded and his parents were notified (even though DP\ntold the authorities that NH was only “playing around”), and LP was suspended for the\nrest of the school year, criminally prosecuted, and formally expelled. Significantly, as\nthe district court observed, and as the majority appears to recognize, no identified\nperpetrator ever harassed or caused problems for DP after being disciplined by the\nschool. There were no repeat offenders, so the only reasonable conclusion from the\nundisputed facts in the record is that the school’s actions, with respect to those offenders,\nwere 100% effective.5\n\n         In addition to investigating all the reported claims of harassment and punishing\nthe offenders so that they never once re-offended, the defendant took additional steps to\nhelp DP. For example, his science teacher, Ted Adams, agreed to be extra vigilant in\nlooking out for him. See J.A. at 825. DP’s mother testified that this gave her “a new\nsense of relief” because “Mr. Adams was always in the hall watching for [DP], keeping\nan eye out for him.” Id. Other teachers agreed to keep watch on him as well. Id. at 761,\n813. Another of his teachers offered suggestions on how to help DP better cope with his\npeer-related problems, such as enrolling in extracurricular social programs like band,\nscience olympiad, and other activities. Id. at 525, 817. School counselor Susan\nMansfield invited DP to attend both group and individual counseling sessions for\nstudents having problems with their peer relationships. Id. at 470-71. The school district\nalso took the unusual step of sending a school social worker and psychologist to his\nhome to meet and evaluate him during his (and their) summer break. Id. at 374, 570. He\nwas given extra time to take his exams, he was given seating preferences to avoid\n\n\n         5\n           The incident that took place in the seventh grade when DP intervened in a dispute between two\nfemale students and, in the process, was slapped by one of the girls, see Maj. Op. at 3, does not give rise\nto an inference of deliberate indifference. He told the teacher what occurred, but he claims that nothing\nwas done. Assuming that to be true, it is apparent that the slap was unrelated to the type of harassment at\nissue in this case. By his own testimony, DP was not the intended victim --- he got involved because he\nwas defending the other girl --- nor does it appear that this incident was in any way related, or similar, to\nthe harassment which is the subject of this litigation. Indeed, he never had any other problems with the girl.\nSee J.A. at 677-79.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 23\n\n\nstudents with whom he might have problems, and he was referred to a social worker for\ncounseling several times each month. See id. at 42. The school provided DP with an\nindividualized evaluation program following his ninth grade year. He earned As and Bs,\nand, as part of his curriculum, he took college courses (at school district expense) which\nallowed him to take advanced classes, to become fluent in Japanese, and to graduate\nearly from high school.\n\n       The school took additional steps that warrant closer review and discussion. First,\nPrincipal Greg Rozeveld offered to meet DP every day to provide assistance while he\nwas in middle school, but the majority seems to fault the school district for the timing\nand circumstances under which these meetings occurred. See Maj. Op. at 3-4. When DP\nwas in the seventh grade, the Pattersons spoke to Principal Rozeveld and told him that\nthey were planning to withdraw DP from school. The parties had a very long meeting\nduring which, according to Ms. Patterson, Mr. Rozeveld said that he “really hated to lose\nthe good ones, the good kids,” and he asked if there was “anything he could do to help.”\nHe offered to meet and counsel DP every day and “start interceding himself.” DP’s\nmother explained that Principal Rozeveld offered to meet with DP for two interrelated\nreasons: he wanted to help him academically, and he wanted to “build[] the trust” so that\nDP would not feel like he was “all alone.” The Pattersons were “grateful for somebody\noffering to help,” so they accepted Principal Rozeveld’s offer and kept DP in school.\nDP’s mother testified that the first time DP met Principal Rozeveld it was “very nice.”\nHowever, the next two or three times that DP went to his office, Mr. Rozeveld was in\na meeting or otherwise unavailable. DP’s mother explained to DP that “sometimes that\nis going to happen, emergencies come up.” It appears that because Principal Rozeveld\n(as head of the middle school) could not always be guaranteed to be in his office at the\ntime DP’s teachers sent him down during class, it was decided that DP would be sent\ndown at the end of the day along with the students who were having their planners\nsigned. DP did this and met with Principal Rozeveld for a number of weeks, but DP then\ndecided he did not want to continue going because he was concerned the other students\nmight start to think he was a “problem student.” See J.A. at 844-850. That was his\nchoice. It is undisputed that Principal Rozeveld offered to, and did, regularly meet with\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                         Page 24\n\n\nand counsel DP until DP stopped the sessions. It is also undisputed that Principal\nRozeveld did this to keep DP in school, to improve his grades, to build his trust, and to\nprevent him from feeling alienated. That DP might have preferred to meet with Mr.\nRozeveld at a different time and under different circumstances does not take away from\nthe fact that --- rather than being deliberately indifferent --- Mr. Rozeveld was\nunquestionably trying to help DP through this difficult time.\n\n        Second, the school district placed DP in a “resource room” for part of each day\nwhile he was in the eighth grade which, everyone agrees, worked very well for him. The\nmajority states that the resource room reduced the actual amount of harassment directed\nat DP, see Maj. Op. at 15-17, n.7, and it faults the school district for discontinuing that\nroom once DP entered high school. See id. at 5-6, 15-17. The undisputed facts do not\nsupport such an inference. It is true that the resource room was available to DP for one\nhour each day while he was in the eighth grade. He went there to meet his science\nteacher, Mr. Adams, and “just kind of wind my day down with him, do my homework.”\nSee J.A. 621-22. It was the equivalent of study hall. Because DP claims that the\nharassment occurred in his classes, in between his classes, in the hallways, at lunch, and\nin the locker areas, it simply does not follow that a study hall for an hour each day could\nhave reduced the harassment to an appreciable degree. In fact, not even DP claims that\nit did. Rather, he testified that eighth grade was “going good” on its own, and he had “no\nclue” what caused this positive turnaround. See id.6 What is established by the\nundisputed facts is that the time spent with Mr. Adams helped DP cope with his peers\nwhich, in turn, helped him better deal with the harassment and learn more effectively.\nIndeed, DP testified that even though he was sometimes picked on and called names in\nthe eighth grade, the harassment did not “bother” him during the time that he was\nmeeting regularly with Mr. Adams. See J.A. at 622. This distinction between meeting\n\n\n        6\n          I emphasize that it was DP himself who testified that the resource room was the equivalent of\na study hall (“I would just kind of wind my day down with [Mr. Adams], do my homework”), and,\nfurthermore, not even he claims that it reduced the actual harassment (“Q: What happened to cause that\nturnaround? A: I have no clue.”). J.A. at 621-22. DP explained that other students in the resource room\nneeded help with their homework, but he “just needed Mr. Adams in there in case I needed him.” DP thus\nbenefitted from time in the resource room because Mr. Adams was his “go-to person” and “one of the only\nstaff members at the school that I felt like I could trust.” See DP’s Depo. at 67-69.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 25\n\n\nwith Mr. Adams and being in the resource room is important, for there is nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that the resource room itself reduced the actual amount of harassment,\nas the majority suggests. Rather, it appears that the resource room was effective because\nof Mr. Adams. DP could not continue getting daily assistance from Mr. Adams once he\nentered high school, however, because Mr. Adams worked exclusively for the middle\nschool. Nevertheless, even though he did not work for the high school, the defendant\ngranted Mr. Adams special authorization to meet with DP for 20-30 minutes each week\n(which he did), even after DP entered the ninth grade. See J.A. 854-57. If the defendant\nwas deliberately indifferent to DP and his situation, surely it would not have authorized\nthe middle school science teacher to meet and counsel him every week after he started\nhigh school. No reasonable finder of fact could find that there was deliberate\nindifference with respect to Mr. Adams and the resource room.\n\n       And lastly, the school district had various policies and programs dealing with\nharassment and bullying. All students were well aware that such conduct would not be\ntolerated. The student athletic code, for example, provided that students were expected\nto “behave appropriately in the locker room. Horseplay and vandalism will not be\ntolerated by the coaches or the athletic department.” See J.A. 54. Violations of this\npolicy were punishable as provided for under the code. The student handbook (which\napplied to all students, not just athletes) prohibited vandalism, physical confrontation,\nand inappropriate language, and it also provided for punishment to violators. See id. at\n82-88. There were two school-wide programs implemented which dealt specifically with\npeer harassment and bullying, “Bang, Bang, You’re Dead” and “Flirting and Hurting.”\nThe majority refuses to consider the policies and programs because it finds evidence that\nthey were “not explained to every student and teacher.” See Maj. Op. at 18 n.10. For this,\nthe majority cites an affidavit from a former student and classmate of DP’s who,\nalthough she recalls the teachers reviewing the student code of conduct with students,\ndoes not “recall ever receiving any serious instruction about bullying, teasing or\nharassment of other students.” See J.A. at 145 (emphasis added). The majority next relies\non an affidavit by a temporary substitute teacher (DP’s brother) who taught at DP’s\nmiddle school for less than four months and who affirms that he did not receive\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 26\n\n\ninstruction on the policy for bullying and harassment. See J.A. at 228. The majority also\ncites to an affidavit signed by the plaintiffs’ expert witness who has opined that, in any\nevent, “no matter how powerfully presented, [one-time programs such as “Bang, Bang,\nYou’re Dead”] have not been demonstrated to have a significant lasting impact on a\nschool’s climate or culture or reducing or eliminating bullying or harassment.” See Maj.\nOp. at 18 n.10. Although this evidence (accepted as true for purposes of the summary\njudgment motion) may speak to the overall effectiveness of the policies and programs,\nand may be relevant if negligence were the standard, its relevance to the issue of\ndeliberate indifference is questionable. Cf. Sanchez v. Alvarado, 101 F.3d 223, 229 (1st\nCir. 1996) (defendant had an inefficient and ineffective anti-harassment policy and\n“leisurely” responded to harassment complaints; whether the policy could have been\nmore effective and better-implemented may have some bearing on whether defendant\nwas negligent, but noting that is not the standard for deliberate indifference). The\naffidavits relied on by the majority do not create a genuine issue of material fact on the\nissue of deliberate indifference. The majority has not cited any case law, and my own\nresearch has uncovered none, holding that good faith (although inefficient) policies and\nprograms addressing peer harassment and bullying may be considered in the deliberate\nindifference context only if the students subjectively perceive them to be “serious\ninstruction;” only if temporary substitute teachers are aware of them; and only if they\nhave been first shown to have “significant lasting impact.”\n\n       In light of the above, it seems to me that the district judge properly found that\nthere were no genuine disputed issues of material fact and that, as a matter of law, the\nschool was not deliberately indifferent. As already noted, deliberate indifference is a\nhigh standard to meet, and the analysis is very deferential to schools. Relying on Davis,\nsupra, the Sixth Circuit has described the appropriate legal standard as follows:\n\n       The recipient is liable for damages only where the recipient itself\n       intentionally acted in clear violation of Title IX by remaining deliberately\n       indifferent to known acts of harassment. See Davis, 526 U.S. at 642, 119\n       S. Ct. 1661, 143 L. Ed. 2d 839 (discussing Gebser v. Lago Vista School\n       Dist., stating liability arose from recipient's official decision not to\n       remedy the violation). “[T]he deliberate indifference must, at a minimum,\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                  Page 27\n\n\n       ‘cause [students] to undergo harassment or make them liable or\n       vulnerable’ to it.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 645, 119 S. Ct. 1661, 143 L. Ed. 2d\n       839.\nVance v. Spencer County Pub. School Dist., 231 F.3d 253, 260 (6th Cir. 2000). The Sixth\nCircuit’s language is particularly on point in this case:\n\n       The recipient is not required to “remedy” sexual harassment nor ensure\n       that students conform their conduct to certain rules, but rather, “the\n       recipient must merely respond to known peer harassment in a manner\n       that is not clearly unreasonable.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 648-649. The\n       deliberate indifference standard “does not mean that recipients can avoid\n       liability only by purging their schools of actionable peer harassment or\n       that administrators must engage in particular disciplinary action.” Id. at\n       648. The standard does not mean that recipients must expel every student\n       accused of misconduct. See id. Victims do not have a right to particular\n       remedial demands. See id. Furthermore, courts should not second guess\n       the disciplinary decisions that school administrators make. See id.\n       “The Supreme Court has pointedly reminded us, however, that this is ‘not\n       a mere “reasonableness” standard’ that transforms every school\n       disciplinary decision into a jury question.” Gant, 195 F.3d at 141\n       (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 649). In an appropriate case, there is no\n       reason why courts on motion for a directed verdict could not identify a\n       response as not “clearly unreasonable” as a matter of law. See Gant, 195\n       F.3d at 141.\nId. The majority glosses over this high legal standard rather quickly, see Maj. Op. at 12-\n13, and it seizes upon the following additional language in Vance:\n\n       [W]here a school district has knowledge that its remedial action is\n       inadequate and ineffective, it is required to take reasonable action in light\n       of those circumstances to eliminate the behavior. Where a school district\n       has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective, and it\n       continues to use those same methods to no avail, such district has failed\n       to act reasonably in light of the known circumstances.\n231 F.3d at 261. The majority seems to interpret these two sentences to mean that even\nif the school district takes disciplinary action in response to all known harassment, and\neven if that action is 100% effective against the individual harassers, it may be liable if\nthere is subsequent harassment by new offenders. There is no authoritative case law to\nsupport such an interpretation. For this sweeping expansion of Vance, the majority relies\nheavily on a single out-of-circuit district court case, Theno v. Tonganoxie Unified School\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 28\n\n\nDist. No. 464, 377 F. Supp. 2d 952 (D. Kan. 2005). The district judge in that case did,\nindeed, reach the same conclusion as the majority. However, there are two reasons why\nit cannot be relied upon.\n\n       First, it is merely one district judge’s opinion and has no authoritative value.\nIndeed, this very same panel recently noted that intra-circuit district court cases are of\nlimited value. See United States Student Ass’n Foundation v. Land, 546 F.3d 373, 383\nn.8, 385 n.10 (6th Cir. 2008). It seems to me, then, that the opinion of a single district\ncourt judge from outside this circuit is an even thinner reed upon which to base an\nexpansion of this court’s jurisprudence.\n\n       Second, and more significantly, it is not persuasive regarding the applicable legal\nstandard. I do not believe the district judge’s opinion in Theno and the majority’s\nopinion today are justified by the Sixth Circuit’s analysis in Vance, nor are they\notherwise consistent with any circuit’s case law. The harassment in Vance was far more\negregious, and the response thereto was far less appropriate, than in this case. The\nstudent in Vance was subjected to widespread harassment and physical abuse. She was\nthe victim of frequent and vulgar name-calling (“whore” and “gay girl,” etc.), and she\nwas touched inappropriately in almost every class. She was stabbed in the hand with a\npen during one assault, and, on another occasion, two students held her down and tried\nto rip off her clothes while another student took off his pants and said that he was going\nto rape her. School officials “talked to” the offenders, but, incredibly, did not take any\nfurther disciplinary action against them. The harassing conduct not only continued, but\nit increased. In fact, the offenders confronted her after they had been “talked to”\nspecifically in order to harass her again. Even though “‘talking to the offenders’\nproduced no results, [the school] continued to employ this ineffective method.” See 231\nF.3d at 262. It was this factual background which led this court to conclude that if a\nschool district “has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective, and it\ncontinues to use those same methods to no avail, such district has failed to act reasonably\nin light of the known circumstances.” Id. at 261. Vance thus confronted the situation\nwhere the harassing students re-offended after they were disciplined (i.e., the discipline\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                             Page 29\n\n\n“produced no results”), yet the school knowingly continued to use the same ineffective\nmethod. This conclusion has no application whatsoever to the present case where the\nreprimands and other forms of discipline were extraordinarily effective as to the known\noffenders. The facts of this case are plainly distinguishable from Vance. Again, the\ndefendant here investigated DP’s complaints, and the offending students were counseled,\nreprimanded, suspended, and/or expelled, depending on the nature of their specific\nmisconduct. No student who received discipline ever bothered DP again. The undisputed\nfacts thus establish that the school district’s actions were 100% effective with respect to\nthose students.\n\n         On this point, a decision out of the Third Circuit is very similar and persuasive.\nSee Doe v. Bellefonte Area School Dist., 2003 WL 23718302 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 29, 2003),\naff’d 106 Fed. Appx. 798 (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2004).7 The student there was ridiculed and\nharassed by his fellow students for years. He was called “queer,” “gay boy,” “pixie,”\n“faggot,” and “peter-eater,” among other things. He was pushed at school and physically\nassaulted at the bus stop. He reported some (but not all) of the bullying and harassment,\nand the school took varying degrees of disciplinary action when the harassment was\nreported. Some of the offenders were given verbal warnings and reprimands, some were\ncounseled about the seriousness of the harassment, some were given detention, and\nothers were suspended. Notably, every time the school warned or disciplined an\noffender, “that perpetrator never bothered Doe again. The School District’s method of\ndealing with specific, identified perpetrators involving Doe was one hundred percent\neffective.” 2003 WL 23718302, at *9. Based on the 100% success rate with the\nindividual offenders, coupled with the school agreeing to be extra “vigilant” of the\nproblems and having an anti-harassment policy, the district court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the school district because “no reasonable finder of fact could\nconclude that the School District was deliberately indifferent to the harassment of Doe,\n\n\n\n\n         7\n           Although this is an unpublished case and has no precedential value in this circuit, a decision of\na three-judge panel from a sister court of appeals has to be more persuasive than a single district judge’s\nopinion from outside this circuit.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 30\n\n\nor that its responses to the harassment of which it was aware were clearly unreasonable.”\nId. at *9-10\n\n       The plaintiff appealed, arguing, as the plaintiffs do here, that the school “should\nhave treated the pattern of harassment as a systemic problem,” and its failure to do so\nwas deliberate indifference. 106 Fed. Appx. at 799. He argued that the school’s response\nwas clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstance that the harassment\ncontinued, even though “each subsequent incident involved a student other than the\nstudent that had been disciplined in any of the prior incidents of harassment directed at\nDoe.” Id. In affirming, the Third Circuit relied upon the Supreme Court’s guidance to\nlower courts in Davis, and held:\n\n       The relevant inquiry for purposes of evaluating whether the School\n       District here was deliberately indifferent to known circumstances of\n       harassment is to review its response to reported incidents of harassment.\n       Each and every time Doe complained, the School District responded with\n       reasonable actions which eliminated further harassment between Doe\n       and the student(s) involved in each incident. Students were suspended\n       and others were given warnings and counseled regarding the seriousness\n       of harassment. In addition, the School District circulated memoranda to\n       faculty and staff putting them on notice of the reported harassment of\n       Doe and requesting assistance to prevent further incidents. Doe was\n       provided with a special means of reporting any additional harassment\n       through the school psychologist, whom he knew personally. The School\n       District also held assemblies and enacted policies addressing peer-to-peer\n       harassment. Such actions are not clearly unreasonable.\n       Nor was the School District deliberately indifferent because it did not\n       undertake the specific remedial action that Doe desired given what he\n       perceived to be the “systemic nature of the harassment.” Davis does not\n       require school districts to purge their schools of actionable peer\n       harassment or to engage in particular disciplinary action. Id. at 648. We\n       will refrain from second-guessing the disciplinary decisions made by the\n       School District which effectively eliminated each reported source of\n       harassment. We do not minimize the unfortunate verbal abuse that Doe\n       was subjected to during his high school years, but the School District was\n       not deliberately indifferent because additional harassment occurred\n       under new and different circumstances. We will affirm the judgment of\n       the district court.\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                               Page 31\n\n\nId. at 800 (emphasis added).8\n\n         More importantly, it seems to me that the majority’s decision today is\ninconsistent with a recent decision from this court. The plaintiff in S.S. v. Eastern\nKentucky Univ., 532 F.3d 445 (6th Cir. 2008), who had physical and mental disabilities,\nwas harassed by fellow students. The harassment was systemic and it lasted for three\nyears. Among many other things, the students called him “gay,” “queer,” “bastard,” and\n“retard;” they pushed and tackled him in the hallway and lunchroom; they threw paper\ntowels at him that had been soaked with water or urine; they threw bleach on him in\nscience class; and they slammed his head into a glass sneeze-guard, the latter incident\nnecessitating a trip to the hospital and treatment for a sprained neck. On one occasion,\na student sexually assaulted the plaintiff by grabbing plaintiff’s genitals and saying\n“Now I’ll see if you are a woman.” After a fight between the plaintiff and “one of his\nfrequent attackers,” the police were called to the school.9 When these incidents were\nreported, “they were investigated, and responsive action was taken.” See S.S. v. Eastern\nKentucky Univ., 431 F. Supp. 2d 718, 728 (E.D. Ky. 2006). The school responded to the\nincidents of which it was made aware by conducting interviews to decide who was at\nfault and disciplining those who were; instructing S.S.’s classmates not to taunt him;\nspeaking to the students about the name-calling; adding extra monitoring; at times\n\n\n\n\n         8\n           Bellefonte, as noted, is quite similar to this case. The Third Circuit found it significant that the\noffending students were given warnings and counseled about the seriousness of their actions; each time\nthe school took action the harassment by that particular student stopped; the teachers were advised and\nagreed to be vigilant about future harassment; the plaintiff was given the means to report harassment\nthrough a faculty member whom he knew and trusted; and the school district had an anti-harassment\npolicy. Each of these factors is present here. I also note that in deciding Bellefonte, the Third Circuit\nimpliedly rejected the interpretation of Vance suggested by the majority today, even though it was urged\nby the appellant on appeal. See generally 2004 WL 3759879, at *20-21, *25-28 (appellant’s brief)\n(interpreting and citing Vance for the view that if a school district discovers that its response to known\nharassment is inadequate against “systemic harassment” (even though it may be effective against the\nindividual harassers), then the school must take “additional actions” to avoid “new liability”).\n         9\n           These facts are set forth in the district court opinion granting summary judgment for the\ndefendant, 431 F. Supp. 2d 718 (E.D. Ky. 2006), which the Sixth Circuit stated was “an accurate\ndescription of the numerous incidents that underlie S.S.’s claims.” See S.S., supra, 532 F.3d at 449.\nAlthough there was a dispute as to whether all of the events happened as the plaintiff described, or whether\nhe was himself responsible for initiating many of the confrontations, the court assumed, as it was required\nto do on summary judgment, that the plaintiff’s evidentiary assertions were true. See, supra, 431 F. Supp.\n2d at 727-28.\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                           Page 32\n\n\nseparating S.S. from students with whom he had problems; assisting the police in regards\nto the fight noted above; and contacting the parents of students involved.\n\n         Despite these efforts, the harassment continued, and S.S. filed suit against the\nschool under the Americans with Disabilities Act.10 He argued, in relevant part, that the\nschool did not adequately respond to, and end, the harassment. The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the school, and, on appeal, the Sixth Circuit confined its\nanalysis to the deliberate indifference issue. To illustrate the distinction between when\nthe issue should be left for the jury to decide, and when it can be decided on summary\njudgment, this court discussed two district court cases that it believed were “instructive,”\nK.M. v. Hyde Park Cent. School Dist., 381 F. Supp. 2d 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); Biggs v.\nBoard of Educ. of Cecil County, Maryland, 229 F. Supp. 2d 437 (D. Md. 2002).11 In\nK.M., the student endured peer harassment for years. The school had notice of the\nharassment, but it took no steps to help or protect him and no one was disciplined. On\nthose particular facts, the district court properly denied summary judgment for the\nschool. Biggs, by contrast, involved similar peer-on-peer harassment, but in that case the\nschool took action whenever there was a reported incident, including counseling the\nvictim, meeting with the offenders and threatening them with suspension, notifying the\nparents, and alerting teachers to the problem. Because such responses established that\nthe school district was not deliberately indifferent, the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment for the school. The Sixth Circuit observed that the facts of S.S.\n“closely mirrored” Biggs and it went on to conclude that the school was not deliberately\nindifferent as a matter of law, even though its efforts were unsuccessful and even though\nthe widespread harassment continued. This court explained that “meeting with the\nstudents, communicating with parents, and disciplining the offending students” simply\ndid not “give rise to an inference that [the school] was deliberately indifferent to S.S.’s\n\n\n         10\n           Although the action was not filed under Title IX, the Sixth Circuit evaluated the ADA claim\npursuant to, and applied the deliberate indifference standard under, the framework set forth in Davis. See\n532 F.3d at 453-54.\n         11\n             I note that the Sixth Circuit looked to these out-of-circuit district court cases merely for\nillustrative purposes and not, as the majority apparently does with Theno, as a significant basis for its\nholding.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                    Page 33\n\n\nsituation or that it had an attitude of permissiveness that amounted to discrimination.”\nSee 532 F.3d at 455-56. Insofar as the defendant here took essentially the same action\n(investigating, counseling, extra monitoring by staff, seating preferences to separate DP\nfrom problem students, meeting with and disciplining the students found at fault,\ncontacting parents, and assisting the police --- the sum of which was 100% effective\nagainst the individual harassers), this case is a close fit to the scenario in S.S.\n\n        That is not to say, of course, that a school may avoid liability merely by taking\nsome action, however minor, in response to known harassment. See Vance, supra, 231\nF.3d at 260 (rejecting the argument that as long as a school district “does something in\nresponse to harassment,” then it has not acted with deliberate indifference) (emphasis\nadded). The pertinent inquiry is whether the response was appropriate under the\nparticular circumstances. Quoting the Title IX guidelines, Vance described an\n“appropriate response” to known harassment as follows:\n\n        [Schools] should take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or\n        otherwise determine what occurred and take steps reasonably calculated\n        to end any harassment, eliminate a hostile environment if one has been\n        created, and prevent harassment from occurring again.\nId. at 261 n.5 (emphasis added). Thus, a school acts appropriately if it investigates what\nhas already occurred, reasonably tries to end any harassment still ongoing by the\noffenders, and seeks to prevent the offenders from engaging in such conduct again. That\nis exactly what happened in this case. It is manifestly unreasonable to read the guidelines\nand Vance as holding that a school district may be responsible for not preventing future\nharassment by entirely separate and new harassers. To suggest otherwise, as the majority\ndoes, comes extremely close to requiring that schools be “purged” of all offensive\nbehavior and be completely harassment-free, which the Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit\nhave unequivocally held is not required --- or possible. See Vance, supra, 231 F.3d at\n260-61 (citing and quoting Davis).\n\n        Whether the defendant, from an objective viewpoint, could have (or should have)\ndone more to stop the harassment is not the appropriate inquiry. “Lack of objective\nreasonableness, i.e., a failure to act as a reasonable person would have acted, does not\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 34\n\n\nby itself equal deliberate indifference.” See Brooks v. Celeste, 39 F.3d 125, 129 (6th Cir.\n1994). Nor does liability turn upon whether the school successfully remedied the\nharassment. The only question is whether the school “intentionally acted in clear\nviolation of Title IX by remaining deliberately indifferent to known acts of harassment,”\nand whether its response was so “clearly unreasonable” and inadequate that it facilitated\nand subjected DP to harassment. Vance, supra, 231 F.3d at 260; see also Davis, supra,\n526 U.S. at 642-47. Based on the undisputed facts in the record, any reasonable juror\nwould have to answer that question “No.” Therefore, as a matter of law, the district court\nproperly held that the defendant was not deliberately indifferent.\n\n        For these reasons, I believe the district court’s decision should be affirmed and\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f",

Plaintiffs-Appellants David\nPatterson and Dena Patterson (collectively referred to as “the Pattersons”), appeal the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Hudson Area\nSchools (“Hudson”) on the Pattersons’ claim that Hudson violated Title IX by allowing\ntheir son, DP,1 to be harassed by other students. The Pattersons’ sole argument is that\nthe district court erred in finding that, as a matter of law, Hudson was not deliberately\nindifferent to the alleged sexual harassment of DP.\n\n            Because we believe that the Pattersons have established that there is a genuine\nissue of material fact as to whether Hudson was deliberately indifferent to the student-\non-student sexual harassment of DP, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n\n            Because this case involves a motion for summary judgment, we will detail the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Pattersons. DP was a\nstudent of Hudson schools during all relevant time periods. Beginning in 2002, during\nDP’s sixth-grade year, various classmates of DP began teasing DP, calling him names,\nand pushing and shoving him in the hallways. DP was pushed into lockers and called\nnames such as “queer,” “faggot,” and “pig” by various students on a daily basis. Joint\nAppendix (“J.A.”) at 668-70 (DP Dep. at 28-30). DP reported at least some of these\ninstances to the school and was told “kids will be kids, it’s middle school.” J.A. at 672\n(DP Dep. at 33). DP also began receiving psychological treatment from Dr. Gretchen\n\n\n\n\n            1\n                All individuals who were minors during the events described herein will be referred to by\ninitials.\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                         Page 3\n\n\nWarwick, Ph.D.2 According to Dr. Warwick, this harassment caused DP to be\ndistraught, anxious, and angry.\n\n        The type of harassment DP faced in sixth grade escalated during DP’s seventh-\ngrade year, when he was called names such as “fat,” “faggot,” “gay,” “queer,” “pig,” and\n“man boobs” on a daily basis. J.A. at 672-74 (DP Dep. at 33, 36-37). DP believes he\nwas called these names more than 200 times during his seventh-grade year. He also was\nfrequently pushed in the hallways. Additionally, DP was called “Mr. Clean” by his\npeers, a derogatory term that referred to DP’s supposed lack of pubic hair.\n\n        On one occasion, DP attempted to stop a female classmate, BC, from tormenting\nanother student. In response, BC slapped DP. Though, upon learning about the incident,\nband teacher Crystal Bough, told DP she “w[ould] take care of it,” the Pattersons were\nnever contacted by the school, nor did Ms. Bough report the incident to the principal.\nJ.A. at 678-79 (DP Dep. at 44-45). The Pattersons learned from DP that he had been\nassaulted at school. This incident led to further teasing, including teasing from\ngeography teacher John Redding, who asked DP later that same day in front of a full\nclass of students: “[H]ow does it feel to be hit by a girl[?]” J.A. at 680 (DP Dep. at 46).\nThe class laughed at DP.\n\n        DP wanted to quit school by the end of the first semester of seventh grade.\nPrincipal Greg Rozeveld3 offered to mentor DP through this hard time. However,\naccording to Mrs. Patterson, when DP first began to meet with Principal Rozeveld, DP\nwas released from class early to attend the meeting. The first visit went smoothly, but\nPrincipal Rozeveld was not in his office when DP arrived for the next three visits. On\nthese occasions, DP would return to class, which caused the teacher to decide to stop\nsending DP early to meet with Principal Rozeveld. Instead, she waited until she released\nthe problem students to go to the office to have their planners signed at the end of the\n\n\n        2\n          Dr. Warwick also treated DP when he was ten years old for problems stemming from his family\nlife. DP was no longer suffering from those problems when the teasing began in sixth grade.\n        3\n         The principal’s name is repeatedly misspelled in Hudson’s brief and the depositions as\n“Roosevelt.”\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                   Page 4\n\n\nschool day. After only a couple of weeks, DP expressed to Mrs. Patterson that he no\nlonger wanted to go with the problem students because other students were beginning\nto think he was a trouble-maker. DP stopped going to meet with Principal Rozeveld\nshortly thereafter.\n\n       These incidents caused DP to withdraw to the point that he began eating lunch\nin the bandroom by himself to avoid his tormentors. His interim grades were also low;\nhowever, DP did receive higher final grades.\n\n       The Pattersons and DP repeatedly reported several incidents of harassment to\nHudson. As the district court accurately detailed, DP and the Pattersons reported the\nfollowing incidents:\n\n       1. Sixth Grade:\n\n               a.        Dave Patterson spoke to a teacher about teasing directed\n                         at [DP] and how [DP] felt upset and humiliated.\n               b.

Mich.\nNov. 28, 2007) (unpublished opinion and order).\n\n       During the summer between seventh grade and eighth grade, Ms. Mansfield,\nalong with social worker Tammy Cates, filled out a referral form to have DP evaluated\nfor special education services. This evaluation established that DP is emotionally\nimpaired as defined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400\net seq. An Individual Education Placement Team was convened and an individual\neducation program was developed. Pursuant to the program, DP was assigned to attend\nteacher Ted Adams’s resource room during one period of the day for all of the eighth-\ngrade year. Mr. Adams was helpful in teaching DP how to cope with his peers. All\nparties agree that DP had a successful eighth-grade year; by using the resource room, DP\nwas able to learn effectively.\n\n       However, DP’s ninth-grade year was not successful. DP’s individual education\nprogram was altered by Hudson. Notably, Hudson High School Principal Michael\nOsborne refused to allow DP to continue in Mr. Adams’s resource room because Mr.\nAdams was a middle-school resource-room teacher. Because DP’s eighth-grade year\nwas so successful, the Pattersons begged Hudson to allow DP to continue in Mr.\nAdams’s resource room, and even offered to have DP go to the middle school to meet\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                             Page 6\n\n\nwith Mr. Adams in Mr. Adams’s room, but this request was to no avail.4 Principal\nOsborne also “didn’t think that [the high school resource room] was the place for [DP].”\nJ.A. at 856 (Mrs. Patterson Dep. at 138). Thus, DP was not placed in any resource room\nfor his ninth-grade year.\n\n         The beginning of his ninth-grade year brought a return of the type of harassment\nDP faced in sixth and seventh grade. DP was again called names such as “gay,” “fat,”\n“fag,” and “queer” and was pushed and shoved in the hallways on a near daily basis.\nJ.A. at 729-30 (DP Dep. at 106-07). That fall, DP also was called “Mr. Clean” by three\nstudents. Those students were forced to meet with DP and Ms. Mansfield. The students\napologized, but DP did not think their apology was sincere. Those three students never\nbothered DP again.\n\n         DP also experienced new types of harassment during his ninth-grade year.\nDuring oral presentations in history class, a fellow student, SE, wrote a series of words\non the back of his note cards. These words created the phrase: “[DP] is a fag.” J.A. at\n708 (DP Dep. at 85). The entire class saw this phrase as the student used the cards for\nhis presentation, which caused the students to laugh at DP. SE was reported to Ms.\nMansfield and the history teacher, both of whom verbally reprimanded SE. SE never\nbothered DP again.\n\n         Shortly after the oral presentation incident, another student, JR, defaced DP’s\nplanner with the sexual phrases “I Æ penis,” “I lick it in the Ass,” “I Æ cock,” and “I’m\na mamma’s boy/I suck on her Nipple” and drawings of buttocks and a penis. J.A. at 311\n(Planner); J.A. at 721-24 (DP Dep. at 98-101). DP reported this incident to both the\nteacher and Principal Osborne. JR was verbally reprimanded by Ms. Mansfield and did\nnot bother DP again after this incident.\n\n\n\n\n         4\n          Though Mr. Adams worked for the middle school, the middle school and high school are housed\nin the same building, segregated into separate wings. According to DP, it was possible for him to stop by\nand meet with Mr. Adams in Mr. Adams’s room even after DP began high school. Mr. Adams did\nvolunteer to counsel DP for 25-30 minutes per week after DP began his ninth-grade year.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 7\n\n\n       In March 2005, unknown students broke into DP’s gym locker, removed his\nclothes and urinated on them, and threw his tennis shoes in the toilet. The locker was\nalso “covered with shaving cream spelling out sexually oriented words.” J.A. at 152\n(TW Aff. ¶ 14). Later that spring, two students, KM and JL, hung a “Mr. Clean” poster\non DP’s locker in the main hallway. Principal Osborne verbally reprimanded KM, and\nsuspended JL for one day. JL’s tougher punishment was due to the fact that he had\npreviously violated school rules in a manner unrelated to the “Mr. Clean” incident.\nNeither student bothered DP thereafter.\n\n       At some point after the “Mr. Clean” incident, DP’s locker in the main hallway\nwas vandalized by unknown students. These students used permanent markers and\nwrote words such as “gay,” “faggot,” and “queer” up and down the locker. J.A. at 805\n(Mr. Patterson Dep. at 55). Additionally, a picture of a penis being inserted into a\nrectum was drawn on the locker. The inside of the locker was also defaced with various\nderogatory phrases, such as “suck your mother’s tits” and “you suck dicks.” Id. After\nthe Pattersons reported the incident, Hudson officials cleaned the outside of the locker;\nDP had to ask Mr. Adams to help him clean the inside of the locker. Hudson conducted\nan investigation, but no individuals were ever punished.\n\n       The final incident of harassment occurred in late May 2005. After Friday night\njunior-varsity baseball practice, DP was sexually assaulted by a fellow teammate, LP,\nin the locker room. LP stripped naked, forced DP into a corner, jumped on DP’s\nshoulders, and rubbed his penis and scrotum on DP’s neck and face. While the assault\nwas occurring, another student, NH, blocked the exit so DP could not escape. DP\ninformed the Pattersons that evening about the attack. DP also informed Andy Wade,\nhis older brother and coach of the junior-varsity baseball team. The Pattersons informed\nPrincipal Osborne about the event on Saturday, during a baseball double-header. Both\nDP and LP played in the double-header, but DP claims he participated in the game only\nin order to prevent the team from having to forfeit.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 8\n\n\n       LP was allowed to attend school on Monday morning while Hudson officials\nbegan investigating the incident. At some point on Monday, LP was suspended for the\nremainder of the school year (just over eight days). However, LP was permitted to\nattend the annual spring sports banquet, one week after the assault. Principal Osborne\ntold Mr. Wade “to treat [LP] like any other player, to shake his hand as [Mr. Wade]\nwould other players and to act like nothing happened.” J.A. at 233 (Wade Aff. ¶ 23).\nOn June 10, 2005, LP was charged with assault with intent to commit a felony and\ncriminal sexual conduct in the second degree. He ultimately pleaded guilty to disorderly\nconduct. He was formally expelled from Hudson in August 2005 and has not been\npermitted to re-enter the Hudson school system. NH was verbally reprimanded for his\nrole in the assault. No criminal charges were filed against NH.\n\n       After the sexual assault, the varsity baseball coach, Jeremy Beal, held a team\nmeeting with both the junior varsity and the varsity baseball players. At the meeting,\nMr. Beal informed the players that they should “‘not joke around with guys who can’t\ntake a man joke.’” J.A. at 153 (TW Aff. ¶ 24 (quoting Mr. Beal)). DP was present at\nthe meeting.\n\n       Due to the continued harassment at Hudson, culminating in a sexual assault, DP\nclaims that he has been psychologically unable to set foot into a Hudson school building\nsince the end of his ninth-grade year. At the end of ninth grade, DP’s individual\neducation program was modified. For his tenth-grade year, “[DP] began receiving\ninstructional services from [Hudson] in the Sacred Heart School building,” a preschool-\nthrough-sixth-grade Catholic elementary school. J.A. at 160 (Johnston Aff. ¶ 36). DP’s\nhigh-school teachers would visit him occasionally to discuss his assignments, even\nthough “[DP] made numerous attempts to e-mail teachers and did not get responses.”\nJ.A. at 157 (Johnston Aff. ¶ 17). This year was not successful for DP.\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                            Page 9\n\n\n         For his eleventh- and twelfth-grade years, Hudson allowed DP to take college\nplacement courses at the local college. Originally, Hudson decided that one semester\nof college coursework would equal one semester of high school course work. However,\nafter Hudson was required to pay tuition, “[t]he standard changed to one semester\ncollege class equals one year high school class . . . .” J.A. at 197 (Mrs. Patterson Aff.\n¶ 7). This facilitated DP’s early graduation.\n\n         The Pattersons filed suit against Hudson and Kathy Malnar, Superintendent of\nSchools for Hudson, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan on November 22, 2005. The complaint alleged the following federal claims:\n(1) Hudson violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; (2) Hudson violated\nDP’s equal-protection rights; and (3) Ms. Malnar “failed to implement and enforce\nmeaningful procedures to ensure compliance with federal law and the policies of\n[Hudson] and failed to ensure the proper education and training of staff as to harassment\nissues.” J.A. at 17 (Compl. ¶¶ 28-30). The complaint also alleged various state claims.\n\n         Hudson and Malnar moved for summary judgment with respect to all claims,\nwhich the district court granted.

The district court determined that the\nPattersons had met their burden with regard to the first two parts of the test, but that the\nPattersons failed to show, as a matter of law, that Hudson’s responses to DP’s reported\nattacks were “clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.” Id. The district\ncourt concluded that, absent such a showing, the Pattersons could not prove that Hudson\nwas “deliberately indifferent to the alleged sexual harassment,” and thus summary\njudgment was appropriate.

Id. at *8-9.\nThe district court further credited Hudson with implementing several proactive programs\nto combat harassment and bullying and with “assist[ing DP] in dealing with the issues\nhe faced in their schools.” Id. at *10.

To establish a prima facie case of student-on-student sexual\nharassment, the plaintiff must demonstrate each of the following elements:\n\n        (1)     the sexual harassment was so severe, pervasive, and objectively\n                offensive that it could be said to deprive the plaintiff of access to\n                the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school,\n        (2)     the funding recipient had actual knowledge of the sexual\n                harassment, and\n        (3)     the funding recipient was deliberately indifferent to the\n                harassment.\nVance, 231 F.3d at 258-59 (quoting Soper v.

The only issue on appeal is whether Hudson’s\nactions require us to hold, as a matter of law, that Hudson has not acted with deliberate\nindifference. We conclude that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                              Page 12\n\n\nPattersons,6 the Pattersons have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact regarding\nwhether Hudson’s actions were deliberately indifferent.\n\n         A recipient of federal funds that remains “deliberately indifferent to known acts\nof harassment” is liable for damages under Title IX. Vance, 231 F.3d at 260. “[T]he\ndeliberate indifference must, at a minimum, ‘cause [students] to undergo’ harassment or\n‘make them liable or vulnerable’ to it.” Id. (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 645) (first\nalteration in Vance, second alteration in Davis). “[A] plaintiff may demonstrate [a]\ndefendant’s deliberate indifference to discrimination ‘only where the recipient’s\nresponse to the harassment or lack thereof is clearly unreasonable in light of the known\ncircumstances.’” Vance, 231 F.3d at 260 (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 648). A recipient\nneed not “[purge its] schools of actionable peer harassment” or “engage in particular\n\n\n         6\n           This is a diametrically different approach than the one taken by the dissent. Although the dissent\nprofesses to be using the correct legal standard, it repeatedly weighs evidence and decides controverted\nissues in favor of Hudson, the moving party. See, e.g., Dissent at 24-25 (deciding that the resource room\nis nothing more than “the equivalent of study hall” and, therefore, could not cause a reduction of\nharassment); 25-26 (belittling the Pattersons’ evidence in regard to the lack of and effectiveness of\nproactive programs). When we review a grant of summary judgment, we are forbidden to weigh the\nevidence or to draw the inferences the dissent insists upon drawing. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (1986) (“Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of\nlegitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether he is ruling on a\nmotion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict. The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed,\nand all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” (emphasis added)). Our job is to look at the\nfacts and consider them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, regardless of our own personal\nviews of how much credence we would give a particular piece of evidence if we were on a jury. The\ndissent’s steadfast determination to act as a juror is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.\n          A clear example of the dissent’s misunderstanding and misapplication of the governing standard\nis found in the assertion that the undisputed facts support a conclusion that the resource room itself did\nnothing to reduce the harassment of DP. The record clearly shows and both parties admit that, when the\nresource room was used, DP suffered less harassment. Whether it was the use of the room or the person\nwho ran the room that caused this undisputed decreased harassment is a question of interpretation.\nBecause we must draw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, it is legally incorrect for the dissent\nto infer that Mr. Adams himself, and not the use of the resource room in general, aided DP. This same\nevidence supports the inference that it was the use of the resource room itself that was beneficial to DP\nand, because that inference favors the Pattersons, that is the inference the Supreme Court demands we\ndraw. The dissent’s repeated claim, unsupported by the record, that all the inferences it draws in Hudson’s\nfavor are “established by the undisputed facts,” see, e.g., Dissent at 24, does not magically give the dissent\ncarte blanche to view controverted issues in the light most favorable to Hudson.\n          Furthermore, even assuming that the inference that the dissent insists upon drawing was legally\npermissible, we believe that a reasonable juror could still find that Hudson was deliberately indifferent.\nAlthough Mr. Adams worked for the middle school, the middle school and the high school were housed\nin the same building, “connected by a short hall.” J.A. at 697 (DP Dep. at 74). DP testified that, during\nhis ninth-grade year, it was possible for him to meet Mr. Adams on the same basis he did while in middle\nschool. Additionally, Mrs. Patterson testified that the Pattersons “begged” Hudson to allow DP to meet\nwith Mr. Adams and even offered to have DP meet with Mr. Adams in Mr. Adams’s room in the middle\nschool. J.A. at 855 (Mrs. Patterson Dep. at 137). Given the effectiveness of the eighth-grade resource\nroom and the willingness of the Pattersons to have DP go back to the middle school to utilize Mr. Adams’s\nservices, a reasonable juror could conclude that Hudson’s refusal to continue the resource room program\nfor DP constitutes deliberate indifference.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v.

Vance, 231 F.3d at 260. “Furthermore,\ncourts should not second guess the disciplinary decisions that school administrators\nmake.” Id. at 260. However:\n\n       where a school district has knowledge that its remedial action is\n       inadequate and ineffective, it is required to take reasonable action in light\n       of those circumstances to eliminate the behavior. Where a school district\n       has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective, and it\n       continues to use those same methods to no avail, such district has failed\n       to act reasonably in light of the known circumstances.\nId. at 261 (emphasis added).\n\n       Relying on this language, one district court determined that, where a student\nsuffered four years of harassment from various other students, a school district’s “tactic\nof merely talking to and warning students who harassed plaintiff,” with occasional\ninvestigation into “some of the more significant incidents and even eventually\nproactively sp[eaking] to students and teachers in an effort to prevent further incidents\n. . . raised a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to withstand summary judgment.”\nTheno v.

In Theno, the plaintiff was repeatedly harassed beginning\nin his seventh-grade year and ending only when he left school during his eleventh-grade\nyear. Id. at 954-61. The harassment consisted of name calling (“faggot,” “queer,”\n“pussy,” “jack-off boy,” etc.), persistent joking regarding plaintiff being caught\nmasturbating in the school bathroom (which was untrue), and some physical altercations\n(pushing, shoving, tripping, fistfights). Id. Most student harassers were merely given\nverbal warnings or reprimanded by the school; however, a few of the more serious\noffenders were more severely disciplined. Id. Importantly, “each time the school\ndisciplined a known harasser, to the best of the school’s knowledge that particular\nharasser ceased harassing plaintiff (with limited exceptions).” Id. at 965. The school\nalso began to speak proactively with students and teachers regarding harassment during\nthe plaintiff’s tenth-grade year. Id. at 959-60.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 14\n\n\n        The school district in Theno argued that, as a matter of law, its responses could\nnot be deemed clearly unreasonable. Id. at 965. The district court disagreed, stressing\nthat\n\n        this is not a case that involved a few discrete incidents of harassment. It\n        involved severe and pervasive harassment that lasted for years, with\n        other students engaging in the same form of harassment after those who\n        were counseled had stopped, and the school rarely took any disciplinary\n        measures above and beyond merely talking to and warning the harassers.\nId. at 966. Though the school took more aggressive measures in the later years of the\nharassment, the district court noted that\n\n        [b]y that time, the harassment had been going on for a number of years\n        without the school handing out any meaningful disciplinary measures to\n        deter other students from perpetuating the cycle of harassment. While\n        the court recognizes that the school was not legally obligated to put an\n        end to the harassment, a reasonable jury certainly could conclude that\n        at some point during the four-year period of harassment the school\n        district’s standard and ineffective response to the known harassment\n        became clearly unreasonable.\nId. (emphasis added). The district court cited Vance to support this determination. Id.\nIt also concluded that Vance supported a finding that “whether the school’s belatedly\nstepped-up efforts were ‘too little, too late’ is a question for the jury.” Id.\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                                Page 15\n\n\n         Theno’s reliance on Vance is persuasive.7 In Vance, when confronted with a\npost-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court upheld the jury\nverdict in favor of the plaintiff, a female student who suffered harassment over many\nschool years perpetrated by various students, and we affirmed. Vance, 231 F.3d at 256-\n58. The school district responded to the plaintiff’s harassment complaints by talking to\nthe perpetrators, to no avail. Id. at 262. We rejected the defendant’s argument that a\n\n\n         7\n            Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, we rely on Vance in making our holding. However, one\ncannot escape the striking similarities between the instant case and Theno, a case that also relied on Vance.\nThe dissent’s attempt to minimize the usefulness of district court opinions does not change this fact. We\ntherefore believe that Theno is a helpful tool to illustrate why the holding in Vance supports our holding\ntoday.\n           More important, the case the dissent cites as “very similar and persuasive,” Dissent at 29, Doe\nv. Bellefonte Area School District, 106 F. App’x 798 (3d Cir. 2004), an unpublished Third Circuit opinion,\nis different from this case in two material respects. First, in Doe, the school district did more to prevent\nthe systematic harassment of Doe than Hudson did in instant case. Specifically, the school district gave\nDoe “a special means of reporting any additional harassment,” circulated memoranda specific to Doe’s\nharassment issues to the faculty in the hopes of preventing future harassment, and “held assemblies and\nenacted policies addressing peer-to-peer harassment.” Doe, 106 F. App’x at 800. As outlined above, when\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Pattersons, we observe that Hudson did not perform any\nof these services during DP’s ninth-grade year. Thus, Doe is distinguishable from the instant case by the\neffort the school district devoted to preventing future harassment.\n           Second, and of greater weight, is the fact that the Third Circuit is not bound by Vance, and thus\nDoe is of little value. Moreover, the dissent’s contention that Doe tacitly rejected our interpretation of\nVance is unavailing, given that the actual opinion in Doe makes no mention of Vance. Therefore, even\nif the Doe panel thoroughly considered and rejected this interpretation of Vance, Doe provides no\nreasoning regarding why it hypothetically rejected that interpretation that we may consider and evaluate.\n           Furthermore, the dissent’s assertion that “a decision of a three-judge panel from a sister court of\nappeals has to be more persuasive than a single district judge’s opinion from outside this circuit,” Dissent\nat 29 n.7, is completely unfounded and demeaning to district court jurists. Under such a theory, a decision\nfrom Learned Hand while sitting on the bench in the Southern District of New York would be categorically\ninferior to any differing opinion rendered by a random three-judge panel from any circuit. Judges and\ncases differ, and such a bright-line rule that imports inferiority without regard to the depth of analysis\npresent in an opinion or to the similarity of facts with the case at bar is unwarranted and disrespectful to\nthe numerous talented district judges.\n           Additionally, the dissent’s reliance on S.S. v. Eastern Kentucky University, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425563\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425563/ss-v-eastern-kentucky-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n2008), is misplaced. S.S. involved a student claiming peer-on-peer harassment in violation of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794. The panel\napplied the Davis test to the claim and held that the school district was not deliberately indifferent as a\nmatter of law. However, the school district in S.S., like the school district in Doe, did more than Hudson\ndid in this case to prevent future harassment: The school district “arrang[ed] for outside speakers to talk\nto the students about name-calling, identif[ied] related topics for discussion at school assemblies and in\nsmall groups,” “call[ed] the police,” and “call[ed] the other students’ . . . parents to discuss the disciplinary\nproblems.” S.S., 532 F.3d at 455. The dissent insists that both Doe and S.S. are factually identical to this\ncase, claiming that Hudson has done everything that the school districts in those two cases have done.\nDissent at 29-33 & n.8. However, that is true only if one views the evidence in the light most favorable\nto Hudson, not when one views the evidence in the light most favorable to the Pattersons. Because the\nlatter is the legally correct view, Hudson is not on par with the school districts in Doe and S.S.\n           Moreover, the panel in S.S. stressed that “[e]ven viewing the record in the light most favorable\nto S.S., proof is lacking as to what [the defendant] could have or should have done differently in order to\nbring the peer-on-peer harassment to a stop.” Id. As explained below, that is not the case in the instant\nappeal; it is undisputed that Hudson was fully aware that use of the resource room in eighth grade impacted\nthe amount of harassment that DP suffered and discontinuing the resource room in ninth grade correlated\nwith a return to high levels of harassment. Hudson Br. at 8-22. Thus, a reasonable jury could find that\nHudson knew how to combat the harassment of DP and simply chose not to implement that known method\nof success. Thus, S.S. is distinguishable.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                   Page 16\n\n\nschool district is not deliberately indifferent “as long as a school district does something\nin response to harassment,” id. at 260, emphasizing that “once [a school district] had\nknowledge that its response was inadequate, it was required to take further reasonable\naction in light of the circumstances to avoid new liability,” id. at 262. We believe this\nlanguage makes clear that, even though a school district takes some action in response\nto known harassment, if further harassment continues, a jury is not precluded by law\nfrom finding that the school district’s response is clearly unreasonable. We cannot say\nthat, as a matter of law, a school district is shielded from liability if that school district\nknows that its methods of response to harassment, though effective against an individual\nharasser, are ineffective against persistent harassment against a single student. Such a\nsituation raises a genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide.\n\n        Furthermore, when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Pattersons,\nwe conclude that there are striking similarities between the instant case and Theno.\nHere, as in Theno, DP was repeatedly harassed over a number of years. Hudson\nresponded to this harassment largely by giving verbal reprimands to the perpetrators.\nThough typically reprimands largely stopped harassment by the reprimanded student,\nthey did not stop other students from harassing DP. This pervasive harassment escalated\nto criminal sexual assault. Moreover, Hudson was aware that the verbal reprimands\nregarding a few students were not stopping the overall harassment of DP; it is undisputed\nthat DP continued to have problems with other students, even after some were\nreprimanded or even disciplined, and DP reported those continuing problems to Hudson.\nHudson Br. at 8-22 (detailing DP’s reported harassment).\n\n        One key difference between Theno and this case is that Hudson did at one point\nemploy a system that successfully combated the harassment of DP, i.e., the use of the\nresource room during eighth grade. In the instant case, a reasonable jury could thus\nconclude that Hudson not only was aware of what did not work, but also was aware of\nwhat had worked to insulate DP from the harassment. However, in ninth grade, Hudson\ndiscontinued the use of the resource room. The cycle of harassment then intensified, and\nHudson’s only response was to employ the same type of verbal reprimands that it had\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                            Page 17\n\n\nused unsuccessfully in response to the sixth- and seventh-grade harassment. Given that\nHudson knew that its methods were ineffective, but did not change those methods, “a\nreasonable jury certainly could conclude that at some point during the . . . period of\nharassment[,] the school district’s standard and ineffective response to the known\nharassment became clearly unreasonable.” Theno, 377 F. Supp. 2d at 966.\n\n         Hudson makes several arguments claiming that its actions were not clearly\nunreasonable as a matter of law, none of which are persuasive. Notably, Hudson does\nnot attempt to distinguish Theno from the instant case, but rather cites four different\ndistrict court cases it believes are more instructive.                     Each of these cases is\ndistinguishable from the instant case or espouses law contrary to our precedent.8\n\n         The thrust of Hudson’s argument is that Hudson dealt successfully with each\nidentified perpetrator; therefore, it asserts that it cannot be liable under Title IX as a\nmatter of law. This argument misses the point.9 As explained above, Hudson’s success\nwith individual students did not prevent the overall and continuing harassment of DP,\na fact of which Hudson was fully aware, and thus Hudson’s isolated success with\nindividual perpetrators cannot shield Hudson from liability as a matter of law. Theno,\n\n\n\n         8\n            Johnson v. Independent School District No. 47, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2577574\"><a href=\"/opinion/2577574/johnson-v-independent-school-dist-no-47/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

When the school became aware of the sexual nature of the\nphrase, it attempted to cover the phrase with nonremovable stickers, a technique that was successful in the\npast. Id. at 942-43. Unfortunately, the stickers proved to be easily removable. Id. Johnson is\ndistinguishable from the instant case because Hudson, when confronted with harassment of DP in ninth\ngrade, implemented a system that it knew from past experience did not work.\n          Hudson also cites Johnson and Wilson v.

We rejected\nthis proposition in Vance. Vance, 231 F.3d at 260.\n          Finally, Hudson cites KF’s Father v. Marriott, No. CA 00-0215-C, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">228353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.

On four separate occasions, the dissent claims that\nHudson was “100% effective” in dealing with the harassment of DP. Dissent at 22, 28, 29, 33. However,\none can make such a statement only if he ignores the realities of DP’s situation. The reprimands of a few\nindividual harassers did not stop harassment by the many, and it is undisputed that Hudson was aware of\nthis fact. Hudson Br. at 8-22 (detailing DP’s reported harassment). Vance teaches that, in such\ncircumstances, a jury may legally find that a school district has “failed to act reasonably in light of the\nknown circumstances.” Vance, 231 F.3d at 261.\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                            Page 18\n\n\n377 F. Supp. 2d at 966. It is for a jury to decide whether Hudson’s actions were “clearly\nunreasonable.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 649.\n\n         Hudson also asserts that it proactively dealt with the issue of harassment and\nbullying through a sexual-harassment policy in the student handbook, from which\nteachers and students were instructed, and school-wide programing dealing with\nharassment and bullying. However, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the\nPattersons, we cannot consider any of Hudson’s claimed programs.10\n\n         Although Hudson’s brief and oral argument before us attempted to minimize the\nharassment suffered by DP, Hudson does not argue that the district court improperly\nfound that the Pattersons had met their burden of showing that the harassment of DP was\nsevere and pervasive. Thus, we do not consider this issue. Therefore, we hold that,\nbecause Hudson had knowledge that its methods for dealing with the overall student-on-\nstudent sexual harassment of DP were ineffective, but continued to employ only those\nmethods, the Pattersons have shown a genuine issue of material fact as to the third part\nof the Davis test that is sufficient to defeat Hudson’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n         We emphasize that, at this stage of the litigation, the Pattersons are not required\nto prove that Hudson is actually liable for the continued harassment of DP (i.e., that\nHudson’s actions were clearly unreasonable), but only that there is a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to whether Hudson was deliberately indifferent to the harassment. In\n\n\n         10\n            First, the Pattersons presented evidence that the sexual-harassment policy was not explained\nto every student and teacher. See, e.g., J.A. at 145 (Kline Aff. ¶ 10); J.A. at 228 (Wade Aff. ¶¶ 9.a-9.b).\nSecond, of the programs listed by Hudson—“Character Counts,” “40 Developmental Assets,” “Bang,\nBang, You’re Dead,” the speakers series, the individual and group counseling sessions, “Flirting and\nHurting Program,” “Concerned About Teen Sexuality (‘CATS’) Program,” “Peer Mediation Program,”\nand “Positive Peers”—the only ones that actually dealt with student-on-student sexual harassment and\nbullying (as opposed to sexual relationships between males and females) and were actually implemented\nwere “Bang, Bang, You’re Dead” and “Flirting and Hurting.” See J.A. at 285 (Stutzky Aff. ¶ 7.c.vii); J.A.\nat 493-98 (Mansfield Dep. at 27-32). Third, the Pattersons’ expert explained that one-time events such\nas “Bang, Bang, You’re Dead,” “no matter how powerfully presented, have not been demonstrated to have\na significant lasting impact on a school’s climate or culture or reducing or eliminating bullying or\nharassment.” J.A. at 285 (Stutzky Aff. ¶ 7.c.viii). Fourth, the Pattersons presented evidence that the\n“Flirting and Hurting” program was not always taught to students. Compare J.A. at 228-230 (Wade Aff.\n¶¶ 9 and 9.e) (stating that Wade taught health during the 2004-2005 school year and did not teach the\n“Flirting and Hurting” program), with J.A. at 495-97 (Mansfield Dep. at 29-31) (explaining that “Flirting\nand Hurting” was integrated into health classes in the 2003-2004 school year). Thus, when viewing these\nprograms in the light most favorable to the Pattersons, we must assume that Hudson was not engaged in\nany proactive activities.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.               Page 19\n\n\nother words, the Pattersons must show only that a reasonably jury could find that Hudson\nviolated Title IX. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Pattersons, we\nbelieve the Pattersons have met this burden.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       Because we conclude that the Pattersons have demonstrated that there is a\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether Hudson’s responses to DP’s reported\nstudent-on-student sexual harassment were clearly unreasonable in light of the known\ncircumstances, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment and REMAND for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v.

I disagree. The single issue in this appeal\nis whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant, Hudson\nArea Schools, was deliberately indifferent to the harassment directed at DP. A school\ndistrict is not deliberately indifferent unless it knows of and disregards an excessive risk\nto the student’s health or safety. See Farmer v.

DP claims\nthat he was harassed almost every day, but the record reflects that he did not report much\nof the harassment.3 When he did report the harassment at times throughout the years, he\nsometimes could not identify the harassers.4 Obviously, the school district is not\nresponsible for failing to stop harassment of which it was not made aware, nor can it be\nheld responsible for failing to punish harassment by unknown individuals.\n\n         When DP complained and the harassers were identified, however, the defendant\nresponded to each incident with action appropriate to the nature and severity of the\nharassment. The students who called DP “Mr. Clean” were taken to the school\ncounselor’s office for a meeting with DP, where they were counseled and then\napologized. The student who wrote the offensive remarks on the back of his note cards\n\n\n\n         2\n           The Supreme Court has emphasized that courts “must bear in mind that schools are unlike the\nadult workplace and that children may regularly interact in a manner that would be unacceptable among\nadults. Indeed, at least early on, students are still learning how to interact appropriately with their peers.”\nSee Davis, supra, 526 U.S. at 651 (citation omitted). I do not minimize the harassment at issue for it was\nvery serious, but it appears that at least some of DP’s peer-related problems were caused by his heightened\nsensitivity to the unfortunate reality that “in the school setting, students often engage in insults, banter,\nteasing, shoving, pushing, and gender-specific conduct that is upsetting to the students subjected to it.” See\nid. at 651-52. According to his teachers, DP was at times highly sensitive and had poor social skills which\nmade it difficult for him to “distinguish[] between camaraderie and being picked on,” which, in turn,\nalienated him from the other students. See Joint Appendix (“J.A.”) at 553-54; accord id. at 102. It should\nbe noted that these socialization and peer-related problems existed long before he entered the Hudson\nschool district, apparently even dating back to daycare. See id. at 532.\n         3\n          To point to one example, the majority states that DP was teased, called names, and pushed and\nshoved “on a daily basis” while he was in the sixth grade. Maj. Op. at 2. Despite the daily nature of this\nharassment, DP admits that he made only “a total of a couple reports regarding [the] incidents that took\nplace” during that school year: one or two reports to Principal Greg Rozeveld and teacher Gwen Marry.\nSee J.A. at 648.\n         4\n           DP was unable to say, for example, who vandalized his hall locker. The school conducted an\ninvestigation into the matter, as the majority acknowledges, see Maj. Op. at 7, but it was unable to\ndetermine who was responsible.\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                              Page 22\n\n\nwas swiftly reprimanded and he, too, apologized. The student who defaced DP’s planner\nwas orally reprimanded, while a student who taped the “Mr. Clean” poster to his locker\nwas suspended from school for one day. With respect to the locker room assault after\nbaseball practice, NH was reprimanded and his parents were notified (even though DP\ntold the authorities that NH was only “playing around”), and LP was suspended for the\nrest of the school year, criminally prosecuted, and formally expelled. Significantly, as\nthe district court observed, and as the majority appears to recognize, no identified\nperpetrator ever harassed or caused problems for DP after being disciplined by the\nschool. There were no repeat offenders, so the only reasonable conclusion from the\nundisputed facts in the record is that the school’s actions, with respect to those offenders,\nwere 100% effective.5\n\n         In addition to investigating all the reported claims of harassment and punishing\nthe offenders so that they never once re-offended, the defendant took additional steps to\nhelp DP. For example, his science teacher, Ted Adams, agreed to be extra vigilant in\nlooking out for him. See J.A. at 825. DP’s mother testified that this gave her “a new\nsense of relief” because “Mr. Adams was always in the hall watching for [DP], keeping\nan eye out for him.” Id. Other teachers agreed to keep watch on him as well. Id. at 761,\n813. Another of his teachers offered suggestions on how to help DP better cope with his\npeer-related problems, such as enrolling in extracurricular social programs like band,\nscience olympiad, and other activities. Id. at 525, 817. School counselor Susan\nMansfield invited DP to attend both group and individual counseling sessions for\nstudents having problems with their peer relationships. Id. at 470-71. The school district\nalso took the unusual step of sending a school social worker and psychologist to his\nhome to meet and evaluate him during his (and their) summer break. Id. at 374, 570. He\nwas given extra time to take his exams, he was given seating preferences to avoid\n\n\n         5\n           The incident that took place in the seventh grade when DP intervened in a dispute between two\nfemale students and, in the process, was slapped by one of the girls, see Maj. Op. at 3, does not give rise\nto an inference of deliberate indifference. He told the teacher what occurred, but he claims that nothing\nwas done. Assuming that to be true, it is apparent that the slap was unrelated to the type of harassment at\nissue in this case. By his own testimony, DP was not the intended victim --- he got involved because he\nwas defending the other girl --- nor does it appear that this incident was in any way related, or similar, to\nthe harassment which is the subject of this litigation. Indeed, he never had any other problems with the girl.\nSee J.A. at 677-79.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 23\n\n\nstudents with whom he might have problems, and he was referred to a social worker for\ncounseling several times each month. See id. at 42. The school provided DP with an\nindividualized evaluation program following his ninth grade year. He earned As and Bs,\nand, as part of his curriculum, he took college courses (at school district expense) which\nallowed him to take advanced classes, to become fluent in Japanese, and to graduate\nearly from high school.\n\n       The school took additional steps that warrant closer review and discussion. First,\nPrincipal Greg Rozeveld offered to meet DP every day to provide assistance while he\nwas in middle school, but the majority seems to fault the school district for the timing\nand circumstances under which these meetings occurred. See Maj. Op. at 3-4. When DP\nwas in the seventh grade, the Pattersons spoke to Principal Rozeveld and told him that\nthey were planning to withdraw DP from school. The parties had a very long meeting\nduring which, according to Ms. Patterson, Mr. Rozeveld said that he “really hated to lose\nthe good ones, the good kids,” and he asked if there was “anything he could do to help.”\nHe offered to meet and counsel DP every day and “start interceding himself.” DP’s\nmother explained that Principal Rozeveld offered to meet with DP for two interrelated\nreasons: he wanted to help him academically, and he wanted to “build[] the trust” so that\nDP would not feel like he was “all alone.” The Pattersons were “grateful for somebody\noffering to help,” so they accepted Principal Rozeveld’s offer and kept DP in school.\nDP’s mother testified that the first time DP met Principal Rozeveld it was “very nice.”\nHowever, the next two or three times that DP went to his office, Mr. Rozeveld was in\na meeting or otherwise unavailable. DP’s mother explained to DP that “sometimes that\nis going to happen, emergencies come up.” It appears that because Principal Rozeveld\n(as head of the middle school) could not always be guaranteed to be in his office at the\ntime DP’s teachers sent him down during class, it was decided that DP would be sent\ndown at the end of the day along with the students who were having their planners\nsigned. DP did this and met with Principal Rozeveld for a number of weeks, but DP then\ndecided he did not want to continue going because he was concerned the other students\nmight start to think he was a “problem student.” See J.A. at 844-850. That was his\nchoice. It is undisputed that Principal Rozeveld offered to, and did, regularly meet with\n\fNo. 08-1008           Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                         Page 24\n\n\nand counsel DP until DP stopped the sessions. It is also undisputed that Principal\nRozeveld did this to keep DP in school, to improve his grades, to build his trust, and to\nprevent him from feeling alienated. That DP might have preferred to meet with Mr.\nRozeveld at a different time and under different circumstances does not take away from\nthe fact that --- rather than being deliberately indifferent --- Mr. Rozeveld was\nunquestionably trying to help DP through this difficult time.\n\n        Second, the school district placed DP in a “resource room” for part of each day\nwhile he was in the eighth grade which, everyone agrees, worked very well for him. The\nmajority states that the resource room reduced the actual amount of harassment directed\nat DP, see Maj. Op. at 15-17, n.7, and it faults the school district for discontinuing that\nroom once DP entered high school. See id. at 5-6, 15-17. The undisputed facts do not\nsupport such an inference. It is true that the resource room was available to DP for one\nhour each day while he was in the eighth grade. He went there to meet his science\nteacher, Mr. Adams, and “just kind of wind my day down with him, do my homework.”\nSee J.A. 621-22. It was the equivalent of study hall. Because DP claims that the\nharassment occurred in his classes, in between his classes, in the hallways, at lunch, and\nin the locker areas, it simply does not follow that a study hall for an hour each day could\nhave reduced the harassment to an appreciable degree. In fact, not even DP claims that\nit did. Rather, he testified that eighth grade was “going good” on its own, and he had “no\nclue” what caused this positive turnaround. See id.6 What is established by the\nundisputed facts is that the time spent with Mr. Adams helped DP cope with his peers\nwhich, in turn, helped him better deal with the harassment and learn more effectively.\nIndeed, DP testified that even though he was sometimes picked on and called names in\nthe eighth grade, the harassment did not “bother” him during the time that he was\nmeeting regularly with Mr. Adams. See J.A. at 622. This distinction between meeting\n\n\n        6\n          I emphasize that it was DP himself who testified that the resource room was the equivalent of\na study hall (“I would just kind of wind my day down with [Mr. Adams], do my homework”), and,\nfurthermore, not even he claims that it reduced the actual harassment (“Q: What happened to cause that\nturnaround? A: I have no clue.”). J.A. at 621-22. DP explained that other students in the resource room\nneeded help with their homework, but he “just needed Mr. Adams in there in case I needed him.” DP thus\nbenefitted from time in the resource room because Mr. Adams was his “go-to person” and “one of the only\nstaff members at the school that I felt like I could trust.” See DP’s Depo. at 67-69.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 25\n\n\nwith Mr. Adams and being in the resource room is important, for there is nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that the resource room itself reduced the actual amount of harassment,\nas the majority suggests. Rather, it appears that the resource room was effective because\nof Mr. Adams. DP could not continue getting daily assistance from Mr. Adams once he\nentered high school, however, because Mr. Adams worked exclusively for the middle\nschool. Nevertheless, even though he did not work for the high school, the defendant\ngranted Mr. Adams special authorization to meet with DP for 20-30 minutes each week\n(which he did), even after DP entered the ninth grade. See J.A. 854-57. If the defendant\nwas deliberately indifferent to DP and his situation, surely it would not have authorized\nthe middle school science teacher to meet and counsel him every week after he started\nhigh school. No reasonable finder of fact could find that there was deliberate\nindifference with respect to Mr. Adams and the resource room.\n\n       And lastly, the school district had various policies and programs dealing with\nharassment and bullying. All students were well aware that such conduct would not be\ntolerated. The student athletic code, for example, provided that students were expected\nto “behave appropriately in the locker room. Horseplay and vandalism will not be\ntolerated by the coaches or the athletic department.” See J.A. 54. Violations of this\npolicy were punishable as provided for under the code. The student handbook (which\napplied to all students, not just athletes) prohibited vandalism, physical confrontation,\nand inappropriate language, and it also provided for punishment to violators. See id. at\n82-88. There were two school-wide programs implemented which dealt specifically with\npeer harassment and bullying, “Bang, Bang, You’re Dead” and “Flirting and Hurting.”\nThe majority refuses to consider the policies and programs because it finds evidence that\nthey were “not explained to every student and teacher.” See Maj. Op. at 18 n.10. For this,\nthe majority cites an affidavit from a former student and classmate of DP’s who,\nalthough she recalls the teachers reviewing the student code of conduct with students,\ndoes not “recall ever receiving any serious instruction about bullying, teasing or\nharassment of other students.” See J.A. at 145 (emphasis added). The majority next relies\non an affidavit by a temporary substitute teacher (DP’s brother) who taught at DP’s\nmiddle school for less than four months and who affirms that he did not receive\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 26\n\n\ninstruction on the policy for bullying and harassment. See J.A. at 228. The majority also\ncites to an affidavit signed by the plaintiffs’ expert witness who has opined that, in any\nevent, “no matter how powerfully presented, [one-time programs such as “Bang, Bang,\nYou’re Dead”] have not been demonstrated to have a significant lasting impact on a\nschool’s climate or culture or reducing or eliminating bullying or harassment.” See Maj.\nOp. at 18 n.10. Although this evidence (accepted as true for purposes of the summary\njudgment motion) may speak to the overall effectiveness of the policies and programs,\nand may be relevant if negligence were the standard, its relevance to the issue of\ndeliberate indifference is questionable. Cf. Sanchez v. Alvarado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729931\"><a href=\"/opinion/729931/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-975-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44489-maria-de-los/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (1st\nCir. 1996) (defendant had an inefficient and ineffective anti-harassment policy and\n“leisurely” responded to harassment complaints; whether the policy could have been\nmore effective and better-implemented may have some bearing on whether defendant\nwas negligent, but noting that is not the standard for deliberate indifference). The\naffidavits relied on by the majority do not create a genuine issue of material fact on the\nissue of deliberate indifference. The majority has not cited any case law, and my own\nresearch has uncovered none, holding that good faith (although inefficient) policies and\nprograms addressing peer harassment and bullying may be considered in the deliberate\nindifference context only if the students subjectively perceive them to be “serious\ninstruction;” only if temporary substitute teachers are aware of them; and only if they\nhave been first shown to have “significant lasting impact.”\n\n       In light of the above, it seems to me that the district judge properly found that\nthere were no genuine disputed issues of material fact and that, as a matter of law, the\nschool was not deliberately indifferent. As already noted, deliberate indifference is a\nhigh standard to meet, and the analysis is very deferential to schools. Relying on Davis,\nsupra, the Sixth Circuit has described the appropriate legal standard as follows:\n\n       The recipient is liable for damages only where the recipient itself\n       intentionally acted in clear violation of Title IX by remaining deliberately\n       indifferent to known acts of harassment.

The Sixth\nCircuit’s language is particularly on point in this case:\n\n       The recipient is not required to “remedy” sexual harassment nor ensure\n       that students conform their conduct to certain rules, but rather, “the\n       recipient must merely respond to known peer harassment in a manner\n       that is not clearly unreasonable.” Davis, 526 U.S. at 648-649. The\n       deliberate indifference standard “does not mean that recipients can avoid\n       liability only by purging their schools of actionable peer harassment or\n       that administrators must engage in particular disciplinary action.” Id. at\n       648. The standard does not mean that recipients must expel every student\n       accused of misconduct. See id. Victims do not have a right to particular\n       remedial demands. See id. Furthermore, courts should not second guess\n       the disciplinary decisions that school administrators make. See id.\n       “The Supreme Court has pointedly reminded us, however, that this is ‘not\n       a mere “reasonableness” standard’ that transforms every school\n       disciplinary decision into a jury question.” Gant, 195 F.3d at 141\n       (quoting Davis, 526 U.S. at 649). In an appropriate case, there is no\n       reason why courts on motion for a directed verdict could not identify a\n       response as not “clearly unreasonable” as a matter of law. See Gant, 195\n       F.3d at 141.\nId. The majority glosses over this high legal standard rather quickly, see Maj. Op. at 12-\n13, and it seizes upon the following additional language in Vance:\n\n       [W]here a school district has knowledge that its remedial action is\n       inadequate and ineffective, it is required to take reasonable action in light\n       of those circumstances to eliminate the behavior. Where a school district\n       has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective, and it\n       continues to use those same methods to no avail, such district has failed\n       to act reasonably in light of the known circumstances.\n231 F.3d at 261. The majority seems to interpret these two sentences to mean that even\nif the school district takes disciplinary action in response to all known harassment, and\neven if that action is 100% effective against the individual harassers, it may be liable if\nthere is subsequent harassment by new offenders. There is no authoritative case law to\nsupport such an interpretation. For this sweeping expansion of Vance, the majority relies\nheavily on a single out-of-circuit district court case, Theno v. Tonganoxie Unified School\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                 Page 28\n\n\nDist.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Kan. 2005). The district judge in that case did,\nindeed, reach the same conclusion as the majority. However, there are two reasons why\nit cannot be relied upon.\n\n       First, it is merely one district judge’s opinion and has no authoritative value.\nIndeed, this very same panel recently noted that intra-circuit district court cases are of\nlimited value. See United States Student Ass’n Foundation v. Land, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1361493\"><a href=\"/opinion/1361493/us-student-assn-foundation-v-land/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383\nn.8, 385 n.10 (6th Cir. 2008). It seems to me, then, that the opinion of a single district\ncourt judge from outside this circuit is an even thinner reed upon which to base an\nexpansion of this court’s jurisprudence.\n\n       Second, and more significantly, it is not persuasive regarding the applicable legal\nstandard. I do not believe the district judge’s opinion in Theno and the majority’s\nopinion today are justified by the Sixth Circuit’s analysis in Vance, nor are they\notherwise consistent with any circuit’s case law. The harassment in Vance was far more\negregious, and the response thereto was far less appropriate, than in this case. The\nstudent in Vance was subjected to widespread harassment and physical abuse. She was\nthe victim of frequent and vulgar name-calling (“whore” and “gay girl,” etc.), and she\nwas touched inappropriately in almost every class. She was stabbed in the hand with a\npen during one assault, and, on another occasion, two students held her down and tried\nto rip off her clothes while another student took off his pants and said that he was going\nto rape her. School officials “talked to” the offenders, but, incredibly, did not take any\nfurther disciplinary action against them. The harassing conduct not only continued, but\nit increased. In fact, the offenders confronted her after they had been “talked to”\nspecifically in order to harass her again. Even though “‘talking to the offenders’\nproduced no results, [the school] continued to employ this ineffective method.” See 231\nF.3d at 262. It was this factual background which led this court to conclude that if a\nschool district “has actual knowledge that its efforts to remediate are ineffective, and it\ncontinues to use those same methods to no avail, such district has failed to act reasonably\nin light of the known circumstances.” Id. at 261. Vance thus confronted the situation\nwhere the harassing students re-offended after they were disciplined (i.e., the discipline\n\fNo. 08-1008            Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                             Page 29\n\n\n“produced no results”), yet the school knowingly continued to use the same ineffective\nmethod. This conclusion has no application whatsoever to the present case where the\nreprimands and other forms of discipline were extraordinarily effective as to the known\noffenders. The facts of this case are plainly distinguishable from Vance. Again, the\ndefendant here investigated DP’s complaints, and the offending students were counseled,\nreprimanded, suspended, and/or expelled, depending on the nature of their specific\nmisconduct. No student who received discipline ever bothered DP again. The undisputed\nfacts thus establish that the school district’s actions were 100% effective with respect to\nthose students.\n\n         On this point, a decision out of the Third Circuit is very similar and persuasive.\nSee Doe v. Bellefonte Area School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">23718302</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (M.D. Pa.

He was called “queer,” “gay boy,” “pixie,”\n“faggot,” and “peter-eater,” among other things. He was pushed at school and physically\nassaulted at the bus stop. He reported some (but not all) of the bullying and harassment,\nand the school took varying degrees of disciplinary action when the harassment was\nreported. Some of the offenders were given verbal warnings and reprimands, some were\ncounseled about the seriousness of the harassment, some were given detention, and\nothers were suspended. Notably, every time the school warned or disciplined an\noffender, “that perpetrator never bothered Doe again. The School District’s method of\ndealing with specific, identified perpetrators involving Doe was one hundred percent\neffective.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">23718302</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. Based on the 100% success rate with the\nindividual offenders, coupled with the school agreeing to be extra “vigilant” of the\nproblems and having an anti-harassment policy, the district court granted summary\njudgment in favor of the school district because “no reasonable finder of fact could\nconclude that the School District was deliberately indifferent to the harassment of Doe,\n\n\n\n\n         7\n           Although this is an unpublished case and has no precedential value in this circuit, a decision of\na three-judge panel from a sister court of appeals has to be more persuasive than a single district judge’s\nopinion from outside this circuit.\n\fNo. 08-1008        Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.

Appx. at 799. He argued that the school’s response\nwas clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstance that the harassment\ncontinued, even though “each subsequent incident involved a student other than the\nstudent that had been disciplined in any of the prior incidents of harassment directed at\nDoe.” Id. In affirming, the Third Circuit relied upon the Supreme Court’s guidance to\nlower courts in Davis, and held:\n\n       The relevant inquiry for purposes of evaluating whether the School\n       District here was deliberately indifferent to known circumstances of\n       harassment is to review its response to reported incidents of harassment.\n       Each and every time Doe complained, the School District responded with\n       reasonable actions which eliminated further harassment between Doe\n       and the student(s) involved in each incident. Students were suspended\n       and others were given warnings and counseled regarding the seriousness\n       of harassment. In addition, the School District circulated memoranda to\n       faculty and staff putting them on notice of the reported harassment of\n       Doe and requesting assistance to prevent further incidents. Doe was\n       provided with a special means of reporting any additional harassment\n       through the school psychologist, whom he knew personally. The School\n       District also held assemblies and enacted policies addressing peer-to-peer\n       harassment. Such actions are not clearly unreasonable.\n       Nor was the School District deliberately indifferent because it did not\n       undertake the specific remedial action that Doe desired given what he\n       perceived to be the “systemic nature of the harassment.” Davis does not\n       require school districts to purge their schools of actionable peer\n       harassment or to engage in particular disciplinary action. Id. at 648. We\n       will refrain from second-guessing the disciplinary decisions made by the\n       School District which effectively eliminated each reported source of\n       harassment. We do not minimize the unfortunate verbal abuse that Doe\n       was subjected to during his high school years, but the School District was\n       not deliberately indifferent because additional harassment occurred\n       under new and different circumstances. We will affirm the judgment of\n       the district court.\n\fNo. 08-1008             Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.

The plaintiff in S.S. v. Eastern\nKentucky Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425563\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425563/ss-v-eastern-kentucky-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2008), who had physical and mental disabilities,\nwas harassed by fellow students. The harassment was systemic and it lasted for three\nyears. Among many other things, the students called him “gay,” “queer,” “bastard,” and\n“retard;” they pushed and tackled him in the hallway and lunchroom; they threw paper\ntowels at him that had been soaked with water or urine; they threw bleach on him in\nscience class; and they slammed his head into a glass sneeze-guard, the latter incident\nnecessitating a trip to the hospital and treatment for a sprained neck. On one occasion,\na student sexually assaulted the plaintiff by grabbing plaintiff’s genitals and saying\n“Now I’ll see if you are a woman.” After a fight between the plaintiff and “one of his\nfrequent attackers,” the police were called to the school.9 When these incidents were\nreported, “they were investigated, and responsive action was taken.” See S.S. v. Eastern\nKentucky Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335803\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335803/ss-v-eastern-kentucky-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The school responded to the\nincidents of which it was made aware by conducting interviews to decide who was at\nfault and disciplining those who were; instructing S.S.’s classmates not to taunt him;\nspeaking to the students about the name-calling; adding extra monitoring; at times\n\n\n\n\n         8\n           Bellefonte, as noted, is quite similar to this case. The Third Circuit found it significant that the\noffending students were given warnings and counseled about the seriousness of their actions; each time\nthe school took action the harassment by that particular student stopped; the teachers were advised and\nagreed to be vigilant about future harassment; the plaintiff was given the means to report harassment\nthrough a faculty member whom he knew and trusted; and the school district had an anti-harassment\npolicy. Each of these factors is present here. I also note that in deciding Bellefonte, the Third Circuit\nimpliedly rejected the interpretation of Vance suggested by the majority today, even though it was urged\nby the appellant on appeal.

The district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the school, and, on appeal, the Sixth Circuit confined its\nanalysis to the deliberate indifference issue. To illustrate the distinction between when\nthe issue should be left for the jury to decide, and when it can be decided on summary\njudgment, this court discussed two district court cases that it believed were “instructive,”\nK.M. v. Hyde Park Cent.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Md. 2002).11 In\nK.M., the student endured peer harassment for years. The school had notice of the\nharassment, but it took no steps to help or protect him and no one was disciplined. On\nthose particular facts, the district court properly denied summary judgment for the\nschool. Biggs, by contrast, involved similar peer-on-peer harassment, but in that case the\nschool took action whenever there was a reported incident, including counseling the\nvictim, meeting with the offenders and threatening them with suspension, notifying the\nparents, and alerting teachers to the problem. Because such responses established that\nthe school district was not deliberately indifferent, the district court properly granted\nsummary judgment for the school. The Sixth Circuit observed that the facts of S.S.\n“closely mirrored” Biggs and it went on to conclude that the school was not deliberately\nindifferent as a matter of law, even though its efforts were unsuccessful and even though\nthe widespread harassment continued. This court explained that “meeting with the\nstudents, communicating with parents, and disciplining the offending students” simply\ndid not “give rise to an inference that [the school] was deliberately indifferent to S.S.’s\n\n\n         10\n           Although the action was not filed under Title IX, the Sixth Circuit evaluated the ADA claim\npursuant to, and applied the deliberate indifference standard under, the framework set forth in Davis. See\n532 F.3d at 453-54.\n         11\n             I note that the Sixth Circuit looked to these out-of-circuit district court cases merely for\nillustrative purposes and not, as the majority apparently does with Theno, as a significant basis for its\nholding.\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                    Page 33\n\n\nsituation or that it had an attitude of permissiveness that amounted to discrimination.”\nSee 532 F.3d at 455-56. Insofar as the defendant here took essentially the same action\n(investigating, counseling, extra monitoring by staff, seating preferences to separate DP\nfrom problem students, meeting with and disciplining the students found at fault,\ncontacting parents, and assisting the police --- the sum of which was 100% effective\nagainst the individual harassers), this case is a close fit to the scenario in S.S.\n\n        That is not to say, of course, that a school may avoid liability merely by taking\nsome action, however minor, in response to known harassment. See Vance, supra, 231\nF.3d at 260 (rejecting the argument that as long as a school district “does something in\nresponse to harassment,” then it has not acted with deliberate indifference) (emphasis\nadded). The pertinent inquiry is whether the response was appropriate under the\nparticular circumstances. Quoting the Title IX guidelines, Vance described an\n“appropriate response” to known harassment as follows:\n\n        [Schools] should take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate or\n        otherwise determine what occurred and take steps reasonably calculated\n        to end any harassment, eliminate a hostile environment if one has been\n        created, and prevent harassment from occurring again.\nId. at 261 n.5 (emphasis added). Thus, a school acts appropriately if it investigates what\nhas already occurred, reasonably tries to end any harassment still ongoing by the\noffenders, and seeks to prevent the offenders from engaging in such conduct again. That\nis exactly what happened in this case. It is manifestly unreasonable to read the guidelines\nand Vance as holding that a school district may be responsible for not preventing future\nharassment by entirely separate and new harassers. To suggest otherwise, as the majority\ndoes, comes extremely close to requiring that schools be “purged” of all offensive\nbehavior and be completely harassment-free, which the Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit\nhave unequivocally held is not required --- or possible. See Vance, supra, 231 F.3d at\n260-61 (citing and quoting Davis).\n\n        Whether the defendant, from an objective viewpoint, could have (or should have)\ndone more to stop the harassment is not the appropriate inquiry. “Lack of objective\nreasonableness, i.e., a failure to act as a reasonable person would have acted, does not\n\fNo. 08-1008         Patterson et al. v. Hudson Area Schools et al.                Page 34\n\n\nby itself equal deliberate indifference.” See Brooks v. Celeste, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (6th Cir.\n1994). Nor does liability turn upon whether the school successfully remedied the\nharassment. The only question is whether the school “intentionally acted in clear\nviolation of Title IX by remaining deliberately indifferent to known acts of harassment,”\nand whether its response was so “clearly unreasonable” and inadequate that it facilitated\nand subjected DP to harassment. Vance, supra, 231 F.3d at 260; see also Davis, supra,\n526 U.S. at 642-47. Based on the undisputed facts in the record, any reasonable juror\nwould have to answer that question “No.” Therefore, as a matter of law, the district court\nproperly held that the defendant was not deliberately indifferent.\n\n        For these reasons, I believe the district court’s decision should be affirmed and\nI respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
