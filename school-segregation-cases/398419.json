The Plaintiffs --\n\nShernika Holton and ten other representative parents of black children attending\n\nelementary, middle, and high schools operated by the District, and the Thomas\n\nCounty Branch of the NAACP -- allege that the District has failed to do so, and\n\nrequest that judicial supervision of the District’s desegregation efforts be imposed.\n\n       After a lengthy bench trial, the district court found that racial imbalances\n\nexisted in several areas of the District’s operations, but that these imbalances were\n\nneither traceable to prior de jure segregation nor the result of present intentional\n\ndiscrimination. Accordingly, the district court concluded that the District had\n\nsatisfied its constitutional obligation to desegregate. For the most part, we can\n\ndiscern no error in the district court’s findings of fact or its application of the law.\n\nHowever, as to the Plaintiffs’ claim that the District’s use of “ability grouping” to\n\ndetermine classroom assignments discriminates on the basis of race, we conclude\n\nthat the district court failed to apply the legal standard long accepted in this Circuit,\n\n\n       *\n         Honorable Richard F. Suhrheinrich, United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\n                                                2\n\fand that this legal error tainted its findings of fact. Accordingly, we affirm in part,\n\nreverse in part, and remand for reconsideration of the ability-grouping issue in light\n\nof the correct legal standard.\n\n\n\n                                           I.\n\n      Notably, this case differs from the other school desegregation cases that\n\nhave come before us in recent years, in that the City of Thomasville School District\n\nhas never operated under any court-imposed desegregation order or other court\n\nsupervision. Indeed, this lawsuit is the first desegregation suit ever brought against\n\nthe District. Because no court has ever imposed a desegregation order on the\n\nDistrict, we face whether it is appropriate to do so for the first time now.\n\n      Specifically, the Plaintiffs raise two broad causes of action. First, they claim\n\nthat the District “has perpetuated, failed to disestablish and maintained\n\npurposefully racially segregated and unequal public schools . . . and, thus, has\n\nacted contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983.” Second, they allege that the District “has perpetuated and failed to\n\ndisestablish racially segregated public schools . . . , has acted with the purpose and\n\neffect of subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination in a federally funded program and,\n\nthus, has acted contrary to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f2000d, and implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 100.”1\n\n       The Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction requiring the District to (a)\n\ndisestablish its racially segregated school system; (b) adopt and implement a plan\n\neffectively to desegregate its buildings and classrooms; (c) provide equal\n\neducational facilities, resources, materials, and instruction to all students, and to\n\nprovide compensatory instruction to students previously denied that opportunity;\n\n(d) cease all discriminatory imposition of discipline; and (e) desegregate all student\n\nactivities, and cease discrimination against black students in this area.\n\n       The district court certified a class of “all present and future parents or\n\nguardians of African American children enrolled or eligible to be enrolled within\n\nthe Thomasville City School District.” Thomas County Branch of N.A.A.C.P. v.\n\nThomasville City Sch. Dist., 187 F.R.D. 690, 700 (M.D. Ga. 1999). It later denied\n\nDefendant’s motions for summary judgment and to reconsider class certification.\n\nThomas County Branch of N.A.A.C.P. v. Thomasville City Sch. Dist., No. 6:98-\n\nCV-63, 2003 WL 169758, at *3 (M.D. Ga. Jan. 21, 2003) (unpublished). In the\n\n\n\n       1\n         The district court grouped these claims together, observing that “[i]f [the District’s]\nactions are found to violate Plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection, Defendant will also be liable\nunder Title VI.” Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1366 (citing Gratz v. Bollinger,\n539 U.S. 244, 276 n.23, 123 S. Ct. 2411, 156 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2003), which provides that\n“discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\ncommitted by an institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes a violation of Title VI”).\nOn appeal, the Plaintiffs do not argue that Title VI has any distinct application; accordingly, like\nthe district court, we treat the two causes of action as being coextensive.\n\n                                                  4\n\fsame order, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, finding that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, any present racial\n\nimbalances in the District are presumptively the result of the District’s previous de\n\njure segregation. Id. at *2.\n\n      Thereafter, the district court tried the case without a jury from July 21 to\n\nAugust 6, 2003. Based on the evidence presented, the trial judge made a series of\n\ndetailed factual findings. We repeat just the basics here, as these findings are laid\n\nout with great clarity and detail in the district court’s order, dated February 5,\n\n2004. See Thomas County Branch of N.A.A.C.P. v. City of Thomasville Sch.\n\nDist., 299 F. Supp. 2d 1340 (M.D. Fla. 2004) (“Thomas County NAACP”).\n\n      First, as background, the district court outlined the history of the District’s\n\ndesegregation efforts, including numerous reorganizations of the District’s schools.\n\nAt the time the Supreme Court issued its seminal opinion in Brown v. Board of\n\nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), declaring that racial\n\nsegregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, the District was operating a de jure segregated school\n\nsystem. Until 1965, the District’s schools remained segregated, with two\n\nelementary schools (grades 1-6) serving black students and four serving white\n\nstudents, as well one high school (grades 7-12) for black students and another for\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fwhite students.\n\n      Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the District adopted\n\nits first desegregation plan, which became effective at the start of the 1965-66\n\nschool year. The plan was based upon freedom of choice, permitting parents to\n\nelect which school their children would attend. This method failed to accomplish\n\nany desegregation, and the District’s historically black schools remained all black.\n\n      A series of exchanges between the District and the Department of Health,\n\nEducation, and Welfare (“HEW”) ensued, culminating in the District’s adoption of\n\na new desegregation plan in 1970. This plan created a single high school for all\n\nstudents in grades 9-12, regardless of race; a single middle school for all students\n\nin grades 7-8, regardless of race; a single school for all students in grade 6,\n\nregardless of race; a single school for all students in grade 5, regardless of race;\n\nand four elementary schools among which all students in grades 1-4 could select\n\nbased on freedom of choice. The plan further provided that “[i]f the ‘freedom of\n\nchoice’ plan does not eliminate the racial identifiability of each of the four\n\nelementary schools, alternate steps will be taken to give this assurance.” HEW\n\nfound that the plan would accomplish the purposes of Title VI and accepted the\n\nplan on July 1, 1970.\n\n      Some reconfiguration of the District’s schools occurred between 1970 and\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f1993, and by the start of the 1993-94 school year, the District was operating four\n\nelementary schools serving grades 1-5 (Douglass, Harper, Jerger, and Scott), one\n\nmiddle school serving grades 6-8 (McIntyre Park), and one high school for grades\n\n9-12 (Thomasville High). At the end of the 2001-02 school year, Douglass\n\nElementary School closed, and since then the District has maintained the remaining\n\nthree elementary schools, as well as its single middle and high schools.\n\n      After providing this background, the district court went on to make detailed\n\nfindings of fact concerning racial imbalances in various areas of the District’s\n\noperations. The district court found racial imbalances to exist in these areas: the\n\nstudent populations of the District’s elementary schools; the composition of some\n\nindividual classes within the District’s schools; the faculty assigned to the\n\nDistrict’s elementary schools; the staff assigned to some of the District’s schools;\n\nthe composition of the student population participating in the District’s gifted and\n\nspecial education programs; and possibly the number of students subjected to\n\ndisciplinary actions.\n\n      Regarding the first area -- student populations of the District’s elementary\n\nschools -- the district court found that two schools were “racially identifiable,”\n\nmeaning that the percentage of black students enrolled varied more than twenty\n\npercent from the district-wide percentage of black students in the grades served by\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fthe school. Harper, the district court found, was an identifiably black school,\n\nwhereas Jerger was an identifiably white school. In the school year 2002-03, for\n\nexample, the district-wide percentage of black students was 73.6, while Harper’s\n\nstudent body was 98.5% black and Jerger’s was 39.8% black. Scott, the single\n\nnon-racially identifiable elementary school, had a student population that was 90%\n\nblack.\n\n         The district court found, however, that these racial imbalances were not\n\ntraceable in any proximate way to the District’s former de jure segregated school\n\nsystem. Notably, from 1970 (when the District adopted its second desegregation\n\nplan) until 1976, the black student population of at least three of the four\n\nelementary schools the District then operated “closely tracked the percentage of\n\nblack students in the District as a whole.” Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 1355. During that period, no student attended a school whose black student\n\npopulation varied by more than twenty percent from the district-wide percentage of\n\nblack students.\n\n         The district court supplied this table to illustrate the data:\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f                                    Percentage of Black Students\n   School       District,      Balfour          Harper       Jerger         Scott\n    Year       Grades 1-4\n 1970-71       57.4          53.4             63.2        60.1          54.9\n 1971-72       62.4          58.3             72.1        68.8          56.1\n 1972-73       65.9          57.8             82.5        66.8          61.1\n 1973-74       67.8          64.7             83.2        68.9          59.2\n 1974-75       66.3          66.1             85.6        66.8          55.3\n 1975-76       67.9          73.0             87.3        63.5          56.1\n\n      The racial imbalances that subsequently developed within the District’s\n\nschools, the district court found, were the result of pronounced enrollment and\n\ndemographic changes in the school District. Following the implementation of the\n\n1970 desegregation plan, the district court observed, white enrollment in the\n\nDistrict’s schools declined substantially, while black enrollment remained fairly\n\nstable. From the 1970-71 school year to the 1977-78 school year, black students\n\nwent from constituting 51.74% to 65.78% of the District’s enrollees.\n\n      In addition, the City of Thomasville experienced population shifts during\n\nthat period. In 1970, the City’s black population was concentrated primarily in the\n\nCity’s southwestern sector, and since that time, the distribution of Thomasville’s\n\nblack population has changed. For example, Harper elementary school was\n\n“surrounded by some predominantly white communities” in 1970, but by 1980,\n\n\n                                          9\n\fthat area had become almost entirely black, and by 1990, “there were few, if any,\n\nwhite students left in the area.” Id. at 1356. As the neighborhoods around Harper\n\nbecame increasingly black, so did Harper’s student population. The district court\n\nexplained that “demographics overtook the Desegregation Plan,” so that Harper’s\n\nvariance from the district-wide enrollment of black students went from 6% in 1970\n\nto almost 20% in 1975. Id. Meanwhile, the District’s other elementary schools\n\nvaried by no more than 11% in this respect.\n\n      The disparity at Harper came to the attention of HEW, and on May 13, 1975,\n\nit sent a letter to the District’s Superintendent advising that the U.S. District Court\n\nfor the District of Columbia had ordered it in Adams v. Weinberger, 391 F. Supp.\n\n269 (D.D.C. 1975), to put school districts on notice “to rebut or explain the\n\nsubstantial racial disproportion in one or more of the district’s schools.” HEW\n\nstated that “The court defined a racially disproportionate school as one in which a\n\n‘20 percent disproportion exists between the percentage of local minority pupils in\n\nthe schools and the percentage in the entire school district.’” Several exchanges\n\nbetween the District and HEW followed, and the District explained its student\n\nassignment procedures to HEW in these terms:\n\n      Assignments are based upon freedom of choice, modified only to the\n      extent hereinafter stated. Freedom of choice forms are issued to all\n      pupils each year. If a school reaches its capacity, priority is given to\n      the child nearest the school. If a parent or student fails to return the\n\n                                           10\n\f      form, the student is assigned by school officials to the school nearest\n      the student’s home which has not been filled to capacity. In order to\n      maximize a biracial complexion in the Harper School, freedom of\n      choice is modified in two respects: (a) Whites residing in the Harper\n      area have been required to attend Harper notwithstanding their\n      selection of another school under freedom of choice[;] (b) Priority has\n      been given to whites desiring to attend Harper as against blacks\n      residing closer to that school.\n\n      After receiving this explanation and other information, HEW “determined\n\nthat no further student desegregation is required of [the District] at this time.” On\n\nNovember 17, 1975, HEW found the District“in compliance with Title VI of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 relative to assignment of students . . . to schools.”\n\nHowever, HEW also noted that the situation at Harper warranted monitoring.\n\n      Beginning in 1977, racial imbalances in the District’s elementary schools\n\nbegan gradually to increase. No formal plan was adopted by the District to address\n\nthese imbalances, but in 1994, the District created a task force to consider the\n\nissue. The task force made consensus recommendations regarding a new process\n\nfor assigning students to elementary schools. The District implemented these\n\nrecommendations, with a few modifications, in 1995. The new assignment process\n\nis based primarily on parent preferences. If space does not permit accommodation\n\nof all preferences, a priority system based on special education considerations,\n\nsibling placement, and residency, determines the assignment.\n\n      Based on this history and data, the district court concluded that two\n\n                                          11\n\felementary schools -- Harper and Jerger -- “are clearly racially identifiable\n\nschools.”   Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1358. To illustrate the\n\ndata supporting this conclusion, the court supplied this table:\n\n                                     Percentage of Black Students\n   School         District       Harper         Jerger         Scott        Douglass\n    Year\n 1999-2000     74.3           100            39.1           84.1           99.6\n 2000-2001     75.2           100            40.3           88.6           100\n 2001-2002     76.0           99.3           41.7           88.7           100\n 2002-2003     73.6           98.5           39.8           90.9           Closed\n\n      Nevertheless, the court found,“that the racial composition of the District’s\n\nelementary schools is currently ‘imbalanced’ because of changes in the racial\n\nmakeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the\n\nenrollment of the District’s schools caused by declining white enrollment as\n\ncompared to black enrollment.” Id. Moreover, the court found “that the current\n\nracial imbalances of the District’s elementary schools are not due to any intentional\n\ndiscrimination on the part of the District and are not vestiges of the District’s\n\nprevious de jure racially segregated system.” Id.\n\n      As to the second racially imbalanced area of the District’s operations --\n\nindividual classes within its schools -- the district court found the imbalances to be\n\nthe result of the District’s use of “ability grouping” or “tracking” to assign students\n\n                                           12\n\fto classes.2 The District, the court explained, begins to group students into classes\n\nbased on their perceived abilities as early as kindergarten. As a result, the court\n\nobserved:\n\n       Regrettably, a disproportionate number of low income children (most\n       of whom happen to be black) are placed in the lower ability groups.\n       The Court finds that these placements are not being made due to the\n       race of the student. Many of these low income students are simply\n       perceived as not being prepared with they first arrive at school. Due\n       to their impoverished environment, they do not receive the\n       background and support that is often so critical for being ready to\n       learn. Tragically, it appears that for many of these children, the “die\n       is cast” as early as kindergarten. These children do not appear to be\n       reevaluated (and thus potentially “re-tracked”) during their\n       progression through the system. The inevitable result therefore is that\n       they remain in the “lower ability” track for the duration of their\n       educational careers, absent parental intervention.\n\nId.\n\n       The district court made “no finding as to whether some placements may be\n\naffected by the subtle racism of low expectations,” but concluded that the District\n\ndoes not manipulate the tracking system to track based on race, and that\n\n“intentional racial discrimination is not the reason for placement decisions.” Id. at\n\n1358 n.21.\n\n       2\n         The district court did not make findings as to the precise racial composition of classes\nwithin the District. The court simply observed that “Plaintiffs presented evidence at trial that\nmany of the less academically advanced classes in the District’s schools are predominantly black\nwhile most of the more academically advanced classes are predominantly white. The Court\nfinds that Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of racial imbalances in certain classes to\nrequire the District to rebut the presumption that those imbalances are traceable to the District’s\nprevious de jure segregated system.” Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1358.\n\n                                                13\n\f       Regarding the third area of racial imbalance -- the District’s faculty -- the\n\ndistrict court found that the imbalances were “not traceable in a proximate way to\n\nthe District’s previous de jure segregated system.” Id. at 1360. The most recent\n\navailable data, the district court observed, indeed showed racial imbalances within\n\nthe faculty:\n\n                                      Percentage of Black Faculty\n  School Year         District          Harper               Jerger            Scott\n 1999-2000         36.0             68.0              9.7               24.2\n 2000-2001         32.4             65.2              10.8              18.2\n 2001-2002         29.7             76.2              8.6               8.3\n 2002-2003         26.0             58.8              8.8               11.1\n\n       Nevertheless, the court observed, the District made “remarkable progress” in\n\ndesegregating its faculty following the implementation of its 1970 desegregation\n\nplan, so that for more than 10 years afterwards, no elementary school had a\n\npercentage of black faculty members that varied more than 15% from the district-\n\nwide percentage of black elementary faculty. Id. The court illustrated the data this\n\nway:\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f                   Percentage of Black Faculty\n   School            District        Balfour           Scott           Jerger          Harper\n    Year\n 1970-1971         44.2            42.9            43.5             31.3            45.5\n 1971-1972         43.4            46.2            36.4             37.5            45.5\n 1972-1973         47.3            46.2            42.1             40.0            54.5\n 1973-1974         43.2            42.9            36.8             35.3            41.7\n 1974-1975         45.7            42.9            36.8             41.2            54.5\n 1975-1976         41.1            40.0            40.0             41.2            45.5\n 1978-1979 3       41.1            35.7            42.9             37.5            38.5\n 1979-1980         43.3            38.5            40.9             35.3            46.2\n 1980-1981         39.3            36.4            39.1             35.3            42.9\n 1981-1982         36.2            30.8            43.5             35.3            35.7\n\n      Based on this data, the district court found that “the District’s Desegregation\n\nPlan effectively desegregated the District’s faculty,” and that the faculty\n\nassignment system is and has been administered without regard to race. Id.\n\nAccordingly, the court concluded that existing racial imbalances were not traceable\n\nto prior de jure segregation.\n\n      As to the fourth area of imbalance -- the District’s staff -- the district court\n\nfound that based on the limited evidence presented regarding the race of the\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          The district court’s table included no data for the school year 1976-1977 or 1977-1978.\n\n                                                 15\n\fDistrict’s elementary school principals and assistant principals,4 “any minimal\n\nimbalance that presently exists” was not proximately traceable to prior de jure\n\nsegregation or the result of intentional discrimination. Id. at 1361. The 1970\n\ndesegregation plan, the district court found, “effectively desegregated the District’s\n\nstaff” by assigning principals in a manner that ensured all students would attend at\n\nleast one school with a white principal and at least two schools with a black\n\nprincipal. Id.\n\n       As to the fifth imbalanced area -- the District’s gifted program for high-\n\nperforming students -- the district court observed black students were “arguably”\n\nunderrepresented in the program. Id. at 1362.5 However, the court found that\n\nplacement in the gifted program was governed by statewide eligibility\n\nrequirements,6 that no student had been admitted to the program without satisfying\n\n\n       4\n         The most recent data presented apparently showed only that during the 1994-1995\nschool year, the District’s K-5 schools Jerger, Harper, and Scott all had white principals;\nMacIntyre Park had a black principal and a white assistant principal; and Thomasville High had\na white principal and an assistant principal described by the district court as “BW,” with “B”\nsignifying black and “W” signifying white.\n       5\n         The district court did not lay out all of the relevant data in its opinion, but observed that\nthe Plaintiffs’ “statistical analysis of the students participating in the program arguably reveals a\ndisproportionate number of whites in the Gifted Program compared to their overall\nrepresentation in the school population.” Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1362.\n       6\n         Georgia Department of Education regulations provide that a student is eligible for\nparticipation in the Gifted Program if he or she:\n\n       (a) score[s] at the 99th percentile (for grades K-2) or the 96th percentile (for\n       grades 3-12) on the composite of full scale score of a standardized test of mental\n\n                                                  16\n\fthese requirements, and that no student satisfying the requirements had ever been\n\ndenied the opportunity to participate on the basis of race or otherwise.\n\nAccordingly, the court concluded that racial imbalances in the District’s gifted\n\nprogram were not proximately traceable to the District’s prior de jure segregation,\n\nnor were they the result of present intentional discrimination.\n\n       Regarding the sixth area of imbalance -- the district’s special education\n\nprogram -- the district court again found that black students were “arguably”\n\noverrepresented.7 Id. The program, the district court observed, was governed by\n\nmyriad state and federal regulations -- including rules issued by the Georgia\n\nDepartment of Education and procedures outlined in the Individuals with\n\nDisabilities Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. -- with which the District reasonably\n\ncomplied. Specifically, the court found no evidence that any student had been\n\nplaced in special education unless state and federal requirements were satisfied,\n\nand no evidence that race had ever been a factor in a placement decision.\n\n       ability and meet[s] one of the achievement criteria [described in the regulations],\n       or (b) qualif[ies] through a multiple-criteria assessment process by meeting the\n       criteria in any three of the following four areas: mental ability (intelligence),\n       achievement, creativity and motivation.\n\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1362 n.27 (alterations in original) (quoting Ga.\nDep’t of Educ. Reg. 160-4-2-.38).\n       7\n         The district court did not lay out the data with particularity in its opinion, but explained\nthat “Plaintiffs presented evidence that arguably showed a disproportionate number of black\nstudents are included in the Special Education Program.” Thomas County NAACP, 299 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1362.\n\n                                                  17\n\fAccordingly, the court concluded that any racial imbalance was not proximately\n\ntraceable to de jure segregation.\n\n      As to the final imbalanced area -- administration of discipline -- the district\n\ncourt assumed without deciding that black students were disproportionately\n\nsubjected to disciplinary action, concluding nevertheless that the District did not\n\ntreat black students differently from white students in disciplining them. The court\n\nfound no evidence that a black student had ever received a harsher punishment\n\nthan a white student for similar misconduct or that a black student had ever\n\nreceived a referral for punishment where a white student did not under the same or\n\nsimilar circumstances. The district court found that race had not been a factor in\n\nany disciplinary decision, and that any racial imbalance in the administration of\n\ndiscipline was not proximately traceable to past de jure segregation.\n\n      In addition, the district court examined several other facets of the\n\nThomasville school system where it found no racial imbalances present: the\n\nDistrict’s facilities, transportation services, and extracurricular activities. As to\n\nfacilities, the court found no disparity in the facility quality or resources of the\n\nDistrict’s identifiably black schools as compared to its identifiably white school,\n\nand concluded that race played no role in the District’s allocation of funds to the\n\nvarious schools. Regarding transportation, the district court observed that the only\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\ftransportation the District offered was for special education and extracurricular\n\nactivities, as well as a very limited route implemented after the closing of Douglass\n\nElementary to transport students previously enrolled there to Harper Elementary.\n\nThe court concluded that because Douglass’ student body had been 100% black,\n\nonly black students received transportation, and thus the District did not\n\ndiscriminate against black students in the provision of transportation. Regarding\n\nextracurricular activities, the court found that all of the District’s extracurriculars\n\nwere available to all students without regard to race, and that no racial imbalances\n\nexisted within those programs.\n\n      Based on these findings, the district court ruled in favor of the District,\n\nconcluding that although racial imbalances existed in some aspects of the District’s\n\nschools, they were neither traceable to the District’s prior de jure segregation, nor\n\nthe result of present intentional discrimination. The district court’s judgment,\n\ndated February 6, 2004, directed that each side would bear its own costs.\n\n                                            II.\n\n      The Plaintiffs raise five broad issues on appeal. First, they argue that the\n\ndistrict court’s failure to determine whether the District had achieved “unitary\n\nstatus” constitutes reversible error. Second, the Plaintiffs claim that the district\n\ncourt misapplied the so-called “Keyes” presumption that present racial imbalances\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fwithin a previously de jure segregated school system are a result of prior\n\nsegregation, because the burden of proof it placed on the District to rebut the\n\npresumption was too low in several respects. Third, the Plaintiffs say that the\n\ndistrict court failed to scrutinize with sufficient rigor the District’s use of “ability\n\ntracking” to assign students to classes. Fourth, the Plaintiffs contend that the\n\ndistrict court failed to articulate or apply any standard for intentional\n\ndiscrimination. Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that the district court’s legal errors\n\ninfected its factual findings, and that the court made several findings of fact that\n\nwere clearly erroneous.\n\n       In school desegregation cases, we review de novo the district court’s\n\ninterpretation and application of the law. N.A.A.C.P., Jacksonville Branch v.\n\nDuval County Sch., 273 F.3d 960, 965 (11th Cir. 2001) (“Jacksonville NAACP”);\n\nManning, 244 F.3d at 940. However, insofar as the Plaintiffs ask us to review the\n\ndistrict court’s factual findings, we do so only for clear error. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n52(a); Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 965; Manning ex rel. Manning v. Sch.\n\nBd., 244 F.3d 927, 940 (11th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                            A.\n\n       We begin with a brief overview of the applicable law of school\n\ndesegregation. The Supreme Court’s decisions in Brown v. Board of Education,\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954) (“Brown I”), and Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083 (1955) (“Brown\n\nII”), placed all de jure segregated school systems under a constitutional obligation\n\nto desegregate. See, e.g., Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 435-36, 88 S.\n\nCt. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716 (1968) (“[S]chool boards operating [dual] school\n\nsystems were required by Brown II ‘to effectuate a transition to a racially\n\nnondiscriminatory school system.’ . . . Brown II was a call for the dismantling of\n\nwell-entrenched dual systems . . . .”). The Supreme Court has explained this\n\naffirmative obligation in these terms: “The duty and responsibility of a school\n\ndistrict once segregated by law is to take all steps necessary to eliminate the\n\nvestiges of the unconstitutional de jure system. This is required in order to ensure\n\nthat the principal wrong of the de jure system, the injuries and stigma inflicted\n\nupon the race disfavored by the violation, is no longer present.” Freeman v. Pitts,\n\n503 U.S. 467, 485, 112 S. Ct. 1430, 118 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1992); see also, e.g.,\n\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28\n\nL. Ed. 2d 554 (1971) (explaining that formerly dual school systems are “clearly\n\ncharged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to\n\nconvert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root\n\nand branch” (quoting Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38)).\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f      A school district’s obligation is to eliminate the vestiges of past\n\ndiscrimination “to the extent practicable.” Manning, 244 F.3d at 943 (quoting\n\nLockett v. Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 839, 842 (11th Cir. 1997)). However, our Court\n\nand the Supreme Court have both explicitly rejected the notion that school systems\n\nmust eliminate vestiges of discrimination “to the maximum extent practicable.”\n\nSee, e.g., Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 101, 115 S. Ct. 2038, 132 L. Ed. 2d 63\n\n(1995) (explaining that the proper judicial inquiry is whether the district has\n\nremedied vestiges of de jure segregation “to the extent practicable,” not to the\n\n“maximum potential”); Manning, 244 F.3d at 943.\n\n      Judicial authority may be invoked when a school district fails to fulfill this\n\nduty: “If school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations under [Brown I,\n\nBrown II, and Green], judicial authority may be invoked. Once a right and a\n\nviolation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to\n\nremedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable\n\nremedies.” Swann, 402 U.S. at 15. However, “[i]n seeking to define . . . how far\n\nthis remedial power extends it is important to remember that judicial powers may\n\nbe exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation. Remedial judicial\n\nauthority does not put judges automatically in the shoes of school authorities\n\nwhose powers are plenary. Judicial authority enters only when local authority\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fdefaults.” Id. at 16. Accordingly, in deciding whether judicial supervision may\n\nproperly be imposed in this case, the key consideration is whether the District has\n\nmet its obligation to eliminate the vestiges of its dual school system “to the extent\n\npracticable.”\n\n      In determining whether past discrimination has been sufficiently eradicated,\n\nthe Supreme Court has advised, courts must examine a number of specific facets of\n\na school system: its faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and\n\nfacilities. Green, 391 U.S. at 435. These areas, “in addition to student attendance\n\npatterns, must be free from racial discrimination before the mandate of Brown is\n\nmet.” Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486. These so-called “Green factors,” the Court has\n\nexplained, “are a measure of the racial identifiability of schools in a system that is\n\nnot in compliance with Brown . . . .” Id.\n\n      In determining whether the school district has eliminated vestiges of de jure\n\nsegregation to the extent practicable in those six areas, “a critical beginning point is\n\nthe degree of racial imbalance in the school district, that is to say a comparison of\n\nthe proportion of majority to minority students in individual schools with the\n\nproportions of the races in the district as a whole.” Id. at 474. In historically\n\nsegregated school systems, the Supreme Court has held, “where it is possible to\n\nidentify a ‘white school’ or a ‘Negro school’ simply by reference to the racial\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fcomposition of teachers and staff, the quality of school buildings and equipment,\n\nor the organization of sports activities, a prima facie case of violation of\n\nsubstantive constitutional rights under the Equal Protection clause is shown.”\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 18.\n\n       The burden then shifts to the school district to demonstrate that the racial\n\nimbalances are “not the result of present or past discriminatory action on their\n\npart.” Id. at 26; accord Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494 (holding that in a formerly de\n\njure segregated school system, “[t]he school district bears the burden of showing\n\nthat any current imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior\n\nviolation”); Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 966; Manning, 244 F.3d at 942.8\n\n       One way for the school district to meet its burden is by showing that the\n\nracial imbalances are attributable to demographic forces. The Supreme Court has\n\n\n\n       8\n          The district court and the parties refer to the burden-shifting framework explicated in\nSwann and Freeman as the “Keyes presumption,” drawing on the Supreme Court’s opinion in\nKeyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973). Our\nprevious cases, too, have repeatedly attributed this methodology to Keyes. See, e.g., Manning,\n244 F.3d at 942; Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 966; Lee v. Etowah County Bd. of Educ.,\n963 F.3d 1416, 1425 (11th Cir. 1992). However, as the above discussion illustrates, what we\nhave called the “Keyes” presumption is actually rooted in Swann and Freeman. Keyes, in\ncontrast, addressed segregation in a school district that was never statutorily dual. The Supreme\nCourt held that a finding of systematic segregation in certain schools within a unified school\ndistrict creates a presumption that the remaining schools within the district were also\nsystematically segregated, absent a showing that the district was divided into clearly unrelated\nunits. Keyes, 413 U.S. at 207. Since Thomasville operated a school system that was formally\ndual in its entirety, Swann and Freeman are more closely on point than Keyes. Nevertheless, for\nsimplicity’s sake, we adhere to our Court’s imprecise but long-established terminology and call\nthe burden-shifting framework applicable here the “Keyes presumption.”\n\n                                               24\n\fexplained that “[a]s the de jure violation becomes more remote in time and . . .\n\ndemographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial\n\nimbalance in a school district is a vestige of the prior de jure system.” Freeman,\n\n503 U.S. at 496. Accordingly, “[o]nce the racial imbalance due to the de jure\n\nviolation has been remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy\n\nimbalance that is caused by demographic factors.” Id. at 494; accord Swann, 402\n\nU.S. at 31-32 (“Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally\n\nrequired to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student\n\nbodies once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished and racial\n\ndiscrimination through official action is eliminated from the system. This does not\n\nmean that federal courts are without power to deal with future problems; but in the\n\nabsence of a showing that either the school authorities or some other agency of the\n\nState has deliberately attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns to affect the\n\nracial composition of the schools, further intervention by a district court should not\n\nbe necessary.”).\n\n      If the school district can demonstrate that demographic factors are “a\n\nsubstantial cause” of the racial imbalances in its schools, “it overcomes the\n\npresumption that segregative intent is the cause, and there is no constitutional\n\nviolation.” Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 966; accord Manning, 244 F.3d at\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f944. The school district need not prove that demographics are the sole cause of the\n\nimbalances. As we have explained previously, “a plaintiff does not undermine the\n\nstrength of a defendant’s demographic evidence by merely asserting that\n\ndemographics alone do not explain the racial imbalances. Rather, for a plaintiff to\n\npreserve the presumption of de jure segregation, the plaintiff must show that the\n\ndemographic shifts are the result of the prior de jure segregation or some other\n\ndiscriminatory conduct.” Id. at 944-45 (footnote omitted).\n\n                                            B.\n\n      With this legal framework in mind, we turn now to each of the arguments\n\nthe Plaintiffs have raised on appeal.\n\n                                            1.\n\n      The Plaintiffs’ first claim is that the district court erred in failing to\n\ndetermine whether the District had achieved “unitary status.” Indeed, the district\n\ncourt explicitly declined to make such a determination, explaining: “To avoid\n\nconfusing terminology, the Court has refrained from using the terms ‘unitary’ or\n\n‘unitary status’ in describing its findings and conclusions in this case.” Thomas\n\nCounty NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1366 n. 30.\n\n      However, the district court’s decision not to make such a finding was not\n\nerror, for two reasons. First, an assessment of unitary status is generally only made\n\n\n\n                                            26\n\fwhen a district court is deciding “when it is appropriate to restore local control”\n\n(i.e., to end judicial supervision) of a school system. See Manning, 244 F.3d at\n\n942. This much is evident from the two factors courts consider in making the\n\nunitariness determination: (1) “whether local authorities have eliminated the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable,” and (2) “whether local\n\nauthorities have in good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and shown a\n\ncommitment to, the desegregation plan.” Id. In a case such as this one -- where\n\nthe school district has never been placed under judicial supervision -- the second\n\nprong of the inquiry has no application, since no desegregation plan has ever been\n\nimposed on the district.\n\n      Second, and more important, the Supreme Court and this Court have made\n\nclear that the substance of the judicial inquiry, not the terminology employed, is\n\nwhat matters. The usefulness of the terms “unitary” and “unitary status” has been\n\ncalled into question, and in fact the Supreme Court has urged the lower courts to\n\ndiscard these terms, explaining:\n\n      The lower courts have been inconsistent in their use of the term\n      “unitary.” Some have used it to identify a school district that has\n      completely remedied all vestiges of past discrimination. Under that\n      interpretation of the word, a unitary school district is one that has met\n      the mandate of [Brown and Green]. Other courts, however, have used\n      “unitary” to describe any school district that has currently\n      desegregated school assignments, whether or not that status is solely\n      the result of a court-imposed desegregation plan. In other words, such\n\n                                          27\n\f      a school district could be called unitary and nevertheless still contain\n      vestiges of past discrimination. That there is such confusion is\n      evident in Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v.\n      Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403 (CA11 1985), where the Court of Appeals\n      drew a distinction between a “unitary school district” and a district\n      that has achieved “unitary status.”\n\nBd. of Educ. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245, 111 S. Ct. 630, 112 L. Ed. 2d 715\n\n(1991) (citations omitted).\n\n      Accordingly, the Supreme Court explained that “it is a mistake to treat\n\nwords such as ‘dual’ and ‘unitary’ as if they were actually found in the\n\nConstitution. The constitutional command of the Fourteenth Amendment is that\n\n‘[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws.’” Id.\n\nat 245-46; see also Freeman, 503 U.S. at 487. This obligation, not whether a\n\nschool district may be labeled “unitary,” is the proper focus of judicial inquiry.\n\n      In Lee v. Etowah County Board of Education, 963 F.2d 1416 (11th Cir.\n\n1992), we similarly observed that “[m]uch confusion has arisen from the use of the\n\nterms ‘unitary’ and ‘unitary status.’” Id. at 1419 n.3. We therefore declared: “To\n\nminimize confusion, we discourage the future use of the term ‘unitary’ to describe\n\na system that has not eliminated vestiges of past discrimination to the extent\n\npracticable but is merely currently in compliance with a court-imposed\n\ndesegregation plan . . . .” Id. Thus, when the plaintiffs in Lee “complain[ed] that\n\nthe district court should have used the phrase ‘unitary status’ rather than the phrase\n\n                                            28\n\f‘unitary system,’” the Court stated: “The district court’s opinion makes clear that it\n\nfound that the defendants had eliminated the vestiges of their prior discrimination;\n\nthus, it is wholly irrelevant what precise language the district court used to\n\nannounce its findings.” Id. at 1424 n.9.\n\n       Mindful of the Supreme Court’s direction that “[s]ubstance, not semantics,\n\nmust govern” in remedying school segregation, Swann, 402 U.S. at 31, we hold\n\nthat the district court committed no error by declining to make a finding of “unitary\n\nstatus.”\n\n                                            2.\n\n       The Plaintiffs’ second argument on appeal is that the district court\n\nmisapplied the so-called “Keyes” presumption that present racial imbalances\n\nwithin a previously de jure segregated school system are proximately traceable to\n\nprior segregation, by placing too low a burden of proof on the District to rebut the\n\npresumption. Specifically, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in three\n\nways: it failed to hold the District to its obligation to eliminate the vestiges of\n\nsegregation to the extent practicable; it failed to require the District to show that its\n\nown policies were not factors contributing to its racial imbalances; and it failed to\n\nrequire the District to show that demographic changes were the “substantial” cause\n\nof the racial imbalances.\n\n\n\n                                            29\n\f       As to the first argument, the Plaintiffs suggest that the district court\n\nerroneously failed to require the District to present evidence that it had eliminated\n\nthe vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable -- that is, that the District had\n\ntaken “every reasonable effort . . . to eradicate segregation and its insidious\n\nresidue.” Appellants’ Br. at 23 (quoting Jacksonville, 273 F.3d at 973).\n\nEssentially, the Plaintiffs’ argument is that the district court failed to consider the\n\nsubstance of the unitariness analysis. The Plaintiffs are correct that the essence of\n\na school district’s desegregation duty is to eliminate the vestiges of segregation “to\n\nthe extent practicable,” and that the district court neglected to use this precise\n\nterminology in assessing whether the District had fulfilled its obligation.\n\nNevertheless, we can find no reversible error here, since the district court’s\n\nthorough opinion and detailed findings plainly illustrate that the court got the\n\nsubstance of the inquiry right.\n\n       A district court may impose court supervision of a school district’s\n\ndesegregation efforts “only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of\n\nalleviating the initial constitutional violation.” Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489.\n\nAccordingly, in considering whether to place a school district under judicial\n\nsupervision, the proper focus of a district court’s inquiry is on whether a\n\nconstitutional violation exists -- that is, whether the district has failed to meet its\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\fconstitutional obligation to desegregate its schools to the extent practicable. See,\n\ne.g., Swann, 402 U.S. at 16.\n\n       We have instructed the district courts that, in evaluating whether a school\n\ndistrict has “[met] its constitutional obligation to eliminate the vestiges of de jure\n\nsegregation to the extent practicable,” a court must examine the six areas of the\n\nschool system enumerated in Green, applying the “presumption that any current\n\nracial disparities in these areas are the result of [the district’s] past unlawful\n\nconduct.” Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 966. The school district “bears the\n\nburden of showing that any current imbalance [in these areas] is not traceable, in a\n\nproximate way, to the prior violation.” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 493).\n\n       Our case law establishes that if the school district proves that demographic\n\nshifts have substantially caused any current racial imbalances in the school system,\n\nit will have satisfied its constitutional obligation to eliminate the vestiges of\n\nsegregation to the extent practicable: “If a school board can prove that\n\n[demographic or other external] factors have substantially caused current racial\n\nimbalances in its schools, it overcomes the presumption that segregative intent is\n\nthe cause [of any racial imbalance], and there is no constitutional violation. Where\n\nthere is no constitutional violation, a school board is under no duty to remedy\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fracial imbalances.” Id.\n\n      Here, the district court repeatedly emphasized that the District was\n\nconstitutionally obligated to desegregate its schools, see, e.g., Thomas County\n\nNAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1343-51, 1366, but did not explicitly acknowledge\n\nthat the nature of the obligation was to eliminate the vestiges of segregation “to the\n\nextent practicable”; accordingly, the district court never explicitly determined\n\nwhether the District had satisfied this obligation. In spite of its failure to use the\n\nmost precise words, the district court got the substance of the inquiry right.\n\n      Heeding the Supreme Court’s directive that judicial authority may not be\n\ninvoked unless local authority has defaulted on its obligation to remedy a\n\nconstitutional violation, see Swann, 402 U.S. at 16, the district court focused its\n\ninquiry on whether any unremedied constitutional violation lingered in the\n\nThomasville school district. Since the District had previously operated a de jure\n\nsegregated school system, the district court observed first that the proper\n\nconsideration was “whether any vestiges of the previous de jure system still exist.”\n\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1366. To make this determination,\n\nthe district court evaluated at some length each of the Green factors (which, again,\n\ninclude student assignments, facilities, faculty and staff assignments,\n\ntransportation, and extracurricular activities), as well as the District’s curriculum\n\n\n\n                                           32\n\fand class assignments, gifted and special education programs, and discipline\n\nsystem, to determine whether racial imbalances were present in any of these areas.\n\nSee id. at 1352 & n.14. Invoking the so-called Keyes presumption, the district\n\ncourt observed that any such imbalances must be “presumed to be vestiges of the\n\nprevious de jure segregated system.” Id. at 1352.\n\n      Identifying racial imbalances in a number of the Green and other areas\n\n(elementary school student population; individual classes; faculty assignments;\n\nstaff assignment; gifted and special education programs; and disciplinary actions),\n\nthe court went on to “examine[] each of these areas to determine whether the\n\nDistrict has carried its burden of proof by proving by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that these racial imbalances are not traceable in a proximate way to the\n\nDistrict’s previous de jure segregated system.” Id. at 1354; see also id. at 1366.\n\nFor each imbalanced area, the district court unambiguously found that\n\ndemographic and other external factors -- including “changes in the racial makeup\n\nof the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the\n\nenrollment of the District’s schools caused by declining white enrollment as\n\ncompared to black enrollment” -- were the cause of the imbalance. Id. at 1358.\n\n      Upon determining that the District had carried its burden in a particular area,\n\nthe trial court then asked “whether the District presently engages in purposeful\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fracial discrimination” in that area. Id. at 1366. The district court found each area\n\nof the Thomasville school system to be free of intentional racial discrimination.\n\n       Finally, the district court concluded that “the District carried its burden of\n\nproving that the racial imbalances in [certain] areas were not traceable in a\n\nproximate way to its previous de jure segregated system,” and that “current\n\npurposeful discrimination did not proximately cause these imbalances.” Id. at\n\n1367. “[S]ince these imbalances are not vestiges of the previous de jure segregated\n\nsystem and are not the proximate result of presently practiced racial discrimination,\n\nthey do not support a claim under either the Fourteenth Amendment or Title VI.”\n\nId.; see also id. at 1352.\n\n       In substance, the district court’s analysis tracked precisely the methodology\n\nprescribed by the Supreme Court and this Court for determining whether a school\n\ndistrict has fulfilled its constitutional obligation to desegregate. In concluding that\n\nracial imbalances within the Thomasville school system were traceable not to any\n\nhistorical segregation but rather to demographic and other external forces, the\n\ndistrict court necessarily found that the District had eliminated the vestiges of\n\nsegregation “to the extent practicable.” Quite simply, the district court’s failure to\n\nemploy the term “to the extent practicable” does not amount to reversible error.\n\n       Next, the Plaintiffs suggest that the District’s burden of rebutting the\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\fpresumption of continuing segregation required it to demonstrate that “its policies\n\nand practices with respect to schoolsite location, school size, school renovations\n\nand additions, student-attendance zones, student assignment and transfer options,\n\nmobile classroom units, transportation of students, assignment of faculty and staff,\n\netc., considered together . . . were not factors in causing the existing condition of\n\nsegregation in these schools.” Appellants’ Br. at 28 (quoting Keyes, 413 U.S. at\n\n213-14).\n\n      The Plaintiffs have taken this standard out of context. For one thing, it\n\nderives from Keyes, which, as we noted earlier, dealt with a school system that was\n\nnot statutorily segregated. The standard the Plaintiffs quote lays out the burden a\n\nschool district faces in rebutting the presumption that an entire unified school\n\nsystem is infected with intentional segregation, which arises out of a finding of\n\nintentional segregation in a single school within that system. See Keyes, 413 U.S.\n\nat 213-14. The presumption is not applicable here, since Thomasville operated a\n\nschool system that was concededly segregated in its entirety under Georgia law.\n\n      Second, even if that presumption was applicable in this case, the Plaintiffs,\n\nwe think, have omitted with an ellipsis a crucial aspect of the standard. The\n\ndistrict’s burden is to prove that its policies and practices “either were not taken in\n\neffectuation of a policy to create or maintain segregation in the core city schools,\n\n\n\n                                           35\n\for, if unsuccessful in that effort, were not factors in causing the existing condition\n\nof segregation in these schools.” Id. at 214 (emphasis added). All the former\n\ncomponent requires the school district to prove is that its policies and practices\n\nwere not intentionally discriminatory. Only if the school district is unable to do so\n\nis it required to demonstrate that its policies “were not factors” in creating\n\nsegregated conditions. In this case, the district court concluded that the District’s\n\npolicies and practices were not intentionally discriminatory, and therefore the court\n\nhad no occasion to consider whether these policies were “factors” contributing to\n\nracial imbalances in Thomasville schools.\n\n      Third, our Court and the Supreme Court have repeatedly defined the burden\n\nthat a formerly de jure segregated school district must carry not as the Keyes-\n\nderived standard Plaintiffs favor, but rather the standard employed by the district\n\ncourt: “The school district bears the burden of showing that any current [racial]\n\nimbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior violation.” Freeman,\n\n503 U.S. at 494; accord, e.g., Manning, 244 F.3d at 942; Jacksonville NAACP, 273\n\nF.3d at 966.\n\n      The district court’s opinion illustrates that this was exactly the burden to\n\nwhich it held the District. See, e.g., Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n1352 (“The Court . . . finds that any racial imbalances that presently exist within\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\fthe District are not traceable in a proximate way to the de jure racially segregated\n\nsystem that existed at the time Brown I was decided almost fifty years ago. The\n\nCourt does find that racial imbalances presently exist within the District in certain\n\nareas. Under Keyes these racial imbalances are presumed to be vestiges of the\n\nprevious de jure segregated system. However, as set forth hereinbelow, the Court\n\nfinds that the District carried its burden of proof by rebutting that presumption.”);\n\nid. at 1366 (“For those areas in which the Court has found current racial\n\nimbalances, there is a presumption that those racial imbalances are vestiges of the\n\nDistrict’s previous de jure segregated system, and Defendant bears the burden of\n\nrebutting that presumption by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nracial imbalances are not traceable in a proximate way to the previous de jure\n\nsegregated system.”).9\n\n       The district court therefore held the City of Thomasville School District to\n\nthe appropriate burden, and committed no error in declining to place on the District\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that its policies and practices were not factors\n\n\n\n       9\n         The district court also explicitly acknowledged the Keyes standard advanced by the\nPlaintiffs, accurately explaining that Keyes held “that if a school board has intentionally engaged\nin segregative actions in a meaningful portion of its system, then a presumption is created that\nany segregation within the system is the result of that intentional segregation. The burden then\nshifts to the school board ‘to disprove segregative intent . . . [or show] that its past segregative\nacts did not create or contribute to the current segregated condition of the [school system].’”\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1350-51 (alterations in original) (emphasis added)\n(citation omitted) (quoting Keyes, 413 U.S. at 211).\n\n                                                 37\n\fcontributing to the racial imbalances within its schools.\n\n      Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by failing to require\n\nthe District to show that demographics were the “substantial” cause of the racial\n\nimbalances in its student population. The Plaintiffs concede that a school district\n\nmay overcome the presumption that racial imbalances are attributable to past de\n\njure segregation by demonstrating that they were instead caused by demographic\n\nshifts, but they maintain that the District’s showing in this case was inadequate,\n\nsince the district court did not find that demographics constituted a substantial\n\ncause of those imbalances. Because the district court’s careful analysis reveals that\n\nit unambiguously did find demographics to be the substantial cause of the racial\n\nimbalances in the student populations of certain Thomasville elementary schools,\n\nwe can discern no error.\n\n      We have repeatedly observed that one way for a school district to rebut the\n\npresumption that racial imbalances are attributable to past segregation is to “prove\n\nthat [demographic shifts or other external forces] have substantially caused current\n\nracial imbalances in its schools.” Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 966. Indeed,\n\nthe Supreme Court has explained that efforts to counteract the effects of\n\ndemographic shifts are simply beyond the scope of judicial authority:\n\n      The effect of changing residential patterns on the racial composition\n      of schools, though not always fortunate, is somewhat predictable.\n\n                                           38\n\f       Studies show a high correlation between residential segregation and\n       school segregation. . . . Where resegregation is a product not of state\n       action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional\n       implications. It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical\n       ability of the federal courts to try to counteract these kinds of\n       continuous and massive demographic shifts. To attempt such results\n       would require ongoing and never-ending supervision by the courts of\n       school districts simply because they were once de jure segregated.\n       Residential housing choices, and their attendant effects on the racial\n       composition of schools, present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult\n       to address through judicial remedies.\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 495.\n\n       After discussing at considerable length the Supreme Court’s precedents to\n\nthis effect, see Thomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1349-50, the district\n\ncourt conducted a detailed analysis of the effect of demographic shifts on the\n\nstudent populations of Thomasville’s elementary schools. Laying out the pertinent\n\ndata in table form, the district court explained that for the first six years after the\n\nDistrict adopted its 1970 desegregation plan, the racial composition of each of the\n\nDistrict’s schools “closely tracked” the racial composition of the District as a\n\nwhole. Id. at 1355.\n\n       Nevertheless, the district court explained: “After the Desegregation Plan was\n\nimplemented, the number of white students enrolled in the District declined\n\nsubstantially over a period of several years. Meanwhile, black enrollment\n\nremained fairly stable.” Id. at 1356 (citations omitted). The court supplied data for\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\fthe eight-year period from 1970-1978 illustrating this change in the racial\n\ncomposition of the District’s student body:\n\n  School Year          White            Black            Total           % Black\n 1970-1971        2274             2438             4712             51.74%\n 1971-1972        2018             2554             4572             55.86%\n 1972-1973        1888             2598             4486             57.91%\n 1973-1974        1614             2604             4218             61.74%\n 1974-1975        1492             2595             4087             63.49%\n 1975-1976        1468             2499             3967             62.99%\n 1976-1977        1459             2487             3946             63.03%\n 1977-1978        1311             2520             3831             65.78%\n\n      Then, the district court explained: “In addition to changes in school\n\nenrollment, the City of Thomasville also experienced population shifts after the\n\nimplementation of the Desegregation Plan. In 1970, the black population in the\n\nCity was concentrated primarily in the City’s southwestern sector. Since that time,\n\nthe distribution of the black population throughout Thomasville has changed.” Id.\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n      As an example, the court explained that “in 1970, Harper Elementary School\n\nwas surrounded by some predominantly white communities. As the neighborhoods\n\naround Harper became increasingly black, so did Harper’s student population.\n\nBecause of the changes in the black population of the District and the City of\n\n                                          40\n\fThomasville, demographics overtook the Desegregation Plan and Harper’s\n\nenrollment became increasingly black.” Id. (citations omitted). Indeed, “Harper’s\n\nvariance from the district-wide percentage of black students went from\n\napproximately 6% in 1970 to almost 20% in 1975, while the other elementary\n\nschools’ black enrollment during that period varied no more than 11% from the\n\ndistrict-wide black enrollment for the elementary grades.” Id. In addition, the\n\ndistrict court noted, “[b]y 1980 the area around Harper had become almost entirely\n\nblack and by 1990 there were few, if any, white students left in the area.” Id. at\n\n1356 n.19.\n\n      Based on this analysis, the district court concluded that demographic\n\nchanges, not prior de jure segregation or present intentional discrimination, were\n\nresponsible for the racial imbalances in the District’s elementary school\n\npopulations:\n\n      Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the Court finds that the\n      racial composition of the District’s elementary schools is currently\n      “imbalanced” because of changes in the racial makeup of the City of\n      Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment\n      of the District’s schools caused by declining white enrollment as\n      compared to black enrollment. The Court finds that the current racial\n      imbalances of the District’s elementary schools are not due to any\n      intentional discrimination on the part of the District and are not\n      vestiges of the District’s previous de jure racially segregated system.\n\nId. at 1358.\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f      Although the district court did not explicitly say that demographic changes\n\nwere the “substantial” cause of the racial imbalances, it clearly found that the\n\nimbalances existed “because of” such changes, and that they were “not due to” any\n\ncurrent intentional discrimination or past de jure segregation. The court’s findings\n\ntherefore unmistakably indicate that it found demographic shifts to be the\n\nsubstantial cause of the racial imbalances in Thomasville schools.\n\n      Insofar as the Plaintiffs are saying that the district court did not find\n\ndemographics to be the sole cause of these imbalances, this simply is not the\n\nburden that the District bears. As we observed earlier, “a plaintiff does not\n\nundermine the strength of a defendant’s demographic evidence by merely asserting\n\nthat demographics alone do not explain the racial imbalances. Rather, for a\n\nplaintiff to preserve the presumption of de jure segregation, the plaintiff must show\n\nthat the demographic shifts are the result of the prior de jure segregation or some\n\nother discriminatory conduct.” Manning, 244 F.3d at 944-45 (footnote omitted).\n\nThe Plaintiffs in this case have made no such showing, and thus the district court\n\ncommitted no error in concluding that the District had carried its burden by\n\ndemonstrating that demographic changes, not past segregation or present\n\nintentional discrimination, were responsible for the racial imbalances in the student\n\nbodies of District schools.\n\n\n\n                                           42\n\f                                               3.\n\n         The Plaintiffs’ third argument on appeal is that in analyzing the\n\nconstitutionality of the District’s “ability-grouping” or “tracking” practices, the\n\ndistrict court failed to apply this Circuit’s precedent, which permits tracking only\n\nwhen it “is not based on the present results of past segregation or will remedy such\n\nresults through better educational opportunities.” Ga. State Conference of\n\nBranches of NAACP v. Georgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1414 (11th Cir. 1985) (“Ga.\n\nNAACP”). On this point, we agree with the Plaintiffs that the district court failed\n\nto apply the Circuit’s well-settled standard, and that this constitutes reversible\n\nerror.\n\n         Although ability-grouping practices may have the effect of creating racial\n\nimbalances within classrooms, we have “consistently stated that ability grouping is\n\nnot per se unconstitutional.” Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 994 (5th Cir.\n\nJune 23, 1981).10 As the Plaintiffs have observed, such practices are permissible in\n\nspite of any segregative effect they may have if the assignment method “is not\n\nbased on the present results of past segregation or will remedy such results through\n\nbetter educational opportunities.” McNeal v. Tate County Sch. Dist., 508 F.2d\n\n\n\n         10\n         The Eleventh Circuit has adopted as precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit\nrendered prior to October 1, 1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.\n1981) (en banc).\n\n                                               43\n\f1017, 1020 (5th Cir. 1975); see also, e.g., Ga. NAACP, 775 F.2d at 1414; Quarles\n\nv. Oxford Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 868 F.2d 750, 753-54 (5th Cir. 1989).\n\n      In this case, the district court found that the District’s use of ability-grouping\n\ncreated racial imbalances within many of the district’s individual classes.\n\nSpecifically, the court found overrepresentation of black students in less\n\nacademically advanced classes and overrepresentation of white students in more\n\nacademically advanced classes. These imbalances, the court concluded, were “a\n\nresult of the District’s educational policy of ‘ability grouping’ or ‘tracking.’”\n\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1358.\n\n      However, the district court did not ask whether the District’s ability-\n\ngrouping practices satisfied our long-established requirement that the tracking\n\npolicy either not be based on present results of past discrimination or be designed\n\nto remedy such results. Instead of determining whether the District’s ability-\n\ngrouping policy was based on present results of past segregation or whether it\n\nwould remedy such results, the district court focused on whether the tracking\n\npractice was intentionally discriminatory. The court acknowledged that “the\n\nDistrict’s tracking system has had the effect of creating racially imbalanced classes\n\nwithin the District’s schools,” but determined that “it was not the intention of the\n\ntracking system to segregate students based upon race” and that “the District does\n\n\n\n                                           44\n\fnot manipulate the ability tracking system in order to track students based upon\n\ntheir race.” Id. at 1359. To pass any further judgment on the District’s tracking\n\npolicy, the court determined, was “beyond the realm of expertise of the judicial\n\nbranch,” and best left to educators. Id. at 1358 n.22.\n\n      However, whether a school district’s ability-grouping practices are based on\n\npresent results of past discrimination, and whether they will remedy such results,\n\nare well-settled subjects of judicial inquiry, since they go to the constitutionality --\n\nnot the soundness as a policy matter -- of these practices. See, e.g., McNeal, 508\n\nF.2d at 1020; Ga. NAACP, 775 F.2d at 1414; Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 996-97 (“The\n\nmerits of a program which places students in classrooms with others perceived to\n\nhave similar abilities are hotly debated by educators; nevertheless, it is educators,\n\nrather than courts, who are in a better position ultimately to resolve the question\n\nwhether such a practice is, on the whole, more beneficial than detrimental to the\n\nstudents involved. Thus, as a general rule, school systems are free to employ\n\nability grouping, even when such a policy has a segregative effect, so long, of\n\ncourse, as such a practice is genuinely motivated by educational concerns and not\n\ndiscriminatory motives.” (emphasis added)).\n\n      The district court’s failure to conduct the proper inquiry requires us to\n\nremand this issue for the district court to reconsider the constitutionality of the\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\fDistrict’s ability-grouping practices, applying the legal framework established by\n\nour Circuit’s precedents in McNeal and Georgia NAACP. Because “[p]roper\n\nresolution of any desegregation case turns on a careful assessment of its facts,”\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 474, we will not decide for ourselves whether the District’s\n\nuse of tracking passes muster under this standard, but rather afford the trier of fact\n\nthe first opportunity to do so.\n\n                                           4.\n\n      The Plaintiffs’ fourth claim on appeal is that the district court failed to\n\narticulate any standard for determining whether the District engaged in present\n\nintentional discrimination, and that the court should have asked whether race was a\n\nsubstantial motivating factor in the District’s actions. Appellants’ Br. at 35 (citing\n\nVill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66, 97 S.\n\nCt. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977)). We agree with the Plaintiffs that the district\n\ncourt could have been clearer in explicating the standard it applied, but the court’s\n\nthorough and thoughtful opinion leaves us convinced that it understood and\n\ncorrectly applied the law.\n\n      The Plaintiffs in this case argued to the district court primarily that racial\n\nimbalances in various facets of the District’s school system were traceable to the\n\nDistrict’s prior de jure segregation, and therefore violated the Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth\n\n\n\n                                           46\n\fAmendment equal protection rights. However, in the alternative, the Plaintiffs\n\nclaimed that the District presently practices intentional discrimination, unrelated to\n\nits history of de jure segregation, in violation of the equal protection principles.\n\nAcknowledging both of these lines of argument, the district court explained:\n\n      To establish such a constitutional violation, the evidence must be\n      sufficient to support a finding that Defendant has engaged in\n      intentional discrimination based upon race. See, e.g., Washington v.\n      Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 238-42 (1976); Keyes, 413 U.S. at 205. . . .\n      Therefore, the Court’s first inquiry is whether Defendant operates an\n      intentionally segregated school system based upon race or has\n      otherwise engaged in purposeful racial discrimination. When a school\n      district has previously operated a de jure segregated system, a district\n      court must first determine whether any vestiges of the previous de jure\n      system still exist before turning to whether the school district\n      presently engages in racial discrimination unrelated to the previous de\n      jure segregated system.\n\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1365-66.\n\n      The district court went on to observe that if, after applying the Keyes\n\npresumption, it found that racial imbalances in the District were not traceable to\n\nprior segregation, “then the Court must determine whether they are the result of\n\ncurrent, intentional racial discrimination.” Id. at 1366. And even for areas in which\n\nthe district court found no racial imbalances, “the Court must ascertain whether the\n\nDistrict presently engages in purposeful racial discrimination in violation of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment and Title VI.” Id.\n\n      The district court’s explanation of the law echoes the essence of the Supreme\n\n                                           47\n\fCourt’s holding in Arlington Heights -- the case the Plaintiffs argue the district\n\ncourt failed to apply -- which is that “[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or\n\npurpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.” Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 265. Indeed, it is well established that proving intent to\n\ndiscriminate is the essential element of an equal protection claim. See, e.g.,\n\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976);\n\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 359-60, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395\n\n(1991) (“A court addressing [an equal protection claim] must keep in mind the\n\nfundamental principle that ‘official action will not be held unconstitutional solely\n\nbecause it results in a racially disproportionate impact. . . . Proof of racially\n\ndiscriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.’” (omission in original) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n\n264-265)); Johnson v. Bush, 2005 WL 832217 (11th Cir. April 12, 2005); Citizens\n\nConcerned About Our Children v. School Bd.,193 F.3d 1285, 1294 (11th Cir.\n\n1999); Ellston v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1406 (11th Cir.\n\n1993); Mencer v. Hammonds, 134 F.3d 1066, 1070 (1998); Parks v. City of\n\nWarner Robins, 43 F.3d 609, 616 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n      In order to establish a present intent to discriminate, the burden rests with\n\nthe Plaintiffs to demonstrate that the District acted with discriminatory purpose.\n\n\n\n                                            48\n\fSee, e.g., Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 723 (2004); Ellston, 997 F.2d at\n\n1406. The Supreme Court has explained that “‘[d]iscriminatory purpose’ . . .\n\nimplies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It\n\nimplies that the decisionmaker . . . selected . . . a particular course of action at least\n\nin part ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable\n\ngroup.” Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 360 (quoting Pers. Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S.\n\n256, 279, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870 (1979)) (omissions in original); accord,\n\ne.g., In re Employment Discrimination Litigation Against State of Ala., 198 F.3d\n\n1305, 1321 (11th Cir. 1999). “Determining whether invidious discriminatory\n\npurpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such\n\ncircumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” Arlington\n\nHeights, 429 U.S. at 266.\n\n       The district court conducted precisely this sort of sensitive inquiry, focusing\n\non whether the evidence established that the District, in any area of its operations,\n\nacted “because of” race. Thus, for example, as to the racial composition of the\n\nDistrict’s elementary schools, the court found that imbalances existed “because of\n\nchanges in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns,\n\nand changes in the enrollment of the District’s schools caused by declining white\n\nenrollment as compared to black enrollment,” and, notably, that the imbalances\n\n\n\n                                            49\n\fwere “not due to any intentional discrimination on the part of the District.”\n\nThomas County NAACP, 299 F. Supp. 2d at 1358. Similarly, the district court\n\nplainly found that “any racial imbalances that presently exist regarding the\n\nDistrict’s faculty are not traceable . . . to current racial discrimination,” since “the\n\nDistrict’s faculty assignment system from 1983 to the present has not been\n\nadministered in a racially discriminatory manner and that the system is presently\n\nadministered without regard to race.” Id. at 1360-61.\n\n       Nor, the district court found, was race a motivating factor in any other area\n\nof the District’s operations. Thus, as to the District’s program for high-performing\n\nstudents, the district court concluded “that no student has ever been denied an\n\nopportunity to participate in the Gifted Program because of race.” Id. at 1362.\n\nLikewise, regarding special education, the district court determined “that race has\n\nnot been a factor in any decision made by the District regarding placement of\n\nchildren in the Special Education Program.” Id. at 1363. As to disciplinary\n\nactions, the court found “that race has not been a factor in any decision made by\n\nthe District with respect to discipline.” Id. at 1364. Regarding the quality of the\n\nDistrict’s facilities, the court determined that “[r]ace plays no factor in the receipt\n\nof use of [facilities] funding.” Id. at 1365. As for extracurricular activities, the\n\ncourt found that “[a]ll District extracurricular activities are available to all of the\n\n\n\n                                            50\n\fDistrict’s students without regard to race,” and thus that any imbalances in\n\nparticipation were not “the result of presently practiced racial discrimination.” Id.\n\n      Based on these findings, the district court concluded that the District had not\n\nviolated the Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights since it had\n\nnot acted with any discriminatory purpose or intent. Id. at 1367.\n\n      We have explained previously that “[b]ecause the issue is a factual one, this\n\nCourt can reverse a district court’s finding of intentional discrimination only if the\n\nfinding is clearly erroneous, is based on clearly erroneous subsidiary findings of\n\nfact, or is based on an erroneous view of the law.” Barber v. Int’l Bhd. of\n\nBoilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers, 778 F.2d 750,\n\n754 (11th Cir. 1985) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Pullman-Standard v. Swint,\n\n456 U.S. 273, 287-90, 102 S. Ct. 1781, 72 L. Ed. 2d 66 (1982) (holding that the\n\nissue of discriminatory intent in a race discrimination case is a factual question for\n\nthe trier of fact, whose findings are reviewed only for clear error); Rogers v.\n\nLodge, 458 U.S. 613, 622-23, 102 S. Ct. 3272, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (1982). Here,\n\nthe district court’s thorough and reasoned analysis illustrates that it held no\n\nerroneous view of the law of intentional discrimination. Accordingly, the only\n\npossible ground for reversal is that the factual findings themselves are clearly\n\nerroneous, an issue we take up below.\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\f                                           5.\n\n      Finally, the Plaintiffs claim that a number of the district court’s findings of\n\nfact were clearly erroneous. They argue that the evidence presented at trial\n\ndemonstrates that the District has not taken all practicable steps to dismantle its\n\nprior de jure segregated school system, and that the District has intentionally\n\ndiscriminated against black students.\n\n      Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) dictates that we may review a district\n\ncourt’s factual findings only for clear error:\n\n      In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory\n      jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its\n      conclusions of law thereon . . . . Findings of fact, whether based on\n      oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly\n      erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial\n      court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Clear error is a highly deferential standard of review. See,\n\ne.g., Manning, 244 F.3d at 940. As the Supreme Court has explained, a “finding is\n\n‘clearly erroneous’ when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing\n\ncourt on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a\n\nmistake has been committed.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564,\n\n573, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985) (quoting United States v. United\n\nStates Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S. Ct. 525, 542, 92 L. Ed. 746 (1948)).\n\n      “This standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the\n\n                                           52\n\ffinding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have\n\ndecided the case differently. The reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty\n\nunder Rule 52(a) if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the trial court. ‘In\n\napplying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting\n\nwithout a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is\n\nnot to decide factual issues de novo.’ Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research,\n\nInc., 395 U.S. 100, 123, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 1576, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969). If the\n\ndistrict court’s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in\n\nits entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had\n\nit been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\n\nIn short, where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s\n\nchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” Id. at 573-74.\n\n      The Plaintiffs first challenge the district court’s finding that the District has\n\ntaken all practicable steps to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation. They\n\nsay that the district court’s finding that demographics were the substantial cause of\n\nracial imbalances among the District’s elementary schools was clearly erroneous\n\nfor two principal reasons: first, because the evidence presented at trial did not show\n\nsufficiently significant demographic changes to account for the racial disparities in\n\nenrollment; and second, because the District could have counteracted these shifts\n\n\n\n                                           53\n\fby implementing attendance zones. Here, the Plaintiffs have done nothing more\n\nthan present an alternative (and permissible) view of the evidence, and therefore\n\nwe cannot conclude that any of the district court’s findings were clearly erroneous.\n\n      Our detailed review of the record leaves us with no doubt that the district\n\ncourt had a sound evidentiary basis for concluding that changes in Thomasville’s\n\ndemography and school enrollment substantially caused the racial imbalances\n\namong the student populations of the District’s elementary schools. As we\n\nexplained in more detail above, the district court based its findings on a thorough\n\nevaluation of Thomasville’s school-enrollment data from 1965 (the last year the\n\nDistrict was de jure segregated) to the time of trial. The district court observed that\n\nthe District’s first desegregation plan was ineffective, but that its second plan,\n\nadopted in 1970, in fact effectively desegregated the schools for at least six\n\nconsecutive years and, indeed, received HEW approval.\n\n      Racial imbalances that developed subsequently, the district found, resulted\n\nnot from the District’s prior de jure segregation, but from a confluence of external\n\nfactors, including a substantial decline in white enrollment in the District and\n\npopulation shifts within the District (in particular, a concentration of Thomasville’s\n\nblack population around Harper Elementary School, an area that was formerly\n\npredominantly white). As the racial imbalances at Harper grew, the district court\n\n\n\n                                           54\n\fnoted, HEW was alerted to the situation. After a series of exchanges with the\n\nDistrict, HEW concluded that in spite of the imbalances, the District was “in\n\ncompliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relative to assignment of\n\nstudents . . . to schools,” and that “no further student desegregation is required of\n\n[the District] at this time.”\n\n       Because these findings of the district court are soundly rooted in the record,\n\nwe are left with no “definite and firm conviction” that they are erroneous. The\n\nSupreme Court has observed that “[a]s the de jure violation becomes more remote\n\nin time and these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a\n\ncurrent racial imbalance in a school district is a vestige of the prior de jure system.”\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. 496. In light of the entire record in this case, we find the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion that changes in enrollment and demographics -- not prior\n\nde jure segregation -- account for the racial imbalances present more than three\n\ndecades after Thomasville dismantled its de jure segregated school system to be\n\nmore than plausible. Accordingly, this finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\n       Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs proceed to argue that the district court’s\n\nconclusion that the District took all practicable steps to eliminate the vestiges of de\n\njure segregation was clearly erroneous because the District refused to implement\n\nattendance zones to counteract the racial disparities that arose under its freedom-\n\n\n\n                                           55\n\fof-choice system. The Plaintiffs’ suggestion, however, clearly contradicts the\n\nSupreme Court’s repeated admonition that courts may not intervene to maintain\n\nracial parity in schools once the initial constitutional violation has been remedied.\n\n      The district court, in this case, found that the District remedied the\n\nconstitutional violation caused by it its de jure segregated school system through\n\nthe adoption of its 1970 desegregation plan, which, undeniably, successfully\n\ndesegregated the District’s school for a number of years. Subsequent demographic\n\nand enrollment changes, however, intervened, undoing much of the racial balance\n\nachieved by the 1970 desegregation plan. While the District is, of course, free to\n\nadopt attendance zones or other constitutional measures that might counteract these\n\neffects, it is simply beyond the authority of any court to force such a policy\n\nmeasure on the District. As the Supreme Court has explained repeatedly:\n\n      Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake. It is to be\n      pursued when racial imbalance has been caused by a constitutional\n      violation. Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has\n      been remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy\n      imbalance that is caused by demographic factors. . . .\n             ....\n             The effect of changing residential patterns on the racial\n      composition of schools, though not always fortunate, is somewhat\n      predictable. Studies show a high correlation between residential\n      segregation and school segregation. . . .\n\n             Where resegregation is a product not of state action but of\n      private choices, it does not have constitutional implications. It is\n      beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the federal\n\n                                          56\n\f      courts to try to counteract these kinds of continuous and massive\n      demographic shifts. To attempt such results would require ongoing\n      and never-ending supervision by the courts of school districts simply\n      because they were once de jure segregated. Residential housing\n      choices, and their attendant effects on the racial composition of\n      schools, present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult to address\n      through judicial remedies.\n\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 494-95; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 24 (“The constitutional\n\ncommand to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every\n\ncommunity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a\n\nwhole.”).\n\n      Accordingly, the Supreme Court has concluded that a district court will\n\nexceed its authority when it intervenes to rearrange a school district’s attendance\n\nzones in order to achieve greater racial balance. In Pasadena Board of Education v.\n\nSpangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 49 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1976), the Court held\n\nthat a district court exceeded its remedial authority in requiring annual\n\nreadjustment of school attendance zones when changes in racial composition of\n\nschools were caused by demographic shifts “not attributed to any segregative acts\n\non the part of the [school district].” Id. at 436. The Court explained that “the\n\nDistrict Court was not entitled to require the [school district] to rearrange its\n\nattendance zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court\n\nwas maintained in perpetuity. For having once implemented a racially neutral\n\n\n\n                                           57\n\fattendance pattern in order to remedy the perceived constitutional violations on the\n\npart of the defendants, the District Court had fully performed its function of\n\nproviding the appropriate remedy for previous racially discriminatory attendance\n\npatterns.” Id. at 436-37; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32 (“Neither school\n\nauthorities nor district courts are constitutionally required to make year-by-year\n\nadjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once the affirmative duty\n\nto desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official\n\naction is eliminated from the system.”).\n\n         Because the district court would exceed its authority by requiring the City of\n\nThomasville School District to adopt attendance zones in order to counteract racial\n\nimbalances caused by demographic forces rather than by prior de jure segregation,\n\nwe cannot find the district court’s conclusion that the District took all practicable\n\nsteps to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation to be clearly erroneous on this\n\nbasis.\n\n         The Plaintiffs also challenge the district court’s finding that the District does\n\nnot now intentionally discriminate against black students. First, the Plaintiffs point\n\nto several pieces of evidence presented at trial that the district court did not discuss\n\nin its opinion, arguing that the court’s failure to acknowledge these pieces of\n\nevidence demonstrates that its factual findings regarding intent to discriminate are\n\n\n\n                                             58\n\fclearly erroneous. Specifically, the Plaintiffs cite the fact that a District task force\n\ndeclined to replace the District’s freedom-of-choice system of student assignment\n\nwith attendance zones, at least in part because some members were concerned that\n\nsuch a change would prompt white students to leave the District and enroll in\n\nprivate schools, as well as the fact that one school administrator testified that she\n\nhad reassigned white students based upon their parents “saying they didn’t want\n\ntheir children in the mostly black classes.”\n\n      While these two pieces of evidence are undoubtedly relevant, we cannot\n\nconclude that the district court’s failure to mention them explicitly in its opinion\n\nsomehow renders all of its detailed findings concerning intent to discriminate\n\nclearly erroneous. For one thing, the evidence presented by both parties at trial\n\nwas extensive and the record in this case is voluminous. The district court was not\n\nobliged to recite and analyze individually each and every piece of evidence\n\npresented by the parties. The plaintiffs do not point to any specific factual finding\n\nthat these particular pieces of evidence render clearly erroneous, but rather suggest\n\nthat they invalidate the entirety of the district court’s intentional discrimination\n\nanalysis. This is simply not the case. As we have already described at some\n\nlength, the district court carefully evaluated all pertinent areas of the District’s\n\noperations, and concluded based on the entirety of the record that the District’s\n\n\n\n                                            59\n\fpolicies and programs are administered in a race-neutral manner, free of any intent\n\nto discriminate.\n\n      The law is well settled that “[i]f the district court’s account of the evidence is\n\nplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not\n\nreverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it\n\nwould have weighed the evidence differently.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574\n\n(emphasis added). We may reverse the district court only when “on the entire\n\nevidence” we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\ncommitted.” Id. at 573. After reviewing the lengthy record in its entirety, we are\n\nleft with no such conviction. The pieces of evidence that the Plaintiffs highlight\n\nare no doubt significant, but “[w]e cannot overturn the district court’s finding of\n\nfact simply because this evidence was merely conflicting.” Ga. NAACP, 775 F.2d\n\n1419. Simply put, ample evidence supports the district court’s reasoned findings,\n\nand we therefore see no clear error.\n\n      Next, the Plaintiffs argue that statistical evidence establishes that the District\n\nintentionally discriminated against black students in the administration of\n\ndiscipline, rendering the district court’s contrary conclusion clearly erroneous. The\n\nPlaintiffs claim that the district court ignored “uncontradicted statistical analysis\n\ndemonstrating that blacks were administered harsher discipline than whites for the\n\n\n\n                                           60\n\fsame conduct.” Appellants’ Br. at 44.\n\n      However, in concluding that this was not the case, the district court relied on\n\ntwo witness’ testimony to the contrary. The trial court explained that it found,\n\n“based upon the evidence presented at trial, no incident in which a black student\n\nreceived a harsher punishment than a white student for the same or similar\n\nmisconduct,” and “that the District does not treat black students differently from\n\nwhite students with respect to referrals for discipline.” Thomas County NAACP,\n\n299 F. Supp. 2d at 1364. Moreover, the district court observed, “[n]o evidence was\n\npresented at trial by Plaintiffs to refute Defendant’s evidence that no black student\n\nhas received a referral for punishment where a white student did not under the\n\nsame or similar circumstances.” Id. (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court\n\nconcluded that “race has not been a factor in any decision made by the District\n\nwith respect to discipline.” Id.\n\n      The Plaintiffs do not point to any specific error in the district court’s\n\nreasoning or otherwise explain how its account of the evidence is flawed. Again,\n\nas long as the district court’s view of the evidence is “plausible,” we have no\n\nground for reversal. Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. And our review of the record in\n\nthis case again reveals that the district court’s assessment is plausible; we,\n\ntherefore, find no error in its conclusion that the District does not intentionally\n\n\n\n                                           61\n\fdiscriminate against black students in the administration of discipline.\n\n       Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that statistical evidence demonstrates that the\n\nDistrict intentionally discriminates against black students by using ability grouping\n\nto assign students to classes, rendering the district court’s contrary conclusion\n\nclearly erroneous. We express no opinion as to which way the evidence points on\n\nthis issue. Based on our earlier conclusion that the district court failed to apply the\n\nproper legal standard in assessing the constitutionality of the District’s use of\n\nability grouping, we remand for the district court to make new findings of fact on\n\nthis issue.\n\n       We have explained numerous times that “only in circumstances when ‘a\n\ndistrict court applies an incorrect legal standard which taints or infects its findings\n\nof facts, [do] such findings lose the insulation of Rule 52(a) and judgment based\n\nthereon cannot stand.’” Jacksonville NAACP, 273 F.3d at 965 (quoting Manning,\n\n244 F.3d at 940-41). On the issue of ability grouping, “the district judge’s repeated\n\nuse of the wrong legal standard sufficiently tainted or infected the findings of fact\n\nso as to strip those findings of the insulation normally accorded under Rule 52(a).”\n\nManning, 244 F.3d at 943. We therefore remand for the district court to make new\n\nfindings of fact, applying the correct legal standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                           62\n\f                                           III.\n\n      Finally, the District has cross-appealed the trial court’s determination that\n\neach party should bear its own costs, asking us to reverse and remand for the\n\ndistrict court to award costs or explain its decision not to do so.\n\n      Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “costs other\n\nthan attorneys’ fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the\n\ncourt otherwise directs.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). In this case, the district court, on\n\nFebruary 6, 2004, entered judgment in favor of the District, but “directed that each\n\nside shall bear its own costs.” The court gave no explanation for denying costs to\n\nthe District, as the prevailing party.\n\n      We have previously held that “where the trial court denies the prevailing\n\nparty its costs, the court must give a reason for its denial of costs so that the\n\nappellate court may have some basis upon which to determine if the trial court\n\nacted within its discretionary power.” Head v. Medford, 62 F.3d 351, 354 (11th\n\nCir. 1995) (emphasis in original) (quoting Gilchrist v. Bolger, 733 F.2d 1551, 1557\n\n(11th Cir. 1984) (citation omitted)). “Thus, although the district court has\n\ndiscretion to deny a prevailing party costs, such discretion is not unfettered.” Id.;\n\naccord Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping & Const. Co.,254 F.3d 987,\n\n1012 (11th Cir. 2001); Gilchrist, 733 F.2d at 1557. Rule 54(d) establishes “a\n\n\n\n                                            63\n\fpresumption that costs are to be awarded to a prevailing party,” and that “[t]o\n\ndefeat the presumption and deny full costs, a district court must have and state a\n\nsound basis for doing so.” Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012, 1038-39 (11th\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n      The Plaintiffs suggest that the district court’s “reasons for denying costs are\n\nimplicit.” Appellants’ Br. at 29. They argue that the district court “implicitly\n\nacknowledged plaintiffs’ good faith and socially important argument throughout\n\nthe opinion.” Id. However, the law of our Circuit establishes unambiguously that\n\nthe district court must explicitly state its reasons for denying costs. Thus, although\n\nthe district court may have acted well within its discretion in assigning each party\n\nits own costs, its failure to state a reason for doing so constitutes reversible error.\n\nWe therefore vacate the district court’s assignment of costs with the instruction that\n\nif the District prevails on the ability-grouping issue we have remanded for\n\nreconsideration, the district court must award costs to the District or explain its\n\ndecision to deny them.\n\n                                           IV.\n\n      After careful review of the record and the district court’s opinion in this\n\ncase, we are convinced that the district court committed no error in declining to\n\nmake a “unitary status” finding, in applying the so-called Keyes presumption, or in\n\n\n\n                                            64\n\fapplying the law of intentional discrimination. We, therefore, affirm the district\n\ncourt’s findings of fact and conclusions of law on all of these issues. However, as\n\nto the district court’s treatment of the Plaintiffs’ challenge to the District’s ability-\n\ngrouping practices, we conclude that the court failed to apply the correct legal\n\nstandard and that this error tainted its factual findings on this issue. We, therefore,\n\nreverse and remand for reconsideration of the Plaintiffs’ ability-grouping claim.\n\nWe can discern no clear error in the district court’s remaining findings of fact, and\n\ntherefore affirm in this respect, too. Finally, because the district court offered no\n\nexplanation for declining to award costs to the District as the prevailing party, we\n\nvacate the assignment of costs and remand for reconsideration.\n\n       AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART,\n\nAND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\f",

The Plaintiffs &#8212; Shernika Holton and ten other representative parents of black children attending elementary, middle, and high schools operated by the District, and the Thomas County Branch of the NAACP &#8212; allege that the District has failed to do so, and request that judicial supervision of the District's desegregation efforts be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a lengthy bench trial, the district court found that racial imbalances existed in several areas of the District's operations, but that these imbalances were neither traceable to prior <i>de jure</i> segregation nor the result of present intentional discrimination. Accordingly, the district court concluded that the District had satisfied its constitutional obligation to desegregate. For the most part, we can discern no error in the district court's findings of fact or its application of the law. However, as to the Plaintiffs' claim that the District's use of \"ability grouping\" to determine classroom assignments discriminates on the basis of race, we conclude that the district court failed to apply the legal standard long accepted in this Circuit, and that this legal error tainted its findings of fact. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for reconsideration of the ability-grouping issue in light of the correct legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, this case differs from the other school desegregation cases that have come before us in recent years, in that the City of Thomasville School District has never operated under any court-imposed desegregation order or other court supervision. Indeed, this lawsuit is the first desegregation suit ever brought against the District. Because no court has ever imposed a desegregation order on the District, we face whether it is appropriate to do so for the first time now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the Plaintiffs raise two broad causes of action. First, they claim that the District \"has perpetuated, failed to disestablish and maintained purposefully racially segregated and unequal public schools ... and, thus, has acted contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.\" Second, they allege that the District \"has perpetuated and failed to disestablish racially segregated public schools ..., has acted with the purpose and effect of subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination in a federally funded program and, thus, has acted contrary to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d, and implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 100.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction requiring the District to (a) disestablish its racially segregated school system; (b) adopt and implement a plan effectively to desegregate its buildings and classrooms; (c) provide equal educational facilities, resources, materials, and instruction to all students, and to provide compensatory instruction to students previously denied that opportunity; (d) cease all discriminatory imposition of discipline; and (e) desegregate all student activities, and cease discrimination against black students in this area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court certified a class of \"all present and future parents or guardians of African American children enrolled or eligible to be enrolled within the Thomasville City School District.\" <i>Thomas County Branch of NAACP v. City of Thomasville Sch. Dist.,</i> 187 F.R.D. 690, 700 (M.D.Ga.1999). It later denied Defendant's motions for summary judgment and to reconsider class certification. <i>Thomas County Branch of NAACP v. City of Thomasville Sch. Dist.,</i> No. 6:98-CV-63, 2003 WL 169758, at *3 (M.D.Ga. Jan.21, 2003) (unpublished). In the same order, the district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, finding that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, any present racial imbalances in the District are presumptively the result of the District's previous <i>de jure</i> segregation. <i>Id.</i> at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the district court tried the case without a jury from July 21 to August 6, 2003. Based on the evidence presented, the trial judge made a series of detailed factual findings. We repeat just the basics here, as these findings are laid out with great clarity and detail in the district court's order, dated February 5, 2004. <i>See Thomas County NAACP.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as background, the district court outlined the history of the District's desegregation efforts, including numerous reorganizations of the District's schools. At the time the Supreme Court issued its seminal opinion in <i>Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), declaring that racial segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the District was operating a <i>de jure</i> segregated school system. Until 1965, the District's schools remained segregated, with two elementary schools (grades 1-6) serving black students and four serving white students, as well one high school (grades 7-12) for black students and another for white students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the District adopted its first desegregation plan, which became effective at the start of the 1965-66 school year. The plan was based upon freedom of choice, permitting parents to elect which school their children would attend. This method failed to accomplish any desegregation, and the District's historically black schools remained all black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A series of exchanges between the District and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\") ensued, culminating in the District's adoption of a new desegregation plan in 1970. This plan created a single high school for all students in grades 9-12, regardless of race; a single middle school for all students in grades 7-8, regardless of race; a single school for all students in grade 6, regardless of race; a single school for all students in grade 5, regardless of race; and four elementary schools among which all students in grades 1-4 could select based on freedom of choice. The plan further provided that \"[i]f the `freedom of choice' plan does not eliminate the racial identifiability of each of the four elementary schools, alternate steps will be taken to give this assurance.\" HEW found that the plan would accomplish the purposes of Title VI and accepted the plan on July 1, 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some reconfiguration of the District's schools occurred between 1970 and 1993, and by the start of the 1993-94 school year, the District was operating four elementary schools serving grades 1-5 (Douglass, Harper, Jerger, and Scott), one middle school serving grades 6-8 (McIntyre Park), and one high school for grades 9-12 (Thomasville High). At the end of the 2001-02 school year, Douglass Elementary School closed, and since then the District has maintained the remaining three elementary schools, as well as its single middle and high schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After providing this background, the district court went on to make detailed findings of fact concerning racial imbalances in various areas of the District's operations. The district court found racial imbalances to exist in these areas: the student populations of the District's elementary schools; the composition of some individual classes within the District's schools; the faculty assigned to the District's elementary schools; the staff assigned to some of the District's schools; the composition of the student population participating in the District's gifted and special education programs; and possibly the number of students subjected to disciplinary actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the first area &#8212; student populations of the District's elementary schools &#8212; the district court found that two schools were \"racially identifiable,\" meaning that the percentage of black students enrolled varied more than twenty percent from the district-wide percentage of black students in the grades served by the school. Harper, the district court found, was an identifiably black school, whereas Jerger was an identifiably white school. In the school year 2002-03, for example, the district-wide percentage of black students was 73.6, while Harper's student body was 98.5% black and Jerger's was 39.8% black. Scott, the single non-racially identifiable elementary school, had a student population that was 90% black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, however, that these racial imbalances were not traceable in any proximate way to the District's former <i>de jure</i> segregated school system. Notably, from 1970 (when the District adopted its second desegregation plan) until 1976, the black student population of at least three of the four elementary schools the District then operated \"closely tracked the percentage of black students in the District as a whole.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1355.

Following the implementation of the 1970 desegregation plan, the district court observed, white enrollment in the District's schools declined substantially, while black enrollment remained fairly stable. From the 1970-71 school year to the 1977-78 school year, black students went from constituting 51.74% to 65.78% of the District's enrollees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the City of Thomasville experienced population shifts during that period. In 1970, the City's black population was concentrated primarily in the City's southwestern sector, and since that time, the distribution of Thomasville's black population has changed. For example, Harper Elementary School was \"surrounded by some predominantly white communities\" in 1970, but by 1980, that area had become almost entirely black, and by 1990, \"there were few, if any, white students left in the area.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1356 n. 19. As the neighborhoods around Harper became increasingly black, so did Harper's student population. The district court explained that \"demographics overtook the Desegregation Plan,\" so that Harper's variance from the district-wide enrollment of black students went from 6% in 1970 to almost 20% in 1975. <i>Id.</i> at 1356. Meanwhile, the District's other elementary schools varied by no more than 11% in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disparity at Harper came to the attention of HEW, and on May 13, 1975, it sent a letter to the District's Superintendent advising that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had ordered it in <i>Adams v. Weinberger,</i> 391 F.Supp. 269 (D.D.C.1975), to put school districts on notice \"to rebut or explain the substantial racial disproportion in one or more of the district's schools.\" HEW stated that \"The court defined a racially disproportionate school as one in which a `20 percent disproportion exists between the percentage of local minority pupils in the schools and the percentage in the entire school district.'\" Several exchanges between the District and HEW followed, and the District explained its student assignment procedures to HEW in these terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assignments are based upon freedom of choice, modified only to the extent hereinafter stated. Freedom of choice forms are issued to all pupils each year. If a school reaches its capacity, priority is given to the child nearest the school. If a parent or student fails to return the form, the student is assigned by school officials to the school nearest the student's home which has not been filled to capacity. In order to maximize a biracial complexion in the Harper School, freedom of choice is modified in two respects: (a) Whites residing in the Harper area have been required to attend Harper notwithstanding their selection of another school under freedom of choice[;] (b) Priority has been given to whites desiring to attend Harper as against blacks residing closer to that school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving this explanation and other information, HEW \"determined that no further student desegregation is required of [the District] at this time.\" On November 17, 1975, HEW found the District \"in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relative to assignment of students ... to schools.\" However, HEW also noted that the situation at Harper warranted monitoring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1977, racial imbalances in the District's elementary schools began gradually to increase. No formal plan was adopted by the District to address these imbalances, but in 1994, the District created a task force to consider the issue. The task force made consensus recommendations regarding a new process for assigning students to elementary schools. The District implemented these recommendations, with a few modifications, in 1995. The new assignment process is based primarily on parent preferences. If space does not permit accommodation of all preferences, a priority system based on special education considerations, sibling placement, and residency, determines the assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this history and data, the district court concluded that two elementary schools &#8212; Harper and Jerger &#8212; \"are clearly racially identifiable schools.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1358.

Due to their impoverished environment, they do not receive the background and support that is often so critical for being ready to learn. Tragically, it appears that for many of these children, the \"die is cast\" as early as kindergarten. These children do not appear to be reevaluated (and thus potentially \"re-tracked\") during their progression through the system.

As to facilities, the court found no disparity in the facility quality or resources of the District's identifiably black schools as compared to its identifiably white school, and concluded that race played no role in the District's allocation of funds to the various schools. Regarding transportation, the district court observed that the only transportation the District offered was for special education and extracurricular activities, as well as a very limited route implemented after the closing of Douglass Elementary to transport students previously enrolled there to Harper Elementary. The court concluded that because Douglass' student body had been 100% black, only black students received transportation, and thus the District did not discriminate against black students in the provision of transportation. Regarding extracurricular activities, the court found that all of the District's extracurriculars were available to all students without regard to race, and that no racial imbalances existed within those programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the district court ruled in favor of the District, concluding that although racial imbalances existed in some aspects of the District's schools, they were neither traceable to the District's prior <i>de jure</i> segregation, nor the result of present intentional discrimination.

Second, the Plaintiffs claim that the district court misapplied the so-called \"<i>Keyes</i>\" presumption that present racial imbalances within a previously <i>de jure</i> segregated school system are a result of prior segregation, because the burden of proof it placed on the District to rebut the presumption was too low in several respects. Third, the Plaintiffs say that the district court failed to scrutinize with sufficient rigor the District's use of \"ability tracking\" to assign students to classes. Fourth, the Plaintiffs contend that the district court failed to articulate or apply any standard for intentional discrimination. Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that the district court's legal errors infected its factual findings, and that the court made several findings of fact that were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In school desegregation cases, we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's interpretation and application of the law. <i>NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v.

The Supreme Court has explained this affirmative obligation in these terms: \"The duty and responsibility of a school district once segregated by law is to take all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional <i>de jure</i> system.

First, an assessment of unitary status is generally only made when a district court is deciding \"when it is appropriate to restore local control\" (<i>i.e.,</i> to end judicial supervision) of a school system. <i>See Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 942. This much is evident from the two factors courts consider in making the unitariness determination: (1) \"whether local authorities have eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable,\" and (2) \"whether local authorities have in good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and shown a commitment to, the desegregation plan.\" <i>Id.</i> In a case such as this one &#8212; where the school district has <i>never</i> been placed under judicial supervision &#8212; the second prong of the inquiry has no application, since no desegregation plan has ever been imposed on the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more important, the Supreme Court and this Court have made clear that the <i>substance</i> of the judicial inquiry, not the terminology employed, is what matters. The usefulness of the terms \"unitary\" and \"unitary status\" has been called into question, and in fact the Supreme Court has urged the lower courts to discard these terms, explaining:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower courts have been inconsistent in their use of the term \"unitary.\" Some have used it to identify a school district that has completely remedied all vestiges of past discrimination. Under that interpretation of the word, a unitary school district is one that has met the mandate of [<i>Brown</i> and <i>Green</i>]. Other courts, however, have used \"unitary\" to describe any school district that has currently desegregated school assignments, whether or not that status is solely the result of a court-imposed desegregation plan. In other words, such a school district could be called unitary and nevertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination. That there is such confusion is evident in <i>Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v. Georgia,</i> 775 F.2d 1403 (C.A.11 1985), where the Court of Appeals drew a distinction between a \"unitary school district\" and a district that has achieved \"unitary status.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bd. of Educ. v.

We therefore declared: \"To minimize confusion, we discourage the future use of the term `unitary' to describe a system that has not eliminated vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable but is merely currently in compliance with a court-imposed desegregation plan ....\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, when the plaintiffs in <i>Lee</i> \"complain[ed] that the district court should have used the phrase `unitary status' rather than the phrase `unitary system,'\" the Court stated: \"The district court's opinion makes clear that it found that the defendants had eliminated the vestiges of their prior discrimination; thus, it is wholly irrelevant what precise language the district court used to announce its findings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1424 n. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of the Supreme Court's direction that \"[s]ubstance, not semantics, must govern\" in remedying school segregation, <i>Swann,</i> 402 U.S. at 31, 91 S.Ct. 1267, we hold that the district court committed no error by declining to make a finding of \"unitary status.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs' second argument on appeal is that the district court misapplied the so-called \"<i>Keyes</i>\" presumption that present racial imbalances within a previously <i>de jure</i> segregated school system are proximately traceable to prior segregation, by placing too low a burden of proof on the District to rebut the presumption. Specifically, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in three ways: it failed to hold the District to its obligation to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable; it failed to require the District to show that its own policies were not factors contributing to its racial imbalances; and it failed to require the District to show that demographic changes were the \"substantial\" cause of the racial imbalances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first argument, the Plaintiffs suggest that the district court erroneously failed to require the District to present evidence that it had eliminated the vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable &#8212; that is, that the District had taken \"every reasonable effort ... to eradicate segregation and its insidious residue.\" Appellants' Br. at 23 (quoting <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 973). Essentially, the Plaintiffs' argument is that the district court failed to consider the <i>substance</i> of the unitariness analysis. The Plaintiffs are correct that the essence of a school district's desegregation duty is to eliminate the vestiges of segregation \"to the extent practicable,\" and that the district court neglected to use this precise terminology in assessing whether the District had fulfilled its obligation. Nevertheless, we can find no reversible error here, since the district court's thorough opinion and detailed findings plainly illustrate that the court got the substance of the inquiry right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may impose court supervision of a school district's desegregation efforts \"only insofar as it advances the ultimate objective of alleviating the initial constitutional violation.\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 489, 112 S.Ct. 1430. Accordingly, in considering whether to place a school district under judicial supervision, the proper focus of a district court's inquiry is on whether a constitutional violation exists &#8212; that is, whether the district has failed to meet its constitutional obligation to desegregate its schools to the extent practicable. <i>See, e.g., Swann,</i> 402 U.S. at 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have instructed the district courts that, in evaluating whether a school district has \"[met] its constitutional obligation to eliminate the vestiges of <i>de jure</i> segregation to the extent practicable,\" a court must examine the six areas of the school system enumerated in <i>Green,</i> applying the \"presumption that any current racial disparities in these areas are the result of [the district's] past unlawful conduct.\" <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 966.

Since the District had previously operated a <i>de jure</i> segregated school system, the district court observed first that the proper consideration was \"whether any vestiges of the previous <i>de jure</i> system still exist.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1366. To make this determination, the district court evaluated at some length each of the <i>Green</i> factors (which, again, include student assignments, facilities, faculty and staff assignments, transportation, and extracurricular activities), as well as the District's curriculum and class assignments, gifted and special education programs, and discipline system, to determine whether racial imbalances were present in any of these areas. <i>See id.</i> at 1352 &amp; n. 14.

For each imbalanced area, the district court unambiguously found that demographic and other external factors &#8212; including \"changes in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment of the District's schools caused by declining white enrollment as compared to black enrollment\" &#8212; were the cause of the imbalance. <i>Id.</i> at 1358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon determining that the District had carried its burden in a particular area, the trial court then asked \"whether the District presently engages in purposeful racial discrimination\" in that area. <i>Id.</i> at 1366.

In concluding that racial imbalances within the Thomasville school system were traceable not to any historical segregation but rather to demographic and other external forces, the district court necessarily found that the District had eliminated the vestiges of segregation \"to the extent practicable.\" Quite simply, the district court's failure to employ the term \"to the extent practicable\" does not amount to reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Plaintiffs suggest that the District's burden of rebutting the presumption of continuing segregation required it to demonstrate that \"its policies and practices with respect to schoolsite location, school size, school renovations and additions, student-attendance zones, student assignment and transfer options, mobile classroom units, transportation of students, assignment of faculty and staff, etc., considered together . . . were not factors in causing the existing condition of segregation in these schools.\" Appellants' Br. at 28 (quoting <i>Keyes,</i> 413 U.S. at 213-14, 93 S.Ct. 2686).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs have taken this standard out of context. For one thing, it derives from <i>Keyes,</i> which, as we noted earlier, dealt with a school system that was not statutorily segregated. The standard the Plaintiffs quote lays out the burden a school district faces in rebutting the presumption that an entire unified school system is infected with intentional segregation, which arises out of a finding of intentional segregation in a single school within that system. <i>See Keyes,</i> 413 U.S. at 213-14, 93 S.Ct. 2686. The presumption is not applicable here, since Thomasville operated a school system that was concededly segregated in its entirety under Georgia law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if that presumption was applicable in this case, the Plaintiffs, we think, have omitted with an ellipsis a crucial aspect of the standard. The district's burden is to prove that its policies and practices \"<i>either were not taken in effectuation of a policy to create or maintain segregation in the core city schools, or, if unsuccessful in that effort,</i> were not factors in causing the existing condition of segregation in these schools.\" <i>Id.</i> at 214, 93 S.Ct. 2686 (emphasis added). All the former component requires the school district to prove is that its policies and practices were not intentionally discriminatory. Only if the school district is unable to do so is it required to demonstrate that its policies \"were not factors\" in creating segregated conditions. In this case, the district court concluded that the District's policies and practices were not intentionally discriminatory, and therefore the court had no occasion to consider whether these policies were \"factors\" contributing to racial imbalances in Thomasville schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, our Court and the Supreme Court have repeatedly defined the burden that a formerly <i>de jure</i> segregated school district must carry not as the <i>Keyes</i>-derived standard Plaintiffs favor, but rather the standard employed by the district court: \"The school district bears the burden of showing that any current [racial] imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to the prior violation.\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 494, 112 S.Ct. 1430; <i>accord, e.g., Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 942; <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 966.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion illustrates that this was exactly the burden to which it held the District. <i>See, e.g., Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1352 (\"The Court . . . finds that any racial imbalances that presently exist within the District are not traceable in a proximate way to the <i>de jure</i> racially segregated system that existed at the time <i>Brown I</i> was decided almost fifty years ago.

The Plaintiffs concede that a school district may overcome the presumption that racial imbalances are attributable to past <i>de jure</i> segregation by demonstrating that they were instead caused by demographic shifts, but they maintain that the District's showing in this case was inadequate, since the district court did not find that demographics constituted a <i>substantial</i> cause of those imbalances. Because the district court's careful analysis reveals that it unambiguously <i>did</i> find demographics to be the substantial cause of the racial imbalances in the student populations of certain Thomasville elementary schools, we can discern no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have repeatedly observed that one way for a school district to rebut the presumption that racial imbalances are attributable to past segregation is to \"prove that [demographic shifts or other external forces] have substantially caused current racial imbalances in its schools.\" <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 966.

It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the federal courts to try to counteract these kinds of continuous and massive demographic shifts. To attempt such results would require ongoing and never-ending supervision by the courts of school districts simply because they were once <i>de jure</i> segregated.

As the neighborhoods around Harper became increasingly black, so did Harper's student population. Because of changes in the black population of the District and the City of Thomasville, demographics overtook the Desegregation Plan and Harper's enrollment became increasingly black.\" <i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Indeed, \"Harper's variance from the district-wide percentage of black students went from approximately 6% in 1970 to almost 20% in 1975, while the other elementary schools' black enrollment during that period varied no more than 11% from the district-wide black enrollment for the elementary grades.\" <i>Id.</i> In addition, the district court noted, \"[b]y 1980 the area around Harper had become almost entirely black and by 1990 there were few, if any, white students left in the area.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1356 n. 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this analysis, the district court concluded that demographic changes, not prior <i>de jure</i> segregation or present intentional discrimination, were responsible for the racial imbalances in the District's elementary school populations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the Court finds that the racial composition of the District's elementary schools is currently \"imbalanced\" because of changes in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment of the District's schools caused by declining white enrollment as compared to black enrollment. The Court finds that the current racial imbalances of the District's elementary schools are not due to any intentional discrimination on the part of the District and are not vestiges of the District's previous <i>de jure</i> racially segregated system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not explicitly say that demographic changes were the \"substantial\" cause of the racial imbalances, it clearly found that the imbalances existed \"because of\" such changes, and that they were \"not due to\" any current intentional discrimination or past <i>de jure</i> segregation. The court's findings therefore unmistakably indicate that it found demographic shifts to be the substantial cause of the racial imbalances in Thomasville schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the Plaintiffs are saying that the district court did not find demographics to be the <i>sole</i> cause of these imbalances, this simply is not the burden that the District bears. As we observed earlier, \"a plaintiff does not undermine the strength of a defendant's demographic evidence by merely asserting that demographics <i>alone</i> do not explain the racial imbalances. Rather, for a plaintiff to preserve the presumption of <i>de jure</i> segregation, the plaintiff must show that the demographic shifts are the result of the prior <i>de jure</i> segregation or some other discriminatory conduct.\" <i>Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 944-45 (footnote omitted). The Plaintiffs in this case have made no such showing, and thus the district court committed no error in concluding that the District had carried its burden by demonstrating that demographic changes, not past segregation or present intentional discrimination, were responsible for the racial imbalances in the student bodies of District schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs' third argument on appeal is that in analyzing the constitutionality of the District's \"ability-grouping\" or \"tracking\" practices, the district court failed to apply this Circuit's precedent, which permits tracking only when it \"is not based on the present results of past segregation or will remedy such results through better educational opportunities.\" <i>Ga. State Conference of Branches of NAACP v. Georgia,</i> 775 F.2d 1403, 1414 (11th Cir.1985) (\"<i>Ga. NAACP</i>\")(quoting <i>McNeal v. Tate County Sch. Dist.,</i> 508 F.2d 1017, 1020 (5th Cir.1975)).

Specifically, the court found overrepresentation of black students in less academically advanced classes and overrepresentation of white students in more academically advanced classes. These imbalances, the court concluded, were \"a result of the District's educational policy of `ability grouping' or `tracking.'\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court did <i>not</i> ask whether the District's ability-grouping practices satisfied our long-established requirement that the tracking policy either not be based on present results of past discrimination or be designed to remedy such results. Instead of determining whether the District's ability-grouping policy was based on present results of past segregation or whether it would remedy such results, the district court focused on whether the tracking practice was intentionally discriminatory. The court acknowledged that \"the District's tracking system has had the effect of creating racially imbalanced classes within the District's schools,\" but determined that \"it was not the intention of the tracking system to segregate students based upon race\" and that \"the District does not manipulate the ability tracking system in order to track students based upon their race.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1359. To pass any further judgment on the District's tracking policy, the court determined, was \"beyond the realm of expertise of the judicial branch,\" and best left to educators. <i>Id.</i> at 1358 n. 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, whether a school district's ability-grouping practices are based on present results of past discrimination, and whether they will remedy such results, are well-settled subjects of judicial inquiry, since they go to the constitutionality &#8212; not the soundness as a policy matter &#8212; of these practices. <i>See, e.g., McNeal,</i> 508 F.2d at 1020; <i>Ga. NAACP,</i> 775 F.2d at 1414; <i>Castaneda,</i> 648 F.2d at 996-97 (\"The merits of a program which places students in classrooms with others perceived to have similar abilities are hotly debated by educators; nevertheless, it is educators, rather than courts, who are in a better position ultimately to resolve the question whether such a practice is, on the whole, more beneficial than detrimental to the students involved. Thus, as a general rule, school systems are free to employ ability grouping, even when such a policy has a segregative effect, <i>so long, of course, as such a practice is genuinely motivated by educational concerns and not discriminatory motives.</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's failure to conduct the proper inquiry requires us to remand this issue for the district court to reconsider the constitutionality of the District's ability-grouping practices, applying the legal framework established by our Circuit's precedents in <i>McNeal</i> and <i>Georgia NAACP.</i> Because \"[p]roper resolution of any desegregation case turns on a careful assessment of its facts,\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 474, 112 S.Ct. 1430, we will not decide for ourselves whether the District's use of tracking passes muster under <i>this</i> standard, but rather afford the trier of fact the first opportunity to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs' fourth claim on appeal is that the district court failed to articulate any standard for determining whether the District engaged in present intentional discrimination, and that the court should have asked whether race was a substantial motivating factor in the District's actions. Appellants' Br. at 35 (citing <i>Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.,</i> 429 U.S. 252, 265-66, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977)). We agree with the Plaintiffs that the district court could have been clearer in explicating the standard it applied, but the court's thorough and thoughtful opinion leaves us convinced that it understood and correctly applied the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs in this case argued to the district court primarily that racial imbalances in various facets of the District's school system were traceable to the District's prior <i>de jure</i> segregation, and therefore violated the Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights. However, in the alternative, the Plaintiffs claimed that the District presently practices intentional discrimination, unrelated to its history of <i>de jure</i> segregation, in violation of the equal protection principles. Acknowledging both of these lines of argument, the district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish such a constitutional violation, the evidence must be sufficient to support a finding that Defendant has engaged in intentional discrimination based upon race. <i>See, e.g., Washington v.

Therefore, the Court's first inquiry is whether Defendant operates an intentionally segregated school system based upon race or has otherwise engaged in purposeful racial discrimination. When a school district has previously operated a <i>de jure</i> segregated system, a district court must first determine whether any vestiges of the previous <i>de jure</i> system still exist before turning to whether the school district presently engages in racial discrimination unrelated to the previous <i>de jure</i> segregated system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1365-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to observe that if, after applying the <i>Keyes</i> presumption, it found that racial imbalances in the District were not traceable to prior segregation, \"then the Court must determine whether they are the result of current, intentional racial discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1366.

Indeed, it is well established that proving intent to discriminate is the essential element of an equal protection claim. <i>See, e.g.,</i> ; <i>Hernandez v.

The Supreme Court has explained that \"`[d]iscriminatory purpose' ... implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker ... selected ... a particular course of action at least in part `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" <i>Hernandez,</i> 500 U.S. at 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859 (quoting <i>Pers.

Thus, for example, as to the racial composition of the District's elementary schools, the court found that imbalances existed \"because of changes in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment of the District's schools caused by declining white enrollment as compared to black enrollment,\" and, notably, that the imbalances were \"not due to any intentional discrimination on the part of the District.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1358. Similarly, the district court plainly found that \"any racial imbalances that presently exist regarding the District's faculty are not traceable ... to current racial discrimination,\" since \"the District's faculty assignment system from 1983 to the present has not been administered in a racially discriminatory manner and that the system is presently administered without regard to race.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1360-61.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, the district court found, was race a motivating factor in any other area of the District's operations. Thus, as to the District's program for high-performing students, the district court concluded \"that no student has ever been denied an opportunity to participate in the Gifted Program because of race.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1362. Likewise, regarding special education, the district court determined \"that race has not been a factor in any decision made by the District regarding placement of children in the Special Education Program.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1363.

The district court observed that the District's first desegregation plan was ineffective, but that its second plan, adopted in 1970, in fact effectively desegregated the schools for at least six consecutive years and, indeed, received HEW approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial imbalances that developed <i>subsequently,</i> the district found, resulted not from the District's prior <i>de jure</i> segregation, but from a confluence of external factors, including a substantial decline in white enrollment in the District and population shifts within the District (in particular, a concentration of Thomasville's black population around Harper Elementary School, an area that was formerly predominantly white). As the racial imbalances at Harper grew, the district court noted, HEW was alerted to the situation. After a series of exchanges with the District, HEW concluded that in spite of the imbalances, the District was \"in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relative to assignment of students ... to schools,\" and that \"no further student desegregation is required of [the District] at this time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because these findings of the district court are soundly rooted in the record, we are left with no \"definite and firm conviction\" that they are erroneous. The Supreme Court has observed that \"[a]s the <i>de jure</i> violation becomes more remote in time and these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance in a school district is a vestige of the prior <i>de jure</i> system.\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 496, 112 S.Ct. 1430. In light of the entire record in this case, we find the district court's conclusion that changes in enrollment and demographics &#8212; not prior <i>de jure</i> segregation &#8212; account for the racial imbalances present more than three decades after Thomasville dismantled its <i>de jure</i> segregated school system to be more than plausible. Accordingly, this finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs proceed to argue that the district court's conclusion that the District took all practicable steps to eliminate the vestiges of <i>de jure</i> segregation was clearly erroneous because the District refused to implement attendance zones to counteract the racial disparities that arose under its freedom-of-choice system. The Plaintiffs' suggestion, however, clearly contradicts the Supreme Court's repeated admonition that courts may not intervene to maintain racial parity in schools once the initial constitutional violation has been remedied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in this case, found that the District remedied the constitutional violation caused by its <i>de jure</i> segregated school system through the adoption of its 1970 desegregation plan, which, undeniably, successfully desegregated the District's school for a number of years. <i>Subsequent</i> demographic and enrollment changes, however, intervened, undoing much of the racial balance achieved by the 1970 desegregation plan. While the District is, of course, free to adopt attendance zones or other constitutional measures that might counteract these effects, it is simply beyond the authority of any court to force such a policy measure on the District. As the Supreme Court has explained repeatedly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance has been caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racial imbalance due to the <i>de jure</i> violation has been remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of changing residential patterns on the racial composition of schools, though not always fortunate, is somewhat predictable. Studies show a high correlation between residential segregation and school segregation. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where resegregation is a product not of state action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications. It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the federal courts to try to counteract these kinds of continuous and massive demographic shifts. To attempt such results would require ongoing and never-ending supervision by the courts of school districts simply because they were once <i>de jure</i> segregated. Residential housing choices, and their attendant effects on the racial composition of schools, present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult to address through judicial remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 494-95, 112 S.Ct. 1430; <i>see also Swann,</i> 402 U.S. at 24, 91 S.Ct. 1267 (\"The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the Supreme Court has concluded that a district court will exceed its authority when it intervenes to rearrange a school district's attendance zones in order to achieve greater racial balance. In <i>Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler,</i> 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976), the Court held that a district court exceeded its remedial authority in requiring annual readjustment of school attendance zones when changes in racial composition of schools were caused by demographic shifts \"not attributed to any segregative acts on the part of the [school district].\" <i>Id.</i> at 436, 96 S.Ct. 2697. The Court explained that \"the District Court was not entitled to require the [school district] to rearrange its attendance zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was maintained in perpetuity. For having once implemented a racially neutral attendance pattern in order to remedy the perceived constitutional violations on the part of the defendants, the District Court had fully performed its function of providing the appropriate remedy for previous racially discriminatory attendance patterns.\" <i>Id.</i> at 436-37, 96 S.Ct. 2697; <i>see also Swann,</i> 402 U.S. at 31-32, 91 S.Ct. 1267 (\"Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the system.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court would exceed its authority by requiring the City of Thomasville School District to adopt attendance zones in order to counteract racial imbalances caused by demographic forces rather than by prior <i>de jure</i> segregation, we cannot find the district court's conclusion that the District took all practicable steps to eliminate the vestiges of <i>de jure</i> segregation to be clearly erroneous on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs also challenge the district court's finding that the District does not now intentionally discriminate against black students. First, the Plaintiffs point to several pieces of evidence presented at trial that the district court did not discuss in its opinion, arguing that the court's failure to acknowledge these pieces of evidence demonstrates that its factual findings regarding intent to discriminate are clearly erroneous. Specifically, the Plaintiffs cite the fact that a District task force declined to replace the District's freedom-of-choice system of student assignment with attendance zones, at least in part because some members were concerned that such a change would prompt white students to leave the District and enroll in private schools, as well as the fact that one school administrator testified that she had reassigned white students based upon their parents \"saying they didn't want their children in the mostly black classes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these two pieces of evidence are undoubtedly relevant, we cannot conclude that the district court's failure to mention them explicitly in its opinion somehow renders all of its detailed findings concerning intent to discriminate clearly erroneous. For one thing, the evidence presented by both parties at trial was extensive and the record in this case is voluminous. The district court was not obliged to recite and analyze individually each and every piece of evidence presented by the parties. The plaintiffs do not point to any specific factual finding that these particular pieces of evidence render clearly erroneous, but rather suggest that they invalidate the entirety of the district court's intentional discrimination analysis. This is simply not the case. As we have already described at some length, the district court carefully evaluated all pertinent areas of the District's operations, and concluded based on the entirety of the record that the District's policies and programs are administered in a race-neutral manner, free of any intent to discriminate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law is well settled that \"[i]f the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of <i>the record viewed in its entirety,</i> the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (emphasis added). We may reverse the district court only when \"on the entire evidence\" we are \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504(marks and citation omitted). After reviewing the lengthy record in its entirety, we are left with no such conviction. The pieces of evidence that the Plaintiffs highlight are no doubt significant, but \"[w]e cannot overturn the district court's finding of fact simply because this evidence was merely conflicting.\" <i>Ga. NAACP,</i> 775 F.2d at 1419. Simply put, ample evidence supports the district court's reasoned findings, and we therefore see no clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Plaintiffs argue that statistical evidence establishes that the District intentionally discriminated against black students in the administration of discipline, rendering the district court's contrary conclusion clearly erroneous. The Plaintiffs claim that the district court ignored \"uncontradicted statistical analysis demonstrating that blacks were administered harsher discipline than whites for the same conduct.\" Appellants' Br. at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in concluding that this was not the case, the district court relied on two witness' testimony to the contrary. The trial court explained that it found, \"based upon the evidence presented at trial, no incident in which a black student received a harsher punishment than a white student for the same or similar misconduct,\" and \"that the District does not treat black students differently from white students with respect to referrals for discipline.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1364. Moreover, the district court observed, \"<i>[n]o</i> evidence was presented at trial by Plaintiffs to refute Defendant's evidence that no black student has received a referral for punishment where a white student did not under the same or similar circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court concluded that \"race has not been a factor in any decision made by the District with respect to discipline.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs do not point to any specific error in the district court's reasoning or otherwise explain how its account of the evidence is flawed. Again, as long as the district court's view of the evidence is \"plausible,\" we have no ground for reversal. <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504. And our review of the record in this case again reveals that the district court's assessment is plausible; we, therefore, find no error in its conclusion that the District does not intentionally discriminate against black students in the administration of discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that statistical evidence demonstrates that the District intentionally discriminates against black students by using ability grouping to assign students to classes, rendering the district court's contrary conclusion clearly erroneous. We express no opinion as to which way the evidence points on this issue. Based on our earlier conclusion that the district court failed to apply the proper legal standard in assessing the constitutionality of the District's use of ability grouping, we remand for the district court to make new findings of fact on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have explained numerous times that \"only in circumstances when `a district court applies an incorrect legal standard which taints or infects its findings of facts, [do] such findings lose the insulation of Rule 52(a) and judgment based thereon cannot stand.'\" <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 965 (quoting <i>Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 940-41). On the these issue of ability grouping, \"the district judge's repeated use of the wrong legal standard sufficiently tainted or infected the findings of factso as to strip those findings of the insulation normally accorded under Rule 52(a).\" <i>Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 943. We therefore remand for the district court to make new findings of fact, applying the correct legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the District has cross-appealed the trial court's determination that each party should bear its own costs, asking us to reverse and remand for the district court to award costs or explain its decision not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\" Fed.R.Civ.P.54(d). In this case, the district court, on February 6, 2004, entered judgment in favor of the District, but \"directed that each side shall bear its own costs.\" The court gave no explanation for denying costs to the District, as the prevailing party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that \"where the trial court denies the prevailing party its costs, the court <i>must</i> give a reason for its denial of costs so that the appellate court may have some basis upon which to determine if the trial court acted within its discretionary power.\" <i>Head v. Medford,</i> 62 F.3d 351, 354 (11th Cir.1995) (emphasis in original) (quoting <i>Gilchrist v. Bolger,</i> 733 F.2d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1984) (citation omitted)). \"Thus, although the district court has discretion to deny a prevailing party costs, such discretion is not unfettered.\" <i>Id.; accord Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Tropical Shipping &amp; Const. Co.,</i> 254 F.3d 987, 1012 (11th Cir.2001); <i>Gilchrist,</i> 733 F.2d at 1557. Rule 54(d) establishes \"a presumption that costs are to be awarded to a prevailing party,\" and that \"[t]o defeat the presumption and deny full costs, a district court must have and state a sound basis for doing so.\" <i>Chapman v. AI Transp.,</i> 229 F.3d 1012, 1038-39 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs suggest that the district court's \"reasons for denying costs are implicit.\" Appellants' Br. at 29. They argue that the district court \"implicitly acknowledged plaintiffs' good faith and socially important argument throughout the opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> However, the law of our Circuit establishes unambiguously that the district court <i>must</i> explicitly state its reasons for denying costs. Thus, although the district court may have acted well within its discretion in assigning each party its own costs, its failure to state a reason for doing so constitutes reversible error. We therefore vacate the district court's assignment of costs with the instruction that if the District prevails on the ability-grouping issue we have remanded for reconsideration, the district court must award costs to the District or explain its decision to deny them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful review of the record and the district court's opinion in this case, we are convinced that the district court committed no error in declining to make a \"unitary status\" finding, in applying the so-called <i>Keyes</i> presumption, or in applying the law of intentional discrimination. We, therefore, affirm the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on all of these issues. However, as to the district court's treatment of the Plaintiffs' challenge to the District's ability-grouping practices, we conclude that the court failed to apply the correct legal standard and that this error tainted its factual findings on this issue. We, therefore, reverse and remand for reconsideration of the Plaintiffs' ability-grouping claim. We can discern no clear error in the district court's remaining findings of fact, and therefore affirm in this respect, too. Finally, because the district court offered no explanation for declining to award costs to the District as the prevailing party, we vacate the assignment of costs and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Honorable Richard F.

See, e.g., Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 942; <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 966. However, as the above discussion illustrates, what we have called the \"<i>Keyes</i>\" presumption is actually rooted in <i>Swann</i> and <i>Freeman. Keyes,</i> in contrast, addressed segregation in a school district that was never statutorily dual. The Supreme Court held that a finding of systematic segregation in certain schools within a <i>unified</i> school district creates a presumption that the remaining schools within the district were also systematically segregated, absent a showing that the district was divided into clearly unrelated units. <i>Keyes,</i> 413 U.S. at 207, 93 S.Ct. 2686. Since Thomasville operated a school system that <i>was</i> formally dual in its entirety, <i>Swann</i> and <i>Freeman</i> are more closely on point than <i>Keyes.</i> Nevertheless, for simplicity's sake, we adhere to our Court's imprecise but long-established terminology and call the burden-shifting framework applicable here the \"<i>Keyes</i> presumption.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court also explicitly acknowledged the<i>Keyes</i> standard advanced by the Plaintiffs, accurately explaining that <i>Keyes</i> held \"that if a school board has intentionally engaged in segregative actions in a meaningful portion of its system, then a presumption is created that any segregation within the system is the result of that intentional segregation.

Lumley, Lumley &amp; Howell, LLP, Macon, GA, for Defendant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeals from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BARKETT, MARCUS and SUHRHEINRICH<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a>, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARCUS, Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this class action lawsuit is whether the City of Thomasville School District (\"the District\") has satisfied its constitutional obligation to dismantle its former <i>de jure</i> racially segregated school system. The Plaintiffs &#8212; Shernika Holton and ten other representative parents of black children attending elementary, middle, and high schools operated by the District, and the Thomas County Branch of the NAACP &#8212; allege that the District has failed to do so, and request that judicial supervision of the District's desegregation efforts be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a lengthy bench trial, the district court found that racial imbalances existed in several areas of the District's operations, but that these imbalances were neither traceable to prior <i>de jure</i> segregation nor the result of present intentional discrimination. Accordingly, the district court concluded that the District had satisfied its constitutional obligation to desegregate. For the most part, we can discern no error in the district court's findings of fact or its application of the law. However, as to the Plaintiffs' claim that the District's use of \"ability grouping\" to determine classroom assignments discriminates on the basis of race, we conclude that the district court failed to apply the legal standard long accepted in this Circuit, and that this legal error tainted its findings of fact. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for reconsideration of the ability-grouping issue in light of the correct legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, this case differs from the other school desegregation cases that have come before us in recent years, in that the City of Thomasville School District has never operated under any court-imposed desegregation order or other court supervision. Indeed, this lawsuit is the first desegregation suit ever brought against the District. Because no court has ever imposed a desegregation order on the District, we face whether it is appropriate to do so for the first time now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the Plaintiffs raise two broad causes of action. First, they claim that the District \"has perpetuated, failed to disestablish and maintained purposefully racially segregated and unequal public schools ... and, thus, has acted contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.\" Second, they allege that the District \"has perpetuated and failed to disestablish racially segregated public schools ..., has acted with the purpose and effect of subjecting Plaintiffs to discrimination in a federally funded program and, thus, has acted contrary to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d, and implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 100.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction requiring the District to (a) disestablish its racially segregated school system; (b) adopt and implement a plan effectively to desegregate its buildings and classrooms; (c) provide equal educational facilities, resources, materials, and instruction to all students, and to provide compensatory instruction to students previously denied that opportunity; (d) cease all discriminatory imposition of discipline; and (e) desegregate all student activities, and cease discrimination against black students in this area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court certified a class of \"all present and future parents or guardians of African American children enrolled or eligible to be enrolled within the Thomasville City School District.\" <i>Thomas County Branch of NAACP v.

Jan.21, 2003) (unpublished). In the same order, the district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, finding that under Eleventh Circuit precedent, any present racial imbalances in the District are presumptively the result of the District's previous <i>de jure</i> segregation. <i>Id.</i> at *2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the district court tried the case without a jury from July 21 to August 6, 2003. Based on the evidence presented, the trial judge made a series of detailed factual findings. We repeat just the basics here, as these findings are laid out with great clarity and detail in the district court's order, dated February 5, 2004. <i>See Thomas County NAACP.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as background, the district court outlined the history of the District's desegregation efforts, including numerous reorganizations of the District's schools. At the time the Supreme Court issued its seminal opinion in <i>Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">873</span></span> (1954), declaring that racial segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the District was operating a <i>de jure</i> segregated school system. Until 1965, the District's schools remained segregated, with two elementary schools (grades 1-6) serving black students and four serving white students, as well one high school (grades 7-12) for black students and another for white students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the District adopted its first desegregation plan, which became effective at the start of the 1965-66 school year. The plan was based upon freedom of choice, permitting parents to elect which school their children would attend. This method failed to accomplish any desegregation, and the District's historically black schools remained all black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A series of exchanges between the District and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\") ensued, culminating in the District's adoption of a new desegregation plan in 1970. This plan created a single high school for all students in grades 9-12, regardless of race; a single middle school for all students in grades 7-8, regardless of race; a single school for all students in grade 6, regardless of race; a single school for all students in grade 5, regardless of race; and four elementary schools among which all students in grades 1-4 could select based on freedom of choice. The plan further provided that \"[i]f the `freedom of choice' plan does not eliminate the racial identifiability of each of the four elementary schools, alternate steps will be taken to give this assurance.\" HEW found that the plan would accomplish the purposes of Title VI and accepted the plan on July 1, 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some reconfiguration of the District's schools occurred between 1970 and 1993, and by the start of the 1993-94 school year, the District was operating four elementary schools serving grades 1-5 (Douglass, Harper, Jerger, and Scott), one middle school serving grades 6-8 (McIntyre Park), and one high school for grades 9-12 (Thomasville High). At the end of the 2001-02 school year, Douglass Elementary School closed, and since then the District has maintained the remaining three elementary schools, as well as its single middle and high schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After providing this background, the district court went on to make detailed findings of fact concerning racial imbalances in various areas of the District's operations. The district court found racial imbalances to exist in these areas: the student populations of the District's elementary schools; the composition of some individual classes within the District's schools; the faculty assigned to the District's elementary schools; the staff assigned to some of the District's schools; the composition of the student population participating in the District's gifted and special education programs; and possibly the number of students subjected to disciplinary actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the first area &#8212; student populations of the District's elementary schools &#8212; the district court found that two schools were \"racially identifiable,\" meaning that the percentage of black students enrolled varied more than twenty percent from the district-wide percentage of black students in the grades served by the school. Harper, the district court found, was an identifiably black school, whereas Jerger was an identifiably white school. In the school year 2002-03, for example, the district-wide percentage of black students was 73.6, while Harper's student body was 98.5% black and Jerger's was 39.8% black. Scott, the single non-racially identifiable elementary school, had a student population that was 90% black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, however, that these racial imbalances were not traceable in any proximate way to the District's former <i>de jure</i> segregated school system. Notably, from 1970 (when the District adopted its second desegregation plan) until 1976, the black student population of at least three of the four elementary schools the District then operated \"closely tracked the percentage of black students in the District as a whole.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1355. During that period, no student attended a school whose black student population varied by more than twenty percent from the district-wide percentage of black students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court supplied this table to illustrate the data:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <pre>---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Percentage of Black Students\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n   School   District,\n    Year    Grades 1-4     Balfour     Harper     Jerger      Scott\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1970-71    57.4         53.4        63.2       60.1       54.9\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1971-72    62.4         58.3        72.1       68.8       56.1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1972-73    65.9         57.8        82.5       66.8       61.1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1973-74    67.8         64.7        83.2       68.9       59.2\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1974-75    66.3         66.1        85.6       66.8       55.3\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1975-76    67.9         73.0        87.3       63.5       56.1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The racial imbalances that subsequently developed within the District's schools, the district court found, were the result of pronounced enrollment and demographic changes in the school District. Following the implementation of the 1970 desegregation plan, the district court observed, white enrollment in the District's schools declined substantially, while black enrollment remained fairly stable. From the 1970-71 school year to the 1977-78 school year, black students went from constituting 51.74% to 65.78% of the District's enrollees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the City of Thomasville experienced population shifts during that period. In 1970, the City's black population was concentrated primarily in the City's southwestern sector, and since that time, the distribution of Thomasville's black population has changed. For example, Harper Elementary School was \"surrounded by some predominantly white communities\" in 1970, but by 1980, that area had become almost entirely black, and by 1990, \"there were few, if any, white students left in the area.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1356 n. 19. As the neighborhoods around Harper became increasingly black, so did Harper's student population. The district court explained that \"demographics overtook the Desegregation Plan,\" so that Harper's variance from the district-wide enrollment of black students went from 6% in 1970 to almost 20% in 1975. <i>Id.</i> at 1356. Meanwhile, the District's other elementary schools varied by no more than 11% in this respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The disparity at Harper came to the attention of HEW, and on May 13, 1975, it sent a letter to the District's Superintendent advising that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had ordered it in <i>Adams v. Weinberger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494490\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494490/adams-v-weinberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span> (D.D.C.1975), to put school districts on notice \"to rebut or explain the substantial racial disproportion in one or more of the district's schools.\" HEW stated that \"The court defined a racially disproportionate school as one in which a `20 percent disproportion exists between the percentage of local minority pupils in the schools and the percentage in the entire school district.'\" Several exchanges between the District and HEW followed, and the District explained its student assignment procedures to HEW in these terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assignments are based upon freedom of choice, modified only to the extent hereinafter stated. Freedom of choice forms are issued to all pupils each year. If a school reaches its capacity, priority is given to the child nearest the school. If a parent or student fails to return the form, the student is assigned by school officials to the school nearest the student's home which has not been filled to capacity. In order to maximize a biracial complexion in the Harper School, freedom of choice is modified in two respects: (a) Whites residing in the Harper area have been required to attend Harper notwithstanding their selection of another school under freedom of choice[;] (b) Priority has been given to whites desiring to attend Harper as against blacks residing closer to that school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving this explanation and other information, HEW \"determined that no further student desegregation is required of [the District] at this time.\" On November 17, 1975, HEW found the District \"in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relative to assignment of students ... to schools.\" However, HEW also noted that the situation at Harper warranted monitoring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1977, racial imbalances in the District's elementary schools began gradually to increase. No formal plan was adopted by the District to address these imbalances, but in 1994, the District created a task force to consider the issue. The task force made consensus recommendations regarding a new process for assigning students to elementary schools. The District implemented these recommendations, with a few modifications, in 1995. The new assignment process is based primarily on parent preferences. If space does not permit accommodation of all preferences, a priority system based on special education considerations, sibling placement, and residency, determines the assignment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this history and data, the district court concluded that two elementary schools &#8212; Harper and Jerger &#8212; \"are clearly racially identifiable schools.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1358. To illustrate the data supporting this conclusion, the court supplied this table:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <pre>---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Percentage of Black Students\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n   School\n    Year      District     Harper     Jerger     Scott     Douglass\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1999-2000  74.3         100        39.1       84.1      99.6\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n2000-2001  75.2         100        40.3       88.6      100\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001-2002  76.0         99.3       41.7       88.7      100\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n2002-2003  73.6         98.5       39.8       90.0      Closed\n---------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>Nevertheless, the court found, \"that the racial composition of the District's elementary schools is currently `imbalanced' because of changes in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment of the District's schools caused by declining white enrollment as compared to black enrollment.\" <i>Id.</i> Moreover, the court found \"that the current racial imbalances of the District's elementary schools are not due to any intentional discrimination on the part of the District and are not vestiges of the District's previous <i>de jure</i> racially segregated system.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second racially imbalanced area of the District's operations &#8212; individual classes within its schools &#8212; the district court found the imbalances to be the result of the District's use of \"ability grouping\" or \"tracking\" to assign students to classes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The District, the court explained, begins to group students into classes based on their perceived abilities as early as kindergarten.

The Court finds that these placements are not being made due to the race of the student. Many of these low income students are simply perceived as not being prepared when they first arrive at school. Due to their impoverished environment, they do not receive the background and support that is often so critical for being ready to learn. Tragically, it appears that for many of these children, the \"die is cast\" as early as kindergarten. These children do not appear to be reevaluated (and thus potentially \"re-tracked\") during their progression through the system.

As to facilities, the court found no disparity in the facility quality or resources of the District's identifiably black schools as compared to its identifiably white school, and concluded that race played no role in the District's allocation of funds to the various schools. Regarding transportation, the district court observed that the only transportation the District offered was for special education and extracurricular activities, as well as a very limited route implemented after the closing of Douglass Elementary to transport students previously enrolled there to Harper Elementary. The court concluded that because Douglass' student body had been 100% black, only black students received transportation, and thus the District did not discriminate against black students in the provision of transportation. Regarding extracurricular activities, the court found that all of the District's extracurriculars were available to all students without regard to race, and that no racial imbalances existed within those programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the district court ruled in favor of the District, concluding that although racial imbalances existed in some aspects of the District's schools, they were neither traceable to the District's prior <i>de jure</i> segregation, nor the result of present intentional discrimination.

First, they argue that the district court's failure to determine whether the District had achieved \"unitary status\" constitutes reversible error. Second, the Plaintiffs claim that the district court misapplied the so-called \"<i>Keyes</i>\" presumption that present racial imbalances within a previously <i>de jure</i> segregated school system are a result of prior segregation, because the burden of proof it placed on the District to rebut the presumption was too low in several respects. Third, the Plaintiffs say that the district court failed to scrutinize with sufficient rigor the District's use of \"ability tracking\" to assign students to classes. Fourth, the Plaintiffs contend that the district court failed to articulate or apply any standard for intentional discrimination. Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that the district court's legal errors infected its factual findings, and that the court made several findings of fact that were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In school desegregation cases, we review <i>de novo</i> the district court's interpretation and application of the law. <i>NAACP, Jacksonville Branch v.

First, an assessment of unitary status is generally only made when a district court is deciding \"when it is appropriate to restore local control\" (<i>i.e.,</i> to end judicial supervision) of a school system. <i>See Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 942. This much is evident from the two factors courts consider in making the unitariness determination: (1) \"whether local authorities have eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable,\" and (2) \"whether local authorities have in good faith fully and satisfactorily complied with, and shown a commitment to, the desegregation plan.\" <i>Id.</i> In a case such as this one &#8212; where the school district has <i>never</i> been placed under judicial supervision &#8212; the second prong of the inquiry has no application, since no desegregation plan has ever been imposed on the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more important, the Supreme Court and this Court have made clear that the <i>substance</i> of the judicial inquiry, not the terminology employed, is what matters. The usefulness of the terms \"unitary\" and \"unitary status\" has been called into question, and in fact the Supreme Court has urged the lower courts to discard these terms, explaining:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower courts have been inconsistent in their use of the term \"unitary.\" Some have used it to identify a school district that has completely remedied all vestiges of past discrimination. Under that interpretation of the word, a unitary school district is one that has met the mandate of [<i>Brown</i> and <i>Green</i>]. Other courts, however, have used \"unitary\" to describe any school district that has currently desegregated school assignments, whether or not that status is solely the result of a court-imposed desegregation plan. In other words, such a school district could be called unitary and nevertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination.

Specifically, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in three ways: it failed to hold the District to its obligation to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable; it failed to require the District to show that its own policies were not factors contributing to its racial imbalances; and it failed to require the District to show that demographic changes were the \"substantial\" cause of the racial imbalances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first argument, the Plaintiffs suggest that the district court erroneously failed to require the District to present evidence that it had eliminated the vestiges of segregation to the extent practicable &#8212; that is, that the District had taken \"every reasonable effort ... to eradicate segregation and its insidious residue.\" Appellants' Br. at 23 (quoting <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 973). Essentially, the Plaintiffs' argument is that the district court failed to consider the <i>substance</i> of the unitariness analysis. The Plaintiffs are correct that the essence of a school district's desegregation duty is to eliminate the vestiges of segregation \"to the extent practicable,\" and that the district court neglected to use this precise terminology in assessing whether the District had fulfilled its obligation.

For each imbalanced area, the district court unambiguously found that demographic and other external factors &#8212; including \"changes in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment of the District's schools caused by declining white enrollment as compared to black enrollment\" &#8212; were the cause of the imbalance. <i>Id.</i> at 1358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon determining that the District had carried its burden in a particular area, the trial court then asked \"whether the District presently engages in purposeful racial discrimination\" in that area. <i>Id.</i> at 1366.

For one thing, it derives from <i>Keyes,</i> which, as we noted earlier, dealt with a school system that was not statutorily segregated. The standard the Plaintiffs quote lays out the burden a school district faces in rebutting the presumption that an entire unified school system is infected with intentional segregation, which arises out of a finding of intentional segregation in a single school within that system. <i>See Keyes,</i> 413 U.S. at 213-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district's burden is to prove that its policies and practices \"<i>either were not taken in effectuation of a policy to create or maintain segregation in the core city schools, or, if unsuccessful in that effort,</i> were not factors in causing the existing condition of segregation in these schools.\" <i>Id.</i> at 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

All the former component requires the school district to prove is that its policies and practices were not intentionally discriminatory. Only if the school district is unable to do so is it required to demonstrate that its policies \"were not factors\" in creating segregated conditions.

Where resegregation is a product not of state action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications. It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the federal courts to try to counteract these kinds of continuous and massive demographic shifts. To attempt such results would require ongoing and never-ending supervision by the courts of school districts simply because they were once <i>de jure</i> segregated. Residential housing choices, and their attendant effects on the racial composition of schools, present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult to address through judicial remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 495, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the neighborhoods around Harper became increasingly black, so did Harper's student population. Because of changes in the black population of the District and the City of Thomasville, demographics overtook the Desegregation Plan and Harper's enrollment became increasingly black.\" <i>Id.</i> (citations omitted). Indeed, \"Harper's variance from the district-wide percentage of black students went from approximately 6% in 1970 to almost 20% in 1975, while the other elementary schools' black enrollment during that period varied no more than 11% from the district-wide black enrollment for the elementary grades.\" <i>Id.</i> In addition, the district court noted, \"[b]y 1980 the area around Harper had become almost entirely black and by 1990 there were few, if any, white students left in the area.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1356 n. 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this analysis, the district court concluded that demographic changes, not prior <i>de jure</i> segregation or present intentional discrimination, were responsible for the racial imbalances in the District's elementary school populations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the Court finds that the racial composition of the District's elementary schools is currently \"imbalanced\" because of changes in the racial makeup of the City of Thomasville, shifting housing patterns, and changes in the enrollment of the District's schools caused by declining white enrollment as compared to black enrollment. The Court finds that the current racial imbalances of the District's elementary schools are not due to any intentional discrimination on the part of the District and are not vestiges of the District's previous <i>de jure</i> racially segregated system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1358.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not explicitly say that demographic changes were the \"substantial\" cause of the racial imbalances, it clearly found that the imbalances existed \"because of\" such changes, and that they were \"not due to\" any current intentional discrimination or past <i>de jure</i> segregation. The court's findings therefore unmistakably indicate that it found demographic shifts to be the substantial cause of the racial imbalances in Thomasville schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the Plaintiffs are saying that the district court did not find demographics to be the <i>sole</i> cause of these imbalances, this simply is not the burden that the District bears. As we observed earlier, \"a plaintiff does not undermine the strength of a defendant's demographic evidence by merely asserting that demographics <i>alone</i> do not explain the racial imbalances. Rather, for a plaintiff to preserve the presumption of <i>de jure</i> segregation, the plaintiff must show that the demographic shifts are the result of the prior <i>de jure</i> segregation or some other discriminatory conduct.\" <i>Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 944-45 (footnote omitted). The Plaintiffs in this case have made no such showing, and thus the district court committed no error in concluding that the District had carried its burden by demonstrating that demographic changes, not past segregation or present intentional discrimination, were responsible for the racial imbalances in the student bodies of District schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs' third argument on appeal is that in analyzing the constitutionality of the District's \"ability-grouping\" or \"tracking\" practices, the district court failed to apply this Circuit's precedent, which permits tracking only when it \"is not based on the present results of past segregation or will remedy such results through better educational opportunities.\" <i>Ga.

Instead of determining whether the District's ability-grouping policy was based on present results of past segregation or whether it would remedy such results, the district court focused on whether the tracking practice was intentionally discriminatory. The court acknowledged that \"the District's tracking system has had the effect of creating racially imbalanced classes within the District's schools,\" but determined that \"it was not the intention of the tracking system to segregate students based upon race\" and that \"the District does not manipulate the ability tracking system in order to track students based upon their race.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1359.

However, in the alternative, the Plaintiffs claimed that the District presently practices intentional discrimination, unrelated to its history of <i>de jure</i> segregation, in violation of the equal protection principles.

They say that the district court's finding that demographics were the substantial cause of racial imbalances among the District's elementary schools was clearly erroneous for two principal reasons: first, because the evidence presented at trial did not show sufficiently significant demographic changes to account for the racial disparities in enrollment; and second, because the District could have counteracted these shifts by implementing attendance zones. Here, the Plaintiffs have done nothing more than present an alternative (and permissible) view of the evidence, and therefore we cannot conclude that any of the district court's findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our detailed review of the record leaves us with no doubt that the district court had a sound evidentiary basis for concluding that changes in Thomasville's demography and school enrollment substantially caused the racial imbalances among the student populations of the District's elementary schools. As we explained in more detail above, the district court based its findings on a thorough evaluation of Thomasville's school-enrollment data from 1965 (the last year the District was <i>de jure</i> segregated) to the time of trial. The district court observed that the District's first desegregation plan was ineffective, but that its second plan, adopted in 1970, in fact effectively desegregated the schools for at least six consecutive years and, indeed, received HEW approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial imbalances that developed <i>subsequently,</i> the district found, resulted not from the District's prior <i>de jure</i> segregation, but from a confluence of external factors, including a substantial decline in white enrollment in the District and population shifts within the District (in particular, a concentration of Thomasville's black population around Harper Elementary School, an area that was formerly predominantly white). As the racial imbalances at Harper grew, the district court noted, HEW was alerted to the situation. After a series of exchanges with the District, HEW concluded that in spite of the imbalances, the District was \"in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relative to assignment of students ... to schools,\" and that \"no further student desegregation is required of [the District] at this time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because these findings of the district court are soundly rooted in the record, we are left with no \"definite and firm conviction\" that they are erroneous. The Supreme Court has observed that \"[a]s the <i>de jure</i> violation becomes more remote in time and these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less likely that a current racial imbalance in a school district is a vestige of the prior <i>de jure</i> system.\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1430</span></a></span>. In light of the entire record in this case, we find the district court's conclusion that changes in enrollment and demographics &#8212; not prior <i>de jure</i> segregation &#8212; account for the racial imbalances present more than three decades after Thomasville dismantled its <i>de jure</i> segregated school system to be more than plausible. Accordingly, this finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs proceed to argue that the district court's conclusion that the District took all practicable steps to eliminate the vestiges of <i>de jure</i> segregation was clearly erroneous because the District refused to implement attendance zones to counteract the racial disparities that arose under its freedom-of-choice system. The Plaintiffs' suggestion, however, clearly contradicts the Supreme Court's repeated admonition that courts may not intervene to maintain racial parity in schools once the initial constitutional violation has been remedied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in this case, found that the District remedied the constitutional violation caused by its <i>de jure</i> segregated school system through the adoption of its 1970 desegregation plan, which, undeniably, successfully desegregated the District's school for a number of years. <i>Subsequent</i> demographic and enrollment changes, however, intervened, undoing much of the racial balance achieved by the 1970 desegregation plan. While the District is, of course, free to adopt attendance zones or other constitutional measures that might counteract these effects, it is simply beyond the authority of any court to force such a policy measure on the District. As the Supreme Court has explained repeatedly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake. It is to be pursued when racial imbalance has been caused by a constitutional violation. Once the racial imbalance due to the <i>de jure</i> violation has been remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of changing residential patterns on the racial composition of schools, though not always fortunate, is somewhat predictable.

It is beyond the authority and beyond the practical ability of the federal courts to try to counteract these kinds of continuous and massive demographic shifts. To attempt such results would require ongoing and never-ending supervision by the courts of school districts simply because they were once <i>de jure</i> segregated. Residential housing choices, and their attendant effects on the racial composition of schools, present an ever-changing pattern, one difficult to address through judicial remedies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Freeman,</i> 503 U.S. at 494-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

First, the Plaintiffs point to several pieces of evidence presented at trial that the district court did not discuss in its opinion, arguing that the court's failure to acknowledge these pieces of evidence demonstrates that its factual findings regarding intent to discriminate are clearly erroneous. Specifically, the Plaintiffs cite the fact that a District task force declined to replace the District's freedom-of-choice system of student assignment with attendance zones, at least in part because some members were concerned that such a change would prompt white students to leave the District and enroll in private schools, as well as the fact that one school administrator testified that she had reassigned white students based upon their parents \"saying they didn't want their children in the mostly black classes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While these two pieces of evidence are undoubtedly relevant, we cannot conclude that the district court's failure to mention them explicitly in its opinion somehow renders all of its detailed findings concerning intent to discriminate clearly erroneous. For one thing, the evidence presented by both parties at trial was extensive and the record in this case is voluminous. The district court was not obliged to recite and analyze individually each and every piece of evidence presented by the parties. The plaintiffs do not point to any specific factual finding that these particular pieces of evidence render clearly erroneous, but rather suggest that they invalidate the entirety of the district court's intentional discrimination analysis. This is simply not the case. As we have already described at some length, the district court carefully evaluated all pertinent areas of the District's operations, and concluded based on the entirety of the record that the District's policies and programs are administered in a race-neutral manner, free of any intent to discriminate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law is well settled that \"[i]f the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of <i>the record viewed in its entirety,</i> the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 573-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Plaintiffs claim that the district court ignored \"uncontradicted statistical analysis demonstrating that blacks were administered harsher discipline than whites for the same conduct.\" Appellants' Br. at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in concluding that this was not the case, the district court relied on two witness' testimony to the contrary. The trial court explained that it found, \"based upon the evidence presented at trial, no incident in which a black student received a harsher punishment than a white student for the same or similar misconduct,\" and \"that the District does not treat black students differently from white students with respect to referrals for discipline.\" <i>Thomas County NAACP,</i> 299 F.Supp.2d at 1364. Moreover, the district court observed, \"<i>[n]o</i> evidence was presented at trial by Plaintiffs to refute Defendant's evidence that no black student has received a referral for punishment where a white student did not under the same or similar circumstances.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court concluded that \"race has not been a factor in any decision made by the District with respect to discipline.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs do not point to any specific error in the district court's reasoning or otherwise explain how its account of the evidence is flawed. Again, as long as the district court's view of the evidence is \"plausible,\" we have no ground for reversal. <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>. And our review of the record in this case again reveals that the district court's assessment is plausible; we, therefore, find no error in its conclusion that the District does not intentionally discriminate against black students in the administration of discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that statistical evidence demonstrates that the District intentionally discriminates against black students by using ability grouping to assign students to classes, rendering the district court's contrary conclusion clearly erroneous. We express no opinion as to which way the evidence points on this issue. Based on our earlier conclusion that the district court failed to apply the proper legal standard in assessing the constitutionality of the District's use of ability grouping, we remand for the district court to make new findings of fact on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have explained numerous times that \"only in circumstances when `a district court applies an incorrect legal standard which taints or infects its findings of facts, [do] such findings lose the insulation of Rule 52(a) and judgment based thereon cannot stand.'\" <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 965 (quoting <i>Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 940-41). On the these issue of ability grouping, \"the district judge's repeated use of the wrong legal standard sufficiently tainted or infected the findings of factso as to strip those findings of the insulation normally accorded under Rule 52(a).\" <i>Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 943. We therefore remand for the district court to make new findings of fact, applying the correct legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the District has cross-appealed the trial court's determination that each party should bear its own costs, asking us to reverse and remand for the district court to award costs or explain its decision not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\" Fed.R.Civ.P.54(d).

They argue that the district court \"implicitly acknowledged plaintiffs' good faith and socially important argument throughout the opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> However, the law of our Circuit establishes unambiguously that the district court <i>must</i> explicitly state its reasons for denying costs. Thus, although the district court may have acted well within its discretion in assigning each party its own costs, its failure to state a reason for doing so constitutes reversible error. We therefore vacate the district court's assignment of costs with the instruction that if the District prevails on the ability-grouping issue we have remanded for reconsideration, the district court must award costs to the District or explain its decision to deny them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful review of the record and the district court's opinion in this case, we are convinced that the district court committed no error in declining to make a \"unitary status\" finding, in applying the so-called <i>Keyes</i> presumption, or in applying the law of intentional discrimination. We, therefore, affirm the district court's findings of fact and conclusions of law on all of these issues. However, as to the district court's treatment of the Plaintiffs' challenge to the District's ability-grouping practices, we conclude that the court failed to apply the correct legal standard and that this error tainted its factual findings on this issue. We, therefore, reverse and remand for reconsideration of the Plaintiffs' ability-grouping claim. We can discern no clear error in the district court's remaining findings of fact, and therefore affirm in this respect, too. Finally, because the district court offered no explanation for declining to award costs to the District as the prevailing party, we vacate the assignment of costs and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Honorable Richard F.

See, e.g., Manning,</i> 244 F.3d at 942; <i>Jacksonville NAACP,</i> 273 F.3d at 966. However, as the above discussion illustrates, what we have called the \"<i>Keyes</i>\" presumption is actually rooted in <i>Swann</i> and <i>Freeman. Keyes,</i> in contrast, addressed segregation in a school district that was never statutorily dual. The Supreme Court held that a finding of systematic segregation in certain schools within a <i>unified</i> school district creates a presumption that the remaining schools within the district were also systematically segregated, absent a showing that the district was divided into clearly unrelated units. <i>Keyes,</i> 413 U.S. at 207, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Since Thomasville operated a school system that <i>was</i> formally dual in its entirety, <i>Swann</i> and <i>Freeman</i> are more closely on point than <i>Keyes.</i> Nevertheless, for simplicity's sake, we adhere to our Court's imprecise but long-established terminology and call the burden-shifting framework applicable here the \"<i>Keyes</i> presumption.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The district court also explicitly acknowledged the<i>Keyes</i> standard advanced by the Plaintiffs, accurately explaining that <i>Keyes</i> held \"that if a school board has intentionally engaged in segregative actions in a meaningful portion of its system, then a presumption is created that any segregation within the system is the result of that intentional segregation.
