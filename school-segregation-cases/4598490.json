This mistaken assump-\n     tion proceeds from a failure to note that\n     population has been sustained as a basis for\n     olassification only in those instances where\n     it bore a reasonable relation to the objects\n     and purposes of the law and was founded upon\n     rational difference in the necessities or\n     conditions of the groups subjected to dirrer-\n     ent laws.

Ct.) 150 S.W.2d 1000:\n          \"It will be noted that the Act in question\n     by its terms is made applicable only in those\n     counties having a population of not less than\n     125,000 nor more than 175,000 inhabitants, and\n     containing a city having a population of not\n     less than 90,000 inhabitants, as shown by the\n     last preceding Federal census, The evidence\n     shows, without dispute, that the only county\n     within the State.coming within the provisions\n     of the Act at the time of its adoption was El\n     Paso county. The Legislature was doubtless\n     cognizant of this fact. It was also oogni-\n     zant Of the fact that another Federal census\n     nould not be taken until 1940, and that as a\n     consequence no other county would come within\n     the terms of the Act for a period of rive\n     years after its adoption. We must presume,\n     therefore, that it was intended by the Legis-\n     lature that said Act should apply only to El\n     Paso County during said period of time. As\n     a matter Of fact, no other county met the\n     population requirements of the Act under the\n     1940.census, and as a consequence El Paso\n     County is the only county that will be affect-\n     ed thereby until after 1950,\n\f.\n\n\n\n\n    Hon. J. Y. Boyd - Page 5   (V-225)\n\n\n              We are therefore met at the outset with\n         a law which, under facts well known at the\n         time of its adoption, was applicable only to\n         a single county. Clearly then it is a local\n         law and must fall as such, unless it can be\n         fairly said that the class so s'egregatedby\n         the Act is a substantial class and has char-\n         acteristics legitimately distinguishing it\n         from the remainder of the State so as to require\n         legislation peculiar thereto. In this instance\n         the olassification is made to rest entirely on\n         the population of the county and a city therein.\n         Resort to population brackets for the purpose of\n         classifying subjects for legislation is permis-\n         sible where the spread of population is broad\n         enough to include or segregate a substantial\n         class, and where the population bears some real\n         relation to the subject of legislation and affords\n         a fair basis for the classification. It has been\n         legitimately employed in fixing fees of offices\n         in certain cases (Clark v. Finley, Comptroller,\n         93 Tex.~l'll,178, 54 S.W. 343), but even then it\n         is permissible only where the spread of population\n         is substantial and is sufficient to include a real\n         class with characteristics which reasonably dis-\n         tinguish it from others as applied to the contem-\n         plated legislation, and affords a fair basis for\n         the olassification~ Bexsr County v.

St., rorbia-\n     ding the Legislature to pass any law regulating\n    .~theaffairs of any such county, creating offices\n     or prescribing the power or duties of officers\n     in counties.\n          “Point 3 challenges the court's action in\n     giving the peremptory instruction and refusing\n     to enjoin the county treasurer and county audi-\n     tor of Jefferson County from issuing, register-\n     ing and paying the salary of the purchasing\n     agent for said county aocording to the provis-\n     ions of Sec. 4(a) of said bill, because the bill\n     is unconstitutional in that Sec. 4(a), having\n     reference to the creation and payment of a county\n     purchasing agent, applies to the 1940 Federal\n     census so that all other counties are excluded\n     and Jefferson County only comes within such pro-\n     visions and so counties or lesser or greater\n     population are not permitted to exercise the\n     power of appointing a purchasing agent. That by\n     reason..ofsuch situation Sec. 4(a) is arbitrary and\n     discriminatory and but a local or special law pas-\n     sed under the guise of the general statute and\n     violative of Art.

This mistaken assump-\n     tion proceeds from a failure to note that\n     population has been sustained as a basis for\n     olassification only in those instances where\n     it bore a reasonable relation to the objects\n     and purposes of the law and was founded upon\n     rational difference in the necessities or\n     conditions of the groups subjected to dirrer-\n     ent laws. Where it has been determined that.\n\fHan, J. Y. Boyd - Page 4   (V-225)\n\n\n     considering the objects and purposes of the\n     law, differences in population afford no ra-\n     tional basis for discriminating between groups\n     of the same natural class, classification on\n     the basis of population has been termed arbi-\n     trary selection, and the law has been held to\n     be special and local. Randolph v.

Ct.) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">:\n          \"It will be noted that the Act in question\n     by its terms is made applicable only in those\n     counties having a population of not less than\n     125,000 nor more than 175,000 inhabitants, and\n     containing a city having a population of not\n     less than 90,000 inhabitants, as shown by the\n     last preceding Federal census, The evidence\n     shows, without dispute, that the only county\n     within the State.coming within the provisions\n     of the Act at the time of its adoption was El\n     Paso county. The Legislature was doubtless\n     cognizant of this fact. It was also oogni-\n     zant Of the fact that another Federal census\n     nould not be taken until 1940, and that as a\n     consequence no other county would come within\n     the terms of the Act for a period of rive\n     years after its adoption. We must presume,\n     therefore, that it was intended by the Legis-\n     lature that said Act should apply only to El\n     Paso County during said period of time. As\n     a matter Of fact, no other county met the\n     population requirements of the Act under the\n     1940.census, and as a consequence El Paso\n     County is the only county that will be affect-\n     ed thereby until after 1950,\n\f.\n\n\n\n\n    Hon. J. Y. Boyd - Page 5   (V-225)\n\n\n              We are therefore met at the outset with\n         a law which, under facts well known at the\n         time of its adoption, was applicable only to\n         a single county. Clearly then it is a local\n         law and must fall as such, unless it can be\n         fairly said that the class so s'egregatedby\n         the Act is a substantial class and has char-\n         acteristics legitimately distinguishing it\n         from the remainder of the State so as to require\n         legislation peculiar thereto. In this instance\n         the olassification is made to rest entirely on\n         the population of the county and a city therein.\n         Resort to population brackets for the purpose of\n         classifying subjects for legislation is permis-\n         sible where the spread of population is broad\n         enough to include or segregate a substantial\n         class, and where the population bears some real\n         relation to the subject of legislation and affords\n         a fair basis for the classification. It has been\n         legitimately employed in fixing fees of offices\n         in certain cases (Clark v.
