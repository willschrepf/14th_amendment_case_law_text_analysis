The definition of “classroom teacher,” set out in W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1\n\n(2009) (Repl. Vol. 2016), is not intended to include within its meaning an “interventionist,”\n\nwho provides instruction to an individual student or a small group of students for the purpose\n\nof intervening in the education of students who are deficient in one or more particular\n\nsubjects.\n\n\n\n              2.     Pursuant to 126 W. Va. C.S.R. §§ 72-2.5.c & d (2015) and 126 W. Va.\n\nC.S.R. § 72-3.13 (2015), a county board of education may contract with its Regional\n\nEducation Service Agency (RESA) for the provision of interventionist services to its\n\nstudents.\n\n\n\n\n                                              i\n\fDavis, Justice:\n\n              In this case, the Monongalia County Board of Education challenges a ruling\n\nby the Circuit Court of Monongalia County that found a county board of education could not\n\ncontract with a Regional Education Service Agency (“RESA”) to provide educational\n\ninterventionists to county elementary and middle school students when those interventionists\n\nare hired by the West Virginia Board of Education (“State Board”) operating through a\n\nRESA. The circuit court rested its conclusion on its determination that an interventionist met\n\nthe statutory definition of a teacher and, therefore, must be directly hired by a county board\n\nof education. After reviewing the parties’ briefs1 and hearing their oral arguments, and\n\nhaving also considered the relevant law, we find the legislative scheme for the RESA\n\nprogram evidences a legislative intent that county boards be authorized to contract with\n\nRESAs to provide interventionist services to county students; therefore, we reverse the circuit\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n              1\n                We acknowledge the contribution of the following amici curiae who filed\nbriefs in this case: The West Virginia Board of Education; The West Virginia Regional\nEducation Service Agencies; West Virginia Association of School Administrators; West\nVirginia School Board Association; West Virginia Education Association; The West Virginia\nSchool Service Personnel Association; and The West Virginia AFL-CIO. We value the\nparticipation of the amici and will consider their briefs in conjunction with the parties’\narguments.\n\n                                              1\n\n\f                                                I.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n                 The dispute in this case arises from the use of educational interventionists to\n\nassist school children in Monongalia County who need educational support beyond that\n\nprovided by the regular classroom teacher, i.e., tutoring, in the subjects of reading and math.\n\nThe Monongalia County Board of Education (“MCBOE”) asserts that by utilizing\n\ninterventionists it is able to provide supportive program-based instruction to over three\n\nhundred struggling elementary and middle school students each year. According to the\n\ncircuit court,\n\n                 19.\t   “Interventionists” provide personalized training to\n                        students who are struggling in reading and math. They\n                        are used to supplement the normal lesson plan of the\n                        child’s regular teacher. The children remain in the class\n                        for a portion of the lesson and then are either pulled from\n                        the class or segregated within the classroom to receive\n                        supplemental instruction from the “Interventionist.”\n\n                 20.\t   . . . . Most [interventionists] are assigned to one school\n                        and work as little as two and a half hours, or as much as\n                        six hours a day. . . .\n\n                 21.\t   “Interventionists” are paid twenty-five dollars ($25.00)\n                        per hour, regardless of their level of training or\n                        experience. They do not receive benefits such as health\n                        insurance, retirement, paid lunch breaks, or planning\n                        periods. They are at-will employees and have no right or\n                        expectation of being rehired from year to year.\n\n                 22.\t   The method used to fill “Interventionist” positions begins\n                        when the job is posted on the RESA VII website. The\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\f                     main requirement for this position is that the individual\n                     be a certified teacher.\n\n              23.\t   At times, RESA VII employees interview the applicant,\n                     and other times, both MCBOE and RESA VII employees\n                     conduct joint interviews. The hiring decision is\n                     ultimately made by the RESA VII Director.\n\nThe MCBOE explains that the support provided to a student by an interventionist is designed\n\nby the student’s teacher, school psychologist, and academic coach, among others, to\n\nintervene in a student’s education before the student has failed a subject. Accordingly,\n\ninterventionists do not engage in planning, grading, assessment, parent communication, or\n\nother responsibilities carried out by classroom teachers. Interventionists are, however,\n\nrequired to be certified teachers.\n\n\n\n              The interventionists utilized by MCBOE are obtained through a contract it has\n\nwith its RESA,2 which is RESA VII. The interventionists hired by RESA VII3 are employees\n\nof the State Board. The MCBOE contracts with RESA VII to provide the services of\n\n\n\n\n              2\n              Regional Education Service Agencies (“RESAs”) are established by statute\nand implemented by the State Board pursuant to W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 (2002) (Repl. Vol.\n2012). Accord W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 (2015) (Repl. Vol. 2016). There are eight separate\nregions in West Virginia, which each have a designated RESA. Monongalia County is one\nof several counties in RESA VII.\n              3\n             RESA VII’s “Strategic Plan,” which is approved by the State Board,\nauthorizes RESA VII to employ interventionists.\n\n                                             3\n\n\finterventionists in schools eligible for Title I services.4 In schools not eligible for Title I\n\nfunding, the services of interventionists also are obtained through a contract with RESA VII,\n\nbut the interventionists’ services are paid for through the MCBOE’s General Fund.5\n\n\n\n              Relevant to the instant dispute, during a board meeting on September 27, 2011,\n\nMCBOE approved the expenditure of Title I funds to contract with RESA VII for the\n\nservices of four interventionists, each to be assigned to a specific Title I qualifying school.\n\n              4\n                  According to the website of the West Virginia Department of Education,\n\n              Title I provides financial assistance to LEAs (Local Educational\n              Agencies) and schools with high numbers or percentages of poor\n              children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state\n              academic standards. LEAs target Title I funds to schools with\n              the highest percentages of children from low-income families.\n              Unless a participating school is operating a schoolwide program,\n              the school must focus Title I services on children who are\n              failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet state academic\n              standards. Schools in which poor children make up at least 40\n              percent of enrollment are eligible to use Title I funds for\n              schoolwide programs to serve all children in the school. LEAs\n              also must offer to utilize Title I funds to provide academic\n              enrichment services to eligible children enrolled in private\n              schools.\n\nhttps://wvde.state.wv.us/titlei/ (last visited October 24, 2016). The MCBOE explains that\nTitle I funds are distributed as formula grants by the federal government. Moreover, “[a]\nRESA is eligible as a local education agency (LEA) to participate in partnership with or on\nbehalf of any county school system or school in those programs that will accomplish\nimplementation of the strategic plan and/or state education initiative.” 126 W. Va. C.S.R.\n§ 72-2.5 (2010). Accord 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-2.5.d (2015).\n              5\n              The MCBOE avers that the “General Fund” to which it refers does not include\nexcess levy funds.\n\n                                              4\n\n\fIn addition, MCBOE approved expenditures from its General Fund to contract with RESA\n\nVII for additional interventionists to serve generally at elementary and middle schools in\n\nMonongalia County. According to MCBOE, approximately thirty interventionists provided\n\nservices to Monongalia County students during the 2011-2012 school year.6\n\n\n\n               In or around December 2011, the American Federation of Teachers – West\n\nVirginia, AFL-CIO (“AFT”), respondents herein, filed in the Circuit Court of Monongalia\n\nCounty a petition for writ of mandamus, naming MCBOE as the respondent, in which they\n\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief.        AFT essentially sought a declaration that\n\ninterventionists are classroom teachers that must be hired by MCBOE, and an injunction to\n\nprevent MCBOE from obtaining interventionists through a contract with RESA VII. After\n\na period of discovery, the parties presented cross motions for summary judgment. On\n\nJanuary 14, 2014, the circuit court denied the motions. The circuit court then allowed the\n\nparties additional time to address questions of fact that had been identified in the court’s prior\n\norder.   These questions pertained to the role and responsibilities of interventionists.\n\nThereafter, following additional discovery, the parties again filed cross motions for summary\n\njudgment. By order entered June 9, 2015, the circuit court granted AFT’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment and denied MCBOE’s motion. In doing so, the circuit court reluctantly\n\n\n\n               6\n               The BOE asserts that interventionists who provided satisfactory service in\nprior school years were afforded the opportunity to be re-employed in subsequent years.\n\n                                                5\n\n\fconcluded that an interventionist met the statutory definition of “classroom teacher”;\n\ntherefore, the position had to be filled through direct employment by MCBOE in accordance\n\nwith the statutory requirements pertaining to hiring and employment of classroom teachers.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                               II.\n\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n               Although the circuit court did not render its final order in the context of the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus that was sought by AFT, it implicitly granted the requested\n\nwrit by granting summary judgment in favor of AFT.                 Likewise, the circuit court\n\nconnotatively declared that MCBOE is prohibited from contracting with RESA VII to obtain\n\nthe services of interventionists and enjoined it from continuing the practice. Thus, our\n\nstandard for reviewing the lower court’s rulings in this appeal is multifaceted.\n\n\n\n               It has been made clear that, “[t]o invoke mandamus the relator must show (1)\n\na clear right to the relief sought; (2) a legal duty on the part of the respondent to do the thing\n\nrelator seeks; and (3) the absence of another adequate remedy.” Syl. pt. 2, Myers v. Barte,\n\n167 W. Va. 194, 279 S.E.2d 406 (1981). This is so because\n\n                      “‘[m]andamus lies to require the discharge by a public\n               officer of a nondiscretionary duty.’ Point 3 Syllabus, State ex\n               rel.

Our review of the circuit court’s grant of\n\nmandamus relief is de novo: “A de novo standard of review applies to a circuit court’s\n\ndecision to grant or deny a writ of mandamus.” Syl. pt. 1, Harrison Cty. Comm’n v. Harrison\n\nCty. Assessor, 222 W. Va. 25, 658 S.E.2d 555 (2008).\n\n\n\n              Because this appeal comes to this Court from an order granting summary\n\njudgment, we also exercise plenary review of that ruling: “A circuit court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment is reviewed de novo.” Syl. pt. 1, Painter v. Peavy, 192 W. Va. 189, 451 S.E.2d 755\n\n(1994). In carrying out our plenary review, we bear in mind that “[a] motion for summary\n\njudgment should be granted only when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of fact to be\n\ntried and inquiry concerning the facts is not desirable to clarify the application of the law.”\n\nSyl. pt. 3, Aetna Cas. & Sur.

Comm’r, 159 W. Va. 108, 219 S.E.2d 361 (1975). To determine the\n\nlegislative intent and thereby decide the question herein presented, we first look to statutory\n\nprovisions related to teachers to discern whether an interventionist meets the definition of a\n\nclassroom teacher.

Finally, we determine which law applies to the instant dispute.\n\n\n\n              In our examination of the statutory and regulatory provisions relevant to this\n\nmatter, we are mindful of the fundamental principles of statutory construction that must be\n\napplied. Namely, we recognize that, in order to glean legislative intent, “[w]e look first to\n\nthe statute’s language. If the text, given its plain meaning, answers the interpretive question,\n\n\n                                               9\n\n\fthe language must prevail and further inquiry is foreclosed.” Appalachian Power Co. v.

Interventionists as Classroom Teachers\n\n              The term “interventionist” is not defined in the West Virginia Code.\n\nAccordingly, in order to determine whether an interventionist is the statutory equivalent of\n\na teacher, we begin with an examination of the definition of a teacher. The statutory\n\ndefinition of a classroom teacher is found in W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1(c)(1) (2009) (Repl. Vol.\n\n2016), which defines the term as follows:\n\n                      (c) “Professional educator” has the same meaning as\n              “teacher” as defined in section one [§ 18-1-1], article one,\n              chapter eighteen of this code. Professional educators are\n              classified as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\n\f                      (1) “Classroom teacher” means a professional educator\n               who has a direct instructional or counseling relationship with\n               students and who spends the majority of his or her time in this\n               capacity[.]\n\n(Emphasis added). The foregoing statute plainly demonstrates that “classroom teacher” is\n\na subclassification of “professional educator.” The term “professional educator,” in turn,\n\nbears the same meaning as the term “teacher,” which is defined in W. Va. Code § 18-1-1(g)\n\n(2012) (Repl. Vol. 2016). Pursuant to W. Va. Code § 18-1-1(g), “‘[t]eacher’ means a\n\nteacher, supervisor, principal, superintendent, public school librarian or any other person\n\nregularly employed for instructional purposes in a public school in this state.” (Emphasis\n\nadded). Although the term “instructional,” which is used in the foregoing definitions of both\n\n“teacher” and “classroom teacher,” is not statutorily defined, we are to give the term its\n\ncommon, ordinary meaning. See Syl. pt. 1, Miners in Gen. Grp. v. Hix, 123 W. Va. 637, 17\n\nS.E.2d 810 (1941) (“In the absence of any definition of the intended meaning of words or\n\nterms used in a legislative enactment, they will, in the interpretation of the act, be given their\n\ncommon, ordinary and accepted meaning in the connection in which they are used.”),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Lee–Norse Co. v. Rutledge, 170 W. Va. 162, 291 S.E.2d 477\n\n(1982). The common, ordinary, and accepted meaning of “instructional” is “[o]f or\n\npertaining to instruction or teaching; educational. . . . Conveying instruction or information.”\n\nVII The Oxford English Dictionary 1050 (2d ed. 1989).\n\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\n\f              Thus, as pointed out by AFT, strictly applying7 the foregoing definitions results\n\nin the inevitable conclusion that an interventionist meets the statutory definition of a\n\nclassroom teacher, because an interventionist has a “direct instructional . . . relationship with\n\nstudents,” albeit in a form more akin to tutoring than to classroom instruction, and “spends\n\nthe majority of his or her time in this capacity.” W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1(c)(1). See, e.g.,\n\nHarmon v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Educ., 205 W. Va. 125, 130, 516 S.E.2d 748, 753 (1999)\n\n(observing that “the degree to which a professional educator directly works with students,\n\nregardless of the location of such work–and the suitability of alternative classifications–are\n\ntwo important factors in determining whether a professional educator should be classified\n\nas a classroom teacher” (footnote omitted)); Putnam Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Andrews, 198\n\nW. Va. 403, 408, 481 S.E.2d 498, 503 (1996) (concluding that educational diagnostician who\n\n“spent the majority of her time working directly with students (administering tests) and\n\nchairing PAC meetings at which the results of these tests were presented and suggestions\n\nbased on their results were implemented” was classroom teacher).\n\n\n\n\n              7\n               We recognize, however, MCBOE’s assertion that the definitions referred to\nare not exclusive insofar as the relevant statutes contain a qualification. See W. Va. Code\n§ 18A-1-1 (2009) (Repl. Vol. 2016) (“The definitions contained in section one [§ 18-1-1],\narticle one, chapter eighteen of this code apply to this chapter. In addition, the following\nwords used in this chapter and in any proceedings pursuant to this chapter have the meanings\nascribed to them unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning.” (emphasis\nadded)); W. Va. Code § 18-1-1 (2012) (Repl. Vol. 2016) (“The following words used in this\nchapter and in any proceedings pursuant thereto have the meanings ascribed to them unless\nthe context clearly indicates a different meaning.” (emphasis added)).\n\n                                               12\n\n\f              Notably, if interventionists are designated as “classroom teachers,” then\n\npursuant to W. Va. Code § 18A-2-1(a) (2013) (Repl. Vol. 2016),8 it does appear to be\n\nmandatory that they be hired by a county board of education: “The employment of\n\nprofessional personnel shall be made by the board only upon nomination and\n\nrecommendation of the superintendent . . . .” (Emphasis added). See Syl. pt. 1, E.H. v.\n\nMatin, 201 W. Va. 463, 498 S.E.2d 35 (1997) (“‘It is well established that the word “shall,”\n\nin the absence of language in the statute showing a contrary intent on the part of the\n\nLegislature, should be afforded a mandatory connotation.’ Syllabus Point 1, Nelson v. West\n\nVirginia Public Employees Insurance Board, 171 W. Va. 445, 300 S.E.2d 86 (1982).”). See\n\nalso W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1(a) (defining “School personnel,” which includes “classroom\n\nteacher[s],” as “all personnel employed by a county board . . . .” (emphasis added)).\n\nSimilarly, W. Va. Code § 18A-2-2(a) (2016) (Repl. Vol. 2016)9 provides, in relevant part,\n\nthat “[b]efore entering upon their duties, all teachers shall execute a contract with their\n\ncounty boards . . . .” (Emphasis added). See State ex rel. Boner v. Kanawha Cty. Bd. of\n\nEduc., 197 W. Va. 176, 184, 475 S.E.2d 176, 184 (1996) (“West Virginia Code § 18A-2-2\n\n\n              8\n               Although the cited version of W. Va.

Va. 363, 373, 275 S.E.2d 908, 915 (1980) (“The relation between the county board of\n\neducation and school teachers is a contractual one. If the board wishes to hire a teacher it\n\nmust do so by means of a written contract.” (citing W. Va. Code § 18A-2-2; additional\n\ncitation omitted)).\n\n\n\n              Nevertheless, we must continue our analysis by considering the provisions\n\npertaining to the role of RESAs and determining whether that role, as it pertains to\n\ninterventionists, is compatible with the statutory definition of a classroom teacher.\n\n\n\n                       B. Interventionists under RESA Provisions\n\n              RESAs are established by W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 (2015) (Repl. Vol. 2016).10\n\nThe Legislature has expressly stated its intent for establishing RESAs thusly: “The intent of\n\nthe Legislature in providing for establishment of [RESAs], hereinafter referred to in this\n\nsection as agency or agencies, is to provide for high quality, cost effective education\n\nprograms and services to students, schools and school systems.” W. Va. Code § 18-2-26(a)\n\n\n\n              10\n                The version of W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 in effect during the time relevant to\nthis dispute was enacted in 2002. However, the portions of the statute upon which we rely\nare substantively the same in both the 2002 and 2015 versions. See W. Va. Code § 18-2-26\n(2002) (Repl. Vol. 2012).\n\n                                             14\n\n\f(emphasis added). Plainly, then, the Legislature expressly intended for RESAs to provide,\n\namong other things, high quality, cost effective education services to students. The evidence\n\npresented in this case demonstrates that interventionists provide high quality and cost\n\neffective educational services to students. As to quality, we note that interventionists\n\nproviding contracted services through a RESA must have the same licensure as educators\n\nemployed directly by county boards of education. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 136-7.1.b.6\n\n(2016).11   Additionally, with respect to the cost-effective aspect of utilizing RESA\n\ninterventionists, the circuit court concluded that\n\n              [t]he opportunity to deploy multiple part-time interventionists,\n              rather than a fewer number of regular full-time employees,\n              results in the ability to offer services to a significantly greater\n              number of students during a school day. . . . This circumstance\n              exists by virtue of greater flexibility in scheduling multiple\n              interventionists in more than one classroom during the same\n              time period.\n\n(Quotations and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n              11\n                Pursuant to 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 136-7.1.b.6 (2016), “[c]ontracted or RESA\nServices. – The county superintendent shall assure that an educator providing contracted\nservices or services through a RESA holds the same licensure required for an educator\nemployed by a board of education.” This identical language also appears in earlier versions\nof the Code of State Rules. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 136-7.1.2.f (2012, 2011, & 2010). The\nState Board, as amicus curiae, further explained in its brief that “[m]any of the persons hired\nas interventionists are retired teachers or those new to the teaching profession that desire a\npart-time work schedule.”\n\n                                              15\n\n\f              The Legislature also has expressly stated its purpose for establishing RESAs,\n\nwhich includes its vision that RESAs would assist the State Board in implementing programs\n\nand services as directed by that body:\n\n                     In establishing the agencies [RESAs] the Legislature\n              envisions certain areas of service in which [RESAs] can best\n              assist the state board in implementing the standards based\n              accountability model pursuant to subsection (a) of this section\n              and, thereby, in providing high quality education programs.\n              These areas of service include the following:\n\n                     ....\n\n                     (6) Developing and/or implementing any other programs\n              or services as directed by law, the state board or the regional\n              council.\n\nW. Va. Code § 18-2-26(b) (emphasis added). Moreover, the Legislature has mandated that\n\nthe State Board promulgate rules for the establishment and operation of RESAs: “[t]he state\n\nboard shall reexamine the powers and duties of [RESAs] in light of the changes in state level\n\neducation policy that have occurred and shall establish multicounty regional education\n\nservice agencies by rule, promulgated in accordance with the provisions of article three-b [§§\n\n29A-3B-1 et seq.], chapter twenty-nine-a of this code.”12 W. Va. Code § 18-2-26(c)\n\n(emphasis added). In accordance with its duty to do so, the State Board promulgated\n\n\n\n\n              12\n              W. Va.

See 126\n\nW. Va. C.S.R. § 72.\n\n\n\n              Among the various legislative rules governing RESAs is one that expressly\n\nauthorizes RESAs to employ staff “to perform services described in the Strategic Plan or to\n\noperate . . . projects that may require staff and support services for effective implementation.”\n\n126 W.

Developing and/or implementing any other\n              programs or services as directed by law or by the WVBE.\n\nThe amended version of the above quoted provision is found at 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.1.f\n(2015). Although the language used in the first paragraph of the 2015 version of this\n                                                                            (continued...)\n\n                                               18\n\n\femploy staff to perform services described in the Strategic Plan, and require RESAs to\n\nimplement programs or services as directed by law or by the State Board, it is noteworthy\n\nthat strategic plans developed by RESAs must be approved by the State Board. See 126\n\nW. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4.16\n\n\n\n              Clearly then, under the foregoing provisions, the use of interventionists is in\n\naccordance with the authority granted to a RESA to employ staff to perform certain services\n\nsuch as those outlined in its Strategic Plan. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-3.13; 126 W. Va.\n\nC.S.R. § 72-5.1.6. The RESA VII Strategic Plan for the 2011-2012 school year, which,\n\nnecessarily, was approved by the State Board, contains a specific provision for employing\n\ninterventionists:\n\n              Employ certified regional providers (interventionists, OTs, PTs,\n              SLPs, academic and job coaches[)] to provide services as set\n              forth by Individual Education Programs and School\n              Improvement Grants for students within RESA 7.\n\n              15\n                (...continued)\nregulation is somewhat different than that quoted above, the regulation still requires RESAs\nto develop and/or implement programs or services as directed by law or by the State Board.\n\n              16\n                126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4 (2010) provides that “[e]ach RESA shall submit,\nwith recommendations from and approval by a majority vote of the regional council, the\nStrategic Plan to the WVDE [West Virginia Department of Education] by October 1 of each\nyear for approval by the WVBE [State Board] . . . .” (Emphasis added). Similarly, 126\nW. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4 (2015) declares that “[e]ach RESA shall submit, with\nrecommendations from and approval by a majority vote of the regional council, the Strategic\nPlan to the WVBE [State Board] staff by October 1 of each year for approval by the WVBE\n[State Board]. . . .” (Emphasis added).\n\n                                             19\n\n\fRESA VII Strategic Plan § 3.4. (2011-2012) (emphasis added).17 Therefore, insofar as the\n\nState Board approved the RESA VII Strategic Plan, it rationally follows that the provision\n\nof interventionists is a service RESA VII is directed by the State Board to provide. This\n\nconclusion is in accord with the legislative rule requiring liberal construction of the\n\nprovisions pertaining to RESAs. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72.2.8 (2010) (“All functions of\n\nthe RESAs shall be liberally construed to effectuate the intent of the WVBE [State Board].”18\n\n\n\n              Finally, we observe that, in carrying out duties such as the provision of\n\ninterventionists, RESAs are expressly empowered to contract with and receive funds from\n\ncounty boards of education:\n\n                      RESAs are empowered to contract with county boards of\n              education, the West Virginia Department of Education\n              (hereinafter WVDE), persons, companies, or other agencies to\n              implement their Strategic Plan (see Section 5.3). A RESA is\n              eligible as a local education agency (LEA)[19] to participate in\n              partnership with or on behalf of any county school system or\n\n\n              17\n                Likewise, the RESA VII Strategic Plan for the 2016-2017 school year\nprovides that RESAs may “[e]mploy certified regional providers (interventionists, OTs, PTs,\nSLPs, school psychologists and job coaches) to provide services as set forth by Individual\nEducation Programs and School Improvement Grants for students within RESA 7.” RESA\nVII Strategic Plan § 3.4. (2016-2017) (emphasis added).\n              18\n                This provision is now found at 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72.2.6 (2015), and states\nthat “[a]ll functions, powers, and duties of the RESAs shall be liberally construed to\neffectuate the intent of the WVBE [State Board].”\n              19\n                As explained in footnote 4, supra, and its accompanying text, Title I provides\nfinancial assistance to LEAs. Where possible, Title I funds are used to provide the\ninterventionists at issue in this case.\n\n                                             20\n\n\f              school in those programs that will accomplish implementation\n              of the strategic plan and/or state education initiative.\n\n126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-2.5 (2010) (emphasis and footnote added).20 With respect to\n\nreceiving funds, 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-4.4 (2010) provides that\n\n                     [a] RESA may receive and disburse funds\n              from . . . member counties, . . . the funds of which will\n              contribute to RESA initiatives. Each RESA is encouraged to\n              partner with member school systems, particularly those\n              designated as low-performing, and other organizations as\n              appropriate to attract and leverage resources available from\n              federal programs to maximize its capacity for meeting the needs\n              of member schools and school systems . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added).21 See also W. Va. Code § 18-2-26(h) (authorizing RESAs to “receive and\n\ndisburse funds from . . . member counties”).22\n\n\n\n              To summarize, the plain language of the foregoing statutes and legislative rules\n\npertaining to RESAs demonstrate that the Legislature intended for RESAs to be enabled to\n\nprovide, among other things, interventionist services to county boards of education through\n\ncontracts with the county boards.\n\n\n              20\n                This provision is found in the 2015 version of the regulations at 126 W. Va.\nC.S.R. §§ 72-2.5.c & d with slight language differences that would not change the outcome\nof our decision in this case.\n              21\n                The language of the 2015 version of 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-4.4 is\nsubstantially the same as that quoted above.\n              22\n                Although the 2002 version of W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 was in effect during the\ntime relevant to this dispute, the above quoted language is identical in both the 2002 and the\n2015 versions of this statute. See supra note 10.\n\n                                             21\n\n\f                                     C. Governing Law\n\n              Based upon the analyses set out above, this Court is now faced with two\n\nlegislative schemes applicable to interventionists: one governing classroom teachers and one\n\ngoverning RESAs. Under the statutory provisions pertaining to classroom teachers, an\n\ninterventionist must be employed by a county board of education. On the other hand, the\n\nRESA provisions allow county boards to contract with RESAs to obtain interventionist\n\nservices for their students. Thus, while both legislative schemes are applicable, they also are\n\ninconsistent and irreconcilable.\n\n\n\n              We find that the rules of statutory construction favor application of the RESA\n\nscheme to this matter. This Court has observed that, “‘where two distinct statutes stand in\n\npari materia, and sections thereof are in irreconcilable conflict, that section must prevail\n\nwhich can properly be considered as the last expression of the law making power . . . .’ State\n\nex rel. Pinson v. Varney, 142 W. Va. 105, 109, 96 S.E.2d 72, 74 (1956).” Stanley v.\n\nDepartment of Tax & Revenue, 217 W. Va. 65, 71, 614 S.E.2d 712, 718 (2005). Under this\n\ndoctrine, the RESA scheme prevails because the statute establishing RESAs was last\n\namended in 2015, and the legislative rules governing RESAs also were last amended in 2015.\n\nMoreover, the RESA strategic plans, such as the RESA VII strategic plan that specifically\n\nprovides for the hiring and use of interventionists, are approved by the State Board on an\n\nannual basis. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4 (2010) (establishing that “[e]ach RESA shall\n\n\n                                              22\n\n\fsubmit . . . the Strategic Plan to the WVDE [West Virginia Department of Education] by\n\nOctober 1 of each year for approval by the [State Board]. . . .”). See also 126 W. Va. C.S.R.\n\n§ 72-5.4 (2015) (providing that “[e]ach RESA shall submit . . . the Strategic Plan to the [State\n\nBoard] staff by October 1 of each year for approval by the [State Board]. . . .”). Conversely,\n\nthe statute setting out the definition of the term “classroom teacher” was last amended in\n\n2009.\n\n\n\n              In addition, it is well established that\n\n              “[t]he general rule of statutory construction requires that a\n              specific statute be given precedence over a general statute\n              relating to the same subject matter where the two cannot be\n              reconciled.” Syl. pt. 6, Carvey v. West Virginia State Bd. of\n              Educ., 206 W. Va. 720, 527 S.E.2d 831 (1999) (internal\n              quotations and citations omitted). See also In re Chevie V., 226\n              W. Va. 363, 371, 700 S.E.2d 815, 823 (2010) (“As a rule, when\n              both a specific and a general statute apply to a given case, the\n              specific statute governs.”).\n\nTeets v. Miller, 237 W. Va. 473, ___, 788 S.E.2d 1, 12 (2016). In the case sub judice, the\n\nvarious RESA provisions provide the more specific law in that they specifically address the\n\nissues herein raised, i.e., granting authority for RESAs to both employ individuals to provide\n\nservices to school children and to enter contracts with county boards of education.\n\nFurthermore, the relevant rules require incorporation of the State Board approved RESA\n\nstrategic plan, which, in this instance, expressly provides for interventionists. The foundation\n\nfor the argument that interventionists must be considered classroom teachers, on the other\n\n\n                                              23\n\n\fhand, rests solely upon W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1(c)(1), a statute that simply defines the term\n\n“classroom teacher” and contains no provision expressly pertaining to interventionists.\n\n\n\n              Accordingly, based upon the analysis set out in this opinion, we now hold that\n\nthe definition of “classroom teacher,” set out in W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1 (2009) (Repl. Vol.\n\n2016), is not intended to include within its meaning an “interventionist,” who provides\n\ninstruction to an individual student or a small group of students for the purpose of\n\nintervening in the education of students who are deficient in one or more particular subjects.\n\nIn addition, we hold that, pursuant to 126 W. Va. C.S.R. §§ 72-2.5.c & d (2015) and 126\n\nW. Va. C.S.R. § 72-3.13 (2015),23 a county board of education may contract with its Regional\n\nEducation Service Agency (RESA) for the provision of interventionist services to its\n\nstudents.\n\n\n\n                                             IV.\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n              For the reasons set out in the body of this opinion, we conclude that the\n\nlegislative scheme for the RESA program evidences a legislative intent that county boards\n\n\n\n\n              23\n                Although we utilize current versions of the Code of State Rules in our holding\nfor ease of reference, our decision applies equally to the earlier versions of the Rules\ndiscussed in the body of the opinion.\n\n                                             24\n\n\fbe authorized to contract with RESAs to provide interventionist services to county students.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the June 24, 2015, order of the Circuit Court of Monongalia County.\n\n\n\n                                                                                 Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\n\f",

The definition of “classroom teacher,” set out in W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1\n\n(2009) (Repl. Vol. 2016), is not intended to include within its meaning an “interventionist,”\n\nwho provides instruction to an individual student or a small group of students for the purpose\n\nof intervening in the education of students who are deficient in one or more particular\n\nsubjects.\n\n\n\n              2.     Pursuant to 126 W. Va. C.S.R. §§ 72-2.5.c & d (2015) and 126 W. Va.\n\nC.S.R. § 72-3.13 (2015), a county board of education may contract with its Regional\n\nEducation Service Agency (RESA) for the provision of interventionist services to its\n\nstudents.\n\n\n\n\n                                              i\n\fDavis, Justice:\n\n              In this case, the Monongalia County Board of Education challenges a ruling\n\nby the Circuit Court of Monongalia County that found a county board of education could not\n\ncontract with a Regional Education Service Agency (“RESA”) to provide educational\n\ninterventionists to county elementary and middle school students when those interventionists\n\nare hired by the West Virginia Board of Education (“State Board”) operating through a\n\nRESA. The circuit court rested its conclusion on its determination that an interventionist met\n\nthe statutory definition of a teacher and, therefore, must be directly hired by a county board\n\nof education. After reviewing the parties’ briefs1 and hearing their oral arguments, and\n\nhaving also considered the relevant law, we find the legislative scheme for the RESA\n\nprogram evidences a legislative intent that county boards be authorized to contract with\n\nRESAs to provide interventionist services to county students; therefore, we reverse the circuit\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n\n              1\n                We acknowledge the contribution of the following amici curiae who filed\nbriefs in this case: The West Virginia Board of Education; The West Virginia Regional\nEducation Service Agencies; West Virginia Association of School Administrators; West\nVirginia School Board Association; West Virginia Education Association; The West Virginia\nSchool Service Personnel Association; and The West Virginia AFL-CIO. We value the\nparticipation of the amici and will consider their briefs in conjunction with the parties’\narguments.\n\n                                              1\n\n\f                                                I.\n\n\n                        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n                 The dispute in this case arises from the use of educational interventionists to\n\nassist school children in Monongalia County who need educational support beyond that\n\nprovided by the regular classroom teacher, i.e., tutoring, in the subjects of reading and math.\n\nThe Monongalia County Board of Education (“MCBOE”) asserts that by utilizing\n\ninterventionists it is able to provide supportive program-based instruction to over three\n\nhundred struggling elementary and middle school students each year. According to the\n\ncircuit court,\n\n                 19.\t   “Interventionists” provide personalized training to\n                        students who are struggling in reading and math. They\n                        are used to supplement the normal lesson plan of the\n                        child’s regular teacher. The children remain in the class\n                        for a portion of the lesson and then are either pulled from\n                        the class or segregated within the classroom to receive\n                        supplemental instruction from the “Interventionist.”\n\n                 20.\t   . . . . Most [interventionists] are assigned to one school\n                        and work as little as two and a half hours, or as much as\n                        six hours a day. . . .\n\n                 21.\t   “Interventionists” are paid twenty-five dollars ($25.00)\n                        per hour, regardless of their level of training or\n                        experience. They do not receive benefits such as health\n                        insurance, retirement, paid lunch breaks, or planning\n                        periods. They are at-will employees and have no right or\n                        expectation of being rehired from year to year.\n\n                 22.\t   The method used to fill “Interventionist” positions begins\n                        when the job is posted on the RESA VII website. The\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\f                     main requirement for this position is that the individual\n                     be a certified teacher.\n\n              23.\t   At times, RESA VII employees interview the applicant,\n                     and other times, both MCBOE and RESA VII employees\n                     conduct joint interviews. The hiring decision is\n                     ultimately made by the RESA VII Director.\n\nThe MCBOE explains that the support provided to a student by an interventionist is designed\n\nby the student’s teacher, school psychologist, and academic coach, among others, to\n\nintervene in a student’s education before the student has failed a subject. Accordingly,\n\ninterventionists do not engage in planning, grading, assessment, parent communication, or\n\nother responsibilities carried out by classroom teachers. Interventionists are, however,\n\nrequired to be certified teachers.\n\n\n\n              The interventionists utilized by MCBOE are obtained through a contract it has\n\nwith its RESA,2 which is RESA VII. The interventionists hired by RESA VII3 are employees\n\nof the State Board. The MCBOE contracts with RESA VII to provide the services of\n\n\n\n\n              2\n              Regional Education Service Agencies (“RESAs”) are established by statute\nand implemented by the State Board pursuant to W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 (2002) (Repl. Vol.\n2012). Accord W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 (2015) (Repl. Vol. 2016). There are eight separate\nregions in West Virginia, which each have a designated RESA. Monongalia County is one\nof several counties in RESA VII.\n              3\n             RESA VII’s “Strategic Plan,” which is approved by the State Board,\nauthorizes RESA VII to employ interventionists.\n\n                                             3\n\n\finterventionists in schools eligible for Title I services.4 In schools not eligible for Title I\n\nfunding, the services of interventionists also are obtained through a contract with RESA VII,\n\nbut the interventionists’ services are paid for through the MCBOE’s General Fund.5\n\n\n\n              Relevant to the instant dispute, during a board meeting on September 27, 2011,\n\nMCBOE approved the expenditure of Title I funds to contract with RESA VII for the\n\nservices of four interventionists, each to be assigned to a specific Title I qualifying school.\n\n              4\n                  According to the website of the West Virginia Department of Education,\n\n              Title I provides financial assistance to LEAs (Local Educational\n              Agencies) and schools with high numbers or percentages of poor\n              children to help ensure that all children meet challenging state\n              academic standards. LEAs target Title I funds to schools with\n              the highest percentages of children from low-income families.\n              Unless a participating school is operating a schoolwide program,\n              the school must focus Title I services on children who are\n              failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet state academic\n              standards. Schools in which poor children make up at least 40\n              percent of enrollment are eligible to use Title I funds for\n              schoolwide programs to serve all children in the school. LEAs\n              also must offer to utilize Title I funds to provide academic\n              enrichment services to eligible children enrolled in private\n              schools.\n\nhttps://wvde.state.wv.us/titlei/ (last visited October 24, 2016). The MCBOE explains that\nTitle I funds are distributed as formula grants by the federal government. Moreover, “[a]\nRESA is eligible as a local education agency (LEA) to participate in partnership with or on\nbehalf of any county school system or school in those programs that will accomplish\nimplementation of the strategic plan and/or state education initiative.” 126 W. Va. C.S.R.\n§ 72-2.5 (2010). Accord 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-2.5.d (2015).\n              5\n              The MCBOE avers that the “General Fund” to which it refers does not include\nexcess levy funds.\n\n                                              4\n\n\fIn addition, MCBOE approved expenditures from its General Fund to contract with RESA\n\nVII for additional interventionists to serve generally at elementary and middle schools in\n\nMonongalia County. According to MCBOE, approximately thirty interventionists provided\n\nservices to Monongalia County students during the 2011-2012 school year.6\n\n\n\n               In or around December 2011, the American Federation of Teachers – West\n\nVirginia, AFL-CIO (“AFT”), respondents herein, filed in the Circuit Court of Monongalia\n\nCounty a petition for writ of mandamus, naming MCBOE as the respondent, in which they\n\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief.        AFT essentially sought a declaration that\n\ninterventionists are classroom teachers that must be hired by MCBOE, and an injunction to\n\nprevent MCBOE from obtaining interventionists through a contract with RESA VII. After\n\na period of discovery, the parties presented cross motions for summary judgment. On\n\nJanuary 14, 2014, the circuit court denied the motions. The circuit court then allowed the\n\nparties additional time to address questions of fact that had been identified in the court’s prior\n\norder.   These questions pertained to the role and responsibilities of interventionists.\n\nThereafter, following additional discovery, the parties again filed cross motions for summary\n\njudgment. By order entered June 9, 2015, the circuit court granted AFT’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment and denied MCBOE’s motion. In doing so, the circuit court reluctantly\n\n\n\n               6\n               The BOE asserts that interventionists who provided satisfactory service in\nprior school years were afforded the opportunity to be re-employed in subsequent years.\n\n                                                5\n\n\fconcluded that an interventionist met the statutory definition of “classroom teacher”;\n\ntherefore, the position had to be filled through direct employment by MCBOE in accordance\n\nwith the statutory requirements pertaining to hiring and employment of classroom teachers.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                               II.\n\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n               Although the circuit court did not render its final order in the context of the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus that was sought by AFT, it implicitly granted the requested\n\nwrit by granting summary judgment in favor of AFT.                 Likewise, the circuit court\n\nconnotatively declared that MCBOE is prohibited from contracting with RESA VII to obtain\n\nthe services of interventionists and enjoined it from continuing the practice. Thus, our\n\nstandard for reviewing the lower court’s rulings in this appeal is multifaceted.\n\n\n\n               It has been made clear that, “[t]o invoke mandamus the relator must show (1)\n\na clear right to the relief sought; (2) a legal duty on the part of the respondent to do the thing\n\nrelator seeks; and (3) the absence of another adequate remedy.” Syl. pt. 2, Myers v.

See\n\nalso Foster Found. v. Gainer, 228 W. Va. at 110, 717 S.E.2d at 894 (“Statutes . . . whose\n\nlanguage is ambiguous must be construed before they can be applied.”).\n\n\n\n                       A. Interventionists as Classroom Teachers\n\n              The term “interventionist” is not defined in the West Virginia Code.\n\nAccordingly, in order to determine whether an interventionist is the statutory equivalent of\n\na teacher, we begin with an examination of the definition of a teacher. The statutory\n\ndefinition of a classroom teacher is found in W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1(c)(1) (2009) (Repl. Vol.\n\n2016), which defines the term as follows:\n\n                      (c) “Professional educator” has the same meaning as\n              “teacher” as defined in section one [§ 18-1-1], article one,\n              chapter eighteen of this code. Professional educators are\n              classified as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\n\f                      (1) “Classroom teacher” means a professional educator\n               who has a direct instructional or counseling relationship with\n               students and who spends the majority of his or her time in this\n               capacity[.]\n\n(Emphasis added). The foregoing statute plainly demonstrates that “classroom teacher” is\n\na subclassification of “professional educator.” The term “professional educator,” in turn,\n\nbears the same meaning as the term “teacher,” which is defined in W. Va. Code § 18-1-1(g)\n\n(2012) (Repl. Vol. 2016). Pursuant to W. Va. Code § 18-1-1(g), “‘[t]eacher’ means a\n\nteacher, supervisor, principal, superintendent, public school librarian or any other person\n\nregularly employed for instructional purposes in a public school in this state.” (Emphasis\n\nadded). Although the term “instructional,” which is used in the foregoing definitions of both\n\n“teacher” and “classroom teacher,” is not statutorily defined, we are to give the term its\n\ncommon, ordinary meaning.

Code § 18A-2-2; additional\n\ncitation omitted)).\n\n\n\n              Nevertheless, we must continue our analysis by considering the provisions\n\npertaining to the role of RESAs and determining whether that role, as it pertains to\n\ninterventionists, is compatible with the statutory definition of a classroom teacher.\n\n\n\n                       B. Interventionists under RESA Provisions\n\n              RESAs are established by W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 (2015) (Repl. Vol. 2016).10\n\nThe Legislature has expressly stated its intent for establishing RESAs thusly: “The intent of\n\nthe Legislature in providing for establishment of [RESAs], hereinafter referred to in this\n\nsection as agency or agencies, is to provide for high quality, cost effective education\n\nprograms and services to students, schools and school systems.” W. Va. Code § 18-2-26(a)\n\n\n\n              10\n                The version of W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 in effect during the time relevant to\nthis dispute was enacted in 2002. However, the portions of the statute upon which we rely\nare substantively the same in both the 2002 and 2015 versions. See W. Va. Code § 18-2-26\n(2002) (Repl. Vol. 2012).\n\n                                             14\n\n\f(emphasis added). Plainly, then, the Legislature expressly intended for RESAs to provide,\n\namong other things, high quality, cost effective education services to students. The evidence\n\npresented in this case demonstrates that interventionists provide high quality and cost\n\neffective educational services to students. As to quality, we note that interventionists\n\nproviding contracted services through a RESA must have the same licensure as educators\n\nemployed directly by county boards of education. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 136-7.1.b.6\n\n(2016).11   Additionally, with respect to the cost-effective aspect of utilizing RESA\n\ninterventionists, the circuit court concluded that\n\n              [t]he opportunity to deploy multiple part-time interventionists,\n              rather than a fewer number of regular full-time employees,\n              results in the ability to offer services to a significantly greater\n              number of students during a school day. . . . This circumstance\n              exists by virtue of greater flexibility in scheduling multiple\n              interventionists in more than one classroom during the same\n              time period.\n\n(Quotations and citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n              11\n                Pursuant to 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 136-7.1.b.6 (2016), “[c]ontracted or RESA\nServices. – The county superintendent shall assure that an educator providing contracted\nservices or services through a RESA holds the same licensure required for an educator\nemployed by a board of education.” This identical language also appears in earlier versions\nof the Code of State Rules. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 136-7.1.2.f (2012, 2011, & 2010). The\nState Board, as amicus curiae, further explained in its brief that “[m]any of the persons hired\nas interventionists are retired teachers or those new to the teaching profession that desire a\npart-time work schedule.”\n\n                                              15\n\n\f              The Legislature also has expressly stated its purpose for establishing RESAs,\n\nwhich includes its vision that RESAs would assist the State Board in implementing programs\n\nand services as directed by that body:\n\n                     In establishing the agencies [RESAs] the Legislature\n              envisions certain areas of service in which [RESAs] can best\n              assist the state board in implementing the standards based\n              accountability model pursuant to subsection (a) of this section\n              and, thereby, in providing high quality education programs.\n              These areas of service include the following:\n\n                     ....\n\n                     (6) Developing and/or implementing any other programs\n              or services as directed by law, the state board or the regional\n              council.\n\nW. Va. Code § 18-2-26(b) (emphasis added). Moreover, the Legislature has mandated that\n\nthe State Board promulgate rules for the establishment and operation of RESAs: “[t]he state\n\nboard shall reexamine the powers and duties of [RESAs] in light of the changes in state level\n\neducation policy that have occurred and shall establish multicounty regional education\n\nservice agencies by rule, promulgated in accordance with the provisions of article three-b [§§\n\n29A-3B-1 et seq.], chapter twenty-nine-a of this code.”12 W. Va. Code § 18-2-26(c)\n\n(emphasis added). In accordance with its duty to do so, the State Board promulgated\n\n\n\n\n              12\n              W. Va.

The RESA VII Strategic Plan for the 2011-2012 school year, which,\n\nnecessarily, was approved by the State Board, contains a specific provision for employing\n\ninterventionists:\n\n              Employ certified regional providers (interventionists, OTs, PTs,\n              SLPs, academic and job coaches[)] to provide services as set\n              forth by Individual Education Programs and School\n              Improvement Grants for students within RESA 7.\n\n              15\n                (...continued)\nregulation is somewhat different than that quoted above, the regulation still requires RESAs\nto develop and/or implement programs or services as directed by law or by the State Board.\n\n              16\n                126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4 (2010) provides that “[e]ach RESA shall submit,\nwith recommendations from and approval by a majority vote of the regional council, the\nStrategic Plan to the WVDE [West Virginia Department of Education] by October 1 of each\nyear for approval by the WVBE [State Board] . . . .” (Emphasis added). Similarly, 126\nW. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4 (2015) declares that “[e]ach RESA shall submit, with\nrecommendations from and approval by a majority vote of the regional council, the Strategic\nPlan to the WVBE [State Board] staff by October 1 of each year for approval by the WVBE\n[State Board]. . . .” (Emphasis added).\n\n                                             19\n\n\fRESA VII Strategic Plan § 3.4. (2011-2012) (emphasis added).17 Therefore, insofar as the\n\nState Board approved the RESA VII Strategic Plan, it rationally follows that the provision\n\nof interventionists is a service RESA VII is directed by the State Board to provide. This\n\nconclusion is in accord with the legislative rule requiring liberal construction of the\n\nprovisions pertaining to RESAs. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72.2.8 (2010) (“All functions of\n\nthe RESAs shall be liberally construed to effectuate the intent of the WVBE [State Board].”18\n\n\n\n              Finally, we observe that, in carrying out duties such as the provision of\n\ninterventionists, RESAs are expressly empowered to contract with and receive funds from\n\ncounty boards of education:\n\n                      RESAs are empowered to contract with county boards of\n              education, the West Virginia Department of Education\n              (hereinafter WVDE), persons, companies, or other agencies to\n              implement their Strategic Plan (see Section 5.3). A RESA is\n              eligible as a local education agency (LEA)[19] to participate in\n              partnership with or on behalf of any county school system or\n\n\n              17\n                Likewise, the RESA VII Strategic Plan for the 2016-2017 school year\nprovides that RESAs may “[e]mploy certified regional providers (interventionists, OTs, PTs,\nSLPs, school psychologists and job coaches) to provide services as set forth by Individual\nEducation Programs and School Improvement Grants for students within RESA 7.” RESA\nVII Strategic Plan § 3.4. (2016-2017) (emphasis added).\n              18\n                This provision is now found at 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72.2.6 (2015), and states\nthat “[a]ll functions, powers, and duties of the RESAs shall be liberally construed to\neffectuate the intent of the WVBE [State Board].”\n              19\n                As explained in footnote 4, supra, and its accompanying text, Title I provides\nfinancial assistance to LEAs. Where possible, Title I funds are used to provide the\ninterventionists at issue in this case.\n\n                                             20\n\n\f              school in those programs that will accomplish implementation\n              of the strategic plan and/or state education initiative.\n\n126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-2.5 (2010) (emphasis and footnote added).20 With respect to\n\nreceiving funds, 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-4.4 (2010) provides that\n\n                     [a] RESA may receive and disburse funds\n              from . . . member counties, . . . the funds of which will\n              contribute to RESA initiatives. Each RESA is encouraged to\n              partner with member school systems, particularly those\n              designated as low-performing, and other organizations as\n              appropriate to attract and leverage resources available from\n              federal programs to maximize its capacity for meeting the needs\n              of member schools and school systems . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added).21 See also W. Va. Code § 18-2-26(h) (authorizing RESAs to “receive and\n\ndisburse funds from . . . member counties”).22\n\n\n\n              To summarize, the plain language of the foregoing statutes and legislative rules\n\npertaining to RESAs demonstrate that the Legislature intended for RESAs to be enabled to\n\nprovide, among other things, interventionist services to county boards of education through\n\ncontracts with the county boards.\n\n\n              20\n                This provision is found in the 2015 version of the regulations at 126 W. Va.\nC.S.R. §§ 72-2.5.c & d with slight language differences that would not change the outcome\nof our decision in this case.\n              21\n                The language of the 2015 version of 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-4.4 is\nsubstantially the same as that quoted above.\n              22\n                Although the 2002 version of W. Va. Code § 18-2-26 was in effect during the\ntime relevant to this dispute, the above quoted language is identical in both the 2002 and the\n2015 versions of this statute. See supra note 10.\n\n                                             21\n\n\f                                     C. Governing Law\n\n              Based upon the analyses set out above, this Court is now faced with two\n\nlegislative schemes applicable to interventionists: one governing classroom teachers and one\n\ngoverning RESAs. Under the statutory provisions pertaining to classroom teachers, an\n\ninterventionist must be employed by a county board of education. On the other hand, the\n\nRESA provisions allow county boards to contract with RESAs to obtain interventionist\n\nservices for their students. Thus, while both legislative schemes are applicable, they also are\n\ninconsistent and irreconcilable.\n\n\n\n              We find that the rules of statutory construction favor application of the RESA\n\nscheme to this matter. This Court has observed that, “‘where two distinct statutes stand in\n\npari materia, and sections thereof are in irreconcilable conflict, that section must prevail\n\nwhich can properly be considered as the last expression of the law making power . . . .’ State\n\nex rel.

Under this\n\ndoctrine, the RESA scheme prevails because the statute establishing RESAs was last\n\namended in 2015, and the legislative rules governing RESAs also were last amended in 2015.\n\nMoreover, the RESA strategic plans, such as the RESA VII strategic plan that specifically\n\nprovides for the hiring and use of interventionists, are approved by the State Board on an\n\nannual basis. See 126 W. Va. C.S.R. § 72-5.4 (2010) (establishing that “[e]ach RESA shall\n\n\n                                              22\n\n\fsubmit . . . the Strategic Plan to the WVDE [West Virginia Department of Education] by\n\nOctober 1 of each year for approval by the [State Board]. . . .”).

In the case sub judice, the\n\nvarious RESA provisions provide the more specific law in that they specifically address the\n\nissues herein raised, i.e., granting authority for RESAs to both employ individuals to provide\n\nservices to school children and to enter contracts with county boards of education.\n\nFurthermore, the relevant rules require incorporation of the State Board approved RESA\n\nstrategic plan, which, in this instance, expressly provides for interventionists. The foundation\n\nfor the argument that interventionists must be considered classroom teachers, on the other\n\n\n                                              23\n\n\fhand, rests solely upon W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1(c)(1), a statute that simply defines the term\n\n“classroom teacher” and contains no provision expressly pertaining to interventionists.\n\n\n\n              Accordingly, based upon the analysis set out in this opinion, we now hold that\n\nthe definition of “classroom teacher,” set out in W. Va. Code § 18A-1-1 (2009) (Repl. Vol.\n\n2016), is not intended to include within its meaning an “interventionist,” who provides\n\ninstruction to an individual student or a small group of students for the purpose of\n\nintervening in the education of students who are deficient in one or more particular subjects.\n\nIn addition, we hold that, pursuant to 126 W. Va. C.S.R. §§ 72-2.5.c & d (2015) and 126\n\nW. Va. C.S.R. § 72-3.13 (2015),23 a county board of education may contract with its Regional\n\nEducation Service Agency (RESA) for the provision of interventionist services to its\n\nstudents.\n\n\n\n                                             IV.\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\n              For the reasons set out in the body of this opinion, we conclude that the\n\nlegislative scheme for the RESA program evidences a legislative intent that county boards\n\n\n\n\n              23\n                Although we utilize current versions of the Code of State Rules in our holding\nfor ease of reference, our decision applies equally to the earlier versions of the Rules\ndiscussed in the body of the opinion.\n\n                                             24\n\n\fbe authorized to contract with RESAs to provide interventionist services to county students.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the June 24, 2015, order of the Circuit Court of Monongalia County.\n\n\n\n                                                                                 Reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\n\f</pre>",
