Ct. No. 56-2012-00416941-CU-\n     Plaintiff and Appellant,                                       PO-VTA\n                                                                 (Ventura County)\nv.\n\nTODD FARM SERVICE, et al.,\n\n     Defendants and Respondents.\n\n\n\n                 An attorney is an officer of the court. He or she must respect and follow\ncourt orders whether they are right or wrong. (People v. Pigage (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th\n1359, 1374; Bus. & Prof. Code §6068, subd. (b).) These time honored rules were lost\nupon counsel. The trial court dismissed with prejudice his client's complaint for personal\ninjuries during jury trial as a sanction for repeated violations of its orders excluding\nhearsay and opinion testimony. Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in\ngranting the terminating sanction and erred when it granted respondents' motions in\nlimine. We affirm.\n                                             Facts\n                 Appellant was employed as a stable maintenance worker at the Ojai Valley\nSchool. One of her job duties was to lift and move hay bales to feed horses kept at the\nschool. In May 2010, she climbed to the top of a stack of hay bales, to throw one of the\nupper bales down to the ground. When she inserted hay hooks into the bale to move it,\n\fthe bale gave way causing her to fall 11 feet to the ground. Appellant was severely\ninjured in the fall. Neither the bale or its strapping were preserved after the fall.\n              Todd Farm Service (Todd) sold and delivered the hay bale to Ojai Valley\nSchool. Todd produced documents indicating that it purchased hay from three suppliers\nin the six months before appellant's accident. One of those suppliers is Berrington\nCustom Hay Stacking and Transport, Inc. (Berrington) located in Nevada. Todd's other\nsuppliers are located in Southern California.\n              Appellant's complaint alleged that Berrington manufactured the bale and\nsold it to Todd. The documents produced by Todd, however, did not establish that\nBerrington supplied the hay bale involved in appellant's accident. Todd stored hay from\nvarious suppliers in the same barn. It did not segregate hay bales by supplier and hay\nbales received from the various suppliers were comingled in the barn. Todd did not\nmaintain a record of which supplier's hay bales were delivered to a particular customer.\n                                     Expert Designation\n              During discovery, appellant failed to make a timely designation of expert\nwitnesses. Instead, after respondents served their designations of expert witnesses,\nappellant served a \"supplemental\" designation naming hers. The trial court granted\nBerrington's motion to strike appellant's supplemental designation. Its minute order\nexplained, \"[Appellant] unreasonably failed to designate her experts pursuant to [Code of\nCivil Procedure] § 2034.260. Having failed to comply with this section, she is not\nentitled to supplement pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure] § 2034.280. Even if she\nwere entitled to supplement, her designation is not a true supplement but rather what\nappears to be a calculated attempt to put [respondent] at a disadvantage as to designation\nof experts. (See Fairfax v. Lords (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1026.)\" Appellant does\nnot challenge this order on appeal and as we shall explain, this order precluded her from\ntestifying as an expert as to the derivation of the subject hay bale.\n                                      Motions in Limine\n              As trial commenced, respondents, both of them, made two motions in\nlimine that are at issue here. Motion in Limine No. 2 sought to exclude opinion testimony\n\n\n                                                2\n\ffrom appellant, based on the order striking her designation of expert witnesses.\nSpecifically, respondents requested that appellant be precluded from testifying that she\ncould determine the geographic origin of hay bales by looking at the color and texture of\nthe hay, and from offering any other opinions concerning the manner in which hay is cut,\nharvested, baled, manufactured, stored and moved. Motion in Limine No. 4 asked the\ntrial court to preclude appellant, on hearsay grounds, from testifying to any statements\nmade by unidentified Todd employees relating to the \"identity\" or origin of hay delivered\nto the school or the bale involved in appellant's accident. The trial court granted both\nmotions.\n              Appellant made an offer of proof that the defective bale was manufactured\nby Berrington. She intended to testify that, \"The usual alfalfa hay bales Todd Farm\ndelivered to the Ojai Valley School were cut, harvested and baled the same, and they had\nthe same look and texture in that they were really green with a lot of fresh leaf and soft\ngrass stems. From 20 years of experience I could recognize and know really green alfalfa\nhay bales with fresh leaf and soft grass stems come from up north, where there is more\nwater; whereas alfalfa bales from Southern California are usually browner, with dry leaf\nand harder grass stems.\" Berrington is located in Nevada where, appellant believes, there\nis more water than in Southern California, the location of the other suppliers used by\nTodd.\n              Appellant was also prepared to testify that, on one occasion, Todd delivered\nbales that were \"brown, had dry leaf and hard grass stems.\" The \"delivery guys\" from\nTodd told appellant these bales came from Southern California. On May 13, 2010, four\ndays before her fall, Todd delivered bales to the school that appellant \"could tell were\nfrom Berrington because they were cut-harvested-baled the same, and were really green\nwith a lot of leaf and soft grass stems; which showed they were from the north and not\nthe south.\" She commented that the horses would love that hay and the delivery men\n\"told me the alfalfa bales looked really fresh because they 'just came off the Berrington\ntruck.'\" The bale involved in appellant's accidental fall was one of the bales delivered on\nMay 13.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              Appellant offered to testify that she saw the delivery men with a receipt\nidentifying Berrington as the supplier of the hay bales. She did not have the receipt itself\nand had no other documentary evidence that the bale involved in her accident was\nsupplied by Berrington. Appellant's trial counsel represented that the Todd employee\nwho delivered hay bales to Ojai Valley School on May 13 died prior to trial.\n              In granting respondents' Motion in Limine No. 4, the trial court concluded\nappellant's proposed testimony concerning statements made by Todd delivery men and\nthe contents of their delivery receipt or ticket was hearsay because the testimony would\nbe offered against Berrington, to prove the truth of her assertion that the hay bale came\nfrom Berrington. It admonished appellant's trial counsel, \"There should be no reference\nto Berrington paperwork or mention the name 'Berrington' by the delivery people.\" In\nresponse to questions from appellant's counsel, the trial court further clarified that its\nruling also applied to appellant's proposed testimony that she was told \"the green stuff is\nfrom up north, which again would be hearsay to her.\"\n                                             Trial\n              Appellant's trial counsel disregarded these admonitions in his opening\nstatement. He asserted the evidence would show \"that the hay bale that broke causing the\nfall and serious injuries to [appellant] came from the Berringtons.\" Appellant's counsel\ninformed the jury that appellant would testify \"she knows the alfalfa was from\nBerrington. Looking at the alfalfa hay that came from up north in Northern Nevada from\nthe Berringtons, it was greener. It didn't contain the dryer hard stems that she noticed in\nother deliveries.\" He later said, \"The evidence is also going to show that the horses loved\nthe Berrington hay. Berrington hay was a higher quality hay.\" Rejecting the defense\ntheory that \"no one keeps track of the hay,\" counsel assured the jury that appellant \"could\ntell, depending on the bales, which general area the bales were coming from. . . . [¶] She\nsaw that the bales from Berrington were greener, they appeared fresher, and they had soft\ngrass stems. And the horses did much better, much happier with those bales.\" Trial\ncounsel also informed the jury, \"[Appellant] knows these are Berrington bales as well\nbecause she saw a delivery receipt.\" At that point, respondents objected and the trial\n\n\n                                               4\n\fcourt instructed the jury to disregard \"any reference to a receipt . . . .\" It also informed\nappellant's trial counsel, \"You're violating a previous ruling of the court . . . .\"\n               Within a few minutes of this exchange, appellant's trial counsel informed\nthe jury, \"We have the exact date [the hay bales] were delivered on May 13th. We have\nthe delivery ticket.\" This prompted another instruction from the trial court for counsel to\n\"move on, please.\"\n               At the next recess, respondents' counsel expressed concern that appellant's\ncounsel \"didn't grasp the meaning of the motions in limine\" because he kept referring to\nmatters that had been excluded. Appellant's counsel responded, \"Your honor, the – we\nhave the delivery tickets. We have the sales receipts . . . . [¶] If she saw a delivery\nreceipt, why can't we say that?\" The trial court repeated its prior ruling that, \"there can\nbe no reference to an alleged word 'Berrington' on a delivery ticket that we don't have.\"\nAppellant's counsel represented, \"we do have the Berrington delivery tickets. We also\nhave the Todd sales receipts. We do have those documents.\" Berrington's counsel\nobjected, \"He doesn't have a delivery ticket that says 'Berrington' on it. He never did.\"\nThe trial court denied respondents' motion for a mistrial but warned appellant's counsel,\n\"[Y]ou are flirting with [a mistrial] if you continue to try and violate or get around it in a\nway that is inappropriate. . . . [¶] So no mention of the word 'Berrington' on a clipboard\nor on a piece of paper that was present at the time of any delivery by Todd Farm. That's\nthe ruling.\"\n               During his direct examination of appellant, counsel asked her at least five\ntimes whether her supervisor told her where the hay deliveries came from. The trial court\nsustained objections to each question. At the next recess, the trial court stated its belief\nthat appellant's counsel, \"seem[s] to be driving at an area that I've already ruled you can't\ngo to. So I don't know what the relevance of where the hay came from would be other\nthan to get to the hearsay that's been excluded.\" Appellant's counsel explained he was\ntrying to establish that Todd delivered all of the school's hay. The trial court reminded\nappellant that Todd's delivery of the hay was not in dispute and that testimony about\nwhere Todd got the hay has been ruled inadmissible. It concluded, \"So to be clear, Mr.\n\n\n                                               5\n\fMurphy, there's to be no testimony in front of the jury that the hay came from Berrington\nor that anybody said that or that any piece of paper said that, unless I approve it in\nadvance. Or anything that resembles what I just described.\"\n              Appellant's counsel stated he was planning to ask appellant if she had ever\nseen a receipt from Berrington confirming its delivery of hay to Todd. The trial court\nresponded, \"And that would be – sounds to me like it's going to be a direct violation of\nmy order.\" After additional argument from appellant's counsel, the court warned counsel,\n\"[Y]ou're just proving the point that everybody's worried about, that you're not going to\nabide by the ruling and one way or another you're going to try and sneak [excluded\ntestimony] in.\"\n              The next morning, appellant re-argued her objections to the orders in\nlimine, offering to testify that she saw Todd delivery receipts identifying Berrington as\nthe supplier of hay bales delivered to the school. The trial court declined to change its\nprior ruling, reasoning that appellant \"utterly failed\" to link Berrington to the hay\ndelivered to the school.\n              Appellant's direct examination continued. Despite the trial court's prior\nruling, counsel asked appellant whether she could \"tell what kind of hay\" was in the\nbales, and whether she could tell, \"from looking at hay the different qualities of hay[.]\"\nThe trial court sustained objections to these questions and to others that appeared to call\nfor hearsay or expert opinions.\n              After the jury was excused for lunch, appellant's counsel reargued the\nevidentiary rulings. Appellant offered to testify that she could see the difference between\nalfalfa and straw, and recognized the bale involved in her accident as alfalfa. The trial\ncourt declined to change its prior ruling.\n              Appellant resumed her testimony after the lunch recess. The following\nexchange occurred:\n       Q:     The hay bale that you were moving, the one where the twine broke apart,\n       do you remember that bale of hay?\n       A:     I do.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Q:      Do you remember what that bale of hay looked like?\n       A:      Yes.\n       Q:      Do you have that in your mind, the bale – that bale of hay?\n       A:      Yes.\n       Q:      You have not forgotten it have you?\n       A:      No, I have not.\n       Q:      If you close your eyes, can you see that bale of hay as it broke apart?\n       A:      Yes, I can.\n       Q:      Where did that bale of hay come from?\n       A:      Berrington.\n               The trial court immediately excused the jury. In the argument that\nfollowed, the court referred to the line of questions as \"flagrant, flagrant misconduct.\nFlagrant misconduct in violation of the Court['s] repeated rulings.\" Appellant's counsel\ndenied the exchange had been planned, insisting that he only asked appellant whether she\nknew where the hay had been delivered from, not where it was grown and baled.\nRespondents requested the case be dismissed with prejudice as to all defendants, as a\nsanction for appellant's misconduct. Appellant's counsel contended the jury should be\ninstructed to disregard the offending testimony.\n               The trial court rejected appellant's explanations. It ordered the case\ndismissed with prejudice against all defendants, \"[a]s a sanction against both [appellant's\ncounsel] and [appellant] for flagrant and repeated violations of the Court's order, and this\nisn't the first one but this one takes the cake . . . .\"\n                                       Standard of Review\n               \"'Broadly speaking, an appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as\nto the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.' (People v. Alvarez (1996) 14\nCal.4th 155, 201.)\" (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Sun Pacific Farming Co. (2000) 77\nCal.App.4th 619, 639.) This deferential standard of review applies to our review of the\ntrial court's determination whether evidence is relevant (Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz\n(2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 229, 281); whether to receive lay opinion testimony (Osborn v.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fMission Ready Mix (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 104, 112); whether proffered evidence\nconstitutes inadmissible hearsay (Thompson v. County of Los Angeles (2006) 142\nCal.App.4th 154, 168); and whether evidence should be excluded in limine. (Hernandez\nv. Paicius (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 452, 456 [disapproved on another ground, People v.\nFreeman (2010) 47 Cal.4th 993, 1007].)\n              We reject appellant's contention that we should apply the standard of\nreview applicable to an order granting a nonsuit, because the trial court's orders in limine\neffectively excluded all evidence relevant to an essential element of her causes of action.\n(See, e.g., Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 28.) In\nEdwards, supra, the motions in limine \"constituted an objection to any and all evidence\non the grounds appellants' pleadings were fatally defective and failed to state a cause of\naction. As such, they operated as a general demurrer to appellants' complaints or a\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings.\" (Id., at p. 27.) Here, by contrast, the trial court\nexcluded two discreet categories of evidence: opinion testimony regarding the source of\nthe defective hay bale and hearsay on the same subject. It did not exclude all possible\nevidence supporting appellant's claims. For example, she could have questioned Todd\nabout the quantity of hay it purchased from each of its suppliers, and about its storage,\nrecord keeping and delivery practices. Because the orders in limine did not have the\neffect of granting a nonsuit or judgment on the pleadings, the abuse of discretion standard\nof review applies.\n              California courts possess inherent power to issue a terminating sanction for\n\"pervasive misconduct[.]\" (Slesinger, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co. (2007) 155\nCal.App.4th 736, 765.) We accept the trial court's factual determinations concerning\nmisconduct if they are supported by substantial evidence. (Sauer v. Superior Court\n(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 230.) We review the order to issue a terminating sanction\nbased on those factual findings for abuse of discretion. (Slesinger, Inc. v. Walt Disney\nCo., supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at p. 765.)\n              In deciding whether the trial court's orders excluding evidence or its order\nterminating the action as a sanction for misconduct constituted an abuse of discretion, we\n\n\n                                             8\n\f\"view the entire record in the light most favorable to the court's ruling, and draw all\nreasonable inferences in support of it. [Citation.] We also defer to the trial court's\ncredibility determinations. [Citation.] The trial court's decision will be reversed only 'for\nmanifest abuse exceeding the bounds of reason.' (Kuhns v. State of California (1992) 8\nCal.App.4th 982, 988.)\" (Slesinger, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at p.\n765.) From the cold record, we do not know if counsel's \"pervasive misconduct\" was\nintentional, negligent, or resulted from ignorance. But the record shows the trial court\ndid not credit counsel's explanation (ante p. 7) and believed that counsel acted\nintentionally. We are bound by this implied credibility finding.\n                                    Opinion Testimony\n              Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it made orders\nexcluding evidence that were tantamount to a nonsuit and when it granted the terminating\nsanction. There was no abuse.\n              The trial court permitted appellant to testify about the appearance of hay\nbales delivered to the school. It excluded her opinion testimony that the hay bale\ninvolved in her fall must have come from Berrington because of its color and other\ncharacteristics. This order was not an abuse of discretion.\n              If appellant's opinion testimony was offered as an expert opinion, the trial\ncourt properly excluded it based on her failure to make a timely designation of expert\nwitnesses. (Fairfax v. Lords (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1025-1027; Zellerino v.\nBrown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1117-1118.) If appellant's testimony was offered as\na layperson's opinion, it was properly excluded because no layperson can express an\nadmissible opinion on where hay was grown and baled. A layperson's opinion testimony\nis admissible only if it is \"(a) Rationally based on the perception of the witness; and (b)\nHelpful to a clear understanding of his [or her] testimony.\" (Evid. Code, § 800.)\nAppellant could not, and did not, demonstrate her opinions about the appearance of hay\nbales had any rational basis. The trial court correctly excluded her opinion testimony.\n(See, e.g., Jambazian v. Borden (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836, 848-849 [rejecting the\nargument that \"a lay witness may render a medical opinion as to whether a patient has a\n\n\n                                              9\n\fcondition which requires particular advice be given as to the risks of a surgery[,]\"\nbecause the diagnosis of medical conditions and the risks associated with them are not\nmatters within the general knowledge of laypersons].)\n                                          Hearsay\n              The trial court also correctly granted respondents' Motion in Limine No. 4,\nto exclude hearsay regarding the source of the hay bales. Appellant offered to testify that\nTodd's delivery person told her the hay bales came from Berrington. She would also\nhave testified that the same delivery person had a receipt identifying Berrington as the\nsupplier of the hay bales. This testimony was properly excluded as hearsay because\nappellant offered it to prove the truth of her assertion that the hay bale involved in her\naccident was supplied by Berrington. (Evid. Code, § 1200.)\n              Appellant contends the delivery person's statement was an admission or a\ndeclaration against interest by Todd. (Evid. Code, §§ 1222, 1230.) There was, however,\nno evidence the delivery person was authorized by Todd to make statements on its behalf.\nWithout that foundation, neither exception to the hearsay rule applies. (WT Grant Co. v.\nSuperior Court (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 284, 286; O'Mary v. Mitsubishi Electronics\nAmerica, Inc. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 563, 569.) Moreover, as the trial court correctly\nreasoned, the evidence was irrelevant with respect to Todd because Todd stipulated that it\ndelivered the hay bale involved in the fall.\n              Even if the testimony would have been admissible against Todd, it was\nhearsay with respect to Berrington. The delivery person was employed by Todd, not\nBerrington. There is no evidence he was authorized to do or say anything on behalf of\nBerrington. (Evid. Code, § 1222.)\n              The trial court also correctly excluded appellant's proffered testimony that\nshe saw Todd's delivery person with a delivery \"ticket\" or receipt identifying Berrington\nas the source of the hay bale. Writings, such as a delivery receipt, must be authenticated\nbefore they, or secondary evidence of their contents, may be admitted into evidence.\n(Evid. Code, § 1401.) Authentication means evidence that the writing is actually what its\nproponent claims it to be. (Jacobson v. Gourley (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1334.)\n\n\n                                               10\n\fAppellant failed to provide any such evidence. She did not possess the physical\ndocument to which her testimony referred and no other witness who claimed to have seen\nit. Todd, the alleged source of the document, testified that no such receipt ever existed.\nHe did not segregate hay in his barn by supplier and he did not document the supplier of\nhay included in any delivery. Based on this evidence, it was well within the trial court's\ndiscretion to find that appellant failed to prove the preliminary facts necessary to admit\nher testimony about the delivery receipt into evidence. (Evid. Code, § 403.)\n                                   Terminating Sanction\n              Appellant contends the trial court issued a \"hasty\" dismissal of her case and\nabused its discretion because it did not first issue monetary, or other less severe sanctions.\nTrial courts have inherent authority to control the proceedings before them. (Cottle v.\nSuperior Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1377.) This includes the authority to impose\na terminating sanction where a party willfully violates the court's orders. (Williams v.\nRuss (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272,\n1292.) In reviewing the order, \"our task is not to supplant our own judgment for that of\nthe trial court, but to ascertain whether the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a\nterminating sanction.\" (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134\nCal.App.4th 1161, 1183; see also Estate of Gilkison (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1448-\n1449 [abuse of discretion on appeal].) The question \"is not whether the trial court should\nhave imposed a lesser sanction; rather the question is whether the trial court abused its\ndiscretion by imposing the sanction it chose.\" (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v.\nBrown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.) It did not.\n              Appellant misstates the record when she claims the dismissal was prompted\nby a single violation of the trial court's evidentiary orders. Our review of the record, as\nrecited ante, discloses numerous occasions during appellant's opening statement in which\ncounsel mentioned matters that had specifically been excluded. Similarly, during his\ndirect examination of appellant, counsel repeatedly asked questions calling for excluded\nevidence. This occurred after the trial court had revisited and clarified its evidentiary\nrulings at least three times. Appellant's counsel repeatedly disregarded the trial court's\n\n\n                                             11\n\forders by asking appellant questions relating to the source of hay delivered to the school\nand her opinions regarding its appearance and condition. The trial court rationally\ndetermined he would continue to feign misunderstanding its evidentiary rulings and to\nsolicit testimony on excluded matters. In these circumstances, the dismissal order was\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n              Nor did the trial court err in dismissing the action as to both Berrington and\nTodd. The case was dismissed because appellant willfully and repeatedly violated the\ntrial court's orders in limine. This misconduct was unduly prejudicial to both\nrespondents. By repeatedly attempting to solicit testimony that had been excluded,\nappellant was attempting to give jurors the impression that respondents, both of them,\nwere hiding the truth. In most, if not all of the previous rulings, both respondents were\nobjecting to the violations of the in limine orders. In a multi-defendant case, there is no\nrule requiring that misconduct must relate to a specific defendant as a prerequisite to a\nterminating sanction as to that defendant. (See, e.g., Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United\nStates, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285, 301 [terminating sanction may benefit any party\nwho \"shows it suffered detriment as the result of the sanctioned party's\" misconduct].)\n              Had the trial court limited its dismissal order to Berrington, Todd would\nhave been left to bear the burden of the jury's suspicions alone. The terminating sanction\nwas an appropriate response to appellant's repeated flagrant misconduct and consistent\nwith the trial court's inherent authority to \"compel[] 'obedience to its judgments, orders\nand process.'\" (Sauer v. Superior Court (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 230.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f                                     Conclusion\n             The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.

The trial court dismissed with prejudice his client's complaint for personal\ninjuries during jury trial as a sanction for repeated violations of its orders excluding\nhearsay and opinion testimony. Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in\ngranting the terminating sanction and erred when it granted respondents' motions in\nlimine. We affirm.\n                                             Facts\n                 Appellant was employed as a stable maintenance worker at the Ojai Valley\nSchool. One of her job duties was to lift and move hay bales to feed horses kept at the\nschool. In May 2010, she climbed to the top of a stack of hay bales, to throw one of the\nupper bales down to the ground. When she inserted hay hooks into the bale to move it,\n\fthe bale gave way causing her to fall 11 feet to the ground. Appellant was severely\ninjured in the fall. Neither the bale or its strapping were preserved after the fall.\n              Todd Farm Service (Todd) sold and delivered the hay bale to Ojai Valley\nSchool. Todd produced documents indicating that it purchased hay from three suppliers\nin the six months before appellant's accident. One of those suppliers is Berrington\nCustom Hay Stacking and Transport, Inc. (Berrington) located in Nevada. Todd's other\nsuppliers are located in Southern California.\n              Appellant's complaint alleged that Berrington manufactured the bale and\nsold it to Todd. The documents produced by Todd, however, did not establish that\nBerrington supplied the hay bale involved in appellant's accident. Todd stored hay from\nvarious suppliers in the same barn. It did not segregate hay bales by supplier and hay\nbales received from the various suppliers were comingled in the barn. Todd did not\nmaintain a record of which supplier's hay bales were delivered to a particular customer.\n                                     Expert Designation\n              During discovery, appellant failed to make a timely designation of expert\nwitnesses. Instead, after respondents served their designations of expert witnesses,\nappellant served a \"supplemental\" designation naming hers. The trial court granted\nBerrington's motion to strike appellant's supplemental designation. Its minute order\nexplained, \"[Appellant] unreasonably failed to designate her experts pursuant to [Code of\nCivil Procedure] § 2034.260. Having failed to comply with this section, she is not\nentitled to supplement pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure] § 2034.280. Even if she\nwere entitled to supplement, her designation is not a true supplement but rather what\nappears to be a calculated attempt to put [respondent] at a disadvantage as to designation\nof experts. (See Fairfax v. Lords (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2253651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2253651/fairfax-v-lords/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Motion in Limine No. 2 sought to exclude opinion testimony\n\n\n                                                2\n\ffrom appellant, based on the order striking her designation of expert witnesses.\nSpecifically, respondents requested that appellant be precluded from testifying that she\ncould determine the geographic origin of hay bales by looking at the color and texture of\nthe hay, and from offering any other opinions concerning the manner in which hay is cut,\nharvested, baled, manufactured, stored and moved. Motion in Limine No. 4 asked the\ntrial court to preclude appellant, on hearsay grounds, from testifying to any statements\nmade by unidentified Todd employees relating to the \"identity\" or origin of hay delivered\nto the school or the bale involved in appellant's accident. The trial court granted both\nmotions.\n              Appellant made an offer of proof that the defective bale was manufactured\nby Berrington. She intended to testify that, \"The usual alfalfa hay bales Todd Farm\ndelivered to the Ojai Valley School were cut, harvested and baled the same, and they had\nthe same look and texture in that they were really green with a lot of fresh leaf and soft\ngrass stems. From 20 years of experience I could recognize and know really green alfalfa\nhay bales with fresh leaf and soft grass stems come from up north, where there is more\nwater; whereas alfalfa bales from Southern California are usually browner, with dry leaf\nand harder grass stems.\" Berrington is located in Nevada where, appellant believes, there\nis more water than in Southern California, the location of the other suppliers used by\nTodd.\n              Appellant was also prepared to testify that, on one occasion, Todd delivered\nbales that were \"brown, had dry leaf and hard grass stems.\" The \"delivery guys\" from\nTodd told appellant these bales came from Southern California. On May 13, 2010, four\ndays before her fall, Todd delivered bales to the school that appellant \"could tell were\nfrom Berrington because they were cut-harvested-baled the same, and were really green\nwith a lot of leaf and soft grass stems; which showed they were from the north and not\nthe south.\" She commented that the horses would love that hay and the delivery men\n\"told me the alfalfa bales looked really fresh because they 'just came off the Berrington\ntruck.'\" The bale involved in appellant's accidental fall was one of the bales delivered on\nMay 13.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              Appellant offered to testify that she saw the delivery men with a receipt\nidentifying Berrington as the supplier of the hay bales. She did not have the receipt itself\nand had no other documentary evidence that the bale involved in her accident was\nsupplied by Berrington. Appellant's trial counsel represented that the Todd employee\nwho delivered hay bales to Ojai Valley School on May 13 died prior to trial.\n              In granting respondents' Motion in Limine No. 4, the trial court concluded\nappellant's proposed testimony concerning statements made by Todd delivery men and\nthe contents of their delivery receipt or ticket was hearsay because the testimony would\nbe offered against Berrington, to prove the truth of her assertion that the hay bale came\nfrom Berrington. It admonished appellant's trial counsel, \"There should be no reference\nto Berrington paperwork or mention the name 'Berrington' by the delivery people.\" In\nresponse to questions from appellant's counsel, the trial court further clarified that its\nruling also applied to appellant's proposed testimony that she was told \"the green stuff is\nfrom up north, which again would be hearsay to her.\"\n                                             Trial\n              Appellant's trial counsel disregarded these admonitions in his opening\nstatement. He asserted the evidence would show \"that the hay bale that broke causing the\nfall and serious injuries to [appellant] came from the Berringtons.\" Appellant's counsel\ninformed the jury that appellant would testify \"she knows the alfalfa was from\nBerrington. Looking at the alfalfa hay that came from up north in Northern Nevada from\nthe Berringtons, it was greener. It didn't contain the dryer hard stems that she noticed in\nother deliveries.\" He later said, \"The evidence is also going to show that the horses loved\nthe Berrington hay. Berrington hay was a higher quality hay.\" Rejecting the defense\ntheory that \"no one keeps track of the hay,\" counsel assured the jury that appellant \"could\ntell, depending on the bales, which general area the bales were coming from. . . . [¶] She\nsaw that the bales from Berrington were greener, they appeared fresher, and they had soft\ngrass stems. And the horses did much better, much happier with those bales.\" Trial\ncounsel also informed the jury, \"[Appellant] knows these are Berrington bales as well\nbecause she saw a delivery receipt.\" At that point, respondents objected and the trial\n\n\n                                               4\n\fcourt instructed the jury to disregard \"any reference to a receipt . . . .\" It also informed\nappellant's trial counsel, \"You're violating a previous ruling of the court . . . .\"\n               Within a few minutes of this exchange, appellant's trial counsel informed\nthe jury, \"We have the exact date [the hay bales] were delivered on May 13th. We have\nthe delivery ticket.\" This prompted another instruction from the trial court for counsel to\n\"move on, please.\"\n               At the next recess, respondents' counsel expressed concern that appellant's\ncounsel \"didn't grasp the meaning of the motions in limine\" because he kept referring to\nmatters that had been excluded. Appellant's counsel responded, \"Your honor, the – we\nhave the delivery tickets. We have the sales receipts . . . . [¶] If she saw a delivery\nreceipt, why can't we say that?\" The trial court repeated its prior ruling that, \"there can\nbe no reference to an alleged word 'Berrington' on a delivery ticket that we don't have.\"\nAppellant's counsel represented, \"we do have the Berrington delivery tickets. We also\nhave the Todd sales receipts. We do have those documents.\" Berrington's counsel\nobjected, \"He doesn't have a delivery ticket that says 'Berrington' on it. He never did.\"\nThe trial court denied respondents' motion for a mistrial but warned appellant's counsel,\n\"[Y]ou are flirting with [a mistrial] if you continue to try and violate or get around it in a\nway that is inappropriate. . . . [¶] So no mention of the word 'Berrington' on a clipboard\nor on a piece of paper that was present at the time of any delivery by Todd Farm. That's\nthe ruling.\"\n               During his direct examination of appellant, counsel asked her at least five\ntimes whether her supervisor told her where the hay deliveries came from. The trial court\nsustained objections to each question. At the next recess, the trial court stated its belief\nthat appellant's counsel, \"seem[s] to be driving at an area that I've already ruled you can't\ngo to. So I don't know what the relevance of where the hay came from would be other\nthan to get to the hearsay that's been excluded.\" Appellant's counsel explained he was\ntrying to establish that Todd delivered all of the school's hay. The trial court reminded\nappellant that Todd's delivery of the hay was not in dispute and that testimony about\nwhere Todd got the hay has been ruled inadmissible. It concluded, \"So to be clear, Mr.\n\n\n                                               5\n\fMurphy, there's to be no testimony in front of the jury that the hay came from Berrington\nor that anybody said that or that any piece of paper said that, unless I approve it in\nadvance. Or anything that resembles what I just described.\"\n              Appellant's counsel stated he was planning to ask appellant if she had ever\nseen a receipt from Berrington confirming its delivery of hay to Todd. The trial court\nresponded, \"And that would be – sounds to me like it's going to be a direct violation of\nmy order.\" After additional argument from appellant's counsel, the court warned counsel,\n\"[Y]ou're just proving the point that everybody's worried about, that you're not going to\nabide by the ruling and one way or another you're going to try and sneak [excluded\ntestimony] in.\"\n              The next morning, appellant re-argued her objections to the orders in\nlimine, offering to testify that she saw Todd delivery receipts identifying Berrington as\nthe supplier of hay bales delivered to the school. The trial court declined to change its\nprior ruling, reasoning that appellant \"utterly failed\" to link Berrington to the hay\ndelivered to the school.\n              Appellant's direct examination continued. Despite the trial court's prior\nruling, counsel asked appellant whether she could \"tell what kind of hay\" was in the\nbales, and whether she could tell, \"from looking at hay the different qualities of hay[.]\"\nThe trial court sustained objections to these questions and to others that appeared to call\nfor hearsay or expert opinions.\n              After the jury was excused for lunch, appellant's counsel reargued the\nevidentiary rulings. Appellant offered to testify that she could see the difference between\nalfalfa and straw, and recognized the bale involved in her accident as alfalfa. The trial\ncourt declined to change its prior ruling.\n              Appellant resumed her testimony after the lunch recess. The following\nexchange occurred:\n       Q:     The hay bale that you were moving, the one where the twine broke apart,\n       do you remember that bale of hay?\n       A:     I do.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Q:      Do you remember what that bale of hay looked like?\n       A:      Yes.\n       Q:      Do you have that in your mind, the bale – that bale of hay?\n       A:      Yes.\n       Q:      You have not forgotten it have you?\n       A:      No, I have not.\n       Q:      If you close your eyes, can you see that bale of hay as it broke apart?\n       A:      Yes, I can.\n       Q:      Where did that bale of hay come from?\n       A:      Berrington.\n               The trial court immediately excused the jury. In the argument that\nfollowed, the court referred to the line of questions as \"flagrant, flagrant misconduct.\nFlagrant misconduct in violation of the Court['s] repeated rulings.\" Appellant's counsel\ndenied the exchange had been planned, insisting that he only asked appellant whether she\nknew where the hay had been delivered from, not where it was grown and baled.\nRespondents requested the case be dismissed with prejudice as to all defendants, as a\nsanction for appellant's misconduct. Appellant's counsel contended the jury should be\ninstructed to disregard the offending testimony.\n               The trial court rejected appellant's explanations. It ordered the case\ndismissed with prejudice against all defendants, \"[a]s a sanction against both [appellant's\ncounsel] and [appellant] for flagrant and repeated violations of the Court's order, and this\nisn't the first one but this one takes the cake . . . .\"\n                                       Standard of Review\n               \"'Broadly speaking, an appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as\nto the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.'

Here, by contrast, the trial court\nexcluded two discreet categories of evidence: opinion testimony regarding the source of\nthe defective hay bale and hearsay on the same subject.

(Slesinger, Inc. v.

From the cold record, we do not know if counsel's \"pervasive misconduct\" was\nintentional, negligent, or resulted from ignorance. But the record shows the trial court\ndid not credit counsel's explanation (ante p. 7) and believed that counsel acted\nintentionally. We are bound by this implied credibility finding.\n                                    Opinion Testimony\n              Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it made orders\nexcluding evidence that were tantamount to a nonsuit and when it granted the terminating\nsanction. There was no abuse.\n              The trial court permitted appellant to testify about the appearance of hay\nbales delivered to the school. It excluded her opinion testimony that the hay bale\ninvolved in her fall must have come from Berrington because of its color and other\ncharacteristics. This order was not an abuse of discretion.\n              If appellant's opinion testimony was offered as an expert opinion, the trial\ncourt properly excluded it based on her failure to make a timely designation of expert\nwitnesses. (Fairfax v. Lords (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2253651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2253651/fairfax-v-lords/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

If appellant's testimony was offered as\na layperson's opinion, it was properly excluded because no layperson can express an\nadmissible opinion on where hay was grown and baled. A layperson's opinion testimony\nis admissible only if it is \"(a) Rationally based on the perception of the witness; and (b)\nHelpful to a clear understanding of his [or her] testimony.\" (Evid. Code, § 800.)\nAppellant could not, and did not, demonstrate her opinions about the appearance of hay\nbales had any rational basis. The trial court correctly excluded her opinion testimony.\n(See, e.g., Jambazian v. Borden (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2291670\"><a href=\"/opinion/2291670/jambazian-v-borden/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Appellant offered to testify that\nTodd's delivery person told her the hay bales came from Berrington. She would also\nhave testified that the same delivery person had a receipt identifying Berrington as the\nsupplier of the hay bales. This testimony was properly excluded as hearsay because\nappellant offered it to prove the truth of her assertion that the hay bale involved in her\naccident was supplied by Berrington. (Evid. Code, § 1200.)\n              Appellant contends the delivery person's statement was an admission or a\ndeclaration against interest by Todd. (Evid. Code, §§ 1222, 1230.) There was, however,\nno evidence the delivery person was authorized by Todd to make statements on its behalf.\nWithout that foundation, neither exception to the hearsay rule applies. (WT Grant Co. v.\nSuperior Court (1972) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Moreover, as the trial court correctly\nreasoned, the evidence was irrelevant with respect to Todd because Todd stipulated that it\ndelivered the hay bale involved in the fall.\n              Even if the testimony would have been admissible against Todd, it was\nhearsay with respect to Berrington. The delivery person was employed by Todd, not\nBerrington. There is no evidence he was authorized to do or say anything on behalf of\nBerrington. (Evid. Code, § 1222.)\n              The trial court also correctly excluded appellant's proffered testimony that\nshe saw Todd's delivery person with a delivery \"ticket\" or receipt identifying Berrington\nas the source of the hay bale. Writings, such as a delivery receipt, must be authenticated\nbefore they, or secondary evidence of their contents, may be admitted into evidence.\n(Evid. Code, § 1401.) Authentication means evidence that the writing is actually what its\nproponent claims it to be. (Jacobson v. Gourley (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

She did not possess the physical\ndocument to which her testimony referred and no other witness who claimed to have seen\nit. Todd, the alleged source of the document, testified that no such receipt ever existed.\nHe did not segregate hay in his barn by supplier and he did not document the supplier of\nhay included in any delivery. Based on this evidence, it was well within the trial court's\ndiscretion to find that appellant failed to prove the preliminary facts necessary to admit\nher testimony about the delivery receipt into evidence. (Evid. Code, § 403.)\n                                   Terminating Sanction\n              Appellant contends the trial court issued a \"hasty\" dismissal of her case and\nabused its discretion because it did not first issue monetary, or other less severe sanctions.\nTrial courts have inherent authority to control the proceedings before them. (Cottle v.\nSuperior Court (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2272808\"><a href=\"/opinion/2272808/cottle-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

It did not.\n              Appellant misstates the record when she claims the dismissal was prompted\nby a single violation of the trial court's evidentiary orders. Our review of the record, as\nrecited ante, discloses numerous occasions during appellant's opening statement in which\ncounsel mentioned matters that had specifically been excluded. Similarly, during his\ndirect examination of appellant, counsel repeatedly asked questions calling for excluded\nevidence. This occurred after the trial court had revisited and clarified its evidentiary\nrulings at least three times. Appellant's counsel repeatedly disregarded the trial court's\n\n\n                                             11\n\forders by asking appellant questions relating to the source of hay delivered to the school\nand her opinions regarding its appearance and condition. The trial court rationally\ndetermined he would continue to feign misunderstanding its evidentiary rulings and to\nsolicit testimony on excluded matters. In these circumstances, the dismissal order was\nnot an abuse of discretion.\n              Nor did the trial court err in dismissing the action as to both Berrington and\nTodd. The case was dismissed because appellant willfully and repeatedly violated the\ntrial court's orders in limine. This misconduct was unduly prejudicial to both\nrespondents. By repeatedly attempting to solicit testimony that had been excluded,\nappellant was attempting to give jurors the impression that respondents, both of them,\nwere hiding the truth. In most, if not all of the previous rulings, both respondents were\nobjecting to the violations of the in limine orders. In a multi-defendant case, there is no\nrule requiring that misconduct must relate to a specific defendant as a prerequisite to a\nterminating sanction as to that defendant. (See, e.g., Parker v. Wolters Kluwer United\nStates, Inc. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 [terminating sanction may benefit any party\nwho \"shows it suffered detriment as the result of the sanctioned party's\" misconduct].)\n              Had the trial court limited its dismissal order to Berrington, Todd would\nhave been left to bear the burden of the jury's suspicions alone. The terminating sanction\nwas an appropriate response to appellant's repeated flagrant misconduct and consistent\nwith the trial court's inherent authority to \"compel[] 'obedience to its judgments, orders\nand process.'\" (Sauer v.
