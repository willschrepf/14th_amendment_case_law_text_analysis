Judge Wiseman\nevaluated the risk here to be insufficient to warrant an upward\nadjustment because the period for which the Geier plaintiffs’\ncounsel sought fees encompassed only “monitoring for\ncompliance,” with an occasional “flurry of activity.”\n“Generally, the trial judge’s exercise of discretion in statutory\nfee award cases is entitled to substantial deference, especially\nwhen the rationale for the award was predominantly fact-\ndriven.” Adcock-Ladd, 227 F.3d at 349.\n  Given the substantial deference this court accords a district\ncourt’s fee award when the district court provides a non-\nerroneous legal and factual basis for its decision, I would\naffirm the fee award here.

The district court, in an extended quote from\nDelaware Valley, acknowledged that a court’s determination\nof the reasonable hourly rate most likely already accounts for\nmost, if not all, of the Johnson factors, with risk as the factor\nremaining to be considered at the upward-adjustment stage of\nthe lodestar analysis.\n  The district court’s opinion details its reason for denying an\nenhancement of the lodestar amount. Judge Wiseman\nevaluated the risk here to be insufficient to warrant an upward\nadjustment because the period for which the Geier plaintiffs’\ncounsel sought fees encompassed only “monitoring for\ncompliance,” with an occasional “flurry of activity.”\n“Generally, the trial judge’s exercise of discretion in statutory\nfee award cases is entitled to substantial deference, especially\nwhen the rationale for the award was predominantly fact-\ndriven.” Adcock-Ladd, 227 F.3d at 349.\n  Given the substantial deference this court accords a district\ncourt’s fee award when the district court provides a non-\nerroneous legal and factual basis for its decision, I would\naffirm the fee award here. Because the majority does not, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
