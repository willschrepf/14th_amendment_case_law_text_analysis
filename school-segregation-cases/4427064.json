See Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(h). The trial court sentenced Appellant to death on\n\nNovember 8, 2013 for the capital murder of Nancy Harris. Appellant filed his\n\nbrief on direct appeal on August 1, 2014. He filed an amended brief on August 21,\n\n2014. He presents sixty-five allegations of reversible error.\n\n                                                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n                                                                  Guilt/Innocence\n\n                                                                    The Offense\n\n              On May 20, 2012, 76-year-old great-grandmother Nancy Judith Harris went\n\nto her job as a clerk at the Fina Whip-In (hereinafter, “the Whip-In”) convenience\n\nstore. (RR44:23; RR46:10; SX#2, 25). At 7:071 a.m., Appellant entered the store\n\n\n\n                                                            \n1\n The surveillance video is time stamped 6:07 a.m. (RR44:49; SX#17). Anna Lunceford, the\nmanager of the Whip-In, testified that the time was off by one hour; at the time she had not\n                                                                         1 \n \n\fcarrying a lighter and a clear plastic bottle filled with lighter fluid. (RR44:50, 230;\n\nSX#17, 79, 83, 85). Once inside, Appellant walked straight to the sales counter,\n\nthen around and behind and into the area reserved for employees.                                                                                                      (RR44:43;\n\nSX#17).                  Nancy was standing behind the counter. (SX#17). She tried to push\n\nAppellant back. (SX#17). Appellant poured the contents of the plastic bottle over\n\nNancy’s head. (SX#17).\n\n              Appellant stood behind Nancy and watched as she tried to open the cash\n\nregister. (SX#17). He took two lighters from a display to the right of the register.\n\n(RR44:231; SX#17, 85).                                           Then, he took two packages of cigarettes from an\n\noverhead dispenser. (RR44:231; SX#17, 87, 88).                                                                              He tried to remove Nancy’s\n\nring from her right finger. (RR44:231; SX#17, 89, 90). The ring did not come\n\noff easily; Appellant licked his fingers to help slide it off. (RR44:232; SX#17, 90,\n\n91). Nancy finally got the register open2 and Appellant took all of the cash from\n\nthe cash tray. (RR44:232; SX#17, 96, 97). Then, he removed the cash tray out of\n\nthe drawer and took some of the coins. (SX#17).\n\n              Almost immediately after Appellant took the money from the register,\n\nflames are reflected on the screen above the cash register. (RR44:232; SX#17, 97).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nrealized she would have to manually change the time following the time change. (RR44:35, 49-\n50; SX#17).\n2\n Nancy opened the register for a no sale transaction at 7:10:54 a.m. (RR44:54, 128-29; SX#19,\n20). \n\n                                                                                              2 \n \n\fNancy, engulfed in flames from her shoulders up, ran out from behind the counter.\n\n(RR44:233; SX#17, 98). Appellant followed close behind. (RR44:233; SX#17).\n\nNancy ran to a nearby sink and leaned over to put out the flames. (SX#17).\n\nAppellant calmly walked out of the store with his bottle, stopping only to take a\n\nfew pieces of candy and stuff them in his pocket. (RR44:233-34; SX#17, 98, 99,\n\n100).\n\n        Nancy bent over the sink, trying to put out the flames consuming the upper\n\nportion of her body. (SX#17). She stopped to pull her shirt over her head and\n\ndropped it on the floor. (SX#17). As Nancy leaned back over the sink, her shirt,\n\nwhich was still burning on the floor, lit her left leg on fire. (SX#17). Unable to\n\nput out all of the flames, Nancy, still on fire, walked outside and waited for help.\n\n(SX#17).\n\n        On the morning of the offense, Garland Police Officers Billy Coffey and\n\nSimon were dispatched to “the 3300 block of Broadway at the Soulman’s Bar-B-\n\nQue and also at the plasma center.” (RR44:62, 64).        Police had received calls\n\nregarding an audible alarm. (RR44:62). When the officers arrived at the plasma\n\ncenter, they found the area secure. (RR44:64).     They got back into their squad\n\ncars and began to proceed to Soulman’s when Simon noticed flames across the\n\nstreet inside the Whip-In. (RR44:62, 65-66; SX#24).        Concerned, the officers\n\nmade their way to the Whip-In. (RR44:66). At that point, they had no idea what\n\n\n                                         3 \n \n\fwas on fire. (RR44:83). Coffey was at the red light, waiting to turn into the Whip-\n\nIn, when he saw “the flames move across the inside of the building.” (RR44:66).\n\nNow, it was an emergency situation. (RR44:84). Coffey turned on his lights and\n\nsirens and hurried into the parking lot. (RR44:66).\n\n              By the time the officers pulled into the parking lot, Nancy was standing\n\noutside. (RR44:84; SX#17). She was still on fire. (RR44:68; SX#17).                               Coffey\n\nretrieved a fire extinguisher from the trunk of his patrol vehicle, ran up, and\n\nextinguished the remaining flames.                             (RR44:68, 84-85; SX#17).      Nancy was\n\n“screaming for help.” (RR44:69). She told the officers that a man had robbed her\n\nand poured something on her. (RR44:69).                             She gave a description of the robber:\n\na “heavy-set black male with blue jeans . . . and a T-shirt.” (RR44:70).\n\n              Garland firefighter and paramedic William Crews was in the area on an\n\nunrelated call when a police officer flagged him down for help. (RR44:89, 92).\n\nCrews pulled up to the Whip-In in the ambulance and began to treat Nancy.\n\n(RR44:93). “She was in a lot of pain. She was very worried.” (RR44:93). She\n\nhad “first, second, and third degree burns to her face, her shoulders, her abdomen,\n\nboth of her upper arms, and to her - - her legs.” (RR44:93). Crews loaded Nancy\n\ninto the ambulance and left for the hospital.3                        (RR44:94).    At first, Nancy was\n\n\n                                                            \n3\n  Crews was familiar with Nancy. He had “made runs on her before” and was aware of her\ndiabetes, high blood pressure and the fact that she had a pacemaker. (RR44:94, 97, 102). He\nand his fellow firefighters also patronized the Whip-In. (RR44:94, 101-02).\n                                                               4 \n \n\fconscious and able to provide her name and history. (RR44:98). As they drove,\n\nher airway began to close and she had a harder time communicating. (RR44:98).\n\n      At the hospital, Nancy was still conscious and able to speak. (RR45:80-81).\n\nApril Gradel, a trauma nurse clinician in the burn unit, gave police a few minutes\n\nto speak with Nancy. (RR45:85, 172, 178; SX#143).           Nancy had “at minimum\n\nsecond to third-degree burns over her entire head, including her face, her neck, her\n\nupper torso, and both of her arms.” (RR45:174). Given the location of Nancy’s\n\nburns, Gradel knew that she was going to have to be intubated.           (RR45:175).\n\nGradel saw a police officer in the hallway and told him that if he was going to\n\nspeak with Nancy, it had to be immediately. (RR45:175).           Gradel was “quite\n\nconvinced it would be [Nancy’s last opportunity to speak].” (RR45:176). Nancy\n\ntold Officer Larry Wilson that “a man she described as a black male, heavy-set,\n\nshort dark hair, and a chubby face, came into the store and demanded money from\n\nher. She advised he took the money and then he poured something on her. She\n\ndidn’t know what - - what it was, and then he lit her on fire.” (RR45:82).\n\n      Dr. John Hunt was also involved in Nancy’s care in the Burn Unit.\n\n(RR46:5). Dr. Hunt testified when an individual is on fire, the mechanism of\n\ninjury is the heat. (RR46:7). “Heat destroys.” (RR46:7). Dr. Hunt described the\n\nthree types of burns:\n\n      The way I usually tell it to family is if the skin is an inch thick, a\n      sunburn is a first-degree burn, and let’s say hypothetically that’s 1/16th\n                                          5 \n \n\f      of an inch. So you’ve got, you know, 15/16ths of an inch left, and\n      that’s not injured and it heals very quickly. A third-degree burn goes\n      through that entire inch of skin. Now, the skin is not an inch thick,\n      but just vision [sic] it as it would be. When that inch of skin is\n      destroyed, that is a third-degree burn. By definition, it destroys any\n      potential for that area that’s third-degree to heal on its own. So a\n      second-degree is anyplace between that sunburn which is 1/16th and\n      that total inch, which is third-degree, in between. So potentially\n      second-degree burns will heal, depends on how deep they are and how\n      long it takes. But the skin elements are there in a second-degree burn,\n      and potentially it will heal. A third-degree, it will not.\n\n(RR46:8-9).    There is also a fourth-degree burn. (RR46:17). This type of burn\n\ndoes not stop at the underside of the skin; it goes all the way through the skin into\n\nthe fat. (RR46:17).\n\n      Dr. Hunt testified that Nancy had burns over 40% of her body. (RR46:10).\n\nThe burns to Nancy’s upper body and face were third and fourth-degree burns.\n\n(RR46:18; SX#146). The burns to her left arm and hand were second and third-\n\ndegree burns. (RR46; SX#147). The burns to her right shoulder and breast were\n\nthird and fourth-degree. (RR46:19; SX#148). The lower portion of her right arm\n\nand hand were second and third-degree burns. (RR46:19; SX#148). The burns to\n\nthe top of her head were third-degree. (RR46:19-20; SX#149).\n\n      Because Nancy’s injuries were to her face and neck, she was intubated and\n\nplaced on a ventilator. (RR46:11). Her face was swollen and her eyes were shut.\n\n(RR46:14). She was able, however, to nod her head and gesture with her hands.\n\n(RR46:14).\n\n\n                                         6 \n \n\f              Nancy’s treatment team determined that Nancy was not going to survive her\n\ninjuries and that treatment would be futile. (RR44:31; RR46:23).                 Prior to the\n\ninstant offense, Nancy executed a DNR, a do-not-resuscitate order.4 (RR44:30-31;\n\nSX#8).                 On May 25, 2012, given the severity and the extent of Nancy’s injuries\n\nand in accordance with her DNR, the decision was made to discontinue life\n\nsupport, and Nancy passed away. (RR46:23-24).\n\n              Dr. Tracy Dyer, a medical examiner with the Dallas County Medical\n\nExaminer’s Office, performed Nancy’s autopsy. (RR46:25, 29-30; SX#9, 151-59).\n\nDuring the autopsy, Dr. Dyer observed “significant serious burns that involved her\n\nentire head, chest, portions of the upper back, and portions of, I believe, it was the\n\nleft lower extremity or left thigh and leg.” (RR46:32). Her hands and palms were\n\ncompletely burned, destroying Nancy’s fingerprints. (RR46:32). On the back of\n\nher left hand, there were “some areas of skin slippage”; the thermal injuries caused\n\nloosening under the layers of Nancy’s skin, causing it to peel off. (RR46:36;\n\nSX#155, 156). Nancy’s right hand was more severely affected. (RR46:37). On\n\nthat hand, “the superficial layers of the skin are gone, and what you have is that\n\nreddened deep tissue in this case, underneath.” (RR46:37; SX#157). Dr. Dyer\n\nobserved skin slippage on Nancy’s left leg and thighs. (RR46:37; SX#158).\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n4\n    Nancy’s DNR is dated May 17, 2002. (SX#8).\n                                                               7 \n \n\f         Nancy’s injuries were consistent with flame burns. (RR46:38). Fire was a\n\ndeadly weapon in this case. (RR46:38). The cause of Nancy’s death was thermal\n\ninjury. (RR46:34, 39). The manner of her death was homicide. (RR46:39).\n\n                                  Appellant’s Capture\n\n         Shortly after police arrived at the Whip-In that morning, calls started coming\n\nin about a man hiding in the alleyways and between the homes in the neighborhood\n\ndirectly behind the store.        (RR44:70, 86). That person matched Nancy’s\n\ndescription. (RR44:70-71, 86). Officers set up a perimeter around the\n\nneighborhood behind the Whip-In. (RR44:71). Officer Rafael Perez participated\n\nin the search. (RR44:178).       In the alley behind Mt. Vernon Street, he noticed a\n\n“heavy-set black male, no shirt, with dark pants” matching the suspect’s\n\ndescription. (RR44:181-82). Perez identified Appellant as the man he saw in the\n\nalley.     (RR44:182-83).      When Appellant saw Perez, he took off running.\n\n(RR44:182-83). Perez lost sight of him briefly, but then he saw Appellant’s leg\n\nsticking out from under a bush. (RR44:184-85).           “He was laid back, kind of\n\nleaning against the wall with one leg out.” (RR44:185). Perez drew his weapon\n\nand instructed Appellant to come out from the bushes and get on the ground.\n\n(RR44:185-86). Coffey arrived and they placed Appellant in handcuffs.\n\n(RR44:186). Appellant asked the officers, “What took you so long[?] Y’all are\n\ngetting slow.” (RR44:186). Appellant was arrested and searched before he was\n\n\n                                            8 \n \n\fplaced in the squad car. (RR44:74). From Appellant’s pockets, Coffey collected a\n\nused lighter, a red lighter, a purple lighter, a gold ring, a car key, coins, and cash.\n\n(RR44:75-78; SX#6, 26, 28-30, 59, 60). Appellant did not appear intoxicated.\n\n(RR44:187).\n\n              Coffey transported Appellant to the police station.5 (RR44:74).        On the\n\ndrive to the station, Appellant tried repeatedly to engage Coffey in conversation.\n\n(RR44:80-81; SX#31). He asked, “What am I being booked for, man?” (SX#31,\n\n1:01). When Coffey advised Appellant was arrested for attempted capital murder,\n\nAppellant asked, “Attempted capital murder of who?”                 (SX#31, 11:38-1:39).\n\nAppellant continued to try to engage Coffey in conversation. (See SX#31). He\n\nasked if Coffey was a family man. (SX#31, 2:55). He asked whether Coffey was\n\nCoffey or Perez. (SX#31). Coffey did not respond to Appellant’s questions.\n\nAppellant stated, “I can tell you everything, man. I can tell you what you want to\n\nknow.” (SX#31, 3:32-3:36). A few minutes later, Appellant told Coffey that he\n\nhad been waiting for police. (SX#31, 6:25). He said that the police came “because\n\nI want[ed] you to.” (SX#31, 6:32). Coffey testified that during the transport,\n\nAppellant did not appear intoxicated. (RR44:79, 87). Appellant did not slur his\n\nspeech and he did not smell of alcohol. (RR44:79, 87). Appellant appeared “[to\n\nbe] coming down from [an] adrenaline rush, maybe fatigued.” (RR44:79-80).\n                                                            \n5\n  A video recording of the transport video was admitted into evidence as State’s Exhibit #31.\n(RR44:80-81).\n                                                               9 \n \n\f      Detective Stacy Tooke was the lead detective on the case. (RR44:213-14).\n\nTooke contacted Appellant at the jail after his arrest. (RR44:219). He requested\n\nand was granted consent to take a sample of Appellant’s DNA. (RR44:219-21;\n\nSX#103).     A forensic investigator collected Appellant’s DNA and took\n\nphotographs of Appellant’s person. (RR44:221). Tooke interviewed Appellant at\n\nthe jail. (RR44:237).\n\n      The jury heard testimony from three of the residents from the neighborhood\n\nbehind the Whip-In, where Appellant hid after the instant offense.   Jim Medley\n\nlives across the alley, behind the Whip-In. (RR44:142-43). On the morning of the\n\noffense, he was at home alone. (RR44:143-44). He heard his dog barking in the\n\nbackyard, so he went outside to investigate. (RR44:144). The gate to his rear-\n\nentry driveway was open. (RR44:144).         On his way back inside the house,\n\nMedley saw a “black man without a shirt, pushing a bicycle. That was about, oh,\n\ntwo houses away.” (RR44:148). At the time, it “seemed like a lot of commotion\n\nin the neighborhood.” (RR44:145).       Medley saw police cars and could hear\n\nsirens. (RR44:145). He noticed his garbage container had been moved and a pack\n\nof cigarettes in his driveway. (RR44:146; SX#48, 78). Medley is not a smoker.\n\n(RR44:146). He picked them up and put them in the garbage. (RR44:146, 151-\n\n53; SX#50). Inside the garbage can, he found a t-shirt. (RR44:147; SX#77).\n\n\n\n\n                                       10 \n \n\f              Ken Marecle was at home with his daughter on the morning of the offense.\n\n(RR44:155-56). At one point, Marecle’s daughter said a man was on their back\n\nporch and was heading for their front door. (RR44:156). Marecle cracked open\n\nthe front door.                             (RR44:157).           Appellant was standing on the front porch.\n\n(RR44:159, 166-67; SX#55).                                        Appellant’s “eyes were really wide and big.”\n\n(RR44:169). He did not smell of alcohol. (RR44:168-69). He was wearing pants\n\nand “military style black rim glasses” but he did not have a shirt on. (RR44:162).\n\nAppellant told Marecle he needed help. (RR44:157, 159). Then, he tried to force\n\nhis way into Marecle’s home. (RR44:159-60). Marecle used his shoulder to push\n\nAppellant outside into the courtyard. (RR44:160, 169). Appellant started fighting\n\nand flailing his arms.                                     (RR44:161, 169).    He pushed Marecle backwards.\n\n(RR44:162).                       Marecle fell and skinned his arms and knee.                 (RR44:162, 165;\n\nSX#56). When he stood up, Appellant took the glasses off of Marecle’s face and\n\nfled.6 (RR44:162-63, 170). Marecle and his daughter were later shown a lineup\n\nbut neither was able to identify the man they saw that morning. (RR44:210-11).\n\n              Lawrence Denson lives on Colonial, near the Whip-In. (RR45:7-8; SX#65).\n\nOn the morning of the offense, Denson was in his kitchen when he noticed\n\n“[Appellant], looked like he was trying to get inside my gate on the side of my\n\nhouse.”                 (RR45:9).                     Denson went outside to confront him.      (RR45:9, 11).\n                                                            \n6\n    The glasses were found several weeks later in the hedges by a neighbor. (RR44:165-66).\n\n\n                                                                       11 \n \n\fAppellant approached Denson “with his arms out, and said, man, I’m in a bad\n\nway.” (RR45:9, 11-12; SX#51-53).                                     Denson told him that “he needed to get his\n\nbad way out of my yard.” (RR45:12). A family friend staying at Denson’s home\n\ncame outside. (RR45:12-13). Appellant turned around and ran toward an alley.\n\n(RR45:13-15). Appellant did not appear to be intoxicated. (RR45:16). Denson\n\npicked Appellant out of a lineup. (RR44:210; RR45:18-19; SX#62-63).\n\n                                                               The Investigation\n\n              On the morning of the offense, Anna Lunceford, Nancy’s manager and\n\nfriend, was notified that the panic button had been activated at the Whip-In.\n\n(RR44:35, 38, 44; SX#25). When she arrived at the store, Nancy was not there.\n\n(RR44:44). The police asked Lunceford to retrieve the footage from the\n\nsurveillance cameras.7 (RR44:46). Lunceford rewound the DVR and played the\n\nsurveillance video for the police. (RR44:45-46; SX#15, 16, 17).\n\n              After she reviewed the surveillance video, Arson Investigator Nancy\n\nCarpenter instructed firefighters to look around for the bottle that Appellant was\n\ncarrying in the video. (RR44:110-11; RR45:48-49). Firefighter Gary Church went\n\noutside and walked toward the back of the building. (RR44:111, 113-14). He\n\nfound a drinking bottle on the ground in the grass. (RR44:111-12; SX#35, 36).\n\n\n                                                            \n7\n  Lunceford testified that the Whip-In is equipped with three surveillance cameras. (RR44:39-\n40; SX#10-12). The images from the cameras are recorded on a digital video recorder.\n(RR44:45).\n                                                                      12 \n \n\fInside the bottle was a paper towel, “down inside the bottle, kind of in the neck[.]”\n\n(RR45:49; SX#36). The bottle smelled of a petroleum-type product. (RR45:49).\n\nCarpenter collected the plastic bottle. (RR45:50-51; SX#36, 114, 115).\n\n      Inside the store, Carpenter pulled back the mat on the floor behind the sales\n\ncounter. (RR45:60).     Carpenter discovered a liquid pooled beneath and collected\n\na sample.     (RR45:60-62; SX#117, 118, 129). Carpenter transported all of the\n\nevidence she collected to the Armstrong Laboratory, a lab capable of testing\n\nevidence involved in an arson investigation. (RR45:69).\n\n      Dr. Kelly Wouters is a chemist with Armstrong Lab.             (RR45:106-07;\n\nSX#136). He testified to the results of the chemical testing. (RR45:110, 112, 113;\n\nSX#137, 138). Analysis of the contents of the plastic drinking bottle and Nancy’s\n\nclothing showed “a medium petroleum distillate of the primary recovery, and . . . a\n\nlower level of isopropyl alcohol.”       (RR45:113-14; SX#137).          A medium\n\npetroleum distillate is “the type of ignitable liquid that we encounter as charcoal\n\nstarter fluid or paint thinners - - we call it mineral spirits sometimes[.]”\n\n(RR45:114).      Isopropyl alcohol is rubbing alcohol.     (RR45:115).      Medium\n\npetroleum distillates and isopropyl alcohol are “immiscible”; they do not mix.\n\n(RR45:115).     The pooled liquid collected from under the mat behind the sales\n\ncounter contained medium petroleum distillate. (RR45:116). Appellant’s t-shirt,\n\npants, belt, left shoe and sock, and his right shoe also contained medium petroleum\n\n\n                                         13 \n \n\fdistillate.   (RR45:116-17; SX#138).    Neither the pooled liquid nor Appellant’s\n\nclothes and shoes contained isopropyl alcohol. (RR45:116-17). No ignitable\n\nliquids were detected on the swabs of Appellant’s hands. (RR45:116).\n\n       Dr. Wouters testified that the liquid contained in SX#60, the cigarette\n\nlighter, was “probably butane[,]” which is not a medium petroleum distillate.\n\n(RR45:118).       The same is true for the liquid contained in SX#59, the other\n\ncigarette lighter. (RR45:119).\n\n       The plastic drinking bottle was swabbed for a DNA sample.       (RR45:128-\n\n30; SX#160-164). Appellant’s DNA was found on the swab of the exterior of the\n\nplastic bottle.   (RR45:154; SX#142).         He was also included as a possible\n\ncontributor of a DNA profile from the interior and exterior opening of the bottle.\n\n(RR45:155; SX#142). Appellant was included as a possible contributor of a low\n\nlevel sample of DNA from the cash drawer. (RR45:156; SX#142).           The swab\n\nfrom the cash drawer was not a very strong match to Appellant. (RR45:160). A\n\npartial DNA profile from the cigarette package matched Appellant. (RR45:156;\n\nSX#142). No DNA profile was obtained from one of the swabs of the T-shirt, one\n\nof the stains from the counter, or the door handle. (RR45:150, 152; SX#142).\n\nAnother stain from the T-shirt was a match to Appellant. (RR45:150; SX#142).\n\nThere was also a profile of an unknown male and an unknown female obtained\n\nfrom that stain. (RR45:150; SX#142). Nancy Harris was excluded as a possible\n\n\n                                        14 \n \n\fcontributor to the unknown female profile. (RR45:153). A sample from a cutting\n\nof the t-shirt was also a match to Appellant. (RR45:153; SX#142). This sample\n\ncontained a profile of an unknown female and an unknown female as well.\n\n(RRR45:153-54).\n\n                                    Punishment\n\n                            The State’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      At punishment, the State presented evidence of Appellant’s criminal history\n\nand bad behavior while in prison:\n\n      In 1993, Appellant lived with Amy Armstrong Franks and three of her\n\nchildren.   (RR47:35-37). At the time, Appellant was Franks’ boyfriend.\n\n(RR47:36). He was 17 and she was 23. (RR47:38).           Appellant was good to\n\nFranks’ children, but over time, he and Franks started fighting. (RR47:37, 39).\n\nAppellant “put his hands on [Franks]” and would grab her and hit her. (RR47:40).\n\nFranks fought back. (RR47:40, 68).\n\n      On one occasion, after a fight, Franks left the apartment and went to a\n\nfriend’s apartment upstairs.   (RR47:41).     She left her two-year-old daughter\n\ndownstairs. (RR47:41). While Franks was gone, Appellant took Franks’ two-\n\nyear-old and left.   (RR47:41).     He eventually returned, and he and Franks\n\nreconciled. (RR47:42).\n\n\n\n\n                                        15 \n \n\f      The last straw for Franks was when, during yet another fight, Appellant hit\n\nFranks while she was holding her daughter. (RR47:42). Her daughter “caught the\n\nback part of his hand.” (RR47:42). When Appellant left, Franks locked him out\n\nand refused to let him back in her apartment. (RR47:42).      She called the police\n\nand told them what had happened. (RR47:44). Appellant returned after the police\n\nleft but Franks refused to let him in.         (RR47:45). She told him that their\n\nrelationship was over. (RR47:46). Appellant banged on the door and threatened\n\nto kick it in. (RR47:46). He threatened to beat her behind. (RR47:70, 75).\n\nFranks barricaded the door and blocked the windows with mattresses and a bunk\n\nbed. (RR47:46, 51).      She turned off the lights and waited in the hallway with a\n\ngun – Appellant’s gun. (RR47:47, 70). “And then [Appellant] went around and\n\nset my patio on fire.” (RR47:46). Appellant threw something onto the patio,\n\nsetting a rug on fire.    (RR47:49).   Franks saw the flames and went outside.\n\n(RR47:50). She shot at Appellant as he ran away. (RR47:50-51, 73). Then she\n\nput out the fire. (RR47:50-51).\n\n      On September 8, 1993, Dallas Police Officer Eric Hagen was dispatched to\n\nFranks’ apartment. (RR47:21). When he arrived, Franks was “extremely agitated\n\nand upset” but would not let Hagen inside. (RR47:22). Hagen walked around to\n\nthe back porch of the ground-floor apartment. (RR47:23, 26). He looked over the\n\n\n\n\n                                         16 \n \n\ffence and saw “a burned piece of wood and burned patio carpet.” (RR47:24). It\n\nappeared someone had tried to set the carpet on fire. (RR47:26).\n\n      On November 9, 1993, Garland Police Investigator Berry Oliver was on\n\nroutine patrol when he saw Appellant walking down the street smoking a joint.\n\n(RR47:101, 104–107).      When Appellant saw Oliver, he attempted to conceal the\n\njoint by “stick[ing] it down the back of his neck and then [he] immediately starts\n\ntrying to get into the trunk of the car[.]” (RR47:104-05). Oliver stopped Appellant\n\nand patted him down. (RR47:105). He found the joint “between [the] coat and\n\n[the] shirt [Appellant was wearing]” and he found a bag of marijuana inside a\n\ntowel that Appellant was carrying. (RR47:105, 107). Oliver arrested Appellant for\n\npossession of marijuana and an outstanding warrant. (RR47:105, 108). Appellant\n\npleaded guilty and received six months’ probation. (RR47:109-110; SX#167). His\n\nprobation was subsequently revoked and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\n\n(RR47:110; SX#167).\n\n\n      On July 23, 1994, while on patrol Garland Police Officer Blaine Ralston ran\n\na routine check of a license plate on a black four-door Cadillac to check for\n\noutstanding warrants. (RR47:116-17). There was an outstanding warrant on the\n\nvehicle, so Ralston attempted to initiate a traffic stop.       (RR47:117-18).      He\n\nactivated his red and blue lights, but the vehicle did not stop; it “just continue[d] to\n\nroll down the road.” (RR47:118). Ralston could see there were two people in the\n\n                                          17 \n \n\fvehicle. (RR47:118).     The female driver made eye contact via the rear view\n\nmirror. (RR47:118, 120). Ralston activated his siren but the vehicle still did not\n\nstop. (RR47:119).    The vehicle ran a stop sign. (RR47:119). Ralston could see\n\nthe male passenger motioning for the driver to ignore Ralston. (RR47:12021).\n\nThe vehicle “started to slow roll” at which point Appellant jumped out and ran\n\ntoward a house, ignoring commands to stop. (RR47:122–23).      Appellant tried but\n\nwas unable to open the front door of the house. (RR47:123).       Ralston and his\n\npartner apprehended him. (RR47:123–24). He told the officers “he had told [the\n\ndriver, his wife Daphne Johnson] to continue to go and not stop because he had\n\nwarrants for his arrest.” (RR47:125). Appellant was later convicted of evading\n\narrest and given one year of probation. (RR47:127-28; SX#168). His probation\n\nwas subsequently revoked and he was sentenced to 180 days in jail. (RR47:128;\n\nSX#168).\n\n\n      On August 7, 1995, Garland Neighborhood Police Officer M.G. Clark was\n\ndispatched to locate Appellant, who was wanted on an ongoing aggravated assault\n\nwith a deadly weapon call. (RR47:132-33). Throughout the night, Appellant had\n\nbeen making threatening phone calls and police had received a tip he was at a\n\nparticular location. (RR47:133-34). Clark located Appellant and arrested him for\n\noutstanding warrants and the aggravated assault case. (RR47:134-37). At the jail,\n\nAppellant threatened Clark so Clark filed a retaliation case against Appellant,\n\n                                       18 \n \n\fprimarily for record purposes. (RR47:138-40). Appellant was later convicted of\n\nthe aggravated assault and sentenced to ten years in prison, probated for five years.\n\n(RR47:140–41, 143; SX #169).       The complainant on the aggravated assault case\n\nwas Courtney Johnson. (RR47:143; SX#169).           The retaliation charge was no-\n\nbilled. (RR47:144).\n\n\n      On October 9, 2002, Garland Police Officers Clay Lacey and Gary\n\nSteadman responded to a hit-and-run call. (RR47:147, 155).         The person who\n\ncalled police was following the vehicle that was involved in the hit-and-run.\n\n(RR47:148, 155).      By the time Lacy arrived at the scene, “the person in the car\n\nwas getting out.” (RR47:148-49).       Lacy and Steadman searched the area and\n\neventually found and apprehended Appellant.            (RR47: 150–151, 155–57).\n\nAppellant repeatedly ignored Steadman’s commands to stop running and to get on\n\nthe ground. (RR47:157-58). Steadman eventually tackled Appellant and arrested\n\nhim for evading arrest.    (RR47:158-60). Appellant was later convicted of the\n\noffense and sentenced to 75 days in jail. (RR47:160-61; SX#170).\n\n\n      On June 14, 2004, Digna Salmeron was in her truck preparing to leave for\n\nwork when she heard a knock on the window. (RR47:182, 191). The man stated\n\nhe was sick and needed to use a phone to call an ambulance. (RR47:183). Scared,\n\nSalmeron told the man she did not have a phone. (RR47:183-84). The man “just\n\nwent at [her].” (RR47:184). He tried to force his way into the truck. (RR47:184–\n                                         19 \n \n\f85, 191). The man eventually wrested the keys away from Salmeron and threw her\n\ninto the yard. (RR47:186). He then started the truck and left. (RR47:186). He later\n\nwrecked Salmeron’s truck, rendering it inoperable. (RR47:188, 197). Salmeron\n\ncould not fully identify the person who did this to her, except that he was a big and\n\nstrong Black man. (RR47:189, 192-93).\n\n\n      Garland Police Officer Matthew St. Clair was dispatched as backup on the\n\ncall regarding the carjacking of Salmeron’s truck.    (RR47:165, 167).     When St.\n\nClair arrived in the area, Officer McClendon had already located the stolen vehicle\n\nand “was in the midst of a . . . high speed vehicle pursuit through some\n\nneighborhoods.” (RR47:166-67).        The driver – Appellant – “lost control and\n\nwrecked out and struck a wall, some parked cars in a driveway, and the corner of a\n\nhouse.” (RR47:168, 170). At that point, Appellant got out and attempted to flee\n\non foot.   (RR47:170). He was eventually taken into custody. (RR47:171-72).\n\nAppellant was subsequently convicted of robbery and sentenced to five years in\n\nprison and assessed a $1,500 fine.       (RR47:175-76; SX#171).        He was also\n\nconvicted of evading arrest, sentenced to a year in state jail, and assessed a $1,500\n\nfine. (RR47:175-76; SX#171).\n\n\n      On September 13, 2004, Garland Police Lieutenant John Spera responded to\n\n“a family disturbance” call.      (RR47:78-79). “[T]here was a suspect there\n\nattempting to kick the door in and that there was also a protective order on him.”\n                                         20 \n \n\f(RR47:79-80). The complainant was Daphne Johnson. (RR47:80). Daphne told\n\npolice that Appellant “had told her he was coming over to get some money and that\n\nhe would kick in the door if he had to.” (RR47:84).    Footprints were visible on\n\nthe door. (RR47:85). There were two children in the apartment at the time.\n\n(RR47:87). Appellant was subsequently convicted for violation of a protective\n\norder and sentenced to 330 days in jail. (RR47:97; SX#166).\n\n      The State also presented evidence of a theft committed by Appellant against\n\nhis former employer. David Contente owns Kwik Kar Oil and Wash in Mesquite.\n\n(RR48:157).   Appellant worked for him in December 2010, performing State\n\ninspections and helping out in the shop. (RR48:158-61). He later became a\n\ncashier. (RR48:161, 183). Appellant worked ten hours a day, five days a week.\n\n(RR48:180).   He was reliable and was given a set of keys to the business.\n\n(RR48:162, 164). Appellant did not handle conflict well, however. (RR48:163).\n\n“He was too rigid, in our rules, you know.” (RR48:163).\n\n      On November 14, 2011, Appellant called Contente at 5:00 in the morning.\n\n(RR48:163-64). Appellant “said I needed to come down to the store so he could\n\ntalk to me and that he had done a bad thing.” (RR48:164). Contente went to his\n\ncomputer and tried to access the surveillance cameras at the store, but the camera\n\nwas blacked out. (RR48:165, 166; SX#175-178). Contente “went to the police\n\ndepartment and asked a policeman to go down there with me.” (RR48:170). He\n\n\n                                       21 \n \n\f“thought the worst.” (RR48:171). The police accompanied him to the store.\n\n(RR48:171). There, Contente discovered that three state inspection booklets, $325\n\nin cash, and a monitor were missing. (RR48:172-73). The inspection booklets and\n\nthe cash were taken from the safe. (RR48:172-73). The booklets are valued at\n\n$2100. (RR48:172). Footage from surveillance camera showed Appellant in the\n\nstore earlier that morning and that Saturday night. (RR48:174; SX#173, 174).\n\nAppellant was arrested. (RR48:178). The monitor was returned but the inspection\n\nbooklets and the cash were not. (RR48:175, 178; SX#174).\n\n      On April 15, 2012, at 5:30 in the morning, Appellant was brought into the\n\nemergency room by Dallas police and paramedics. (RR48:190-91; SX#188).        He\n\nwas handcuffed, “highly agitated” and “somewhat combative.” (RR48:194). He\n\nwas in a substance-induced psychosis. (RR48:202-03). It took eight or nine\n\npeople to hold Appellant on the bed. (RR48:194). He had to be placed in a body\n\nnet, a four-point restraint that lays over the patient and attaches to the bed.\n\n(RR48:194-95).   The more the staff tried to hold Appellant down, the more\n\nagitated it made him. (RR48:195). Appellant made several statements: “I hope\n\nthey’re getting this on TV, God is watching all of this, XLT and divorce is a bad\n\nthing, and I’m going to grab your gun.”      (RR48:197).    Once Appellant was\n\nmedicated he calmed down. (RR48:198). He reported that he had being smoking\n\n\n\n\n                                       22 \n \n\fcrack cocaine, ice, and marijuana laced with PCP. (RR48:198). He did not report\n\nany mental health concerns. (RR48:199-200, 208).\n\n      Parker was not involved in his discharge, but per hospital protocol,\n\nAppellant would have been offered information and resources regarding drug\n\ntreatment. (RR48:200-01, 205, 208-09).\n\n      On the morning of April 26, 2012, Carina Pinzon was working as a\n\nhousekeeper at the Express Inn in Garland. (RR48:101). She was cleaning one of\n\nthe rooms and left the door propped open with her cart. (RR48:102). When she\n\nwas cleaning the bathroom, a man moved her cart and entered the room.\n\n(RR48:102-03).    Pinzon turned around when the man touched her shoulder.\n\n(RR48:103-04). He said something to her in English, but she did not understand\n\nhim. (RR48:103). She asked if he needed something. (RR48:103). At that point,\n\nshe noticed that the zipper on his pants was down. (RR48:104, 108). “[H]e had\n\nhis penis outside and that’s when I got scared.” (RR48:104). His penis was erect.\n\n(RR48:108).   He tried to grab her hand. (RR48:105). Pinzon threw a bucket of\n\nwater at him, pushed him and ran away. (RR48:105). She ran to the office and\n\nher manager called the police. (RR48:105-06).\n\n      Garland Police Officer Mark Mendoza was dispatched to the Express Inn.\n\n(RR48:117-18). There, he spoke with Pinzon and got a description of the suspect.\n\n(RR48:119). He then consulted with the manager to determine whether the suspect\n\n\n                                         23 \n \n\fwas a guest at the motel. (RR48:119). The manager gave him some names and\n\nMendoza went to those rooms. (RR48:120). Appellant was one of the possible\n\nsuspects.   (RR48:120). Mendoza recognized Appellant from a prior arrest.\n\n(RR48:120). Appellant allowed Mendoza into his motel room, which smelled of\n\nmarijuana. (RR48:121, 129). Mendoza noticed that Appellant’s clothes were wet.\n\n(RR48:121, 123).     Appellant told Mendoza that he had been smoking crack all\n\nnight, but he did not appear intoxicated. (RR48:121, 123, 130). Mendoza asked if\n\nAppellant had anything illegal in his room. (RR48:122). Appellant advised that he\n\n“probably had a crack pipe or something somewhere in the room.” (RR48:122).\n\nMendoza asked Appellant about the incident with Pinzon. (RR48:122). Appellant\n\ntold him that “he was just trying to drop off some towels to the room.”\n\n(RR48:122). Pinzon confirmed Appellant was the man who had exposed himself to\n\nher.   (RR48:124).   Appellant was not arrested, but he was issued a criminal\n\ntrespass warning and was ordered to leave the motel. (RR48:124-25).\n\n       Mendoza had previously arrested Appellant on May 31, 1994. Mendoza and\n\nhis partner, Officer Ehrman, were dispatched to the scene of a man and woman\n\nfighting on the side of the road. (RR48:111-12).      Upon arrival, the officers\n\nseparated Appellant and the woman and ran a check for outstanding warrants.\n\n(RR48:112). They seated Appellant in the patrol car. (RR48:113). When Officer\n\nMendoza opened the door to notify Appellant that he would be arrested on a\n\n\n                                       24 \n \n\fwarrant, Appellant “came charging out of the back [of the] squad car, like trying to\n\nget away, and we began wrestling with him.” (RR48:113). Appellant put up “a\n\npretty good struggle.” (RR48:114).     He bit Mendoza on the arm. (RR48:114).\n\nHe bit Ehrman. (RR48:114). He bit Ehrman so hard that he bit through the\n\nofficer’s watch. (RR48:114). Appellant later pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and\n\nwas sentenced to twelve months’ probation.         (RR48:115-16; SX#189).       His\n\nprobation was revoked and he was sentenced to 365 days in jail. (RR48:116;\n\nSX#189).\n\n      Carlton Jenkins was incarcerated with Appellant at the Rudd Unit for two\n\nmonths in 2005. (RR47:201, 203, 238). They were bunkmates. (RR47:202). At\n\nfirst, Appellant and Jenkins had “a decent relationship.” (RR47:205).       Jenkins\n\ntestified that Appellant “stopped going to work . . . [and] was confined to the\n\nhousing unit then.” (RR47:207).      Several times, Appellant was not able to buy\n\ngroceries at the commissary. (RR47:210). Jenkins shared some of his food with\n\nhim. (RR47:211).     The bunkmates’ relationship began to change. (RR47:214).\n\nJenkins saw Appellant sitting on the head of his bed, which is a sign of disrespect.\n\n(RR47:214).    Appellant’s “demeanor went south.” (RR47:215). Appellant “quit\n\nschool, too.” (RR47:216). He “was on confined housing.” (RR47:216). Jenkins\n\ntried to talk to Appellant but “It went bad.” (RR47:219).\n\n\n\n\n                                        25 \n \n\f      July 25, 2005 “was GI day.” (RR47:220). “[E]verybody cleans the dorm.”\n\n(RR47:220).     Afterwards, Appellant “was sitting on [Jenkins’] bunk.”\n\n(RR47:222). Jenkins told Appellant that they needed to talk because he wanted\n\nAppellant to stop disrespecting him. (RR47:223, 247). The men went to the back\n\nof the dorm. (RR47:223, 248). There, “[Appellant] assaulted [Jenkins].       He\n\nswung at [him].” (RR47:223). He hit Jenkins in the head. (RR47:224). The men\n\n“sort of grabbed each other[.]” (RR47:224). They separated when they thought a\n\nguard was approaching. (RR47:225). Then, they “went back and then [they]\n\nfought some more.” (RR47:225). Appellant grabbed Jenkins below his knees and\n\nflipped him, causing Jenkins’ head to his the concrete floor. (RR47:226, 233).\n\nJenkins “split [his] head open.” (RR47:227).     He was bleeding; “[t]here was\n\nblood everywhere.” (RR47:227-28).     Jenkins was transferred to another unit to\n\nreceive medical treatment. (RR47:230).      The injury to his head required nine\n\nstaples. (RR47:230–231; SX #172). Jenkins also suffered bruising from blows to\n\nhis face and head. (RR47:232). Appellant was sent to solitary confinement.\n\n(RR47:230).\n\n\n      Ashley Villegas worked for a year as a correctional officer with the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice (“TDCJ”) at the Price Daniel Unit in Snyder,\n\nTexas. (RR47:256-57). Villegas worked the overnight shift, from 9:00 p.m. to\n\n5:00 a.m., which required that every two hours she walk the unit and count the\n\n                                      26 \n \n\finmates. (RR47:260, 262).        On February 14, 2006, when she arrived at\n\nAppellant’s cell during her 1:00 a.m. count, she “noticed the offender having one\n\narm up on his door and the other arm on his penis masturbating and looking at me\n\nand smiling like with a grin, I guess as if he thought it was funny.” (RR47:263-\n\n64).   Appellant’s pants were down and his penis was visible.         (RR47:264).\n\nVillegas testified that Appellant was “known as . . . a high profile inmate so that\n\nmeans that all the officers knew who he was, but not in a good way, because they\n\nhad also written disciplinary reports on him, too.” (RR47:271).\n\n\n       Jennifer Pyburn is a detention officer at the Lew Sterrett Jail. (RR48:134).\n\nAt one time, Appellant was under her supervision. (RR48:137). One time when\n\nPyburn was escorting Appellant to a visit, he turned around “and he was like, I\n\nought to just pull you in here, which is like the visitation door.” (RR48:145).\n\nAppellant “didn’t say it in a mean - - mean way[.]” (RR48:145). He was smiling.\n\n(RR48:145). Appellant later apologized. (RR48:155).\n\n       On another occasion, Pyburn observed an interaction between Appellant and\n\nanother detention officer when Appellant was disrespectful. (RR48:147-48). The\n\nofficer told Appellant the shower he was supposed to be cleaning was not clean\n\nenough.    (RR48:147).    Appellant told her that was the way he cleaned it.\n\n(RR48:147-48). When Pyburn instructed Appellant how to clean the shower, he\n\ntold her that “we do not pay him enough to clean the shower.” (RR48:149).\n\n                                        27 \n \n\f      Pyburn testified that although it is against the rules, inmates tattoo\n\nthemselves while in jail.     (RR48:140-41).      The tattooing device is usually\n\nfashioned using staples or parts from a dismantled intercom and the ink is created\n\nusing colorful candy. (RR48:140-41).\n\n      Melodye Nelson, a 25-year veteran of TDCJ, testified as an expert on the\n\nprison system in Texas. (RR48:18). She is the senior warden of the female death\n\nrow located at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas. (RR48:19). She\n\npreviously served as a major at the male death row located at the Polunsky Unit in\n\nLivingston, Texas for over three years. (RR48:18-19). Nelson testified generally\n\nabout the types of facilities, number of inmates and guards statewide, and how\n\ninmates are classified within the system.\n\n      When an inmate arrives at TDCJ, he is sent to intake in order to determine\n\nhis custody level. (RR48:32).      Among the factors considered are the inmate’s\n\nhistory of incarceration and prior jail conduct, as well as the nature of his current\n\noffense and the length of his sentence. (RR48:31-32). General Population 1, or\n\n“G1,” are those offenders who are the lowest risk. (RR48:32, 34). A G1 may be a\n\ntrustee, which allows him or her to live and work outside of the facility’s perimeter\n\nfences. (RR48:34). General Population 2, or “G2,” is the largest percentage of\n\nthe general inmate population.      A G2 may live in a dormitory and work in\n\nmaintenance, food service or laundry. (RR48:41). General Population 3, or “G3,”\n\n\n                                            28 \n \n\fincludes inmates serving 50 years or more. (RR48:32). A G3 is not allowed into\n\npublic unrestrained and without armed supervision. (RR48:35). A G3 “cannot be\n\nassigned anywhere on a facility that they would have access to multiple areas, such\n\nas maintenance crews.” (RR48:41). G3s are permitted contact visits with their\n\nimmediate family. (RR48:58). General Population 4, or “G4,” are those inmates\n\nwho are disciplinary problems. (RR48:32). A G4’s movement and job assignment\n\nare very restricted. (RR48:42). General Population 5, or “G5,” are those inmates\n\nwho are disciplinary problems and exhibit assaultive behaviors. (RR48:32-33).\n\nFinally, administrative segregation is reserved for inmates with multiple\n\ndisciplinary incidents or gang affiliation or inmates who “have posed a threat - - a\n\ncontinuing threat to the safety and security of our institutions.” (RR48:44). The\n\ninmate’s initial classification is then referred to a State Classification Committee.\n\n(RR48:33). Based on that classification, the inmate will be assigned to a facility\n\nwithin TDCJ. (RR48:33). Once in that facility the Unit Classification Committee\n\nwill monitor and adjust the inmate’s custody level. (RR48:33).\n\n      An inmate convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without parole\n\nis classified as a G3 upon arrival at TDCJ. (RR48:48).           A capital murderer\n\nsentenced to life without parole will never receive a classification better than G3,\n\nalthough they may be classified as a G4 or G5 or placed in administrative\n\nsegregation. (RR48:48).\n\n\n                                         29 \n \n\f      With regard to death row inmates, there are three custody levels: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n(RR48:46). Nelson described them as follows:\n\n      Death Row 1 meaning no disciplinaries, not a behavior problem; 2\n      would be the same thing, had a major disciplinary case; and a Death\n      Row 3 would be assaultive death row, or assaultive disciplinary case.\n      And we keep them as a D3 30 days. We review them. If they haven’t\n      had another assaultive case, we move them up to a D2. A Death Row\n      2, Level 2 stays there 90 days. At the 90-day mark, we review them,\n      and if they haven’t had some continued disciplinary problems, we - -\n      we bump them back up to a Death Row Level 1, a D1.\n\n(RR48:46). All death row inmates are housed in one-man cells and most are\n\nallowed up to two hours of recreation per day. (RR48: 46, 77). They are allowed\n\ntwo hours of visitation once a week as well as a visit from a spiritual advisor.\n\n(RR48:77).\n\n      TDCJ maintains some records of inmates’ disciplinary infractions.\n\n(RR48:36). Records of minor infractions are not maintained; they are shredded.\n\n(RR48:36).    Minor infractions include:      being out-of-place; giving things to\n\nanother inmate; failing to obey a direct order; not going to school, etc. (RR48:38).\n\nOften, verbal confrontations between the inmate and a guard do not result in a\n\ndisciplinary case.   (RR48:38). Nelson testified death row inmates have been\n\ninvolved in assaults on other inmates, assaults on staff, sexual misconduct,\n\npossession of contraband, possession of weapons, possession of drugs, and\n\npossession of cell phones.     (RR48:47). For demonstrative purposes, Nelson\n\n\n\n                                        30 \n \n\fbrought some weapons she has confiscated from inmates over the years made from\n\nmaterials like cardboard, parts of a typewriter, screws, and pencils. (RR48:59-62).\n\n                                 Appellant’s Case\n\n      Appellant testified regarding his upbringing, drug use and the instant\n\noffense. He testified he has been using crack cocaine for “about 14 years[]” and\n\nhas experimented with alcohol and PCP.        (RR49:8).     He testified he began\n\nsmoking marijuana at seven years of age. (RR49:9). He bought it with his\n\nallowance money. (RR49:9).\n\n      Appellant testified he was released from prison in July 2009 and relapsed in\n\nOctober of 2011. (RR49:11). He started smoking crack and “ice.” (RR49:11).\n\nAt first, it was only on weekends. (RR49:12).        He was still paying his bills.\n\n(RR49:12). His relapse was “devastating.” (RR49:16). It made him lazy and he\n\nfell into a deep depression. (RR49:16). “I stayed home in the dark, you know, just\n\nwas embarrassed, ashamed.” (RR49:16).\n\n      On the night before the offense, Appellant went by himself to his brother\n\nAnthony’s wedding reception.       (RR49:19).     He stayed for about an hour.\n\n(RR49:24). Everybody was happy and having a good time, but Appellant felt like\n\nhe was in his own personal hell. (RR49:19-20). Because he had missed so much\n\nwork due to his drug use, Appellant had lost his job. (RR49:20).       He also felt\n\nashamed of his clothes and hair. (RR49:22).\n\n\n                                        31 \n \n\f         Appellant went home, ate dinner, then walked back to the party. (RR49:25-\n\n26).     He told his cousin that he messed up his car when he put gas mixed with\n\nwater in the tank. (RR49:26-28). The cousin gave him $30 and suggested how to\n\nfix it. (RR49:27-28). Appellant was drunk, so he used the money “to get high.”\n\n(RR49:28).      For the next several hours, Appellant “[c]ontinued to smoke, sell a\n\nlittle bit, smoke, sell a little bit, smoke.” (RR49:28).   He also had some Xanax to\n\nuse when it was time to return home to babysit his daughter. (RR49:29).\n\n         At about 6 o’clock in the morning, Appellant walked back to his brother’s\n\nhouse. (RR49:30). He found a bottle of wine on the patio and drank the whole\n\nthing.     (RR49:30).   He “wanted money.         I wanted to get high on crack.”\n\n(RR49:30). He saw a plastic water bottle. (RR49:30). He put lighter fluid in it.\n\n(RR49:30). He was “[j]ust going to take it and scare the person.” (RR49:30). He\n\nplanned to “[p]our it on her.” (RR49:30). It was going to be a “scare tactic.”\n\n(RR49:31). Although he did not remember having a lighter, he acknowledged he\n\nwould have had to have one to smoke crack. (RR49:32).\n\n         Appellant walked across the street to the Whip-In. (RR49:31). He wanted\n\nto get the money and leave. (RR49:32). He did not intend to set Nancy on fire.\n\n(RR49:31).      Appellant walked inside and “saw a lady.” (RR49:33). She was\n\ngetting the mop bucket ready. (RR49:33). Appellant walked behind the counter.\n\n(RR49:33). Nancy followed him and told him he was not supposed to be behind\n\n\n                                          32 \n \n\fthe counter. (RR49:33). When she got close to him “I just poured the fluid over\n\nher head. At that time I remember she was - - started trembling.” (RR49:33).\n\n      Appellant told Nancy to open the cash register because he wanted the\n\nmoney. (RR49:33).        While she was opening the register, he took a lighter and\n\nsome cigarettes.      (RR49:33).    He did not remember taking Nancy’s ring.\n\n(RR49:33-34).      Nancy opened the register and moved away.           (RR49:34).\n\nAppellant took the money. (RR49:34). He warned Nancy to stand back because\n\nhe had a lighter. (RR49:34). She moved toward him and he “flipped [the lighter]\n\nonce to try to scare her but that didn’t stop her.” (RR49:34). Nancy reached\n\nacross him again. (RR49:34). It “spooked” Appellant so he flicked the lighter\n\n“again, twice, hoping that she would move back.” (RR49:34).           That’s when\n\nNancy’s clothes ignited. (RR49:35). Appellant was not thinking. (RR49:35-36).\n\nHe was intoxicated; he had smoked nearly $100 worth of crack, consumed alcohol,\n\nand had taken a Xanax. (RR49:36). He did not think to help Nancy once she was\n\non fire. (RR49:36).\n\n      Appellant “knew [he] had [done] a bad thing, so [he] just - - [he] just ran.”\n\n(RR49:41). He ran and hid in some bushes and smoked a cigarette. (RR49:41).\n\nHe “got tired of laying in those bushes, so when [he] came out, that’s when [he]\n\nsaw the police car parked at the end of the street.” (RR49:40-41). Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                                        33 \n \n\fstarted running. (RR49:41).                                      When he tired of running, he sat on a porch and\n\nwaited for the police. (RR49:41).\n\n              Appellant remembered “tussling” with Marecle but did not remember his\n\nencounter with Denson.                                         (RR49:41). He remembered stealing a bicycle.\n\n(RR49:41-42).                           He testified he thought the ride to the police station was “very\n\nshort. It was like I just closed my eyes and opened my eyes and I was there.”\n\n(RR49:42).                      When he was in the patrol car, he did not understand what he had\n\ndone. (RR49:43).\n\n              Appellant’s testified that his parents were married. (RR49:46, 90). His\n\nmother worked during the day and his father worked at night. (RR49:46). They\n\ntook him to church and taught him right from wrong. (RR49:90). Appellant has\n\ntwo brothers, Anthony and Timothy. (RR49:47). Anthony went into the military.\n\n(RR49:47). Timothy “has been in prison half his life.” (RR49:47).\n\n              When Appellant was five years old, a cousin “put his penis in my mouth,\n\n[and] peed in my mouth.”8 (RR49:50). Appellant’s cousins and uncle laughed at\n\nhim. (RR49:50). When he was eight, the family friend he bought drugs from,\n\nfondled him.                        (RR49:48).                 “He pulled my penis out and wanted to suck it.”\n\n(RR49:48).                      Appellant “let him do it for a little while, but then [he] knew that\n\n\n                                                            \n8\n  Appellant testified he never said anything about childhood sexual abuse prior to counsel on the\ninstant offense. (RR49:91). He never mentioned it during previous incarcerations or when he\nwas hospitalized because he thought it “was irrelevant at the time.” (RR49:91).\n                                                                        34 \n \n\fwasn’t right.” (RR49:48). He told him to stop. (RR49:48). Appellant still bought\n\ndrugs from him. (RR49:48-49).       Appellant used the fondling incident “to hold\n\nover [the friend’s] head.” (RR49:49). Appellant threatened to tell about the abuse\n\nand the man “gave [him] what [he] wanted.” (RR49:49).\n\n      Appellant testified that when he dated Amy Armstrong they fought and\n\nargued. (RR49:53-54). He admitted that he hit Armstrong, but “I didn’t just hit\n\nher enough just to really hurt her, but just enough to make her stop hitting me[.]”\n\n(RR49:53). He testified he threw the burning log on her patio “to get her to come\n\noutside, get her to let me in. I had nowhere to go.” (RR49:54).\n\n      Appellant is married to Daphne Johnson.        They have three daughters.\n\nAppellant and Daphne started dating when he was fifteen years old and married\n\nwhen they were eighteen. (RR49:52, 55). Appellant admitted that he used to hit\n\nDaphne. (RR49:55). He never hit her “enough to just hurt her, just enough to back\n\nher off.” (RR49:57).\n\n      Appellant dropped out of school when he was in eleventh grade. (RR49:46).\n\nHe was never placed in special education classes, but he was in “basic classes.”\n\n(RR49:91).     He took courses in auto body technology at Richland College.\n\n(RR49:91). Appellant testified he “learn[s] at a slow pace[,]” but he does not have\n\na learning disability. (RR49:92).\n\n\n\n\n                                        35 \n \n\f      Appellant worked at a company called Sanden for about five years, from\n\n1997 until 2002. (RR49:58). He started on the assembly line, but was promoted\n\nfour times, all the way to repairman. (RR49:59). He was eventually fired because\n\nhe missed too many days of work. (RR49:58-59).        At the time, he was using\n\ndrugs on the weekends and “it carried on until the Mondays and Tuesdays[.]”\n\n(RR49:59).   After he was fired, Appellant checked himself into Green Oaks\n\nHospital to be treated for drug abuse. (RR49:59).   He was there for a week and\n\nwas diagnosed with depression. (RR49:60).      After Green Oaks, he was sent to\n\nSummer Sky in Stephenville for further inpatient treatment.           (RR49:60).\n\nAppellant spent 35 days at Summer Sky. (RR49:60). He “wasn’t ready [to leave],\n\nbut [his] insurance ran out.” (RR49:61). He spent a week in a halfway house, then\n\nreturned home to his wife. (RR49:61). Upon his return home, he stayed sober for\n\na few weeks, then went back to using crack and marijuana and drinking alcohol.\n\n(RR49:61-62).\n\n      Appellant testified he was “under the influence[]” when he stole Salmeron’s\n\ntruck and “coming down off of [drugs]” during the theft of the Kwik Kar’s money\n\nand inspection books. (RR49:62, 75). Appellant testified he did not remember the\n\nincident with Pinzon. (RR49:118). Every time he has been in trouble, it was\n\nbecause of the drugs and depression. (RR49:99-100). He was depressed “because\n\nI couldn’t do more for my family and myself.” (RR49:99). He testified the first\n\n\n                                       36 \n \n\ftime he spoke with Daphne after the instant offense, he “couldn’t remember what\n\n[he] had done.” (RR49:80). Appellant confirmed his criminal history:\n\n       September 15, 1991: At 15, Appellant was arrested driving a stolen car.\n        (RR49:100).\n\n       February 4, 1992:     He was arrested for pushing a police officer.\n        (RR49:100).\n\n       December 9, 1992: He was arrested for theft. (RR49:100).\n\n       August 13, 1993:        He was arrested for assaulting Armstrong.\n        (RR49:100-01).\n\n       September 8, 1993: He was arrested after he threw the burning object\n        onto Armstrong’s patio. (RR49:101).\n\n       September 9, 1993: He was arrested for possession of marijuana.\n        (RR49:102). This is the only drug charge Appellant has ever had.\n        (RR49:102).\n\n       February 8, 1994: Appellant was arrested for outstanding warrants.\n        (RR49:102).\n\n       April 16, 1994: He was arrested for an outstanding warrant on the\n        marijuana charge. (RR49:102).\n\n       May 31, 1994: He was arrested for assault warrants. (RR49:103). This\n        is when he bit Officers Mendoza and Ehrman. (RR49:103).\n\n       July 23, 1994: Appellant directed Daphne not to stop the car when the\n        police were trying to pull her over. (RR49:103).\n\n       August 7, 1995: He was arrested for aggravated assault against Daphne’s\n        sister, Courtney Johnson. (RR49:104).\n\n       June 9, 2002: He was issued a Class C assault citation for hitting\n        Daphne. (RR49:105).\n\n                                      37 \n \n\f       October 9, 2002: He was arrested for evading arrest. (RR49:105).\n\n       November 15, 2002: He was arrested for assaulting Daphne.\n        (RR49:105).\n\n       July 3, 2003: Appellant did not remember walking up and hitting Daphne\n        as she sat in the drive though at Braum’s. (RR49:106). But, he did not\n        deny that the incident happened. (RR49:47).\n\n       September 7, 2003: He was arrested for assaulting Daphne. (RR49:107).\n\n       January 5, 2004: He was arrested for theft. (RR49:107)\n\n       June 19, 2004: He was arrested for robbing Salmeron. (RR49:107).\n\n       September 13, 2004:            He violated Daphne’s protective order.\n        (RR49:108).\n\n      Appellant testified the reason he set Nancy on fire was because she was\n\ncoming at him. (RR49:120). Appellant acknowledged that when he was arrested,\n\nhe only told police that he had consumed cocaine and two beers prior to the\n\noffense.      (RR49:120).   He did not mention the bottle of wine or the Xanax.\n\n(RR49:120). “It was irrelevant. I was intoxicated.” (RR49:120).\n\n      Photographs of Appellant’s tattoos were admitted into evidence.\n\n(RR49:130-33; SX#179-186). Appellant testified he got several of them while he\n\nwas in prison.       He acknowledged that he was never caught for those rule\n\nviolations.     (RR49:132). Recently, while incarcerated for the instant offense,\n\n\n\n\n                                         38 \n \n\fAppellant had “Gift from God” tattooed around his collarbone. (RR49:132, 133).\n\nHe did not get caught for this rule violation. (RR49:132).\n\n        Appellant’s supervisor from Sanden testified that Appellant was a good\n\nworker. (RR49:137-38, 141). His only problem was his attendance. (RR49:142).\n\nSeveral co-workers testified Appellant was polite and friendly. (RR49:149-50,\n\n157, 162). They testified this offense was out-of-character. (RR49:153, 158-59,\n\n166).\n\n        Daphne Johnson testified she is Appellant’s wife. (RR49:184). She testified\n\nwhen they married, they were immature. (RR49:186). They struggled financially,\n\nthey did not communicate well, and their arguments got physical. (RR49:186).\n\nThey hit each other. (RR49:217). Daphne did not remember reporting to police\n\nthat Appellant had made threatening phone calls. (RR49:219).          She did not\n\nremember her sister filing an aggravated assault charge against Appellant.\n\n(RR49:220).\n\n        In an application for protective order, Daphne alleged that on December 9,\n\n2003, Appellant “became angry and punched [her] in the face.”          (RR49:223;\n\nSX#193). She also wrote that Appellant “very frequently” did the following:\n\ncalled her names and criticized her; tried to keep her from doing something; going\n\nout with friends; gave her angry looks or stares; prevented her from having money\n\nfor her own use; threatened to hit or throw something at her; pushed, grabbed, or\n\n\n                                         39 \n \n\fshoved her; put down her family or friends; and, slapped, hit or punched her.\n\n(RR49:222; SX#193). In the affidavit, Daphne also detailed Appellant’s prior\n\nassaults.   (RR49:223-24; SX#193).      In November of 2003, Daphne locked\n\nAppellant out when he came home very late. (RR49:224). He beat and banged on\n\nthe door.     (RR49:224).   When Daphne finally let him in, he pushed her.\n\n(RR49:224). In October of 2003, Daphne again locked the door when Appellant\n\nwent out. (RR49:224). Appellant kicked in the door and punched her in the face\n\nand chest. (RR49:224). She suffered a black eye, scratches on her face and neck,\n\nand soreness and pain. (RR49:224). She was unable to work for two weeks.\n\n(RR49:224). Daphne wrote:\n\n      Over the last nine years, Matthew has been physically violent and\n      abusive to me. He has hit me, punched me, slapped me, kicked me\n      once, strangled me, pushed and shoved me, and thrown me around.\n      I’ve had bruises, black eyes, a bloody nose, a busted lip, scratches;\n      soreness, swelling and pain.\n\n(SX#193).\n\n      Daphne first became aware of Appellant’s drug use after his grandmother\n\ndied. (RR49:187). He “would go off on binges” and disappear for a day or two.\n\n(RR49:188).     Appellant would get physical with Daphne when he was high.\n\n(RR49:198). Daphne kicked him out of the house four to six times. (RR49:190).\n\nShe tried to talk to him about his drug use. (RR49:195). He tried to stop using on\n\nhis own. (RR49:195). Appellant also suffers from depression. (RR49:209). The\n\n\n                                       40 \n \n\fdepression became more frequent after the Kwik Kar incident. (RR49:210). In\n\nDaphne’s opinion, Appellant was high at the time of the offense. (RR49:243). She\n\ntestified that Appellant “was an awesome father” to their three daughters.\n\n(RR49:192).\n\n      Pharmacologist Dr. John Roache testified as an expert regarding illegal\n\ndrugs and addiction. (RR50:27). Roache testified addiction is “a learning process\n\nthat happens with repeated use of drugs of abuse.” (RR50:30-31).\n\n      Cocaine is a stimulant. (RR50:33). It increases wakefulness and vigilance\n\nand produces feelings of intense euphoria and motivation. (RR50:34). Marijuana\n\nis a plant and a mild hallucinogen. (RR50:34). Phencyclidine or, PCP, is a\n\nhallucinogen. (RR50:35). A user feels “superhuman empowered.” (RR50:35). It\n\ncan also produce “psychotic like effects, where you can have hallucinations,\n\nparanoia, and extreme agitation.” (RR50:35).      Methamphetamine or “ice,” is a\n\nstimulant, which produces effects similar to cocaine. (RR50:35).       Xanax is a\n\nbenzodiazepine. (RR50:36). It is a sedative and used to treat anxiety. (RR50:36).\n\n      Commonly, an addict will use multiple chemical substances. (RR50:37).\n\nThis is referred to as poly-substance dependence or poly-substance abuse.\n\n(RR50:37). When an individual is under the influence, he may be more impulsive.\n\n(RR50:37). “[T]he addict becomes more driven for the immediate consequences\n\nof the drug experience and less thoughtful or conscientious or cognitively decisive\n\n\n                                        41 \n \n\fabout longer term consequences.” (RR50:37-38). Often, addicts have relapses\n\nafter periods of sobriety. (RR50:43).\n\n      Roache conceded that when Appellant checked himself into the hospital in\n\n2002, he was depressed because he was unable to quit using drugs. (RR50:44).\n\nIndeed, the discharge instructions indicate “The patient was profoundly depressed\n\nbecause of his inability to stop doing drugs, and having observed his many losses,\n\nincluding job, family, financial, and clearly self esteem.” (RR50:53; DX#22).\n\nRoache conceded that while incarcerated prior to trial, Appellant was not\n\ndiagnosed with depression, but with poly-substance abuse and substance-induced\n\nmood disorder. (RR50:45).\n\n      Although Roache did not review the surveillance video of this offense, he\n\nopined Appellant was intoxicated at the time he committed the offense.\n\n(RR50:45). Roache did not think it was “necessary[]” to review the surveillance\n\nvideo. (RR50:45-46).\n\n      Frank AuBuchon testified as an expert on the Texas prison system. He\n\ndescribed the various classification levels and the types of housing available.\n\n(RR50:146-47, 151, 158, 160-61). AuBuchon reviewed Appellant’s entire\n\nclassification file, records of Appellant’s incarceration at the Dallas County Jail, a\n\nsummary of Appellant’s extraneous offenses, and a summary of the instant offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         42 \n \n\f(RR50:145-46). AuBuchon testified Appellant will go into TDCJ as a G3 and will\n\nbe placed in a high security unit. (RR50:157).\n\n              Dr. Jonathan Sorensen testified that he conducted an actuarial analysis to\n\ndetermine the probability that Appellant will be violent in prison. (RR51:22, 27;\n\nDX#25). Sorensen opined that Appellant “will fare better than the average\n\nincoming capital offender.” (RR51:30; DX#26). The factors that decreased\n\nAppellant’s risk of violence include: his age; his educational level; a lack of a\n\ndisruptive group or gang affiliation; his prior prison behavior and classification\n\nlevel; and, the fact that he would be serving life without the possibility of parole.\n\n(RR51:30-31, 38, 42, 44). The factors that increased Appellant’s level of risk\n\ninclude: his prior incarceration; his prior assaults while incarcerated; and, the fact\n\nthat his capital murder involved a contemporaneous robbery. (RR51:45-46, 20-\n\n51).\n\n              James Aiken, a prison consultant who has never worked in a Texas prison,\n\ntestified that Appellant “fares low on the factors of providing unusual risk to staff,\n\ninmates, or the general public.” (RR51:58, 60, 61; DX#27).\n\n              Appellant’s older brother Timothy9 testified about their family and their\n\nhistory of drug use.                                  All three brothers used drugs. (RR50:74). Timothy was\n\naware that Appellant used drugs at a young age. (RR50:73). Twice, he took away\n                                                            \n9\n At the time of trial, Timothy was serving a 40-year sentence for a 2004 conviction for theft of a\nperson and assault on a public servant. (RR50:67).\n                                                                     43 \n \n\fAppellant’s marijuana. (RR50:75). Then, Timothy went to prison when Appellant\n\nwas 15 years old and was gone for eleven years. (RR50:85). Timothy returned\n\nhome for a couple of years, then went back to prison on two 40-year sentences.\n\n(RR50:85).\n\n      Timothy was present during one fight between Appellant and Daphne.\n\n(RR50: 80-81). Appellant tried to slap Daphne. (RR50:81). Timothy intervened\n\nand he and Appellant “had a fight - - a tussle.” (RR50:81). In Timothy’s opinion,\n\nAppellant was intoxicated at the time because “he was big and I’m smaller and I\n\nhandled him - - I mean, real easy.” (RR50:82).\n\n      Appellant’s mother-in-law, Hazel Johnson, testified that Appellant is a good\n\nperson and a good father. (RR50:88, 90, 92). In the month before the offense,\n\nAppellant was stressed and depressed. (RR50:93-94).       Daphne’s aunt, Frances\n\nWilson, testified she learned that Appellant had a drug problem about five years\n\nafter he and Daphne were married. (RR50:100). She started talking to him about\n\nit in 2011. (RR50:101-02). Appellant was depressed and Wilson worried that he\n\nwould harm himself. (RR50:103). Wilson was not aware of any physical abuse\n\nbetween Appellant and Daphne. (RR50:100). Daphne’s sister Courtney Johnson\n\ntestified Appellant and Daphne’s relationship was “a normal relationship, just like\n\nany other married couple would have.” (RR50:111-12). She never saw Appellant\n\nphysically abuse Daphne, but she would “hear stuff from [her] sister.”\n\n\n                                        44 \n \n\f(RR50:112). Courtney was aware of Appellant’s drug problem and has seen him\n\nunder the influence. (RR50:113).      She did not recall the incident on August 7,\n\n1995 when Garland police were called to her apartment. (RR50:126-27). She did\n\nnot recall telling police that Appellant pointed a gun at her. (RR50:128). She did\n\nnot recall trying to drop charges with the district attorney’s office. (RR50:128).\n\nShe has no recollection of the fact that Appellant pleaded guilty to that offense and\n\nserved out a probation. (RR50:126-27).\n\n        A week before this instant offense, Courtney went with Appellant to the\n\nGarland Police Station when he asked them to “lock him up” because he was on\n\ndrugs and wanted to avoid getting into trouble. (RR50:123). Without any active\n\nwarrants, the police did not arrest him. (RR50:124).\n\n        Valerie Braziel is Appellant’s daughter Matduxx’s godmother. (RR50:166,\n\n169).    They met in 2009 after Appellant’s release from prison. (RR50:169-70).\n\nSince that time, they have become friends. (RR50:170). In the time leading up to\n\nthis offense, Appellant was withdrawn and Braziel felt as though he was depressed.\n\n(RR50:174). Braziel had no idea that he was a drug addict. (RR50:174). She was\n\nnot aware of any domestic violence between Appellant and Daphne. (RR50:173).\n\n                           The State’s Case-in-Rebuttal\n\n        Nurse Kelly Nelson treated Nancy in the Burn Intensive Care Unit at\n\nParkland Hospital. (RR51:71-73). Nancy was in pain. (RR51:74). She was\n\n\n                                         45 \n \n\funable to speak because she had a breathing tube.              (RR51:74).   Nelson\n\ncommunicated with Nancy using non-verbal pain scales “based on how the patient\n\nis acting or like body language, emotion.” (RR51:74). Nelson was able to ask\n\nNancy “yes” or “no” questions and Nancy responded using hand signals and nods.\n\n(RR51:74-75).     On May 23, Nancy was “in critical condition.”         (RR51:75).\n\nNancy was concerned about her prognosis.          (RR51:75).     “She attempted to\n\ncommunicate to me by using her finger and writing in the air, and she spelled out\n\nthe word die, d-i-e. I clarified that that’s what she had spelled out to me, and she\n\nnodded, yes. . . . She nodded yes to the question, are you wondering if you are\n\ngoing to die.” (RR51:75). When Nelson explained all of the “interventions” that\n\nthe medical team was performing, Nancy “was shaking her head no.” (RR51:76).\n\nNancy “didn’t want all the interventions that we were providing for her.”\n\n(RR51:76).\n\n      The State published the recording from Officer Coffey’s dashboard camera.\n\n(RR51:81; SX#187). On the video, when the officers pull up to the Whip-In,\n\nNancy is standing outside. (SX#187). She is still on fire. (SX#187).     She can be\n\nheard screaming and pleading for help. (SX#187).\n\n      Nancy’s daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Harris, testified briefly regarding the\n\neffect of Nancy’s death on the family. (RR51:82). Elizabeth is married to Chris\n\nHarris, Nancy’s youngest son. (RR51:82). She was very close to Nancy. (RR51:\n\n\n                                        46 \n \n\f84).   Elizabeth and Chris have three daughters, Lorelei, Hanna, and Olivia.\n\n(RR51:84). Every Friday Nancy would pick up the girls from school and have a\n\n“Mimi day[.]” (RR51:84). Nancy was an “amazing” grandmother. (RR51:85).\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Issue Nos. 1-7:      The trial court properly denied Appellant’s Batson\n\nchallenges to the State’s exercise of peremptory challenges against seven minority\n\nveniremembers. Appellant has not met his burden to show that the State’s strikes\n\nwere the product of racial discrimination.\n\n       Issue Nos. 8-19: The trial court properly granted the State’s challenges for\n\ncause against 4 prospective jurors. These jurors possessed biases against the law\n\nthe State was entitled to rely upon.      Appellant has failed to show that he was\n\ndeprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n       Issue Nos. 20-27: The trial court properly denied Appellant’s challenges for\n\ncause against 8 prospective jurors. All of the denials were proper and Appellant\n\nhas failed to show that he was denied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory\n\nchallenge.\n\n       Issue Nos. 28-30: The trial court properly granted the State’s challenges for\n\ncause against 3 prospective jurors. These jurors possessed biases against the law\n\nthe State was entitled to rely upon.      Appellant has failed to show that he was\n\ndeprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n\n                                           47 \n \n\f      Issue Nos. 31-32: Appellant’s argument that he was deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury lacks merit. Appellant has failed to prove that any of the trial\n\ncourt’s rulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was\n\nbiased or prejudiced.\n\n      Issue No. 33: The evidence is sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction\n\nfor capital murder. Contrary to the assertions in his brief, the record is replete with\n\nevidence showing his specific intent to kill Nancy Harris. Further, the evidence\n\nalso shows that the murder took place during the course of committing or\n\nattempting to commit robbery.\n\n      Issue No. 34-35: The trial court properly admitted the surveillance video of\n\nthe instant offense as well as the still photographs from that video. While the\n\nvideo is graphic, it simply depicts the reality of Appellant’s crime. The probative\n\nvalue of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\n      Issue Nos. 36-37: The trial court properly admitted the photographs of\n\nNancy at autopsy and at the hospital prior to her death. The photographs helped\n\nthe medical examiner and her physician in their testimonies, and they depict\n\nnothing more than the reality of Appellant’s brutal crime.\n\n      Issue Nos. 38-40: The trial court properly admitted evidence of statements\n\nNancy made prior to her death. These statements were admissible as excited\n\nutterances and/or dying declarations. Alternatively, any error is harmless.\n\n\n                                          48 \n \n\f      Issue No. 41: The trial court properly admitted evidence of Appellant’s\n\nactions after he fled the Whip-In.        This evidence was admissible as same-\n\ntransaction contextual evidence. Alternatively, any error is harmless.\n\n      Issue No. 42: The trial court properly instructed the jury regarding voluntary\n\nintoxication. Appellant’s cross-examination may have led the jury to believe his\n\nactions were excused by his intoxication.\n\n      Issue Nos. 43-44: The trial court properly admitted during the punishment\n\nphase, evidence of Appellant’s extraneous conduct with former girlfriend, Amy\n\nFranks. There is no evidence that the State acted in bad faith and Appellant has\n\nfailed to show that he was surprised or that his defensive strategy would have\n\nchanged in any way.\n\n      Issue Nos. 45-48: The trial court properly admitted during the punishment\n\nphase, evidence of Appellant’s prior convictions. The State presented evidence\n\ntying Appellant to each of the complained-of exhibits.\n\n      Issue No. 49: The trial court properly admitted the expert testimony of\n\nWarden Melodye Nelson as her testimony was relevant and helpful to the jury in\n\ndeciding the first special issue. Alternatively, any error is harmless.\n\n      Issue No. 50: The evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nanswer to the future dangerousness special issue.        Based upon the facts of the\n\ninstant offense, as well as the evidence of Appellant’s past acts of crime and\n\n\n                                          49 \n \n\fviolence, a rational jury could find that Appellant would constitute a continuing\n\nthreat to society.\n\n      Issue Nos. 51-53: Appellant’s arguments regarding the punishment charge\n\nare inadequately briefed and multifarious. Regardless, the trial court properly\n\ndenied his requested instructions and properly overruled his objections to the\n\ncharge.\n\n      Issue Nos. 54-65: Appellant’s admittedly meritless federal constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Texas death penalty statute are presented only to preserve the\n\ncomplaints for federal habeas review. And while Appellant invites this Court to\n\nrevisit its prior holdings against his position, he provides no new authority for this\n\nCourt or the State to address.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 1 THROUGH 7:        THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S BATSON CHALLENGES.\n\n      In Issues 1 through 7, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his objection based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986) to the\n\nState’s use of peremptory challenges on veniremembers Sheppard Brown,\n\nKimberly Houston, Percy Phillips, Shirley Wilson, Telli White, Dionne Hashaway,\n\nand Christylynn Kyles. (Appellant’s Br. at 35-51). These contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n\n\n                                         50 \n \n\f                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and the U.S. Constitution prohibit\n\nthe use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.261(a) (West 2006); Batson, 476 U.S. at 85;\n\nWatkins v. State, 245 S.W.3d 444, 447 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Under Batson, a\n\ndefendant must first make a prima facie showing that the prosecution exercised its\n\nperemptory challenges on the basis of race. Reed v. Quarterman, 555 F.3d 364,\n\n368 (5th Cir. 2009). If the defendant makes that showing, the burden shifts to the\n\nprosecutor to present race-neutral explanations for striking the jurors in question.\n\nId. The court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of\n\nproving purposeful discrimination. Id.\n\n      At the second step of this process, the proponent of the strike need only\n\ntender an explanation that is race-neutral. Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447. The\n\nultimate plausibility of that race-neutral explanation is to be considered as part of\n\nthe third step of the analysis, in which the trial court determines whether the\n\nopponent of the strike (usually the defendant) has satisfied his burden of\n\npersuasion to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the strike was\n\nindeed the product of the proponent’s racial discrimination. Id. Whether the\n\nopponent satisfies his burden of persuasion to show that the proponent’s facially\n\n\n\n\n                                         51 \n \n\frace-neutral explanation for his strike is pre-textual, not genuine, is a question of\n\nfact for the trial court to resolve in the first instance. Id.\n\n       This Court should not overturn the trial court’s resolution of the Batson issue\n\nunless it determines that the trial court’s ruling was clearly erroneous.         See\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447-48. In assaying the record for clear error, vel non, this\n\nCourt should consider the entire record of voir dire; it need not limit itself to\n\narguments or considerations that the parties specifically called to the trial court’s\n\nattention so long as those arguments or considerations are manifestly grounded in\n\nthe appellate record. Id. at 448. But this Court should examine a trial court’s\n\nconclusion that a facially race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge is\n\ngenuine, rather than a pretext, with great deference, reversing only when that\n\nconclusion is, in view of the record as a whole, erroneous. Id.\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n     I.   Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, but\n          the issue is moot.\n\n       After the parties exercised their peremptory strikes, Appellant asserted that\n\nhe “would have Batson objections to some of the State’s strikes.” (RR43:19).\n\nAppellant identified seven African-Americans veniremembers that the State struck.\n\n(RR43:19-20). The State argued that Appellant failed to establish a prima facie\n\ncase. (RR43:20).       Without ruling on the State’s objection, the trial court stated\n\nthat it “would prefer that the State explain their strikes.” (RR43:20). The State did\n                                             52 \n \n\fnot object to the trial court’s failure to rule. Consequently, this Court must assume\n\nthat Appellant satisfied his step-one obligation to make a prima facie case of\n\npurposeful discrimination and address only the second and third steps.              See\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448; see also Chambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 23 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1993) (where the State fails at trial to object to the trial court’s failure\n\nto rule on the defendant’s prima facie case, that issue becomes moot and it cannot\n\nbe raised on appeal).\n\n    II.   The State’s race-neutral explanations\n\n      At the second step of the Batson process, the prosecutor need only tender an\n\nexplanation that is race-neutral on its face. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 768\n\n(1995) (indicating the State has a burden of production in the second step merely to\n\npresent a facially valid explanation for its strike); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447.\n\n                   Brown, Phillips, White, Hashaway, and Kyles\n\n      At the Batson hearing, the State explained that it stuck all qualified\n\nprospective jurors who ranked themselves as a “3” on their questionnaire.\n\n(RR43:20-21). Question No. 2 on the questionnaire asked: “With reference to the\n\ndeath penalty, which of the following statements best represents your feelings?”\n\n(RR4-RR34; RR36-RR42; Q. p. 1).           A ranking of “3” indicates the following\n\nopinion: “Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed,\n\nas long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of\n\n\n                                          53 \n \n\fcircumstances.” (RR4-RR34; RR36-RR42; Q. p. 1).                      The State explained that it\n\nstruck every person on the qualified-juror panel that selected number “3,”\n\nincluding Sheppard Brown (Juror 2A, an African-American male), Percy Phillips10\n\n(Juror 60A, an African-American male), Telli White (Juror 329A, an African-\n\nAmerican female), Dionne Hashaway (Juror 911A, an African-American female),\n\nand Christylynn Kyles (Juror 1133A, an African-American female), Christina\n\nMoore (Juror 271A, a Caucasian female), Laura Luna (Juror 340A, a Caucasian\n\nfemale), Ronald Drake (Juror 759A, a Caucasian male), and Scot McComas (Juror\n\n1331A, a Caucasian male). (RR43:20-21; Brown, Juror 2A, Q. p.1; Phillips, Juror\n\n60A, Q. p.1; White, Juror 329A, Q. p.1; Hashaway, Juror 911A, Q. p.1; Kyles,\n\nJuror 1133A, Q. p.1; Moore, Juror 271A, Q. p.1; Luna, Juror 340A, Q. p.1; Drake,\n\nJuror 759A, Q. p.1; McComas, Juror 1331A, Q. p.1). The State also intended to\n\nstrike Jerry Matlock, (Juror 1500A, a Caucasian male), the last juror in the\n\nalternate pool, on the same grounds. (RR43:21; Matlock, Juror 1500A, Q. p.1).\n\n              The State’s reason was grounded in these jurors’ opinion about the death\n\npenalty and is race-neutral. Courts have found similar grounds as facially neutral.\n\nSee, e.g., Mathis v. State, 67 S.W.3d 918, 924-25 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (holding\n\nprosecutor’s explanations—that he struck a juror because she was in favor of the\n\n\n\n                                                            \n10\n  Percy Phillips ranked himself as a three and a five on this question. (RR43:20-21; Phillips,\nJuror 60A, Q. p.1).\n                                                               54 \n \n\fdeath penalty only in two specified circumstances and she felt the death penalty\n\nwas imposed too frequently—were facially race-neutral).\n\n                               Kimberly Houston\n\n       At the Batson hearing, the State explained that it exercised a peremptory\n\nchallenge against Houston because “she’s an attorney and we don’t think that\n\nattorneys are generally good on jury panels.” (RR43:21). When the State indicates\n\nthat it challenged a prospective juror based on that person's type of employment\n\nand that the State has had poor success with that type of worker, the reason is a\n\nrace-neutral explanation for exercising the peremptory strike. Middleton v. State,\n\n187 S.W.3d 134, 142 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006, no pet.) (citing Barnes v.\n\nState, 855 S.W.2d 173, 174 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993, pet. ref'd)).\n\n                                 Shirley Wilson\n\n       At the Batson hearing, the State explained that it exercised a peremptory\n\nchallenge against Wilson because the State did not believe that Wilson was\n\nqualified. (RR43:20). Indeed, during individual voir dire, the State challenged\n\nWilson for cause because Wilson vacillated on Special Issue No. One. (RR8:225-\n\n26).   The State questioned Wilson at length on this issue. (RR8:205-09).     She\n\ntestified that she could never answer Special Issue No. 1 “yes” because she\n\nbelieves there is no way to predict an individual’s future actions. (RR8:205-09).\n\nWhen questioned by the defense, Wilson initially repeated her earlier position,\n\n\n                                       55 \n \n\fstating “I can’t see what you can really show to me [to prove] what the future is\n\ngoing to hold. I’m not for sure if I could answer that yes[.]” (RR8:220). Then, in\n\ncontradiction, she said she could answer the first special issue in the affirmative.\n\n(RR8:221).     The State’s challenge for cause was denied. (RR8:227).          Given\n\nWilson’s vacillation regarding Special Issue No. One, the State chose to\n\nperemptorily strike Wilson.     Vacillating is a race-neutral reason for exercising a\n\nperemptory strike. See Cook v. State, 858 S.W.2d 467, 472 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1993) (finding no clear error in trial judge’s conclusion that the State’s peremptory\n\nstrike of a vacillating juror was a satisfactory race-neutral reason).\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n       The record supports all of the State’s proffered race-neutral explanations for\n\nexercising peremptory strikes against the seven prospective minority jurors.\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the State satisfied its\n\nstep-two burden of production to tender facially race-neutral explanations for its\n\nperemptory strikes. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n    III.   Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence\n           that the strikes were the product of racial discrimination\n\n       Appellant has not shown purposeful discrimination by the State. Here, the\n\ndefendant has the burden to persuade the trial court that the prosecutor’s\n\nexplanations for the State’s strikes were incredible or disingenuous. Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457. The focus of the Batson inquiry in this stage is on the genuineness,\n                                           56 \n \n\fnot reasonableness, of the asserted non-racial motive. Nieto v. State, 365 S.W.3d\n\n673, 676 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). The question of pretext is a question of fact for\n\nthe trial court to resolve, subject to reversal on appeal only for clear error.\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n      Appellant primarily contends that the State’s strikes must have been racially\n\nmotivated because these jurors were qualified jurors and had some characteristics\n\npotentially favorable to the State’s position on the death penalty. (Appellant’s Br.\n\nat 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47). The jurors’ qualifications for jury service are\n\nirrelevant to the analysis, however.    Factors relevant to determining whether\n\npurposeful discrimination has been proven include the following:\n\n            1. whether the State utilized its option to shuffle the jury panels\n               in a manner that supported an inference of race\n               discrimination;\n            2. whether the prosecutor’s office trying the case followed a\n               formal policy to exclude minority venire members from jury\n               service which was known to at least one of the prosecutors\n               at trial;\n            3. whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges to\n               eliminate a far greater proportion of minority venire\n               members than non-minority venire members;\n            4. whether the reasons the State asserted for eliminating the\n               minority venire members in question appeared to apply\n               equally well to many non-minority venire members whom\n               the State did not challenge; and\n            5. whether the State directed questions expressly designed to\n               elicit grounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately,\n               in a manner that suggested an intent to single out minority\n               venire members for elimination.\n\n\n\n                                         57 \n \n\fWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448-49 (relying on Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.S. 231, 240-\n\n64, 266 (2005)). This Court looks to the collective and cumulative impact of these\n\nnon–exclusive factors in determining whether an inference of racial discrimination\n\nis so powerful that it overcomes the deference given to trial courts. See id. at 449,\n\n457.\n\n       An analysis of these factors demonstrates that Appellant’s claim of\n\npurposeful discrimination lacks merit.\n\n             1. Jury Shuffle\n\n       There is no evidence of jury shuffling in this case. The parties selected the\n\ngroup of qualified jurors from a June 21, 2013 special venire. (RR4). Appellant\n\ndoes not assert or demonstrate that the venire was shuffled or otherwise arranged in\n\na manner to decrease the possibility of a minority member.\n\n             2. Formal Policy Prohibits Discrimination\n\n       The Dallas County District Attorney’s office’s notorious formal policy of\n\nexcluding minorities is a relic of a bygone era. It is common knowledge that the\n\noffice policy of the last several years not only forbids such discrimination, it\n\nrequires an investigation into sustained Batson challenges and authorizes discipline\n\nranging from reprimand to termination. The State asks this Court to take judicial\n\nnotice of this well-known fact. Tex. R. Evid. 201.\n\n\n\n\n                                         58 \n \n\f                             3. Proportionality of Strikes\n\n              Appellant argues that even one racially motivated peremptory strike violates\n\nBatson and he makes no effort to demonstrate a pattern of discriminatory strikes.\n\nHe does not identify the size or racial makeup of the pool of qualified venire\n\nmembers. Nor does he analyze the number of strikes used by either side or how\n\nthey were used. He merely argues that the State used 7 of its 12 peremptory strikes\n\nto eliminate 60% of the African-Americans on the qualified prospective jury panel,\n\na statistic with which the State disagrees. 11 (Appellant’s Br. at 50).\n\n              For statistical evidence to be relevant, data concerning the entire pool is\n\nnecessary. See Medellin v. Dretke, 378 F.3d 270, 278 (5th Cir. 2004). By itself,\n\nthe number of African Americans struck is an irrelevant statistic. Woodward v.\n\nEpps, 580 F.3d 318, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the State’s striking 100% of\n\nthe black jurors alone does not support a finding of discrimination and does not\n\nshow any disparity in relation to the non-minority jurors).\n\n              The data evinces no discriminatory intent by the State. The panel of\n\nqualified venire members consisted of 44 people.                                Of these, 12 (27%) were\n\nAfrican-American, 27 (61%) were Caucasian, 4 (9%) were Hispanic, and 1 (2%)\n\ndeclined to indicate his race.                                 The State exercised 15 peremptory strikes.\n\n                                                            \n11\n  Appellant states in his brief that the State “used 7 of its 12 peremptory strikes to eliminate 60%\nof the African-Americans on the qualified prospective jury panel.” (Appellant’s Br. p. 50). In\nfact, the State exercised all 15 of its statutorily authorized peremptory strikes. The State\npresumes that Appellant’s reference to the State’s use of 12 strikes is a clerical error.\n                                                                  59 \n \n\f(RR43:8-19). Seven of those 15 strikes (47%) were used on African-Americans, 7\n\n(47%) were used on Caucasians, and 1 (6%) was used on a Hispanic juror.\n\n(RR43:8-19). Appellant exercised 17 peremptory strikes. (RR43:8-19). Of his 17\n\nstrikes, 2 were used on African-American jurors, 11 were used on Caucasian\n\njurors, and 3 were used on Hispanic jurors. (RR43:8-19). The result was a 12-\n\nmember jury consisting of 3 African-American jurors and 9 Caucasian jurors, with\n\n2 Caucasian alternate jurors.\n\n      The State’s use of 7 strikes on African-American venire members is not\n\ndefinitive of the inquiry in Batson’s third step; instead, a reviewing court must look\n\nat all relevant factors. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 452 (upholding the trial court,\n\ndespite the State’s disproportionate use of 6 of its 11 peremptory challenges\n\nagainst a racial group making up only 22% of the venire). Of the 44 venire\n\nmembers who could conceivably be chosen for the jury, 12 (27%), were African-\n\nAmerican. A random selection would yield either 3 or 4 African-American jurors\n\nin the 14 jurors selected (12 plus 2 alternates) (or 27% of fourteen, equaling 3.78\n\njurors). See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 451-52 (holding a random selection from a\n\n22% African-American venire would yield 2 or 3 black jurors because 22% of 12\n\njurors, plus 1 alternate, was 2.86). This jury panel had 3 African-American jurors.\n\nThus, 27% of the qualified jurors were African-American and 25% of the 12-\n\nperson jury was African-American. This jury had the expected amount of African-\n\n\n                                         60 \n \n\fAmerican members as would be expected from a random selection of the 44\n\nqualified jurors. Statistical analysis simply fails to show any racial discrimination.\n\n             4. Comparative Analysis\n\n      Appellant contends on appeal that the prosecutor’s stated reasons are a\n\npretext for racial discrimination because non-minority jurors with similar responses\n\nor characteristics were not struck by the State. (Appellant’s Br. at 50). At the\n\nBatson hearing, however, defense counsel failed to provide a comparative analysis\n\non the jurors. (RR43:21-22). Counsel did not cross-examine the prosecutor about\n\nher reasons for not striking any similarly situated venire members. (RR43:20-23).\n\nAs such, the prosecutor had no opportunity to respond to counsel’s allegations.\n\nAppellant should not be permitted to raise claims of disparate treatment for the first\n\ntime on appeal. By failing to properly present this claim at trial, he denied the\n\nprosecutor the opportunity to create a record on the prosecutor’s strategy, and he\n\ndenied the trial court an opportunity to rule on the claim.\n\n      Whether a prosecutor intended to discriminate on the basis of race is a\n\nquestion of historical fact properly decided in the trial courts. See Hernandez v.\n\nNew York, 500 U.S. 352, 367-69 (1991). State procedural rules demand that\n\nallegations of disparate treatment by the prosecutor be raised in the trial court, so\n\nthat they can be properly answered by the State and decided by that court. See\n\nTex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457-58 (Keller, P.J., concurring);\n\n\n                                          61 \n \n\fYoung v. State, 826 S.W.2d 141, 147-49 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (Campbell, J.,\n\ndissenting).\n\n      The State acknowledges this Court’s majority opinion in Young that a non-\n\ncapital defendant is not required to raise a comparative analysis in the trial court to\n\nhave evidence of such considered on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 145-46. The\n\nFifth Circuit has applied Young to a capital case and criticized this Court’s\n\ninconsistency in its application of the contemporaneous objection rule to Batson\n\nclaims in capital cases. Reed, 555 F.3d at 370.\n\n      This Court should explicitly overrule Young. See generally Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457-58 (Keller, P.J., concurring); Young, 826 S.W.2d at 147-49\n\n(Campbell, J., dissenting). Its majority—and the courts that rely on it—view the\n\ncomparative analysis as merely an appellate argument that can be fairly addressed\n\nfor the first time on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 146. In truth, it is a factual\n\nallegation of unfair treatment between jurors. If properly raised in the trial court,\n\nthe prosecution’s response may provide additional facts for the appellate court to\n\nconsider when reviewing the Batson ruling. If raised at trial successfully, the trial\n\ncourt can cure the error before trial even begins.        If not raised at trial, the\n\nprosecutor’s mental process and the trial judge’s credibility decision concerning\n\nthe non-strikes are simply omitted from the record. Jurors are not products of a set\n\nof cookie cutters, and the unexplained decision not to strike a non-minority juror\n\n\n                                          62 \n \n\fwho shares one trait in common with a minority juror is held against the State on\n\nappellate review. See, e.g., Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 244 (stating, “If, indeed, Fields’s\n\nthoughts on rehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have worried\n\nabout a number of white panel members he accepted with no evident\n\nreservations.”) (emphasis added). The prosecutor’s explanation of her voir dire\n\nstrategy and the trial court’s ruling on the strategy is critical to a fair appellate\n\nreview.\n\n      At the very least, a prosecutor should enjoy favor on appeal when the matter\n\nis not raised at trial, much like the presumption against a finding of ineffective\n\nassistance of defense counsel.       In claims regarding violations of a client’s\n\nconstitutional right to counsel, this Court has stated that “counsel should ordinarily\n\nbe accorded an opportunity to explain her actions before being condemned as\n\nunprofessional and incompetent.” Bone v. State, 77 S.W.3d 828, 836 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002). A prosecutor’s credibility is the heart of Batson review, and she\n\nshould be accorded no less of an opportunity to explain her actions.\n\n      This Court should conclude that the comparative analysis is not preserved\n\nfor review or, alternatively, presume that the comparative analysis favors the\n\nprosecutor absent affirmative evidence on the record.\n\n      In any event, Appellant has wholly failed to establish that the potential jurors\n\nwho are the focus of his Batson challenge were similarly situated to non-minority\n\n\n                                          63 \n \n\fpotential jurors who were not struck.\n\n                                           Brown, Phillips, White, Hashaway, and Kyles\n\n              As argued above, the State struck each and every qualified prospective juror\n\nregardless of race who ranked him/herself as a “3,” indicating a belief that,\n\n“Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long\n\nas the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of circumstances.”\n\n(RRR43:20-21).                                The State struck all 9 “3s” on the qualified prospective juror\n\npanel.               (RR43:20-21). Appellant points to no evidence to the contrary.                      He\n\ncannot show disparate treatment of Brown, Phillips, White, Hashaway, and Kyles\n\ncompared to accepted non-minority veniremembers. As such, Appellant has failed\n\nto show that the prosecutor’s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                                                               Kimberly Houston\n\n              The State explained that it struck Houston because she is an attorney12 and\n\nbecause “we don’t think that attorneys are generally good on jury panels.”\n\n(RR43:21; Houston, Juror 27A, Q. p.1). Houston was the only attorney on the\n\nqualified-juror panel. (RR43:21). As such, this rationale was a unique explanation\n\nfor the strike, which applied to no other prospective juror.                            Importantly, during\n                                                            \n12\n   The State expressed this same opinion during the voir dire of another juror, Sheppard Brown.\nIn explaining the terms used in the special issues, the prosecutor commented that “That’s a whole\nlot of legal words. I’m going to try to talk to you about it in terms that - - that anybody would\nget, because we’re - - we’re not putting lawyers on this jury.” (RR5:30). She also stated that,\n“We’re going to put air conditioning techs and people who don’t know the law [on the jury].\nAnd there’s a good reason for that, by the way. Lawyers are not always the smartest people in\ntown.” (RR5:30).\n                                                                      64 \n \n\fthe Batson hearing, defense counsel did not challenge the prosecutor’s stated\n\nreason. Whether Appellant’s counsel personally felt such information should be\n\nthe basis for a strike, is irrelevant; nothing indicates this was a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination.     He cannot show that Houston was treated differently from non-\n\nminority venire members who the State accepted.\n\n                                     Shirley Wilson\n\n         The State struck Wilson because it did not believe that she was a qualified\n\njuror.    During the State’s questioning, Wilson stated repeatedly that she did not\n\nbelieve that the State could ever present proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a\n\ndefendant would be a future danger. The following exchange took place:\n\n         [Prosecutor]: Now we’re talking about punishment, and that Special\n         Issue Number 1, about what he’s going to do in the future, because\n         you can see how that’s asking the jury to decide if this person is going\n         to continue to constitute a continuing threat, if he’s going to continue\n         to commit criminal acts of violence. Do you see that?\n\n         [Wilson]: Yes, I see it.\n\n         [Prosecutor]: I mean, basically we’re asking you to look into the\n         future and decide whether it’s more likely than not he’s going to be a\n         continuing threat to society. How are you going to decide that?\n\n         [Wilson]: I can’t decide that.\n\n         [Prosecutor]: You can’t decide that?\n\n         [Wilson]: Huh-uh.\n\n         [Prosecutor]: Is there anything that I could do to prove to you beyond\n         a reasonable doubt - -\n                                           65 \n \n\f    [Wilson]: No.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: - - that a person is going to do something in the future?\n\n    [Wilson]: No.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Or is more likely than not going to do something in the\n    future?\n\n    [Wilson]: You can’t.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: And why is that?\n\n    [Wilson]: Because we just can’t determine what the future going [sic]\n    to be and what that person is going to do.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Okay. So there’s - - there’s nothing that I could do, no\n    evidence I could bring to you - -\n\n    [Wilson]: No.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: - - that would get you to answer Special Issue Number 1\n    yes?\n\n    [Wilson]: No. I don’t think there’s any - - you know, we just don’t\n    know. We don’t know what a person would do, whether it’s good or\n    bad in the future.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Sure. I mean, people can change?\n\n    [Wilson]: Yes, they can.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: But you don’t know 100 percent, but you’re telling me\n    you - - there’s no way I’m going to be able to tell you - - or bring to\n    you proof to convince you that it’s more likely than not that a person\n    is going to do something in the future?\n\n    [Wilson]: I just don’t - - no, I don’t think there’s any evidence just - -\n    you can bring and just - - to tell me what the future hold for that\n                                       66 \n \n\f     person, if that person going to be able to do it or not, no.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. And you understand that - - that the law would -\n     - well, let me rephrase that. I guess - - I mean, I totally see where\n     you’re coming from. We don’t have a crystal ball.\n\n     [Wilson]: Huh-uh.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: But in a trial situation there’s not - - no evidence,\n     there’s nothing I could present to you to convince you of what the\n     future is going to hold for somebody?\n\n     [Wilson]: No.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: So you’re automatically going to answer that Special\n     Issue Number 1 no because there’s nothing I can do. You’re always\n     going to say no to Special Issue Number 1? Do you see what that\n     question is asking?\n\n     [Wilson]: Let me just read it again. Maybe I’m - - I mean, maybe\n     I’m - - I’m just saying I just don’t see how you can - - how - - I’m not\n     saying you, but who can present what a person is going to do in the\n     future when it come [sic] down to criminal acts.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Sure. And I’m not arguing with you. Please don’t - -\n     please don’t think that.\n\n     [Wilson]: So I guess I have to answer no.\n\n     [. . . ]\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. And there’s nothing I assume that I could say to\n     change your mind about that?\n\n     [Wilson]: Probably not.\n\n(RR8:205-08).     The prosecutor questioned Wilson at length on this issue and\n\nWilson maintained her stance. (RR8:205-08).\n\n\n                                         67 \n \n\f      During questioning by the defense, counsel asked Wilson whether she could\n\n“keep an open mind to Special Issue Number 1 and wait until you hear all the\n\nevidence before you decide what the appropriate answer is[.]” (RR8:219). Wilson\n\nresponded that, now that she understood that special issue, she would “have to just\n\nwait before I could just say this person is no good to nothing, anymore, period,\n\nthere’s no chance.” (RR8:219). But that line of questioning did not ask whether\n\nshe could ever find a defendant to be a future danger. This question simply asked\n\nwhether she could keep an “open mind.” When defense counsel specifically asked\n\nwhether she could answer Special Issue No. 1 “yes,” Wilson maintained, as she did\n\nunder questioning by the State, that she could not say that she would do so.\n\n(RR8:220). She stated that “I can’t see what you can really show to me what the\n\nfuture is going to hold. I’m not for sure if I could answer that yes[.]” (RR8:220).\n\nVery shortly thereafter, however, she gave a response that seemed to indicate that\n\nshe changed her mind and could answer Special Issue No. 1 in the affirmative:\n\n“Yes, I guess, if I’m presented with the evidence and here it is [. . .] then I would\n\nhave to say yes, now that I understand the question better.” (RR8:221).\n\n      Importantly, a review of Wilson’s testimony under questioning by the\n\ndefense indicates that Wilson may have been confused about the fact that in order\n\nfor the death penalty to be assessed, she would have to answer the first special\n\nissue “yes.”   And, that in order to answer special issue No. 1 “yes,” she would\n\n\n                                         68 \n \n\fhave to find a defendant to be a future danger. Defense counsel asked Wilson\n\nwhether she understood that life without the possibility of parole and death are the\n\nonly two possible punishments. (RR8:215). She did. (RR8:215). Then, he asked\n\nwhether she understood that “in order for someone to receive the death sentence,\n\nyou would have to answer Special Issue Number 1 yes?” (RR8;216-17). Wilson\n\nsaid, “No. I read that over and over, but I didn’t know I needed to answer yes in\n\norder for a person to receive the death penalty[.]” (RR8:217). They discuss the\n\nterms “probability” and “criminal acts of violence.” (RR8:217-20). Then, she\n\nreiterates the position she took when under questioning by the State, “I can’t see\n\nwhat you can really show to me [to prove] what the future is going to hold.”\n\n(RR8:220).\n\n      Wilson’s responses indicate that she was either unwilling or unable to\n\nanswer Special Issue No. 1 in the affirmative or that she was a vacillating juror.\n\nSince the trial court denied the State’s challenge, the State exercised a peremptory\n\nchallenge.   Indeed, the State struck all jurors that it had unsuccessfully challenged\n\nfor cause. Of the 44 qualified jurors, the State unsuccessfully challenged for cause\n\n4 potential jurors: Wilson (Juror 196A, an African-American female), Chad Davis\n\n(Juror 265A, a Caucasian male), Ronald Drake (Juror 759A, a Caucasian male),\n\nand Wanda Benjamin (Juror 1369A, an African-American female).             Davis was\n\nlater excused (RR31:5) as was Benjamin (RR41:28). The State struck Drake.\n\n\n                                         69 \n \n\f(RR43:12).     Appellant has failed to show Wilson was treated differently from\n\naccepted non-minority venire members.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has wholly failed to show that Jurors Brown, Phillips, White,\n\nHashaway, Kyles, Houston, or Wilson were similarly-situated to non-minority\n\njurors that were not struck by the State.\n\n             5. Disparate Questioning\n\n      Appellant points to no instances of disparate questioning by the State. Cf.\n\nMiller-El, 545 U.S. at 256-57 (prosecutors used a graphic script when describing\n\nthe death penalty to African-American jurors who were ambivalent to the death\n\npenalty more often than with white jurors who also were ambivalent). Nor is any\n\ndisparate questioning apparent in the record.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nState’s exercise of its peremptory challenges against 7 African-Americans was the\n\nproduct of racial discrimination. Appellant has not shown that the State’s\n\nexplanations did not apply equally to non-minority venire members that the State\n\ndid not challenge, that the State directed questions expressly designed to elicit\n\ngrounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately, or that a formal policy\n\nexcludes minorities from jury service. The record before this Court supports the\n\n\n                                            70 \n \n\ftrial court’s resolution of the fact question of pretext. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Appellant’s Batson challenges. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at\n\n456-57.\n\n      Issues 1 through 7 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 8 THROUGH 19:        THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nGRANTING THE STATE’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n      In Issues 8 through 19, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting the State’s challenges for cause against potential jurors Mary Boulos,\n\nJudith McDaniel, Terry Plank, and Floyd Stanmore. (Appellant’s Br. pp.51-64).\n\nHe contends the exclusion of these jurors and the failure of the trial court to allow\n\nhim to voir dire these jurors violated article 35.16 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure as well as his right to counsel under the federal and state constitutions.\n\nSee U.S. CONST. amends VI & XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, § 10; Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 35.16 (West 2006). Appellant’s contentions lack merit and should\n\nbe overruled.\n\n                                   Applicable Law\n\n      Article 35.16(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n      A challenge for cause may be made by the State for any of the following\n      reasons:\n\n             1. That the juror has conscientious scruples in regard to the infliction\n                of the punishment of death for crime, in a capital case, where the\n                                          71 \n \n\f                 State is seeking the death penalty.\n\n              2. That he is related within the third degree of consanguinity or\n                 affinity as determined under Chapter 573, Government Code, to\n                 the defendant; and\n\n              3. That he has a bias or prejudice against any phase of the law upon\n                 which the State is entitled to rely for conviction or punishment.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(b). A “bias against the law” is the refusal to\n\nconsider or apply the relevant law. Sadler v. State, 977 S.W.2d 140, 142 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1998). The test is whether the bias or prejudice would substantially\n\nimpair the prospective juror’s ability to carry out his oath and instructions in\n\naccordance with the law. Threadgill v. State, 146 S.W.3d 654, 667 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2004).\n\n      On appeal, a reviewing court will overturn the trial court's ruling on a\n\nchallenge for cause only if it clearly abused its discretion. Gonzales v. State, 353\n\nS.W.3d 826, 831 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). The reviewing court gives great\n\ndeference to the trial court’s decision on a challenge for cause because the trial\n\njudge was in the best position to observe the venire member during voir dire. Id.\n\nWhen the record reflects that a venire member vacillated or equivocated on her\n\nability to follow the law, the reviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Id;\n\nGardner v. State, 306 S.W.3d 274, 295 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                          72 \n \n\f                                      Analysis\n\n      The trial court did not err in granting the State’s challenges for cause against\n\nprospective jurors Mary Boulos, Judith McDaniel, Terry Plank, and Floyd\n\nStanmore.\n\n                                   Mary Boulos\n\n      On her questionnaire, Mary Boulos wrote that she is in favor of the death\n\npenalty but that she does have “moral, religious, or personal beliefs that would\n\nprevent [her] from sitting in judgment of another human being[.]” (Boulos, Juror\n\n285A, Q. p. 1). In fact, on that questionnaire, Boulos made statements in four\n\nplaces in which she indicated that she does not believe she has the right to judge\n\nanother human being: “I don’t feel that I have the right to judge someone’s future”\n\n(RR11:18; Boulos, Juror 285A, Q. p.2); the best argument against the death\n\npenalty is “judging whether a person has the right to live or not” (Boulos, Juror\n\n285A, Q. p. 2); “still don’t have the right to judge whether someone lives or dies”\n\n(Boulos, Juror 285A, Q. p.2); and “I do not feel that I have the right to judge\n\nwhether or not someone is given the death penalty or life.” (Boulos, Juror 285A,\n\nQ. p.18).\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor probed Boulos as to how she felt about\n\nsitting in judgment and answering questions in such a way that a death sentence\n\nwould be imposed.     (RR11:17-18).     Boulos responded she was not comfortable\n\n\n                                         73 \n \n\fbecause “[she’s] not somebody to sit there and judge somebody else[.]”\n\n(RR11:18).     The prosecutor tried to get a definitive answer regarding Boulos’\n\nability to sit in judgment. The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Okay. And like I told you in the beginning, the law is\n      not going to require - - we’re not going to require that you sit in\n      judgment of an individual in this situation - -\n\n      [Boulos]: Yeah.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: - - if it’s going to do violence to your conscience.\n\n      [Boulos]: Yeah.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: If it is something you cannot do because of personal,\n      moral, or religious reasons; is that where you stand?\n\n      [Boulos]: Yes.\n\n(RR11:18). The State challenged Boulos for cause.           (RR11:19).     Appellant\n\nobjected and stated that Boulos had not said “that her feelings would impair her\n\nability to answer the questions and follow the law.”     (RR11:19-20).      The trial\n\ncourt granted the State’s challenge. (RR11:20). The totality of Boulos’ voir dire\n\nshows Boulos could not sit in judgment of another individual and her statements\n\nsupport the trial court’s decision. To the extent, if any, that some of Boulos’ other\n\nremarks could be interpreted as contradictory, the trial court was the fact finder\n\nduring voir dire and, thus, free to resolve her conflicting answers in the State’s\n\nfavor. See King v. State, 29 S.W.3d 556, 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (particular\n\ndeference is given to the trial court’s conclusion that venire member cannot follow\n                                         74 \n \n\flaw when venire member’s answers are vacillating, unclear, or contradictory). To\n\nconclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy of encouraging trial\n\ncourt’s to liberally grant challenges for cause rather than err by denying a\n\nchallenge on a close question. Jones v. State, 982 S.W.2d 386, 394 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1998).\n\n      The record reflects that the State challenged Boulos for cause and that the\n\ntrial court granted the State’s challenge. (RR11:19-20). Contrary to the statements\n\nin Appellant’s brief, there is no evidence that the trial court excused Boulos sua\n\nsponte.\n\n      Finally, on appeal, Appellant contends that he was denied the opportunity to\n\nquestion Boulos.     (Appellant’s Br. p. 57). During voir dire when the State\n\nchallenged this juror, however, Appellant did not request an opportunity to\n\nquestion Boulos. (RR11:20). See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.17, § 2\n\n(stating that “In a capital felony case . . . on demand of the State or defendant,\n\neither is entitled to examine each juror on voir dire individually and apart from the\n\nentire panel, and may further question the juror on the principles propounded by\n\nthe court.”). As a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate review,\n\nhowever, the record must show that the complaint was made to the trial court by a\n\ntimely request, objection, or motion and that the trial court either (1) ruled on the\n\nrequest, objection, or motion; or (2) refused to rule on the request, objection, or\n\n\n                                         75 \n \n\fmotion, and the complaining party objected to the refusal. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1\n\n(a).   Given Appellant’s failure to request the opportunity to question Boulos, he\n\nfailed to preserve any issue for this Court’s review.\n\n                                  Judith McDaniel\n\n       On her questionnaire, Judith McDaniel wrote that she is not in favor of the\n\ndeath penalty.    (McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.1).        Among other reasons, she\n\nbelieves in “the possibility of redemption” and in light of “Craig Watson’s [sic]\n\npush to find those wrongfully convicted,” McDaniel wrote she is against the death\n\npenalty. (McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.1).         McDaniel ranked herself as a “3,”\n\nindicating, “Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be\n\nimposed, as long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of\n\ncircumstances.” (McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.1). She noted, however, “Maybe I\n\nshould circle #5[,]” which provides that “I could never, under any circumstances,\n\nreturn a verdict which assessed the death penalty.”\n\n       Additionally, McDaniel wrote that although it is improving, she does not\n\nbelieve that the death penalty is applied fairly in Dallas County. (McDaniel, Juror\n\n317A, Q. p.4). She wrote that the death penalty is used too often in Texas.\n\n(McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.4).\n\n       During voir dire, McDaniel reiterated her general opposition to the death\n\npenalty and gave answers suggesting considerable discomfort in participating in a\n\n\n                                          76 \n \n\fprocess where an individual may be sentenced to death.     McDaniel testified that\n\neven though her opinion about the death penalty has wavered over the years, “I\n\nreally doubt that I - - I could be in favor of the death penalty.” (RR11:101).\n\nWhen asked whether she could participate in death penalty decision, she stated, “I\n\ndon’t want to. I don’t - - I don’t think I can.” (RR11:104).       The prosecutor\n\nexplained the death penalty is not automatic.       (RR11:105).    The prosecutor\n\nexplained the special issues and asked McDaniel if she could answer them in such\n\na way that would result in a death sentence. (RR11:105-07). McDaniel testified\n\nthat she “can’t honestly say, but I am pretty sure I would not go for the death\n\npenalty.” (RR11:107). When finally pinned down, McDaniel testified she could\n\nnot guarantee the ability to set aside her personal feelings. (RR11:121).       The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: I’m going to - - I - - “I don’t think” and “maybe” and\n      “probably” are not - - are not words that lawyers are very good at\n      accepting, and I apologize, but the record has to be very clear, so I’m\n      going to ask it a different way. You don’t think you could. I’m going\n      to turn that around and ask you, can you guarantee both sides of this,\n      the State and the Defense, that you could set aside your personal\n      feelings and be a juror in this case, even if it resulted in the death\n      sentence?\n\n      [McDaniel]: No, I can’t guarantee it.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Thank you.\n\n(RR11:121).   The State challenged McDaniel for cause, which was granted over\n\nAppellant’s objection, based on the fact that “she would not be able to make that\n                                        77 \n \n\fdecision or at minimum could not guarantee us that she could set aside her\n\npersonal feeling and assess a sentence that may result in execution.” (RR11:122).\n\n      A venireperson may not be excused for her general opposition to the death\n\npenalty. Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 522-23 (1968); Rachal v. State, 917\n\nS.W.2d 799, 810 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).        A veniremember is challengeable for\n\ncause, however, if his beliefs against capital punishment would prevent or\n\nsubstantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with the\n\ncourt's instructions and the juror's oath. See Colburn v. State, 966 S.W.2d 511, 517\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1998).        A juror must be able to set aside her personal\n\npreferences and biases to consider as death eligible all those defined as death\n\neligible by section 19.03 of the penal code and article 37.071 of the criminal\n\nprocedure code. Rachal, 917 S.W.2d at 812.\n\n      Clearly, the totality of McDaniel’s voir dire testimony demonstrates that her\n\nbeliefs about capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\nperformance of her duties as a juror as required by law. She had a bias against the\n\nlaw governing a defendant’s eligibility for the death penalty. The record supports\n\nthe trial court’s decision to grant the State’s challenge.   See King, 29 S.W.3d at\n\n568. To conclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier.\n\nJones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n\n\n\n                                         78 \n \n\f      Appellant’s contention that he was denied the opportunity to question\n\nMcDaniel lacks merit. (Appellant’s Br. p. 59). During voir dire, when the State\n\nchallenged this juror, Appellant did not request an opportunity to question her.\n\n(RR11:122). See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.17, § 2. As such, any claim\n\nof that nature is not preserved for this Court’s review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1 (a);\n\nPena v. State, 285 S.W.3d 459, 463 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n                                   Terry Plank\n\n      In his questionnaire, Terry Plank wrote he is not in favor of the death\n\npenalty. (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p.1).    He wrote, “I feel no one has the right to\n\ntake the life of another, including the State.” (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p.1). In six\n\nseparate places, Plank wrote that he does not believe in the death penalty. (Plank,\n\nJuror 320A, Q. p.1, 2, 3). In one instance, he described the death penalty as “state\n\nsanctioned murder.” (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p.2). In contradiction, Plank ranked\n\nhimself as a “3,” indicating that “Although I do not believe that the death penalty\n\nshould ever be imposed, as long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under\n\nthe proper set of circumstances.” (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p. 1).\n\n      During voir dire, Plank testified he was “ambivalent” about the death\n\npenalty. (RR12:24).    Ultimately, he conceded that he could not guarantee that he\n\ncould set aside his personal feelings about the death penalty and follow the law.\n\n(RR12:29). The following exchange took place:\n\n\n                                        79 \n \n\f    [Prosecutor]: We’ve got to have people whose feelings are the death\n    penalty is appropriate in some cases, based on the evidence. And\n    yours is never.\n\n    [Plank]: Right.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: And so I would - - I would tell you that you’d be a great\n    juror on a case where the punishment range was 5 to 99 or life or even\n    on a capital murder case where we weren’t seeking the death penalty.\n    Sounds to me like you could give the State a fair trial in the first part\n    of the case on guilt/innocence, no issues there, but it’s the penalty\n    phase that causes you some concerns because of your personal\n    beliefs?\n\n    [Plank]: Absolutely.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: And if I had to ask you for today for a guarantee those\n    [beliefs] wouldn’t interfere, you couldn’t guarantee me that?\n\n    [Plank]: I don’t - - I know I disagree, so it’s hard to - - it’s hard to say\n    that I would just all of a sudden agree.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Right. And - - and you don’t have to - - I’m not trying\n    to change your opinion about the death penalty.\n\n    [Plank]: Right.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Just because you don’t agree with it, doesn’t necessarily\n    disqualify you from the jury pool. But you’ve got to be able to\n    promise me today and guarantee me today that your feelings against\n    the death penalty would not interfere with your ability to follow the\n    law, listen to the evidence, and base your verdict only on the\n    evidence, even if that meant that the death penalty was imposed. And\n    you’ve kind of already told me that this isn’t - - this isn’t really for\n    you, the death penalty; is that right?\n\n    [Plank]: I believe so.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: This won’t be the last jury summons you get, I promise.\n    And hopefully the next one wouldn’t be on a case where the death\n                                        80 \n \n\f      penalty was at issue. And I know it’s hard to say what you could or\n      couldn’t do in the future because you’ve never been put in those\n      shoes, but I’m telling you, you don’t have to be put in that position, if\n      you can’t guarantee me you could - - you could do it.\n\n      [Plank]: Right. I don’t think I can guarantee anything, not - - not\n      knowing, you know - - not ever having been in that position before.\n\n(RR12:27-29). The State challenged Plank for cause because “he cannot guarantee\n\nthe State that he would be able to follow the law and base his verdict on the\n\nevidence because of his strong opposition to the death penalty.” (RR12:29). The\n\ntotality of Plank’s voir dire testimony clearly demonstrates his beliefs about capital\n\npunishment would prevent or substantially impair his ability to follow the law.\n\nSee Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517. The record supports the trial court’s decision to\n\ngrant the State’s challenge. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568. To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Appellant argues that he was denied the opportunity to question Plank.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. p. 61-62). After the State challenged Plank for cause, Appellant\n\nrequested the opportunity to question him. (RR12:30).        The judge said that he\n\nwould “give [the defense] a chance,” but that the court “[didn’t] think he’s\n\nqualified.”   (RR12:30).    Then he granted the State’s challenge.        (RR12:30).\n\nAppellant objected. (RR12:30).        He did not, however, renew his request to\n\nquestion Plank as the court had previously said it would allow.           (RR12:30).\n\nInstead, he “object[ed] to not being able to rehabilitate him.” (RR12:30).\n\n\n                                         81 \n \n\f      Any error in denying Appellant’s request to question Plank is harmless. See\n\nTex. R. App. P. 44.2(b); Jones v. State, 982 S.W.2d 386, 391-92 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1998). With regard to the erroneous excusal of a venire member, reversal is\n\nrequired if the defendant was deprived of a lawfully constituted jury. See id. at\n\n394. As argued in detail above, the totality of Plank’s voir dire testimony clearly\n\ndemonstrates his beliefs about capital punishment would prevent or substantially\n\nimpair his ability to follow the law. See Simpson v. State, 119 S.W.3d 262, 266-67\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (finding error harmless where “Given the venire member’s\n\ntestimony, it is highly unlikely that the appellant would have been able to convince\n\nthe juror to say otherwise or that the trial court would have abused its discretion in\n\ndismissing her for cause.”).   Moreover, Appellant did not make a proffer of the\n\nquestions that he would have asked Plank had he been given the opportunity.\n\n(RR12:29-30).    As such, it cannot be determined whether he was denied the\n\nopportunity to properly question Plank.      Appellant has failed to show that he was\n\ndeprived of a lawfully constituted jury.\n\n                                  Floyd Stanmore\n\n      In his questionnaire, Floyd Stanmore ranked himself as a “2,” which\n\nindicates that he believes the death penalty is appropriate in some murder cases and\n\nthat he could return a verdict in a proper case which assessed the death penalty.\n\n(Stanmore, Juror 1118A, Q. p.1).       Stanmore later contradicted this statement,\n\n\n                                           82 \n \n\fhowever, when asked whether there was any reason why he would not want to\n\nserve as a juror in this case. He wrote, “I am not sure that I could vote for the\n\ndeath [penalty] [sic].” (Stanmore, Juror 1118A, Q. p18).       In his questionnaire,\n\nStanmore stated his concern that the death penalty is applied unfairly to minorities\n\nin Texas, including Dallas County. (Stanmore, Juror 1118A, Q. pp.2-3). Beyond\n\nthe death penalty, Stanmore wrote that the biggest problem in our criminal justice\n\nsystem is that “I do not think that minorities are treated fairly always.” (Stanmore,\n\nJuror 1118A, Q. p.4).\n\n      During voir dire, Stanmore reiterated his concern about whether all\n\ndefendants receive a fair trial. (RR32:70). He wondered “how many defendants\n\nor convicted individuals have actually been executed who were actually innocent.”\n\n(RR32:70). Stanmore testified as follows:\n\n      I can’t [100%] [sic] say that I would be able to sit through the process,\n      look at all the evidence, and listen to the evidence and still be able to\n      come to a conclusion that the death penalty is warranted in this case.\n\n(RR32:72). The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: So just from what you’re telling me, it kind of sounds\n      like, Mr. Stanmore, that you kind of did come in, you know, not\n      knowing - - most people, when we say the word you come in with a\n      bias or already come in with a preconceived notion, people think of\n      that negatively. I’m not saying it in a negative way. But I’m saying it\n      in such a way that as you sit here right now, you already kind of\n      know, based on your reservation, how you’d feel or how you would\n      lean toward, you know, a certain outcome of the trial. Like I said,\n      maybe this particular case isn’t the one for you. You know, maybe\n      another type of case that you don’t know as much information about\n                                         83 \n \n\f      or another type of case that the death penalty is nowhere near it.\n      Would you say that’s a true statement?\n\n      [Stanmore]: That’s pretty close to the truth, yes. I would say, yes.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: And that as you sit here right now, and you said you\n      can’t guarantee, let’s say the State, [100%] that you could base all of\n      you[r] information on the facts and evidence that come in this case,\n      that you’re still going to bring with you some of these reservations\n      because you didn’t leave those at the door, did you?\n\n      [Stanmore]: Not at all.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: All right.\n\n      [Stanmore]: That reservation is about the death penalty itself, not\n      about conviction.\n\n(RR32:73-74). The prosecutor explained the procedure involved in a capital case\n\nand that the State believed that it had the type, quality, and quantity of evidence\n\nthat would require the jury to answer the first special issue in the affirmative and\n\nthe second special issue in the negative. (RR32:76-77). Stanmore stated that “it\n\nwould bother [him] as an individual” to participate in the process. (RR32:78). At\n\nthat point, the State successfully challenged Stanmore for cause. (RR32:78).\n\nAppellant argued that Stanmore’s “reservations” and his reluctance to participate\n\nwere insufficient to sustain the State’s challenge. (RR32:79).\n\n      The totality of Stanmore’s voir dire testimony clearly shows his beliefs\n\nabout the criminal justice system and capital punishment would prevent or\n\nsubstantially impair his ability to carry out his obligations as a juror.       At a\n\n\n                                         84 \n \n\fminimum, Stanmore vacillated. Where the venire member either vacillates or\n\nequivocates on his ability to follow the law, the Court should defer to the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment on the challenge for cause. Granados v. State, 85 S.W.3d 217,\n\n231 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). The record supports the trial court’s decision to grant\n\nthe State’s challenge. See Segundo v. State, 270 S.W.3d 79, 94 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2008) (“We therefore defer to the trial judge, who can best determine, based upon\n\nthe [venire member’s] tone and tenor, whether that person could follow the\n\napplicable law despite his views about the death penalty.”). To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Appellant also contends that he was denied the opportunity to question\n\nStanmore.    (Appellant’s Br. p. 63-64).     After the State challenged Stanmore for\n\ncause, Appellant objected to Stanmore being excused without the opportunity to\n\nquestion him. (RR32:79). Any error in denying Appellant’s request is harmless.\n\nSee Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b); Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 391-92. As argued in detail\n\nabove, the totality of Stanmore’s voir dire testimony clearly shows his beliefs\n\nabout the criminal justice system and capital punishment would prevent or\n\nsubstantially impair his ability to carry out his obligations as a juror. He was also a\n\nvacillating juror.   See Simpson, 119 S.W.3d at 266-67.      As above, Appellant did\n\nnot make a proffer of the questions that he would have asked Stanmore had he\n\nbeen given the opportunity. (RR32:78-79). As such, it cannot be determined\n\n\n                                           85 \n \n\fwhether he was denied the opportunity to properly question Stanmore.      Appellant\n\nhas failed to show that he was deprived of a lawfully constituted jury.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State’s challenges\n\nfor cause regarding Boulos, McDaniel, Plank, and Stanmore. Even assuming their\n\nexcusal was erroneous, it was harmless. The erroneous excusal of a venireperson\n\nwarrants reversal only if the record shows that the error deprived the defendant of a\n\nlawfully constituted jury. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 393. Appellant makes no such\n\nshowing.    Moreover, no evidence indicates that the jurors who served on\n\nAppellant’s jury were in any way biased, interested, or otherwise disqualified from\n\nserving.   As a result, reversal is unwarranted. See Feldman v. State, 71 S.W.3d\n\n738, 749 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (holding any error in excusing venireperson was\n\nharmless absent any showing that she was excused based on general opposition to\n\ndeath penalty or that any juror was unfit for jury duty).\n\n      Issues 8 through 19 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 20 TO 27: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n      In Issues 20 through 27, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his challenges to 8 prospective jurors. In so doing, Appellant argues, the\n\ntrial court violated his right to a fair and unbiased jury under the United States\n\nConstitution and article 35.16(c)(2) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.\n                                          86 \n \n\f                                   Applicable Law\n\n      A prospective juror may be challenged for cause if, among other reasons, he\n\npossesses a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the defendant or he possesses a\n\nbias against an aspect of the law upon which the State or the defendant is entitled\n\nto rely. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 35.16(a)(9), (c)(2); Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667.\n\n      Appellant has the burden of establishing that his challenge for cause is\n\nproper. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747. Before a venire member can be excused\n\nfor bias, the law must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can\n\nfollow that law regardless of his personal views. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nAppellant does not meet his burden of establishing that his challenge for cause is\n\nproper until he has shown that the prospective juror understood the requirement of\n\nthe law and could not overcome his prejudice well enough to follow it. See\n\nFeldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747.\n\n      When reviewing a trial court’s decision to deny a challenge for cause, the\n\nappellate court looks at the entire record to determine if there is sufficient evidence\n\nto support the ruling. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The appellate court reviews a\n\ntrial court’s ruling with “considerable” or “great” deference because the trial judge\n\nis in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror’s demeanor and was present\n\nto observe the juror and listen to his tone of voice. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667;\n\n\n                                          87 \n \n\fSaldano v. State, 232 S.W.3d 77, 91 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Particular deference\n\nis given when the venire member’s answers are vacillating, unclear, or\n\ncontradictory.   Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.       When the venire member is\n\npersistently uncertain about having the ability to follow the law, the reviewing\n\ncourt does not second guess the trial court and must defer to its decision. Gardner,\n\n306 S.W.3d at 295-96; Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517. The appellate court reverses a\n\ntrial court’s ruling on a challenge for cause “only if a clear abuse of discretion is\n\nevident.” Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517.\n\n      Harm from the erroneous denial of a defense challenge for cause occurs\n\nunder the following circumstances: (1) a defendant exercises a peremptory\n\nchallenge on a prospective juror whom the trial court erroneously failed to excuse\n\nfor cause at the defendant’s request, (2) the defendant uses all of his statutorily-\n\nallotted peremptory challenges, and (3) the trial court denies the defendant’s\n\nrequest for an additional peremptory challenge to use on another prospective juror\n\nwhom the defendant identifies as “objectionable” and who actually sits on the jury.\n\nSaldano, 232 S.W.3d at 91. When all of these conditions are met, the defendant\n\nhas been wrongfully deprived of one of his statutory peremptory challenges in that\n\nhe was forced to use a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror who\n\nshould have been removed for cause. See id. If the defendant received additional\n\nperemptory challenges beyond the fifteen allotted by statute, he must show harm\n\n\n                                         88 \n \n\fby proving that the trial court erroneously denied a number of defense challenges\n\nfor cause equal to at least one more than the number of additional peremptory\n\nchallenges granted. Escamilla v. State, 143 S.W.3d 814, 821 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2004).\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      After the trial court qualified a panel of 44 prospective jurors, the parties\n\nasserted their peremptory challenges at a hearing, which was conducted on October\n\n15, 2013. (RR43). During this hearing, Appellant exhausted all 15 of his statutory\n\nperemptory strikes as well as 2 additional strikes granted by the court. (RR43:9-\n\n18). He struck James Couch (Juror 80A), Craig Matthews (Juror 154A), Kevin\n\nPowell (Juror 179A), Kimberly Turvan (Juror 295A), Laura Carroll (Juror 433A),\n\nMolli Elliston (Juror 532A), Jerry Mace (Juror 615A), Rudy Ochoa (Juror 617A),\n\nHolly Sanders (Juror 636A), Debra Filler (Juror 701A), Sandra Gromacki (Juror\n\n756A), Sabastian Coleman (Juror 1023A), Jessica Magee (Juror 1149A), Sarah\n\nWagler (Juror 1168A), Deemie Naugle (Juror 1196A), Raul Ibarra-Avila (Juror\n\n1351A), and Christina Salazar (Juror 1365A). (RR43:8-17). Appellant requested\n\na third additional strike.   (RR43:17).    That request was denied and the next\n\nqualified prospective juror, Shonquidria Jenkins (Juror 1368A), was seated on the\n\njury. (RR43:17-18).    Appellant identified Jenkins as an “objectionable juror” and\n\n\n\n\n                                          89 \n \n\fagain requested an additional strike.13 (RR43:17-18).                                    That request was denied.\n\n(RR43:18). After Jenkins, the next qualified prospective juror, Jerri Adams (Juror\n\n1393A), was seated on the jury. (RR43:18). Appellant did not identify Adams as\n\nan “objectionable juror.” (RR43:18).\n\n              At trial, Appellant did not identify Powell, Matthews, Carroll, Elliston,\n\nMace, Gromacki, Wagler, or Adams as “objectionable jurors.” (RR43:9, 10, 11,\n\n12, 15-16).                    The only juror he identified as objectionable was Jenkins. (RR43:17-\n\n18, 23).                  And, of the pool of jurors identified in Issues 20 through 27, the only\n\njuror Appellant was forced to accept who actually sat on the jury and deliberated\n\nwas Jerri Adams.\n\n              Since Appellant received 2 extra peremptory challenges in addition to the 15\n\nallotted by statute for use on the pool in selecting 12 jurors, he must show that the\n\ntrial court erroneously denied at least three of his challenges for cause. See, e.g.,\n\nSaldano, 232 S.W.3d at 93 (noting that Saldano would have to show 3 erroneous\n\ndenials because he received two extra peremptory strikes). Appellant has not met\n\nhis burden.\n\n                                                               Issue #20: Kevin Powell\n\n              During voir dire, Appellant challenged Kevin Powell for cause because\n\nPowell answered in his questionnaire that he would give more credibility to police\n                                                            \n13\n  Later in the hearing, Appellant explained that Jenkins was objectionable “primarily because\nshe had indicated that she was a victim of family violence or domestic violence[.]” (RR43:23).\n                                                                         90 \n \n\fofficers. (RR8:56). Powell also answered “yes” to a question asking whether he\n\nbelieved that police officers are more likely to tell the truth than the average\n\nperson.   (Powell, Juror 179A, Q. p. 5).        Appellant’s challenge was denied.\n\n(RR8:60).\n\n      A defendant may insist on jurors who will impartially judge the credibility\n\nof witnesses. Hernandez v. State, 563 S.W.2d 947, 950 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978).\n\nA venire member who believes a police officer would never lie under oath has an\n\nimpermissible bias against the defendant under article 35.16(a)(9) of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(a)(9); Lane v. State,\n\n822 S.W.2d 35, 42 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor questioned Powell regarding his view of\n\npolice officer credibility. (RR8:15-16).      Powell affirmed he could wait until a\n\nwitness testifies before he judges their credibility.         (RR8:15-16). Under\n\nquestioning by defense counsel, Powell affirmed his belief that police officers are\n\nmore likely to tell the truth than the average person.     (RR8:41-42).    Defense\n\ncounsel explained the law required that “you have to start all witnesses off the\n\nsame, that just because of a person’s occupation, they are not deemed more\n\ncredible than anyone else.” (RR8:42).      Powell affirmed he understood the law.\n\n(RR8:42). Counsel asked whether Powell would agree that the opinion expressed\n\nin his questionnaire is different than his testimony in court. (RR8:42). Powell\n\n\n                                        91 \n \n\fresponded, “Well, you asked me about my feelings, and that’s what I responded\n\nto.” (RR8:42). Apparently, Powell was attempting to distinguish that the opinions\n\nexpressed in his questionnaire were his “feelings” as opposed to the law.       The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Okay. And are your feelings that even knowing\n      what the law says, that you give police officers more credibility than\n      you do the average citizen? And as I said, there’s no such thing as a\n      right answer or wrong answer. I just want to know how you feel.\n\n      [Powell]: Right. Again, I understand, you know, what you’re saying\n      to me, and - - and I base this on, you know, my feelings, but I can be,\n      you know, fair with every witness that - - if I heard that testimony.\n\n(RR8:42-43). Later, defense counsel returned to the subject and asked whether, if\n\nhe served on the jury and understood the law, Powell would give police officers\n\nmore credibility. (RR8:44). Powell testified he “would look at everything that has\n\nbeen given and all the testimony that, you know, I hear and I believe I can give a\n\ngood and fair response to it.” (RR8:44).\n\n      The totality of Powell’s testimony indicates he would wait to hear a\n\nwitness’s testimony before judging that witness’s credibility.   To the extent that\n\nany of his responses may be interpreted as contradictory, this Court should defer to\n\nthe trial court’s resolution of his responses. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The\n\nreviewing court must give great deference to the trial court’s decision on a\n\nchallenge for cause based on the trial judge’s opportunity to observe the venire\n\nmember during voir dire. Id. When the record reflects that a prospective juror\n                                           92 \n \n\fvacillated or equivocated on her ability to follow the law, the reviewing court must\n\ndefer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295. Given Powell’s assurances\n\nthat he could follow the law, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nPowell was not biased against Appellant. See Lane, 822 S.W.2d at 45 (holding\n\nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a challenge for cause\n\nwhere, venire member said she would “evaluate a police officer[’s credibility] as\n\nshe would any other [witness]”).\n\n      Appellant also challenged Powell on the basis that he would automatically\n\nassess the death penalty after finding a guilty verdict on capital murder.    In his\n\nquestionnaire, Powell wrote he is in favor of the death penalty and “If a person is\n\nproven guilty of taking someones [sic] life in commission of a crime their life\n\nshould be taken.” (Powell, Juror 179A, Q. p.2.).     On its face, Powell’s response\n\nsuggests he believed that all murders warrant a death sentence. The remainder of\n\nPowell’s questionnaire and voir dire indicates otherwise, however.\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor explained that a verdict of guilty as to\n\ncapital murder does not automatically lead to the death penalty. (RR8:25, 29, 34-\n\n35). The jurors would then have to consider the special issues. (RR8:25-26, 29-\n\n35). Powell affirmed that he understood. (RR8:25-26, 29-353). He affirmed that\n\nhe would hold the State to its burden of proof on the first special issue. (RR8:37-\n\n38). Importantly, Powell wrote in his questionnaire and affirmed during voir dire\n\n\n                                        93 \n \n\fthat in some circumstances, a life sentence is appropriate. (RR8:17; Powell, Juror\n\n179A, Q. p.2).     Thus, although Powell believed that the death penalty was an\n\nappropriate punishment for murder he did not believe the death penalty should be\n\nautomatic for every murder.       His answer to the first special issue would be\n\ndetermined by an examination of all the evidence, rather than solely the guilty\n\nverdict.\n\n      Lastly, Appellant contends that Powell should have been excused based on\n\nhis belief that the death penalty is appropriate in circumstances involving robbery,\n\nsexual assault, torture, or abuse of children and the elderly. (Appellant’s Br. at 65).\n\nThis complaint was not asserted at trial and is not properly preserved for this\n\nCourt’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Regardless, Appellant’s contention\n\nlacks merit. During voir dire, Appellant briefly questioned Powell about his belief\n\nthat other offenses should be eligible for the death penalty. (RR8:48-49). Powell\n\naffirmed his belief that the death penalty should be available for sexual assault,\n\ntorture, or abuse of children or the elderly. (RR8:49).      Defense counsel did not\n\nask Powell whether this belief would interfere with his ability to follow the law in\n\nthis case. (RR8:48-49). Indeed, counsel simply moved on to a different line of\n\nquestioning. (RR8:49). As such, he failed to show that Powell was challengeable\n\nfor cause on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                          94 \n \n\f      Based on the totality of the voir dire testimony, sufficient evidence supports\n\nthe trial court’s ruling, and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nAppellant’s challenge for cause against Powell. No evidence sustains that Powell\n\nwas biased in any way against Appellant or the law. During voir dire, Powell\n\naffirmed he would afford Appellant the presumption of innocence; he would hold\n\nthe State to its burden of proof; he would not require the defense to present any\n\nevidence; he would not consider Appellant’s silence as evidence; he would wait to\n\nhear a witness’s testimony before determining credibility; and, he understood that\n\nthe death penalty is not automatic for capital murder. (RR8:12-18, 25-26, 29, 34,\n\n37-38). Accordingly, Issue 20 should be overrruled.\n\n                            Issue #21: Craig Matthews\n\n      Appellant challenged Craig Matthews for cause on the basis that he would\n\nbe “predisposed or leaning toward answering Special Issue Number 1 yes” if he\n\nfound Appellant guilty of capital murder. (RR9:111). The trial court stated:\n\n      I don’t think a disqualifying question was asked him on that matter.\n      And I think after hearing all of his testimony, I think he can follow the\n      law and be a fair juror, so I’m going to deny your challenge.\n\n(RR9:111). The record supports the trial court’s determination.\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor explained, “There are no automatics in this\n\nprocess.” (RR9:54). She further explained that after a verdict of guilt, jurors do\n\nnot vote whether the defendant should receive a life or death sentence; the jurors\n\n\n                                         95 \n \n\fwould have to answer the special issues. (RR9:55).          Matthews affirmed his\n\nunderstanding. (RR9:55-56). The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Absolutely. And, you know, we ask you all these\n      things before the law has been explained to you, and that’s why I just\n      want to make sure that even though this is your personal belief that\n      you are completely entitled to at all times, that you would then be able\n      to - - and you’re not going to have to memorize this. You’ll see it\n      again in the jury’s charge, the special issues. I just want to make sure\n      that if the law is given to you by the Court, you would then be able to\n      render your verdict based on the law and the evidence and not have\n      any automatics. No automatic response because somebody is found\n      guilty of the offense of capital murder and no matter how cold,\n      horrible, and heinous, that you will be able to deliberate with regards\n      to Special Issue Number 1 and make the State prove that to you\n      beyond a reasonable doubt before answering it yes.\n\n      [Matthews]: Yeah.\n\n(RR9:71). Matthews repeatedly affirmed his understanding that the verdict must\n\nbe based on the law and the evidence and with no automatic answers.        (RR9:56,\n\n58, 59, 60, 67, 68, 74, 81). When defense counsel asked Matthews what his\n\n“feelings on the death penalty” would be after he (on a hypothetical jury) found a\n\ndefendant guilty of capital murder, Matthews responded:\n\n      I don’t know. My understanding of the law as it’s been presented to\n      me is that - - if those causes and consequences are proven, then - -\n      then it’s an option relative to the two special issues.\n\n(RR9:85).     Matthews accepted that the appropriate punishment for someone\n\nfound guilty of capital murder could be life without parole. (RR9:85). The record\n\nreflects that Matthews’ examination of the law and evidence as related to the two\n\n\n                                        96 \n \n\fspecial issues would control his answers rather than the verdict.        As such, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant’s challenge for cause\n\nagainst Matthews.\n\n      Issue 21 should be overruled.\n\n                              Issue #22: Laura Carroll\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Laura Carroll for cause because she was\n\n“mitigation impaired” and because “someone would have to convince her that life\n\nwas the more appropriate verdict.” (RR15:74).             The trial court denied this\n\nchallenge. (RR15:74). The record reflects no bias against the law governing the\n\nmitigation special issue and, thus, supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n      During voir dire, Carroll affirmed that if she were to find someone guilty of\n\ncapital murder, she would not “be leaning toward the death penalty[.]” (RR15:49).\n\nShe testified, “No. It would depend on the circumstances throughout the entire\n\ntrial. I can’t make a presumption like that without having any kind of evidence to\n\nsay that, yes, I would go either way.” (RR15:49).         Carroll testified that Special\n\nIssue No. 2 “always matters.” (RR15:57). “There could be” evidence that would\n\nconvince her that life is the appropriate punishment. (RR15:57). She testified she\n\nwould “lean more closely toward the death penalty” (after having found someone\n\nguilty of capital murder and found him a future danger), “but [she] would have no\n\nproblem listening to others and discussing why we should go with a life sentence\n\n\n                                           97 \n \n\finstead.” (RR15:57-58). See Coleman v. State, 881 S.W.2d 344, 352 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1994) (holding that the trial court did not err in denying a challenge for cause\n\nfor an inability to consider mitigating evidence where the record showed that the\n\nprospective juror could listen to the evidence with an open mind).\n\n         In Saldano, this Court stated that a veniremember is not challengeable for\n\ncause simply because he would place the burden of proof on the defense regarding\n\nmitigation. Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 92 (citing Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 559\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1999)). Nevertheless, Carroll testified she would not require the\n\ndefense to present such evidence. (RR15:58).            The following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n         [Defense counsel]: If you - - if - - on your hypothetical jury, you\n         found somebody guilty of capital murder, you found beyond a\n         reasonable doubt that they are going to be a threat in the future, is the\n         Defense going to have to bring you some kind of evidence to convince\n         you that life is appropriate at that point?\n\n         [Carroll]: You would think that they would. I would think that they\n         would.\n\n         [Defense Counsel]: Would you require that?\n\n         [Carroll]: No.\n\n(RR15:58). Defense counsel later returned to the topic and asked whether Carroll’s\n\npersonal feeling, after having found someone a future danger, would be that the\n\ndeath penalty is appropriate. (RR15:71). Carroll testified, “It would be, yes.”\n\n(RR15:71). Counsel asked whether her feeling would remain unless “somebody\n                                            98 \n \n\fcan convince you otherwise[.]” (RR15:71). Carroll testified, “I would be, yes.”\n\n(RR15:71).     Carroll never testified the defense must bring any evidence to\n\nconvince her that life was the appropriate sentence. (RR15:71). The totality of\n\nCarroll’s testimony indicates she would be fair and impartial and would listen to all\n\nevidence in order to answer the two special issues. This Court should defer to the\n\ntrial court’s resolution of any of her possible conflicting responses. See Feldman,\n\n71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n      Issue 22 should be overrruled.\n\n                               Issue #23: Molli Elliston\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Molli Elliston for cause because, as to Special\n\nIssue No. 1, Elliston would only require one criminal act of violence. (RR16:56).\n\nThe trial court denied Appellant’s challenge for cause. (RR16:56).\n\n      During voir dire, defense counsel questioned Elliston regarding Special\n\nIssue No. 1.     When discussed “criminal acts of violence,” he asked Elliston\n\nwhether she would require a single act of violence or multiple and instructed her\n\nthat the term had no definition. (RR16:44). Elliston testified she would “have to\n\nthink about that, if that truly means acts plural and not a singular act.” (RR16:44).\n\nShe testified that it “seems a little bit like splitting hairs to whether it would be just\n\none or multiple.” (RR16:45). The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Defense counsel]: But that seems to be a hair that the legislature has\n      split.\n                                           99 \n \n\f    [Elliston]: Okay. Well, I’d have to think about that.\n\n    [. . .]\n\n    [Defense counsel]: Well, do you want me to - - to - - to come back to\n    it? Do you - - or - - because it’s - - it’s an important question, and it’s\n    - - it’s what the legislature requires, that you would have to believe\n    that the Defendant would commit criminal acts, plural, of violence.\n\n    [Elliston]: I’m thinking. Criminal acts of violence - - If - - I - - if you\n    think a person is - - is likely to commit another act of violence which\n    would constitute a threat to society, then I’m having trouble\n    distinguishing it it’s - - if you have - - if anybody can be so specific as\n    saying, one - - they can do one future act of violence but not five. I\n    don’t know how - - I don’t know how you ever - - I’m not sure they\n    did intend that. I think it’s maybe - - I don’t know. I don’t know. If I\n    - - if I thought - - if that act of violence is to kill somebody else, that’s\n    a continuing threat to society. One person being killed is a threat,\n    whether it’s a prison - -\n\n    [. . .]\n\n    [Defense Counsel]: And hopefully we can - - we can figure this out.\n    Are you saying that if you thought there’s a probability that the\n    Defendant would commit a criminal act, singular, that would be\n    sufficient for you to answer Special Issue Number 1 yes, as opposed\n    to criminal acts, plural?\n\n    [Elliston]: Yeah, I think so. I think when you’ve already got a strike\n    against you and if you - - if some - - I just don’t - - you’re - - you’re -\n    - you’re speculating anyway at best whether or not they will commit\n    future acts. It’s - - no one really knows that. So I do not see how you\n    can break it down and say I think they’ll possibly commit one other\n    act, but that would certainly be their limit. I just don’t think you can\n    do that. If that’s what the legislature intended, I’m a believer in\n    following the law, regardless of my beliefs, but I just got to - - I don’t\n    - - I’d love to - -\n\n\n\n                                        100 \n \n\f(RR16:46-47). Importantly, Elliston testified that she would have to “think about\n\nthat.” (RR16:45).    Elliston vacillated on this issue. (RR16:45-47).    When the\n\nrecord reflects that a prospective juror vacillated or equivocated on her ability to\n\nfollow the law, the reviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295.\n\n      Issue 23 should be overruled.\n\n                              Issue #24: Jerry Mace\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Jerry Mace for cause for the following\n\nreasons: (1) he would presume future danger if the individual is guilty of capital\n\nmurder; and (2) he is “mitigation impaired.” (RR18:68). Appellant’s challenge\n\nwas denied. (RR18:68). The record supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n      The State must prove the future dangerousness special issue beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(c). Any venire\n\nmember who would automatically answer the future dangerousness special issue in\n\nthe affirmative or who would place the burden of proof on the defense is\n\nchallengeable for cause under article 35.16(c)(2) for having a bias or prejudice\n\nagainst a law applicable to the case upon which the defense is entitled to rely.\n\nFeldman, 71 S.W.3d at 745.\n\n      Mace’s voir dire testimony shows he held no bias against the law governing\n\nthe first special issue. During voir dire, the prosecutor explained the various\n\n\n                                        101 \n \n\faspects of the first special issue, particularly that the State must prove that the\n\nanswer to that question is “yes.” (RR18:26-31, 30).    She explained that while the\n\njury could consider the facts of the case in answering the question, “it’s not an\n\nautomatic answer. In other words, just because you’re convicted of capital murder\n\ndoesn’t always mean that Special Issue Number 1 is yes.” (RR18:30). Mace\n\nindicated he understood.     (RR18:31).    He testified, “Well, you have to be\n\nconcerned about [the facts of the offense], but you’ve got to listen to everything\n\nthat went down and just determine then was it - - or is he going to do it again or\n\nmore than likely will he do it again[.]” (RR18:31). Moreover, when he was\n\nquestioned by the defense, Mace denied that a robbery indicates a person is a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. (RR18:57). Clearly, Mace understood the State had\n\nto prove future danger and he would hold the State to its burden.\n\n      Appellant’s complaint that Mace is “mitigation impaired” is also refuted by\n\nthe record.   On his questionnaire, Mace was asked what he thought about the fact\n\nthat “[s]ome people feel genetics, circumstances of birth, upbringing and\n\nenvironment should be considered when determining the proper punishment of\n\nsomeone convicted of a crime.”      Mace wrote, “B.S.! I’m not concerned about\n\nhow they were raised. Only that a horrific crime was committed.” (Mace, Juror\n\n615A, Q. p.6). Notably, this answer was given before Mace was instructed on the\n\n\n\n\n                                        102 \n \n\fapplicable law. During voir dire, defense counsel questioned Mace about his\n\nanswer. The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: You don’t have to use the - - use the word, but\n      does the B.S. represent the way you feel?\n\n      [Mace]: To bring it in as - - yes, in a sense. The - - the act itself was\n      the individual’s - - at that moment, what transpired growing up and - -\n      and such, probably got him to that point or got her to that point or\n      helped to get to that point, but that didn’t - - that doesn’t come into\n      play when it’s the act itself.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Okay. And does it come into play when you’re\n      considering punishment?\n\n      [Mace]: It may, depending on Special Issue Number 2 and the\n      mitigation circumstances. I don’t know. You know, if certain\n      circumstances say that - - I’d have to - - I’d have to hear it. I don’t\n      know. You know, I mean, I would be open to listening to it, and I\n      definitely wouldn’t be qualified to say that, well, background and\n      generics [sic] - - genetics have a lot of pull on this. I wouldn’t know\n      that. I would expect you all to tell me what is going on here.”\n\n(RR18: 58-59).    Mace testified he could consider mitigating circumstances, which\n\ncould warrant a life sentence. (RR18:60).      His testimony shows that he would\n\nconsider the evidence but that he might not regard it as mitigating. His testimony\n\ndoes not show that he would not consider the evidence at all. That Mace could\n\nconsider mitigating evidence is all that is constitutionally required. See Cordova v.\n\nState, 733 S.W.2d 175, 189 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987); see also Coleman, 881\n\nS.W.2d at 352 (holding that the trial court did not err in denying a challenge for\n\n\n\n\n                                        103 \n \n\fcause for an inability to consider mitigating evidence where the record showed that\n\nthe venire member could “listen with an open mind”).\n\n      Issue 24 should be overruled.\n\n                           Issue #25: Sandra Gromacki\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Sandra Gromacki for cause because Gromacki\n\ncould not presume a life sentence is the proper punishment and “she leaned toward\n\nthe death penalty.” (RR20:103-04). He also complained that “she would consider\n\nit if the Defendant failed to testify during the penalty phase in consideration of\n\nSpecial Issue Number 2.”       (RR20:104).      Appellant’s challenge was denied.\n\n(RR20:104). The record supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n      The law does not require that a juror presume a life sentence is the proper\n\npunishment. See Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 303. Nevertheless, the record shows\n\nGromacki would apply such a presumption.         During voir dire, defense counsel\n\nasked whether, if Gromacki found someone guilty of capital murder, she would\n\n“lean heavily toward the death penalty?” (RR20:81). Gromacki admitted that she\n\nwould but testified that “[her] answer for that, though, would not be like\n\n[100%][.]”   (RR20:81).     Defense counsel later returned to this subject and\n\nGromacki affirmed her previous stance.         (RR20:94).   Defense counsel asked\n\nwhether Gromacki was “telling us that you could not follow the presumption that\n\nlife without parole would be the appropriate punishment[.]” (RR20:95). Gromacki\n\n\n                                        104 \n \n\fresponded, “No[,]” that while she might lean toward the death penalty, she would\n\nstill follow the presumption regarding life without parole. (RR20:95).\n\n      Next, Gromacki was asked whether she agreed that she would have to hear\n\nfrom Appellant in order to answer Special Issue No. 2 “yes.”             (RR20:88).\n\nGromacki testified, “Not - - not necessarily, no.” (RR20:88). Then, the following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Well, there are people that come in and say, you\n      know what, I could never find something sufficiently mitigating\n      unless - - without hearing from him, without hearing if he was sorry or\n      how he felt about it. Do you know what I mean?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Uh-huh, yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: How do you feel about that?\n\n      [Gromacki]: I could see that playing a part in the mitigating\n      circumstances.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: So it is something that you would consider?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: If the Defendant didn’t testify in the penalty\n      phase with regard to Special Issue Number 2, that is something you\n      would take into consideration?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Despite the fact that the law says he doesn’t have\n      to testify?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Yes.\n\n\n\n                                       105 \n \n\f(RR20:89). The trial court later rehabilitated Gromacki. The judge explained the\n\nlaw and asked whether Gromacki could follow the law. (RR20:103). Gromacki\n\nsaid she could. (RR20:103). The judge then asked whether Gromacki, knowing\n\nthe law, would require Appellant to testify as to Special Issue No. 2. (RR20:103).\n\nGromacki said “no.” (RR20:103).\n\n       The totality of Gromacki’s testimony indicates that she would be fair and\n\nimpartial and would listen to all evidence to answer the two special issues. This\n\nCourt should defer to the trial court’s resolution of any possible contradictory\n\nresponses. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n      Issue 25 should be overruled.\n\n                            Issue #26: Sarah Wagler\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Sarah Wagler for cause on the basis that she\n\ncould not fairly apply the presumption of innocence and that she “would require\n\nthe Defense to do something.” (RR34:83).        Appellant’s challenge was denied.\n\n(RR34:83). The record reflects that Wagler had no bias against the presumption of\n\ninnocence.   Although she would expect Appellant to present evidence in his\n\ndefense, she would not require him to.\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor asked Wagler whether she was familiar with\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. (RR34:17). Wagler responded, “That’s not to incriminate\n\nyourself, correct?” (RR34:17).    The prosecutor explained a defendant cannot be\n\n\n                                         106 \n \n\fcompelled to testify. (RR34:17). Wagler affirmed she understood. (RR34:17).\n\nThe prosecutor asked what Wagler’s verdict would be if the State failed to prove\n\nits case and Wagler responded she “would have to acquit.” (RR34:17).           The\n\nrecord is clear that Wagler could fairly apply the presumption of innocence.\n\n      Then, defense counsel questioned Wagler regarding the fact that the defense\n\nhas no burden of proof:\n\n      [Defense counsel]: You understand that this table has absolutely no\n      burden to present any evidence to the jury at all.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n      [Defense counsel]: And you can’t require that.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n      [. . .]\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: But under the law, we don’t have to prove a thing\n      to you.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: We don’t have to prove that Matthew Johnson is\n      not guilty. We don’t have to prove that Matthew Johnson would not\n      be a continuing threat to society.\n\n      [Wagler]: Uh-huh.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:     And we don’t have to prove any kind of\n      mitigation to you.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right. My reasonable expectation would be that if the\n      State presented X, Y, and Z, that the Defense would come back and\n      counter why X, Y, and Z did not exist or what made changes to X, Y,\n                                        107 \n \n\f      and Z, not just sit there and let them make a statement and not say\n      anything back. That’s what I meant by both good and bad - -\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Okay.\n\n      [Wagler]: - - in play.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: But you understand the State has got the burden\n      of proving it. We don’t have - - we don’t have to prove why the\n      State’s wrong or that the State’s wrong or - - or anything like that.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n(RR34:60-61).    Later, however, when defense counsel asked whether she would\n\nrequire the defense to “counter” the State’s evidence, Wagler testified, “[I]f there’s\n\nno counter, then to me, you’re accepting what’s being said.”              (RR34:62).\n\nEssentially, Wagler would require the defense to “counter what is being said or\n\nwhat is being presented[.]” (RR34:62-63). Defense counsel explained the law did\n\nnot place any burden on the defense. (RR34:64). Wagler testified she “would\n\nhave an expectation that [the defense] would want to counter something that was\n\nnegative.” (RR34:64). Without that “counter,” Wagler testified that “then it’s just\n\nmy personal belief as to whether or not I happen to feel whichever person is\n\nspeaking for the State is saying the truth or not the truth.” (RR34:65). Wagler\n\ntestified she would require the defense to counter the State’s evidence or “assume\n\nthe responsibility that I’m going to make a personal judgment on my own as to\n\nwhether or not I believe what the State is presenting or not presenting.”\n\n(RR34:65).\n                                         108 \n \n\f      The trial court interjected and instructed Wagler regarding the presumption\n\nof innocence and the fact that a defendant has no burden of proof. (RR34:66).\n\nWagler affirmed she understood. (RR34:66). Wagler testified she could presume\n\ninnocence and return a verdict of not guilty even if the defense did not present any\n\nevidence. (RR34:67). She also testified she could answer Special Issue No. 1 “no”\n\nwithout hearing anything from the defense. (RR34:72).\n\n      The totality of Wagler’s testimony shows that she could apply the\n\npresumption of innocence and that she would not require the defense to present any\n\nevidence. This Court should defer to the trial court’s resolution of any possible\n\ncontradictory responses. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n      Issue 26 should be overruled.\n\n                             Issue #27: Jerri Adams\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Jerri Adams for cause for the following\n\nreasons:   (1) she would disregard trial court instructions that conflicted with\n\nScripture; (2) she would extend more credibility to police officers; and, (3) she is\n\n“mitigation challenged based on her answers in her questionnaire and her answers\n\nto the Court.” (RR39:99). The trial court denied Appellant’s challenge, and with\n\ngood cause. (RR39:99).\n\n      Adams testified that she attends church regularly and that her faith is very\n\nimportant to her. (RR39:61-62). She testified her religious beliefs do not conflict\n\n\n                                        109 \n \n\fwith the death penalty. (RR39:16). On her questionnaire, in response to a question\n\nasking if the death penalty should be available for murder in the course of robbery,\n\nAdams wrote that she agreed and that the “laws of the land should be followed as\n\nlong as there is no contradiction with Scripture – the Bible gives several\n\nreasons/examples in both the old and new testaments where death was the\n\npunishment.” (Adams, Juror 1393A, Q. p.2). Defense counsel questioned Adams\n\nat length about this subject. (RR39:61-68). Adams clarified when she wrote the\n\naforementioned statement in her questionnaire, she “meant in the bigger picture[.]”\n\n(RR39:62). She testified, “If the law says you can do it, I still don’t think you can\n\ndo it, because I believe it is against [S]cripture.” (RR39:62). She mentioned\n\nabortion as an example. (RR39:62, 64). Adams “didn’t mean that [she was] not\n\ngoing to obey whatever the law is in the court for determining [a legal outcome].”\n\n(RR39:62).\n\n      Defense counsel again pursued the subject and at one point, Adams\n\nconceded if the instructed law conflicted with Scripture, Adams would follow\n\nScripture. (RR39:64-65).      Adams noted, however, she had never encountered\n\nsuch a situation and she could not imagine one. (RR39:65, 67).         She testified,\n\n“There’s not any - - there’s not a law that I - - that I know of that’s going to not\n\nallow me to follow.” (RR39:66).        Ultimately, Adams testified that she would\n\nfollow the law applicable in a death penalty case. (RR39:68).\n\n\n                                        110 \n \n\f      In Gardner, a prospective juror testified, like Adams, that if the law violated\n\nScripture, he would follow Scripture. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 298. Also like\n\nAdams, the juror testified he had never encountered such a situation. Id.       This\n\nCourt held the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in denying Gardner’s\n\nchallenge for cause because the existence of “some unknown, hypothetical\n\nsituation in which man’s law was in conflict with [the juror’s] understanding of\n\nScripture does not mean that he was unable or unwilling to follow the law in a\n\ndeath-penalty case.” Id. at 299.    The same logic applies here. Adams testified\n\nsome unknown situation may cause the law to conflict with Scripture. (RR39:65-\n\n66). Even so, she testified she would follow the law in a death penalty case.\n\n(RR39:68).    The trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Adams’ responses\n\nregarding her ability to follow the law, and he found them credible.\n\n      On her questionnaire, Adams wrote police officers are more likely to tell the\n\ntruth “because they are a group that has been culled from all that apply & they\n\nlikely better understand the repurcussions [sic] of not telling the truth.” (Adams,\n\nJuror 1393A, Q. p. 5). During voir dire, she affirmed she would wait to hear what\n\na witness had to say and would not automatically assume credibility based on one’s\n\nposition as a police officer. (RR39:29-30). Defense counsel posed the question to\n\nAdams again later. (RR39:95). Adams reiterated that she would not give the\n\nofficer more credibility. (RR39:95). She “would expect them to be telling the\n\n\n                                        111 \n \n\ftruth on things, but [. . .] I don’t think anybody else stepping up here would be any\n\nless credible than the officer just because he had a uniform.” (RR39:95-96). The\n\ntotality of Adams’ testimony indicates she would wait to hear a witness’s\n\ntestimony before passing judgment on credibility. Given her assurances to follow\n\nthe law, the trial court reasonably concluded that Adams held no bias. See Lane,\n\n822 S.W.2d at 45.\n\n        Finally, Appellant’s complaint that Adams was “mitigation challenged”\n\nlacks merit. Adams affirmed that if she heard evidence that was sufficiently\n\nmitigating, she would answer “yes” to Special Issue No. 2. (RR39:44, 46-47). She\n\ncould not envision a situation in which she would answer that issue “yes,” but she\n\ncould imagine the possibility. (RR39:46-47).       She affirmed she would keep an\n\nopen mind as to Special Issue No. 2. (RR39:53). In short, the record reflects no\n\nbias against Appellant on the mitigation issue, and Appellant fails to articulate one.\n\n        At trial, Appellant did not specify how Adams was “mitigation challenged”\n\nexcept by “her answers in her questionnaire.” (RR39:99). Appellant failed to\n\nidentify, however, which answers on Adams’ 19-page questionnaire indicated a\n\nbias.\n\n        In his brief, Appellant argues Adams’ emotional state during voir dire shows\n\na lack of objectivity to consider some of the evidence presented at trial.       This\n\n\n\n\n                                         112 \n \n\fcomplaint was not asserted at trial and was not properly preserved. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a).\n\n      Issue 27 should be overruled.\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has not shown even one erroneous ruling on his challenges for\n\ncause, much less three erroneous rulings. See Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 837.\n\nTherefore, he has not shown this Court that he was denied the use of a statutorily\n\nprovided peremptory strike. Issues 20 through 27 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 28 THROUGH 30:       THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR\nIN GRANTING THE STATE’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n      In Issues 28, 29, and 30, Appellant contends the trial court erred in granting\n\nthree of the State’s challenges for cause over his objection against venire members\n\nAlan Avidon, John Cavner, and Douglas Green. (Appellant’s Br. pp.87-91). He\n\ncontends the trial court abused its discretion in excusing these jurors. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                             Issue #28: Alan Avidon\n\n      Prior to voir dire, the State notified the trial court that Avidon had not\n\nanswered a question on his questionnaire truthfully. (RR13:4). Avidon checked\n\n“no” in response to a question asking “Have you . . . ever been accused, arrested or\n\nconvicted (including probation, deferred adjudication, conditional discharge, fine,\n\netc.) of a crime above the level of a traffic ticket.” (Avidon, Juror 247A, Q. p. 8)\n                                         113 \n \n\f(emphasis in original). The State ran Avidon’s criminal history and discovered\n\nAvidon had “received deferred [adjudication] in Dallas County for a DWI back in\n\n1980, as well as an arrest in New York for possession of a dangerous drug.”\n\n(RR13:4-5). Given Avidon’s lack of candor, the State challenged Avidon for\n\ncause. (RR13:5). Appellant objected. (RR13:5). The trial court brought Avidon\n\ninto the courtroom to inquire about his criminal history. (RR13:7).           Avidon\n\nadmitted to the two arrests. (RR13:9). He testified he “didn’t indicate it on the\n\nquestionnaire thinking that it was, you know, so long that the statute of limitation\n\npassed.” (RR13:9). The court excused the juror and granted the State’s challenge.\n\n(RR13:10).\n\n      A challenge for cause may properly be asserted on grounds not specifically\n\nenumerated in article 35.16 if the challenge is based on facts that show the\n\nprospective juror would be “incapable or unfit to serve on the jury.” See Mason v.\n\nState, 905 S.W.2d 570, 577 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).             These challenges are\n\naddressed to the trial court’s discretion.      See id.    Avidon withheld critical\n\ninformation when he failed to truthfully answer the question regarding his criminal\n\nhistory. Importantly, Avidon did not simply forget the arrests. (RR13:9). Instead,\n\nhe claimed he thought the statute of limitations had passed. (RR13:9).        Avidon\n\nplaced his veracity – and, therefore, his fitness to serve – in question.   The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by granting the State’s challenge for cause against\n\n\n                                         114 \n \n\fAvidon.    To conclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated in\n\nconnection with the State’s response to Issues 8-19. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Regardless, even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in granting the\n\nState’s challenge for cause against Avidon (which the State does not concede), any\n\nalleged error is harmless.    The erroneous excusing of a venire member will call\n\nfor a reversal only if the record shows that the error deprived the defendant of a\n\nlawfully constituted jury. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394. Appellant has made no such\n\nshowing.\n\n      Issue 28 should be overruled.\n\n                              Issue #29: John Cavner\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor explained the phases of a death penalty trial\n\nand asked Cavner whether he would be more inclined to answer the special issues\n\nin such a way that a life sentence would result. (RR17:122). Cavner responded, “I\n\nthink there is - - that I would be constantly trying to prove to myself that is not the\n\nright answer. In other words, that would be my - - my - - my leaning, my bias\n\nprobably.” (RR17:122). When asked whether he could guarantee he would set\n\naside his personal feelings and beliefs and decide the case based on the facts and\n\nevidence, Cavner testified that he could not make that guarantee. (RR17:124-25).\n\n      On the other hand, when questioned by the defense, Cavner testified he “can\n\nkeep an open mind.” (RR17:127). He testified he could listen to the evidence but\n\n\n                                         115 \n \n\f“I - - as I’ve said before, I know I’m going to have a, going in, bias[.]”\n\n(RR17:130). At one point, he finally said that if he “could find nothing mitigating,\n\nthen [he could assess the death sentence].” (RR17:130). Apparently recognizing\n\nCavner’s inconsistent answers, the trial court attempted to clarify Cavner’s\n\nresponses. The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Trial Court]: All I want you to do is tell me, and I know you will,\n      how - - exactly how you feel and believe. Would - - will you always\n      find mitigating evidence regardless of the evidence?\n\n      [Cavner]: Well, I answered his question the way I did because I think\n      it will be very difficult for there not to be mitigating evidence.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Well, that’s all right, too. Can there ever be - - with\n      your opinion about the death penalty and your opposition to it, again,\n      if you want to look at Special Issue Number 2, can you - - will you\n      ever be - - regardless of the evidence, will you ever be able to answer\n      that issue yes, knowing death - - I’m sorry, no, knowing that the death\n      penalty will result? Whatever you say that’s it.\n\n      [Cavner]: I don’t believe I could do it.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Well - -\n\n      [Cavner]: I can’t do it.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Any doubt in your mind?\n\n      [Cavner]: No doubt.\n\n(RR17:132-33). The State challenged Cavner for cause because “he would never\n\never be able to answer Special Issue Number 2 in such a way that would result in\n\n\n\n\n                                        116 \n \n\fthe death sentence.” (RR17:134).       The trial court granted the State’s challenge\n\nover Appellant’s claim that Cavner was qualified. (RR17:134).\n\n      The totality of Cavner’s voir dire testimony clearly shows his beliefs about\n\ncapital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his\n\nduties as a juror in accordance with the court’s instructions and his oath.\n\nSee Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517.       At a minimum, he was a vacillating juror and\n\nthe Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the challenge for cause.\n\nGranados, 85 S.W.3d at 231.        To conclude otherwise would controvert this\n\nCourt’s policy as stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Issue 29 should be overruled.\n\n                            Issue #30: Douglas Green\n\n      Douglas Green gave multiple contradictory answers during voir dire. The\n\nState challenged him for cause and that challenge was granted. (RR21:122-23).\n\n      In his questionnaire, in response to convictions based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, Green wrote that he agreed, “If DNA or forensic evidence to 100%\n\nconclusion.” (Green, Juror 597A, Q. p.3). When questioned by the prosecutor,\n\nGreen affirmed that “[u]nder the circumstances with a death penalty, yes[,]” he\n\nwould require the State to prove its case beyond all doubt.        (RR21:98).    He\n\nunderstood that this would be holding the State to a higher burden of proof than\n\nrequired. (RR21:97-98).      When questioned by the defense, Green testified he\n\n\n                                         117 \n \n\fwould “follow the law” and affirmed he would not hold the State to a higher\n\nburden of proof. (RR21:115). Jurors may be challenged and removed for bias\n\nagainst the law, which includes the burden of proof. See Bodde v. State, 568\n\nS.W.2d 344, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978) (finding juror properly excluded where\n\njuror insisted she would hold the state to a more stringent standard of proof than\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt\").\n\n      Next, the prosecutor explained that at trial, the State is required to prove\n\ncertain elements for a conviction of capital murder.   (RR21:75-77). She gave a\n\nhypothetical in which the State alleged a murder committed during the course of a\n\nsexual assault. (RR21:75, 77). In the hypothetical, the State proved the murder,\n\nbut instead of sexual assault, proved a robbery. (RR21:74-76). Green testified that\n\nhe “might” still convict of capital murder even though the State did not prove the\n\noffense as alleged. (RR21:78). The defense attempted to rehabilitate Green on this\n\nissue, but Green testified that “if [he] knew someone had committed murder, [he]\n\nwould have a hard time[.]” (RR21:107-08). Then, he testified he would follow the\n\nlaw. (RR21:108).\n\n      Finally, in his questionnaire, in response to a question asking what would be\n\nimportant to him in deciding whether a person should receive a life or death\n\nsentence, Green wrote, “Does the person have an evil heart.” (Green, Juror 597A,\n\nQ. p.3). When questioned by the prosecutor, he testified he would “rather hear the\n\n\n                                       118 \n \n\fperson tell me why than someone else speak for them.” (RR21:95). He testified,\n\n“I can’t imagine if I was in that - - in the other position that I wouldn’t want to tell\n\nmy story.” (RR21:95). When defense counsel asked whether Green could follow\n\nan instruction on the Fifth Amendment right to silence, Green testified, “I could. I\n\nwould feel it’s strange, but I - - I could.” (RR21:119).\n\n      Green gave contradictory answers regarding several critical issues: (1) his\n\nability to apply the proper standard of proof; (2) his ability to require that the State\n\nprove each and every element; and, (3) a defendant’s right to remain silent. The\n\nState challenged him on all three of these bases, and the trial court acted well\n\nwithin its discretion in granting the challenge. (RR21:122-23). Green was a\n\nclassic vacillating juror. The Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on\n\nthe challenge for cause. Granados v. State, 85 S.W.3d 217, 231 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2002).\n\n      Issue 30 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 31 AND 32:        APPELLANT WAS NOT DEPRIVED OF A\nLAWFULLY CONSTITUTED JURY.\n\n      In Issues 31 and 32, Appellant contends the trial court’s rulings “in relation\n\nto overruling Appellant’s objections to the trial court’s actions in reference to each\n\njuror complained about previously” deprived him of a lawfully constituted jury\n\nresulting in violations of his rights under the state and federal constitutions, and\n\nunder article 35.16 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.       (See Appellant’s Br. pp.\n                                          119 \n \n\f92-93).     He fails to specify, however, whether he is referring to the trial court’s\n\ndenial of his challenges for cause or the granting of the State’s challenges for\n\ncause.\n\n         In any event, Appellant has failed to show he was deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury. He has failed to show the trial court’s rulings on any of the\n\nchallenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was biased or prejudiced. If an\n\nappellant does not present record evidence demonstrating that the trial court’s error\n\ndeprived him of a jury comprised of legally qualified jurors, he has suffered no\n\nharm and the reviewing court should presume the jurors are qualified. See Gray v.\n\nState, 233 S.W.3d 295, 301 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\n         Issues 31 and 32 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 33: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\nSUPPORT APPELLANT’S CONVICTION FOR CAPITAL MURDER.\n\n         In Issue 33, Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support\n\nhis conviction for capital murder. Specifically, Appellant contends that he lacked\n\nthe specific intent to kill Nancy and that the State failed to show a nexus between\n\nthe murder and the theft. (Appellant’s Br. p. 94). Appellant’s contentions lack\n\nmerit and should be overruled.\n\n                                 Standard of Review\n\n         When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate\n\ncourt considers all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n                                          120 \n \n\fdetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\n\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

This\n\nstandard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts\n\nin the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from\n\nbasic facts to ultimate facts.

A person commits theft if he\n\nunlawfully appropriates property with intent to deprive the owner of the property.\n\nId. § 31.03(a).\n\n      The State must prove a nexus between the murder and the theft, i.e., that the\n\nmurder was committed in order to facilitate the taking of the property. See Cooper\n\nv. State, 67 S.W.3d 221, 222-23 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002); Hooper v. State, 214\n\n\n                                          121 \n \n\fS.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthe appellate court should look at events occurring before, during and after the\n\ncommission of the offense and may rely on actions of the defendant which show an\n\nunderstanding and common design to do the prohibited act).\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n       The following evidence proves that Appellant intended to kill Nancy Harris\n\nand that the murder occurred to facilitate the taking of property:\n\n     Appellant walked into the Whip-In carrying a lighter and a plastic bottle\n      filled with a flammable liquid.\n\n     He walked straight to the sales counter, then around and behind into the area\n      reserved for employees.\n\n     When Nancy attempted to push him back, Appellant poured the contents of\n      the plastic bottle, the flammable liquid, over Nancy’s upper body.\n\n     Appellant stood directly behind Nancy as she tried to open the register. He\n      took two lighters from a display to the right of the register. He took two\n      packages of cigarettes from an overhead dispenser. He took the ring Nancy\n      was wearing on her right hand. When Nancy opened the register, Appellant\n      took all of the cash and some of the coins.\n\n     After Appellant took the money from the register he flicked his lighter and\n      the flame ignited the liquid on Nancy.\n\n     While Nancy, engulfed in flames from her shoulders up, ran out from behind\n      the counter, Appellant calmly walked out of the store with his plastic bottle\n      and the stolen property. On his way out, he stopped to take some candy and\n      stuff it in his pocket.\n\n     Appellant made no effort to help Nancy extinguish the flames.\n\n\n                                         122 \n \n\f     Appellant fled the store and hid from police in the neighborhood behind the\n      Whip In.\n\n     Nancy told police that “a black male, heavy-set, short dark hair, and a\n      chubby face, came into the store and demanded money from her. She\n      advised he took the money and then he poured something on her. She didn’t\n      know what - - what it was, and then he lit her on fire.” (RR45:82).\n\n     Nancy was rushed to the hospital. She suffered second-, third-, and fourth-\n      degree burns over forty percent of her body.\n\n     Five days after Appellant set her on fire, life support was discontinued.\n      Nancy died as a result of her burns.\n\n     Appellant was arrested shortly after the offense in the neighborhood behind\n      the Whip-In. When he was handcuffed, he asked the officers what had taken\n      them so long. He commented that they were “getting slow.” (RR44:186).\n\n     Three lighters, Nancy’s ring, coins, and cash were recovered from\n      Appellant’s pocket after his arrest.\n\n     A plastic bottle was found in the grass behind the Whip-In. DNA on the\n      plastic water bottle was identified as Appellant’s.\n\n     Testing of the contents of the plastic water bottle and Nancy’s clothing\n      showed a medium petroleum distillate of the primary recovery and a lower\n      level of isopropyl alcohol. A medium petroleum distillate is an ignitable\n      fluid, which is found in charcoal starter fluid, paint thinner, and mineral\n      spirits.\n\n       Despite the aforementioned evidence, Appellant nevertheless contends that\n\nno evidence proves he went to the Whip-In “to murder the Complainant in order to\n\nrob her[,]” and that, as such, no evidence shows his specific intent to kill.   In\n\nsupport of his contention, he cites his own testimony from the punishment phase\n\nthat he had no intent to murder Nancy. (Appellant’s Br. p. 96).    In a bifurcated\n\n                                       123 \n \n\ftrial before a jury on a plea of not guilty, however, “consideration of the evidence\n\nis necessarily limited to the evidence before the jury at the time it rendered its\n\nverdict of guilt.” Barfield v. State, 63 S.W.3d 446, 450 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001).\n\nAbsent a judicial confession, evidence from the punishment phase of a trial will\n\nnot be considered in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction. Munoz v. State, 853 S.W.2d 558, 560 n.3 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\n\nAccordingly, because Appellant’s punishment-phase testimony was not before the\n\njury when it found Appellant guilty of capital murder, it should not be considered\n\nin determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.\n\n      Regardless,    the   evidence    overwhelmingly     contradicts    Appellant’s\n\npunishment testimony and argument that he lacked the specific intent to kill.\n\n“Intent can be inferred from the acts, words, and conduct of the accused.” Patrick\n\nv. State, 906 S.W.2d 481, 487 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (citing Beltran v. State, 593\n\nS.W.2d 688, 689 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980)). Appellant walked in to the Whip-In\n\narmed with his plastic bottle of flammable liquid and his lighter. The first thing\n\nthat he did when he walked behind the counter was pour that liquid over Nancy’s\n\nupper body. Immediately after he robbed her, he flicked his lighter and ignited the\n\nfluid on her body. That Appellant actually poured the lighter fluid over Nancy and\n\nlater ignited it supports a conclusion of specific intent. Notably, he made no effort\n\nto call an ambulance or extinguish the flames. He simply left by walking casually\n\n\n                                        124 \n \n\fout of the store as his elderly victim was left to contend with the flames now\n\nengulfing her entire upper body. Based on this evidence, a rational jury could have\n\nfound Appellant intended to kill Nancy. See Patrick, 906 S.W.2d at 487 (finding\n\nevidence legally sufficient to prove intent to kill in light of the extent of the\n\ncomplainant’s injuries, how the injuries were inflicted, and the relative size and\n\nstrength of the parties).\n\n       Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to prove the murder took place during\n\nthe course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. Appellant argues the\n\ntheft was unrelated to the murder and was an afterthought, and thus is insufficient\n\nto prove capital murder. (Appellant’s Br. at 97). Appellant’s argument is once\n\nagain contradicted by the surveillance video. The video shows that Appellant went\n\ninto the Whip-In that morning with his plastic bottle of flammable liquid and his\n\nlighter.   He was fully prepared to commit robbery.        Once inside the store, he\n\npoured the fluid over Nancy.       Then he took the lighters, the cigarettes, Nancy’s\n\nring, and the money.        After he had what he wanted and had no further need for\n\nNancy, he flicked his lighter and the flame ignited the fluid on her body.      This\n\ngave him the opportunity to flee the scene. In short, the murder and the robbery\n\nare closely intertwined. Appellant poured the lighter fluid over Nancy so that she\n\nwould cooperate and open the register. He waited to set her on fire until after she\n\nopened the register and he had a chance to take all that he wanted. Once he had\n\n\n                                          125 \n \n\fwhat he wanted, he set Nancy on fire and left. The robbery was anything but an\n\nafterthought.\n\n      Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict,\n\na rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of capital murder\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the evidence is legally sufficient to support\n\nthe conviction.\n\n      Issue 33 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 34 AND 35:     THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF THE INSTANT OFFENSE AS WELL AS STILL\nPHOTOGRAPHS FROM THAT VIDEO. ALTERNATIVELY, ANY ERROR IS HARMLESS.\n\n      In his Issue 34, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to 24 still photographs from the surveillance video of the instant offense.\n\nIn Issue 35, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the\n\nsurveillance video over his Rule 403 objection. Appellant’s contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      During a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected that the\n\nsurveillance video of the instant offense was unfairly prejudicial and asked the trial\n\ncourt to conduct “a 403 balancing test.” (RR44:33). The trial court overruled\n\nAppellant’s objection and stated that “the evidence about to be presented by the\n\n\n\n\n                                         126 \n \n\fState is more probative than prejudicial.” (RR44:33). The surveillance video was\n\noffered and admitted and published to the jury.14 (RR44:48-49; SX#16-17).\n\n              Later, the State moved to admit State’s Exhibits 79-102, which are still\n\nphotographs taken from the surveillance video.                        (RR44:229).   The following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n              [Prosecutor]: I’m going to show you State’s Exhibits 79 through 102,\n              and ask you if those are screen shots or still shots from this\n              surveillance video that showed some of the significant things that\n              occurred in the video?\n\n              [Detective Tooke]: Yes, they are.\n\n              ...\n\n              [Prosecutor]: I would offer State’s Exhibit 79 through 102.\n\n              (State’s Exhibits 79 through 102 offered.)\n\n              [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, we’re going to object to 79 through\n              102 due to their cumulative nature and also the previous objections\n              that were set out in Pretrial Motion Number 57.\n\n              [Trial Court]: Any response?\n\n              [Prosecutor]: Judge, I can show the video multiple times and stop and\n              freeze this, but I believe that this is more expedient. The fact is that\n              the content contained in these photographs is already in evidence\n              through the video, and this just allows the State to show this and point\n              out the - - the specific - - the specific aspects of the video without\n              playing it again.\n                                                            \n14\n   Two copies of the surveillance video were admitted. (RR44:49; SX#16, 17). State’s Exhibit\n#16 is the unedited version, which contains footage from all three surveillance cameras.\n(RR44:47; SX#16). State’s Exhibit #17 is the compilation version, which combines the footage\nfrom the cameras for ease of the viewer. (RR44:47-49; SX#17). State’s Exhibit #17 is the\nversion that was shown to the jury. (RR44:49; SX#17).\n                                                               127 \n \n\f      [Trial Court]: All right. Defense’s objection is overruled.\n\n(RR44:229).    The photographs were published to the jury. (RR44:229-234).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n      A trial court’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. See Weatherred v. State, 15 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2000). The trial court’s ruling should be upheld if it is within the zone\n\nof reasonable disagreement. Id. And, it will be upheld if it is correct on any theory\n\nof law applicable to the case. Romero v. State, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1990).\n\n                       Photograph and Videotape Evidence\n\n      The admissibility of a photograph falls within the sound discretion of the\n\ntrial judge. Paredes v. State, 129 S.W.3d 530, 539 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\nGenerally, if testimony about the matters that are depicted in the photograph is\n\nadmissible, then the photograph will also be admissible. Id. at 539.     Videotapes\n\nare considered in the same manner. See Tex. R. Evid. 1001(b).\n\n                                     Rule 403\n\n      The admissibility of photographic evidence alleged to be unduly prejudicial\n\nis governed by Texas Rule of Evidence 403. Tex. R. Evid. 403; Emery v. State,\n\n881 S.W.2d 702, 710 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Under Rule 403, all relevant\n                                        128 \n \n\fevidence is admissible unless “its probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nthe danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\n\nconsiderations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”\n\nTex. R. Evid. 403.      In performing a Rule 403 analysis, “the trial court must\n\nconsider the host of factors affecting probativeness . . . and balance those factors\n\nagainst the tendency, if any, that the photographs have to encourage resolution of\n\nmaterial issues on an inappropriate emotional basis.” Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547,\n\n568 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). Relevant factors a court may consider in making this\n\ndetermination include the number of exhibits offered, their gruesomeness, their\n\ndetail, their size, whether they are black-and-white or color, whether they are\n\nclose-up, whether the body is naked or clothed, the availability of other means of\n\nproof, and other circumstances unique to the individual case. Chamberlain v.\n\nState, 998 S.W.2d 230, 237 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n\n      All probative evidence proffered by an adverse party will be prejudicial, but\n\nonly unfair prejudice warrants exclusion of the evidence. See Montgomery v.\n\nState, 810 S.W.2d 372, 378 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (citing United States v.\n\nFigueroa, 618 F.2d 934, 943 (2nd Cir. 1980).\n\n\n\n\n                                         129 \n \n\f                                     Analysis\n\n                        Issue #35: The Surveillance Video\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting the surveillance video depicting the\n\ninstant offense. The footage from the surveillance video is in black-and-white and\n\nis 4 minutes and 44 seconds long. (SX#17). Given the relative positions of the\n\ncameras, at times, some angles offer a closer view of Nancy and Appellant behind\n\nthe sales counter as she opens the register and as he takes lighters, cigarettes,\n\nmoney, and her ring. (SX#17).      The later portion of the video is graphic as it\n\nshows an elderly woman on fire and the removal of her shirt in an attempt to put\n\nout the flames engulfing her upper body. (SX#17). The video is without a doubt,\n\nboth graphic and disturbing.     Yet, the video simply shows the offense as it\n\noccurred.     It depicts nothing more than the reality of the brutal crime that\n\nAppellant committed.\n\n      Furthermore, the video aided the jury in understanding how the crime\n\noccurred. In Gordon v. State, this Court described the utility of video recordings\n\nas follows:\n\n      Video recordings in general may be more helpful to a jury than still\n      photographs. While still photographs offer to the jury an isolated and\n      fixed content, a video recording allows a more panoramic\n      representation of the physical and forensic evidence.\n\nGordon v. State, 784 S.W.2d 410, 412 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).           Beyond the\n\ndepiction of the offense itself, the video helped the jury understand the testimony\n                                       130 \n \n\fregarding the crime scene, including the layout of the sales counter at the Whip-In\n\nand Appellant and Nancy’s position during the offense.\n\n      Appellant correctly states “There was no question for the jury as to how the\n\nvictim died.” (Appellant’s Br. p. 104).     It was undisputed that Nancy died as a\n\nresult of thermal injuries.   What was disputed, however, was Appellant’s intent.\n\nAt no time did Appellant concede his guilt for the offense of capital murder.\n\nIndeed, during voir dire, defense counsel told many of the potential jurors that in\n\ncounsel’s opinion, the jury would never reach the punishment phase because they\n\nwould not find Appellant guilty. (RR5-RR42). The State was obligated to prove\n\neach and every element of the offense, including Nancy’s identity and all of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding her robbery and murder.        The video of the offense is\n\nrelevant because it shows the offense as it happened. It establishes not only that\n\nAppellant committed the instant offense, but also the way in which he committed\n\nit. And, the way in which Appellant committed the offense – walked into the\n\nWhip-In with a flammable liquid, went straight to the sales counter, poured the\n\nliquid over the elderly female clerk’s head and upper body, robbed her, set her on\n\nfire, then walked casually out of the store leaving his victim engulfed in flames – is\n\nhighly probative of his intent. In sum, the video of the offense is highly probative\n\nof Appellant’s specific intent to kill Nancy Harris, and is in no way unfairly\n\n\n\n\n                                         131 \n \n\fprejudicial to Appellant. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting it.\n\n                            Issue #34: Still Photographs\n\n       The trial court did not err in admitting the still photographs as they are not\n\ncumulative of the video. This Court has held that “a still photograph is not\n\ncumulative of a videotape.” Matamoros v. State, 901 S.W.2d 470, 476 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1995). A still photograph allows the jury to examine the scene in detail.\n\nId.   Like the video, the twenty-four still photographs are in black-and-white.\n\n(SX#79-102). These photographs were used by Detective Tooke as he described\n\nthe details of the offense. (RR44:229-34).        While it is true that the jury had\n\nalready seen the surveillance video, a single viewing of a 5 minute video is hardly\n\nsufficient time for the jury to take in all of the details. Rather than play the video\n\nmultiple times during Detective Tooke’s testimony, the prosecutor used the\n\nphotographs to describe the critical details from the offense.\n\n       For example, State’s Exhibits #79-82 shows Appellant as he enters the\n\nWhip-In. (SX#79-82). State’s Exhibit #83 shows Appellant carrying the plastic\n\nbottle in his right hand. (SX#83).      State’s Exhibit #84 shows Appellant as he\n\nstarts to walk behind the sales counter. (SX#84). State’s Exhibit #85 shows\n\nAppellant behind the sales counter with Nancy. (SX#85). He has a lighter in his\n\nhand and is taking lighters from a display. (RR44:230; SX#85). State’s Exhibit\n\n\n                                         132 \n \n\f#86 is another view of Appellant and Nancy behind the counter. (SX#86). State’s\n\nExhibits #87 and 88 show Appellant taking cigarettes. (RR44:231; SX#87, 88).\n\nState’s Exhibit #89 shows Appellant’s hand on Nancy’s hand.              (RR44:231;\n\nSX#89).     State’s Exhibits #90 and 91 show Appellant licking his fingers.\n\n(RR44:232; SX#90, 91). State’s Exhibits #92 again shows Appellant’s hand on\n\nNancy’s hand. (RR44:232; SX#92). State’s Exhibit #93 shows Appellant’s hand\n\non the counter. (RR44:232; SX#93). State’s Exhibits #94 and 95 show the register\n\ndrawer open. (RR44:232; SX#94, 95).          State’s Exhibit #96 shows Appellant’s\n\nhand going from the register drawer. (RR44:232-33; SX#96). State’s Exhibit #97\n\nshows the fire as it is reflected on the register monitor. (SX#97). State’s Exhibits\n\n#98-102 show Nancy on fire and Appellant as he walks out of the store. (SX#98-\n\n102).\n\n        Each photograph provided an additional detail critical to the jury’s\n\nunderstanding of the offense and the crime scene.         Notably, the prosecutor’s\n\nquestioning of Detective Tooke regarding the photographs was very brief,\n\ncomprising only six pages of an otherwise lengthy record. (RR44:229-34).\n\n        Appellant argues that State’s Exhibits #98, 99, and 100 “are exceptionally\n\nprejudicial in that they depict Ms. Harris on fire. . . . The jury did not need to see\n\nstill photographs of a burning woman to discern what had taken place.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. p. 99). The State acknowledges that State’s Exhibits #98, 99, and\n\n\n                                         133 \n \n\f100 are graphic in that these photographs show Nancy on fire. (SX#98, 99, 100).\n\nNevertheless, these photographs are not overly gruesome, and they provided the\n\njury with the means to focus on some highly relevant details of the offense.\n\n       State’s Exhibit #98 shows Nancy from the chest down, as she runs out from\n\nbehind the counter and Appellant walks out behind her. (SX#98). State’s Exhibit\n\n#99 shows Nancy on fire, and provides another view of Appellant casually leaving\n\nthe store. (SX#99). State’s Exhibit #100 shows Nancy on fire as she walks toward\n\nthe sink. (SX#100). Importantly, the left side of the photograph shows Appellant\n\nwalking out of the store carrying the plastic bottle. (SX#100). The complained-of\n\nexhibits helped the jury to understand not only what Appellant did to Nancy but\n\nalso how, afterward, he fled the scene, taking his bottle of flammable liquid with\n\nhim.\n\n       The probative value of all 24 photographs was not substantially outweighed\n\nby their prejudicial effect. See Tex. R. Evid. 403. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting them.    See Matamoros, 901 S.W.2d at 476 (finding no\n\nabuse of discretion in admitting crime scene photographs over Matamoros’\n\nobjection that they were cumulative of a crime scene video previously admitted as\n\nthe photographs provided different vantage points, which might enhance the jury’s\n\nunderstanding of the crime scene and they permitted the jurors to examine the\n\n\n\n\n                                        134 \n \n\fscene in detail). At a minimum, its decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n                           Any Alleged Error is Harmless\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting the video and the still photographs,\n\nAppellant was not harmed.       The erroneous admission of photographs is non-\n\nconstitutional error governed by Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.2(b). See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 44.2(b). Nonconstitutional error that does not affect the substantial rights\n\nof the defendant is disregarded by the appellate court. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\nA substantial right is affected when the error has a “substantial and injurious effect\n\nor influence in determining the jury’s verdict.” See King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266,\n\n271 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). In making this determination, this Court may consider\n\nthe entire record, including the nature of the evidence supporting the verdict, and\n\nthe character of the error and its relationship to other evidence. See Morales v.\n\nState, 32 S.W.3d 862, 867 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n      Here, overwhelming evidence supported the jury’s verdict. When officers\n\narrived at the Whip-In, Nancy told them that a man had robbed her and poured\n\nsomething on her. (RR44:69). She described her attacker as a “heavy-set black\n\nmale with blue jeans . . . and a T-shirt.” (RR44:70).       At the hospital, she told\n\nWilson that “a black male, heavy-set, short dark hair, and a chubby face, came into\n\nthe store and demanded money from her. She advised he took the money and then\n\n\n                                         135 \n \n\fhe poured something on her. She didn’t know what - - what it was, and then he lit\n\nher on fire.” (RR45:82).\n\n      When Perez searched the neighborhood behind the Whip-In, he saw a man\n\nmatching Nancy’s description. (RR44:178, 181-82).            After a foot chase, Perez\n\narrested the man, Appellant. (RR44:181-86). Appellant asked police, “What took\n\nyou so long[?] Y’all are getting slow.” (RR44:186). From Appellant’s pockets,\n\npolice collected a used lighter, a red lighter, a purple lighter, a gold ring, a car key,\n\ncoins, and cash. (RR44:75-78; SX#6, 26, 28-30, 59, 60).\n\n      Investigators collected pooled liquid underneath the floor mat behind the\n\nsales counter as well as a plastic drinking bottle found in the grass behind the store.\n\n(RR44:111-12; RR45:50-51, 60-62; SX#35, 36, 114, 115, 117, 118, 129). Testing\n\nof contents of the plastic bottle and Nancy’s clothing showed “a medium\n\npetroleum distillate of the primary recovery, and . . . a lower level of isopropyl\n\nalcohol.” (RR45:113-14; SX#137). The pooled liquid from under the floor mat\n\nalso contained medium petroleum distillate as did Appellant’s t-shirt, pants, belt,\n\nleft shoe and sock, and his right shoe. (RR45:116-17; SX#138). A medium\n\npetroleum distillate is an ignitable liquid often encountered as charcoal starter\n\nfluid, paint thinner or mineral spirits. (RR45:114).\n\n      Appellant’s DNA was found on the exterior of the plastic bottle and he was\n\nincluded as a possible contributor of a DNA profile from the interior and exterior\n\n\n                                          136 \n \n\fopening of the bottle. (RR45:154-55; SX#142).         Appellant was included as a\n\npossible contributor of a low level sample of DNA from the cash drawer.\n\n(RR45:156; SX#142).      And, a partial DNA profile from the cigarette package\n\nmatched Appellant.     (RR45:156; SX#142).        Finally, the jury heard medical\n\ntestimony regarding the severity and extent of Nancy’s injuries.\n\n      Accordingly, taking the entire record into consideration, Appellant was not\n\nharmed by the admission of the surveillance video or the still photographs taken\n\nfrom the video. Issues 34 and 35 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 36 AND 37: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED THE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VICTIM IN\nTHE HOSPITAL. ALTERNATIVELY, ANY ERROR IS HARMLESS.\n\n      In Issue 36, Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting, over his\n\nRule 403 objection, nine photographs taken during Nancy’s autopsy. In Issue 37,\n\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in admitting, over his Rule 403 objection,\n\nseven photographs of Nancy taken at the hospital prior to her death. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      During trial, in a hearing outside the presence of the jury, the State offered\n\ninto evidence nine autopsy photographs: State’s Exhibit Nos. 9, 151, 152, 153,\n\n\n\n                                        137 \n \n\f154, 155, 156, 157, and 158.15 (RR45:182). An additional 34 photographs taken\n\nduring the autopsy were not offered. (RR45:183). The State also offered seven\n\nphotographs taken of Nancy at the hospital prior to her death: State’s Exhibit Nos.\n\n144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150. (RR45:182).                                    An additional 22 photographs\n\ntaken at the hospital were not offered. (RR45:183-84).\n\n              Appellant objected to all sixteen photographs on the basis of his previously\n\nfiled Pretrial Motion #57 as well as Rule 403. (RR45:183).                                     The trial court\n\naffirmed it had reviewed all of the photographs, including those not offered into\n\nevidence, and overruled Appellant’s objection.                                   (RR45:184-85).      The nine\n\nautopsy photographs were admitted through Dr. Dyer, the medical examiner.\n\n(RR46:30). The seven hospital photographs were admitted through Dr. Hunt, the\n\nphysician who treated Nancy at the Burn Unit at Parkland Hospital. (RR46:16).\n\n                                                                    Analysis\n\n                                                         Issue #36: Autopsy Photographs\n\n              The trial court did not err in admitting nine photographs taken during\n\nNancy’s autopsy. All 9 photographs of Nancy’s deceased body were displayed to\n\nthe jury in color. (RR45:182; SX#9, 151-58).                                    Although Nancy is not clothed,\n\nmost of the photographs are close-ups of specific parts of her body. And, the\n\n\n                                                            \n15\n  Prior to trial, the State offered into evidence State’s Pretrial Exhibit #2, which contains copies\nof all photographs taken during Nancy’s autopsy and all photographs taken of Nancy at the\nhospital prior to her death. (RR41:25; State’s Pretrial Exhibit #2).\n                                                                      138 \n \n\fphotographs are not repetitious; each depicts a different area of injury.       For\n\nexample, State’s Exhibit #9, the autopsy identification photograph, is a close up of\n\nNancy’s face. (RR46:37; SX#9). State’s Exhibit #152 shows the back of Nancy’s\n\nhead and top of her shoulders. (RR46:35; SX#152). State’s Exhibit #153 shows\n\nNancy’s back. (RR46:36; SX#153). State’s Exhibit #154 shows the back of\n\nNancy’s left leg. (RR46:36; SX#154). State’s Exhibit #155 shows the top of\n\nNancy’s left hand. (RR46:36; SX#155). State’s Exhibit #156 shows the underside\n\nof Nancy’s left hand. (RR46:36-37; SX#156). State’s Exhibit #157 shows the top\n\nof Nancy’s right hand. (RR46:37; SX#157). State’s Exhibit #158 shows Nancy’s\n\nleft foot. (RR46:37; SX#158).\n\n      State’s Exhibit #151 is not a close-up photograph.         It shows Nancy’s\n\nunclothed body from the waist down. (RR46:33; SX#151). Her private area is\n\ncovered on the photograph by what appears to be a white box.             (RR46:33;\n\nSX#151). A photograph, which is used to describe the complainant’s injuries, is\n\nnot inadmissible simply because it depicts an unclothed body. See Santellan v.\n\nState, 939 S.W.2d 155, 172-73 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (finding no error in\n\nadmitting photographs of victim’s naked body during autopsy where the\n\nphotographs show damage done to victim’s body by Sanetellan and no damage\n\nattributable to the autopsy is apparent).\n\n\n\n\n                                            139 \n \n\f      The 9 complained-of photographs are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule\n\n403. All 9 autopsy photographs were probative of Nancy’s injuries; they show the\n\nexternal injuries – burns, swelling, skin slippage and necrosis – that Nancy\n\nsuffered as a result of the instant offense. (RR46:33-38; SX#9, 151-158). The\n\nphotographs were used by the medical examiner, Dr. Dyer, to explain those\n\ninjuries. (RR46:33-38). This Court has held that a trial court does not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting autopsy photographs over a Rule 403 objection where they\n\nhelp to explain the medical examiner’s testimony describing the victim’s various\n\nwounds for which appellant is responsible. See Escamilla, 143 S.W.3d at 826.\n\nGiven the nature of Nancy’s injuries – thermal injury – the photographs were\n\nespecially important to help the jury understand how and why she died.        The\n\nphotographs are also probative of Appellant’s intent. The location and severity of\n\nNancy’s injuries show Appellant intended to kill her.     See Rojas v. State, 986\n\nS.W.2d 241, 249-50 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (finding no abuse of discretion in\n\nadmitting autopsy photo because, among other reasons, it was probative of Rojas\n\nmental state at the time of the murder). Notably, Dr. Dyer’s testimony regarding\n\nthe photographs consisted of only five pages in an otherwise lengthy record.\n\n(RR46:33-38).\n\n      Appellant argues that the photographs are “extremely gruesome[.]”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. p.107). The photographs are gruesome, but they depict nothing\n\n\n                                       140 \n \n\fmore than the injuries that Appellant inflicted on Nancy. See Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at\n\n568 (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting 10\n\nphotographs of the victim’s body, including autopsy photos, because the\n\nphotographs depicted the manner of death and were no more gruesome than the\n\ncrime).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the nine autopsy\n\nphotographs. At a minimum, its decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n                         Issue #37: Hospital Photographs\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting 7 photographs of Nancy taken in the\n\nhospital prior to her death. Like the autopsy photographs, Nancy is not clothed but\n\nmost of the photographs are close-ups of specific body parts. The photographs are\n\nnot repetitious; each depicts a different area of injury. State’s Exhibit #144 shows\n\nNancy’s badly burned left leg next to her unburned right leg.         (RR46:16-17;\n\nSX#144). Her private area is covered by a towel. (SX#144). State’s Exhibit #145\n\nis a close-up of Nancy’s left leg. (SX#145). State’s Exhibit #146 shows Nancy’s\n\nseverely burned upper body. (SX#146). She is attached to a ventilator. (RR46:18;\n\nSX#146). She is unclothed, but because she is so severely burned, her breasts are\n\nnot easily discerned. (SX#146). State’s Exhibit #147 shows the underside of\n\nNancy’s left arm. (RR46:18-19; SX#147). State’s Exhibit #148 shows the top of\n\n\n                                        141 \n \n\fNancy’s right arm and a small part of her unclothed right side.         (RR46:19;\n\nSX#148). State’s Exhibit #149 is a close-up of the top of Nancy’s severely burned\n\nhead and face. (RR46:19-20; SX#149). State’s Exhibit #150 shows Nancy’s\n\nunclothed lower back. (RR46:20; SX#150).\n\n        The seven complained-of photographs are not unfairly prejudicial under\n\nRule 403. These photographs, like the autopsy photographs, were probative of the\n\ninjuries Nancy suffered as a result of the instant offense. (RR46:16-20; SX#144-\n\n150). They were used by Dr. Hunt to explain those injuries. (RR46:16-20). Dr.\n\nHunt testified Nancy was burned over 40% of her body. (RR46:10). He used the\n\nphotographs to identify Nancy’s second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns.\n\n(RR46:16-20; SX#144-150).       It would have been impossible for the jury to\n\nunderstand the nature and extent of her injuries without seeing photographs of\n\nthem.\n\n        Moreover, the photographs are probative of Appellant’s intent. Appellant\n\npoured a flammable liquid over the upper body of an elderly woman and lit her on\n\nfire. The location and severity of Nancy’s injuries show Appellant intended to kill\n\nher. See Rojas, 986 S.W.2d at 249-50. At a minimum, the trial court’s decision\n\nto admit the photographs falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement. See\n\nWeatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542; see also Long v. State, 823 S.W.2d 259, 273 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1991) (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\n\n                                       142 \n \n\fadmitting thirteen photographs of the victims’ bodies at the crime scene because\n\nthe photographs were limited in number, reflected the manner of death, and had to\n\nbe viewed together to get an accurate assessment of the injuries sustained by the\n\nvictims).\n\n                           Any Alleged Error is Harmless\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting the 16 complained-of photographs,\n\nAppellant was not harmed.        As previously argued, there was overwhelming\n\nevidence supported the jury’s verdict regardless of the photographs of Nancy.\n\nAccordingly, taking the entire record into consideration, it is clear that any alleged\n\nerror in admitting the complained-of photographs clearly did not affect Appellant’s\n\nsubstantial rights and should be disregarded. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Issues 36 and 37 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 38, 39, AND 40: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED EVIDENCE OF STATEMENTS MADE BY THE COMPLAINANT PRIOR TO HER\nDEATH.\n\n      In Issue 38, Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting during the\n\nguilt/innocence phase of trial, evidence of statements Nancy made to police at the\n\nWhip-In. In Issue 39, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nevidence of statements Nancy made to police when she was at the hospital.          In\n\nIssue 40, Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting during the\n\n\n\n\n                                         143 \n \n\fpunishment phase, evidence of statements Nancy made to police at the Whip In.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Issue #38: Nancy’s Statements at the Whip-In (Guilt/Innocence Phase)\n\n      During the guilt/innocence phase of trial, Officer Coffey testified that when\n\nhe drove into the parking lot of the Whip-In, Nancy was stepping out the front\n\ndoor, “still on fire.” (RR44: 67-68). Officer Coffey grabbed his fire extinguisher\n\nand put out the flames. (RR44:68). Nancy was “screaming for help.” (RR44:69).\n\nThe following exchange then took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Was she able to give Officer Simon a description of the\n      person that had done this to her?\n\n      [Coffey]: Yes. She said a black male came into the store - -\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I’m going to object to hearsay and\n      confrontation.\n\n(RR44:69). The prosecutor noted that the statement was an excited utterance and\n\nthat it was nontestimonial. (RR44:69).         Appellant’s objection was overruled.\n\n(RR44:69).    Officer Coffey testified Nancy “told officer Simon and then he\n\nrepeated it to me, that - - she said there was a black male that came into the store\n\nand he robbed her and poured something on her.” (RR44:69).\n\n\n\n\n                                        144 \n \n\f                    Issue #39: Nancy’s Statements at the Hospital\n\n      Later, Officer Wilson testified about the conversation he had with Nancy at\n\nthe hospital while she was still conscious and able to speak. (RR45:81). She was\n\nabout to be intubated and placed on a ventilator. (RR45:81). Appellant objected\n\nwhen the prosecutor asked what Nancy told him. (RR45:81). The following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Was she able to describe to you what happened to her?\n\n      [Wilson]: Yes, she was.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: What did she tell you?\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I’m going to object to hearsay.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: It’s an exception, dying declaration.\n\n(RR45:81).    Appellant objected “under the confrontation clause.” (RR45:82).\n\nThat objection was overruled. (RR45:82). Wilson testified Nancy told him that “a\n\nblack male, heavy-set, short dark hair, and a chubby face, came into the store and\n\ndemanded money from her. She advised he took the money and then he poured\n\nsomething on her. She didn’t know what - - what it was, and then he lit her on\n\nfire.” (RR45:82).\n\n        Issue #40: Nancy’s Statements at the Whip-In (Punishment Phase)\n\n      After the defense rested and before the State’s case-in-rebuttal during the\n\npunishment phase of trial, the trial court conducted a hearing on the admissibility\n\n\n                                        145 \n \n\fof the in-car video of one of the patrol officers who drove up to the Whip-In on the\n\nmorning of the offense. Appellant objected as follows:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, we would object to that as - - first\n      off, it’s not in rebuttal to anything that we have presented in our case-\n      in-chief, so we would argue it’s improper rebuttal.\n\n              We would further argue that her statements are hearsay and\n      violate the right to confrontation. We would object to the relevance of\n      it at this point. And furthermore, under Rule 403, we would object.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Ms. Moseley.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, this is proper rebuttal. There has been at\n      least a day and a half of testimony from the Defendant and his family\n      about the impact this crime and the potential sentence will have on\n      him and his family. And I believe under the law, we’re entitled to\n      present victim impact testimony so that the jury has something to\n      weigh as it relates to Special Issue 2 and the mitigation. The question\n      is, is it sufficiently mitigating, and the impact on the victim is\n      certainly relevant to that.\n\n            I would also argue as to the hearsay objection that it is a dying\n      declaration, and that by the Defendant setting her on fire and causing\n      her death, he’s waived a confrontation argument.\n\n             And, as to 403, I think the Court should watch the video, but it\n      would be - - certainly before making the ruling, we would ask the\n      Judge to watch the video to make that determination, but there’s\n      nothing more probative as to the impact of this crime on the victim\n      than the jury being able to see it themselves.\n\n(RR51:69).      The trial court watched the video and overruled Appellant’s\n\nobjection. (RR51:70; SX#187).\n\n      State’s Exhibit #187 was offered and admitted over Appellant’s objection\n\nthrough the testimony of Officer Simon. (RR51:81; SX#187). On the video,\n                                        146 \n \n\fNancy can be heard shouting repeatedly, “Help me,” “Oh God, help me,” “Help\n\nme, please.” (SX#187).       Nancy provides her name, date of birth, address, and\n\ntelephone number. (SX#187).       She says that she is “going to faint.” (SX#187).\n\nShe says, “guy tried to rob me.” (SX#187). When she is asked whether the man\n\nthrew something on her, she says that the man threw Chlorox and fire. (SX#187).\n\nNancy described the man as a young Black male, short and heavy set with a round\n\nface. (SX#187).\n\n                                   Applicable Law\n\n                                       Hearsay\n\n      Hearsay is defined as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant\n\nwhile testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted.” Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). The matter asserted is defined as “any\n\nmatter explicitly asserted, and any matter implied by a statement, if the probative\n\nvalue of the statement as offered flows from declarant’s belief as to the matter.”\n\nTex. R. Evid. 801(c).\n\n                                  Excited Utterance\n\n      An excited utterance is defined as “[a] statement relating to a startling event\n\nor condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by\n\nthe event or condition.”      Tex. R. Evid. 803(2).       Excited utterances are not\n\n\n\n\n                                         147 \n \n\fexcluded by the hearsay rule.     Id.   In Zuliani v. State, this court described the\n\nbasis for this exception as follows:\n\n      [It is] a psychological one, namely, the fact that when a man is in the\n      instant grip of violent emotion, excitement or pain, he ordinarily loses\n      the capacity for reflection necessary to the fabrication of a falsehood\n      and the truth will come out. In other words, the statement is\n      trustworthy because it represents an event speaking through the\n      person rather than the person speaking about the event.\n\nZuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 595 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (internal quotations\n\nomitted). “The critical determination is whether the declarant was still dominated\n\nby the emotions, excitement, fear or pain of the event or condition at the time of\n\nthe statement.” Salazar v. State, 38 S.W.3d 141, 154 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001)\n\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\n                                 Dying Declaration\n\n      A dying declaration is a “statement made by a declarant while believing that\n\nthe declarant’s death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what\n\nthe declarant believed to be impending death.”           Tex. R. Evid. 804(b)(2).\n\n“All that the rule requires is sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, that\n\ndemonstrates that the declarant must have realized that he was at death’s door at\n\nthe time that he spoke.” Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 288 n.20.\n\n      It is well settled that the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule does\n\nnot violate a defendant’s right of confrontation under the federal or Texas\n\nConstitution. See id. at 288 n.20.\n                                        148 \n \n\f                                       Analysis\n\n        As a threshold matter, it is the State’s position that Appellant failed to\n\nproperly brief Issues 38, 39, and 40. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h). Appellant cites\n\nthe complained-of testimony and generally asserts that it is hearsay, but he fails to\n\noffer any specific argument or authority in support of his contentions. This Court\n\nis not required to make Appellant’s case for him. Garcia v. State, 887 S.W.2d 862,\n\n882 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (stating that a reviewing court “will not brief\n\nappellant’s case for him”). Appellant’s thirty-eighth, thirty-ninth, and fortieth\n\nissues should be overrruled on this basis.\n\n        Should this Court nevertheless find that Appellant has properly briefed these\n\nissues, the State offers the following response:\n\n        Issue #38: Nancy’s Statements at the Whip-In (Guilt/Innocence Phase)\n\n        The trial court did not err in admitting Officer Coffey’s testimony regarding\n\nNancy’s description of her attacker.     Nancy’s statements were admissible as an\n\nexcited utterance. See Tex. R. Evid. 803(2). When Nancy made the complained-of\n\nstatements, she had just experienced a startling event: she was robbed and set on\n\nfire.   Indeed, the flames on her body were extinguished only seconds before she\n\nmade the complained-of statements.           She was screaming for help.    She was\n\nclearly still under the stress or excitement caused by the offense and her statements\n\nconcerned the startling event.   See Tex. R. Evid. 803(2).\n\n\n                                         149 \n \n\f       Furthermore, the statements’ admission had no impact on Appellant’s\n\nconfrontation rights because they were non-testimonial in nature. Statements are\n\nnon-testimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under\n\ncircumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation\n\nis to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. Davis v. Washington,\n\n547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006); see Vinson v. State, 252 S.W.3d 336, 339-40 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008). When the police arrived at the Whip-In, Nancy was still on fire.\n\nShe made the complained-of statements shortly after the flames were extinguished.\n\nAt the time, police were trying to help Nancy and determine what had happened;\n\nthey had not yet received notification regarding the store’s panic alarm. (RR44:68-\n\n69). It was clearly an ongoing emergency situation.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nstatements.   At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n                  Issue #39: Nancy’s Statements at the Hospital\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting Officer Wilson’s testimony regarding\n\nNancy’s statements to him at the hospital. Nancy’s statements were admissible as\n\na dying declaration. See Tex. R. Evid. 804(b)(2). Nancy made the complained-of\n\nstatements to Officer Wilson minutes after she arrived in the hospital emergency\n\nroom to be treated for severe burns. (RR45:80). Shortly before she arrived at the\n\n\n                                       150 \n \n\fhospital, Nancy, a 76-year-old woman with a pacemaker and diabetes, had been\n\ndoused with a flammable liquid and set on fire.     She was about to be intubated.\n\nGiven the fact that she was in the emergency room and considering the nature and\n\nextent of her injuries as well as her own medical history, the trial court could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Nancy believed she was dying when she made the\n\nstatements regarding the cause or circumstances of her impending death. See\n\nGardner, 306 S.W.3d at 291-92 (finding no abuse of discretion in admitting\n\ncomplainant’s statements to 911 operator that her husband shot her even though\n\ncomplainant did not expressly state that she was dying and no one explicitly told\n\nher that she was dying).   Because the complained-of statements were admissible\n\nas a dying declaration, Appellant’s confrontation right was not violated.        See\n\nGardner, 306 S.W.3d at 288 n.20.\n\n      The complained-of statements were also admissible as an excited utterance.\n\nZuliani, 97 S.W.3d at 595. Nancy was still under the stress of the startling event\n\ndescribed above. The fact that some time had passed between the event and her\n\nstatements is merely a factor to be considered in the analysis. Id. at 596 (noting\n\nthat whether time has elapsed since the startling event is only one factor to be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a statement is an excited utterance). As stated,\n\nNancy made the statements shortly after she arrived in the emergency room and\n\n\n\n\n                                        151 \n \n\fwhile she was being treated for her burns. She was still under the pain and stress\n\nof the startling event and her statements concerned that startling event.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nstatements.      At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n        Issue #40: Nancy’s Statements at the Whip-In (Punishment Phase)\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting during the punishment phase of trial,\n\nthe in-car police video containing Nancy’s statements to police regarding the\n\ninstant offense.    As previously argued in response to Issue 38, Nancy’s statements\n\nto police when they arrived at the Whip-In were admissible as excited utterances\n\nand because they were non-testimonial in nature. Since the testimony of the two\n\nofficers was admissible, the video is therefore admissible. See Williams v. State,\n\n958 S.W.2d 186, 195 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (stating that “a photograph is\n\nadmissible if verbal testimony as to matters depicted in the photographs is also\n\nadmissible.”).     State’s Exhibit #187, the in-car video, simply allows the jury to\n\nhear the statements from Nancy in her own voice.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nstatements.   At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n\n\n\n                                         152 \n \n\f                               Any Error is Harmless\n\n      Even if this Court finds that the trial court erred, any alleged error is\n\nharmless.      Nancy’s descriptions of the man who attacked her did not have a\n\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdicts.\n\nBefore any of the officers testified about Nancy’s statements to them, the jury saw\n\nthe surveillance video. (RR44:49; SX#17).       The jury saw with their own eyes,\n\nhow on May 20, 2012, Appellant walked in to the Whip-In, robbed Nancy, and set\n\nher on fire.    (SX#17). Nancy’s descriptions to police regarding the person who\n\nrobbed her and set her on fire only confirmed what the jury had already seen.\n\n      Issues 38, 39, and 40 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 41: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ADMITTED\nEVIDENCE OF APPELLANT’S ACTIONS AFTER HE FLED THE WHIP-IN.\n\n      In Issue 41, Appellant contends that, during the guilt phase, the trial court\n\nerred under Rule 404(b) in admitting evidence of the bad acts and offenses he\n\ncommitted after he fled the Whip-In.      Appellant’s contentions lack merit and\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      During the guilt/innocence phase, Appellant objected to testimony from\n\nthree of the residents from the neighborhood behind the Whip-In, where Appellant\n\nhid after the instant offense: Jim Medley, Ken Marecle, and Lawrence Denson.\n\nPrior to their testimony, Appellant objected, arguing that their testimony involved\n                                        153 \n \n\fextraneous offenses which were “not necessary to the jury’s understanding[.]”\n\n(RR44:140). Appellant’s objection was overruled. (RR44:141).\n\n                               Standard of Review\n\n      A ruling on the admissibility of extraneous offenses is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Devoe v. State, 354 S.W.3d 457, 469 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Rule 404(b) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n      Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove\n      the character of a person in order to show action in conformity\n      therewith. It may however be admissible for other purposes, such as\n      proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\n      identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 404(b).      Evidence of extraneous offenses may be admissible,\n\nhowever, if it has relevance apart from character conformity. See Moses v. State,\n\n105 S.W.3d 622, 626 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      Appellant has failed to properly brief this issue. He recites trial counsel’s\n\nobjection and the law, but does not actually identify whose testimony he contends\n\nwas improperly admitted.       Importantly, in the cited exchange, wherein trial\n\ncounsel lodged her objection, only two of the three neighborhood residents are\n\nidentified by name, Medley and Marecle. (Appellant’s Br. p. 113).     As such, any\n\nalleged error as to the third neighborhood resident, Lawrence Denson, was not\n\n\n                                        154 \n \n\fpreserved. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). As to Medley and Marecle, the issue is\n\ninadequately briefed. Rule 38.1(h) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nrequires that a brief contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made,\n\nwith appropriate citations to authorities and to the record. Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h);\n\nsee, e.g., Walder v. State, 85 S.W.3d 824, 827 (Tex. App.—Waco 2002, no pet.)\n\n(setting forth the elements necessary to satisfy the mandatory requirement of a\n\n“clear and concise argument” pursuant to Rule 38.1).\n\n      Nevertheless, testimony from all three of the neighborhood residents –\n\nMedley, Marecle, and Denson – was admissible as same transaction contextual\n\nevidence.    Same transaction contextual evidence is admissible to impart\n\ninformation to the jury that is essential to understanding the context and\n\ncircumstances of events which, although legally separate offenses, are blended or\n\ninterwoven. See Camacho v. State, 864 S.W.2d 524, 532 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993)\n\n(finding evidence of kidnapping and murder of complainant’s wife and son\n\nadmissible as same transaction contextual evidence as it was necessary to\n\nunderstand the charged offense). “[E]vents do not occur in a vacuum, and the jury\n\nhas a right to hear what occurred immediately prior to and subsequent to the\n\ncommission of the act so that it may realistically evaluate the evidence.”\n\nWesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 115 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (citing Archer v.\n\nState, 607 S.W.2d 539, 542 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980)).\n\n\n                                        155 \n \n\f      The three neighborhood residents’ testimony provide context to the offense\n\nand show Appellant’s consciousness of guilt. Medley’s testimony helped the jury\n\nto understand where Appellant went when he fled the Whip-In and how he tried to\n\nget rid of the t-shirt he wore while he committed the offense. Evidence of flight\n\nand attempts to conceal incriminating evidence are admissible as circumstances\n\nshowing consciousness of guilt. See Wells v. State, 578 S.W.2d 118, 119 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1979). Medley testified that on the morning of the offense, he found a\n\npack of cigarettes in his driveway. (RR44:146; SX#48, 78).     Inside the garbage\n\ncan, he found a t-shirt. (RR44:147; SX#77).         DNA on the t-shirt matched\n\nAppellant.   (RR44:206-07; RR45:134; SX#77, 135, 141, 142).           A medium\n\npetroleum distillate was also detected on the t-shirt. (RR44:206-07; RR45:117;\n\nSX#77, 135, 138).\n\n      Marecle and Denson’s testimony informed the jury of Appellant’s attempts\n\nto try to avoid detection and apprehension.     Marecle testified that Appellant\n\nappeared on his porch, asking for help. (RR44:157, 159, 166-67; SX#55).       His\n\n“eyes were really wide and big.” (RR44:169).     He was wearing pants and black-\n\nrim glasses, but no shirt. (RR44:162). He tried to push his way into Marecle’s\n\nhome. (RR44:159-60). Marecle pushed Appellant outside. (RR44:160, 169).\n\nThere, Appellant pushed Marecle to the ground. (RR44:161, 169). When Marecle\n\nstood up, Appellant took the glasses off of Marecle’s face and fled. (RR44:162-63,\n\n\n                                       156 \n \n\f170). At Denson’s house, Appellant tried to get inside the gate. (RR45:9). When\n\nDenson confronted him, Appellant approached him saying “man, I’m in a bad\n\nway.” (RR45:9, 11-12; SX#51-53).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse it’s discretion in admitting the testimony of the\n\nthree neighborhood residents. At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542. Even if this Court\n\nfinds that the trial court erred, however, any alleged error is harmless. As argued in\n\ndetail above, the State presented overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt.\n\n      Issue 41 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 42:     THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY INSTRUCTED THE\nJURY ON VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.\n\n      In Issue 42, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the jury instruction regarding voluntary intoxication. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      The court’s charge during the guilt/innocence phase of trial included the\n\nfollowing instruction:\n\n      Voluntary intoxication does not constitute a defense to the\n      commission of a crime. “Intoxication” means the disturbance of\n      mental or physical capacity resulting from the introduction of any\n      substance into the body.\n\n\n\n\n                                         157 \n \n\f(CR14:4508).     Appellant objected to this instruction.        (RR45:187-88).    His\n\nobjection was overruled. (RR45:188).\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n      A reviewing court examines the trial court’s submission of jury instructions\n\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at 122.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Texas Penal Code § 8.04(a) provides that voluntary intoxication does not\n\nconstitute a defense to the commission of a crime. Tex. Penal Code Ann. §\n\n8.04(a). It is appropriate to include an § 8.04(a) instruction in the guilt/innocence\n\ncharge if there is evidence from any source that might lead a jury to conclude that\n\nthe defendant’s intoxication somehow excused his actions. Sakil v. State, 287\n\nS.W.3d 23, 26 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).           It is not necessary that the defendant\n\nassert intoxication as a defense for the § 8.04(a) instruction to be included in the\n\ncharge. Id. at 26 fn. 8. It is not necessary that the evidence conclusively establish\n\nthe defendant’s intoxication for the instruction to be included in the charge. See id.\n\nat 27-28.\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n      The trial court did not err when it included the complained-of instruction\n\nduring guilt/innocence as there was evidence that might have led the jury to believe\n\nthat Appellant was intoxicated and that his intoxication excused his actions.\n\n\n                                         158 \n \n\fAppellant cross-examined Officer Coffey regarding his opinion of whether\n\nAppellant was intoxicated after he was arrested and was being transported to jail.\n\n(RR44:87). Coffey testified he did not “smell anything on [Appellant.]”\n\n(RR44:87).      Appellant asked whether someone can be intoxicated “from a\n\nsubstance that didn’t have a smell[.]”         (RR44:87).    Coffey conceded that\n\npossibility. (RR44:87).    He also conceded that Appellant appeared “erratic” on\n\nthe transport video. (RR44:87).     Appellant also cross-examined Marecle about\n\nwhether Appellant appeared intoxicated at the time of their encounter. (RR44:168-\n\n69). Indeed, Marecle testified “It had to be something because he didn’t look - -\n\nhis eyes were really wide and big.” (RR44:169).        Finally, the State notes that\n\nduring closing argument, defense counsel argued that “any person with common\n\nsense can tell [Appellant] is under the influence” when he is in the patrol car.\n\n(RR46:54-55).\n\n      Because there was some evidence that Appellant may have been intoxicated,\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion when it included a § 8.04 instruction in\n\nthe charge during guilt/innocence. See Sakil, 287 S.W.3d at 24, 27-28 (finding no\n\nerror in including § 8.04(a) instruction where evidence of Sakil’s intoxication was\n\nequivocal: the complainant told the 911 operator that Sakil was not intoxicated, but\n\nthat he was behaving “oddly” during their fight; psychiatrist testified to Sakil’s\n\nhistory of poly-substance abuse).\n\n\n                                        159 \n \n\f              Issue 42 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 43 AND 44: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED EVIDENCE DURING THE PUNISHMENT PHASE OF APPELLANT’S\nEXTRANEOUS OFFENSES.\n\n              In Issues 43 and 44, Appellant contends that, during punishment, the trial\n\ncourt erred in admitting over his objection, evidence of his extraneous bad acts.\n\nHe contends that the State’s notice of its intent to present the evidence was\n\ninadequate under article 37.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure in that it\n\nfailed to include the date of the acts and county in which they occurred.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                                               Pertinent Facts\n\n              On September 27, 2013, thirty days prior to trial, the State filed and served\n\nAppellant with its notice of extraneous offenses. (CR14:4461-69). Included in\n\nthat notice were four specific assaults Appellant committed against his former\n\ngirlfriend Amy Armstrong Franks.16 (CR14:4461-62). Also included was the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                        During the defendant’s relationship with Amy Armstrong, in or about\n                         the year 1993, the defendant was physically abusive. The defendant\n                         was jealous and would get violent if he thought she was with\n                         someone else. She said he punched her, pushed her, and choked her.\n                         He drank alcohol a lot and smoked marijuana. He threatened Ms.\n                         Armstrong, saying, “Nobody’s gonna have you if I can’t have you.”\n                         These incidents all occurred in Dallas County, Texas.\n                                                            \n16\n  At the time of trial, Amy Armstrong had married and gave her name as Amy Franks.\n(RR47:29-30).\n                                                                    160 \n \n\f(CR14:4468).      During the punishment phase of trial, Appellant objected to the\n\nState presenting evidence of ongoing abuse between Appellant and Amy\n\nArmstrong. (RR47:9). Appellant argued that the State’s notice “lacks detail with\n\nregard to specific dates.” (RR47:10). He objected that there was no date or time\n\nassociated with the claim regarding Appellant’s threat, “Nobody’s gonna have you\n\nif I can’t have you.” (RR47:10). He objected that the claims regarding drugs and\n\nalcohol were “very general and vague.” (RR47:10). Finally, he objected that the\n\n“offenses or transactions” were not relevant to Appellant’s death worthiness\n\nbecause they occurred 20 years ago and are “highly prejudicial.” (RR47:12).\n\nAppellant’s objection was overruled. (RR47:12).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The introduction of extraneous conduct evidence in the punishment phase of\n\na capital murder trial is governed by the notice requirements of Article 37.07, §\n\n3(g) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n37.071, § 2(a)(1). Article 37.07, § 3(g) requires the State, on timely request, to\n\ngive the defendant reasonable notice of extraneous crimes or bad acts that the State\n\nintends to use at trial. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, § 3(g)\n\n(incorporating Texas Rule of Evidence 404(b)’s reasonable notice requirement).\n\nThis statute also requires the State to give additional notice if it intends to use an\n\nextraneous offense that has not resulted in a final conviction. To be reasonable, the\n                                         161 \n \n\fnotice must include the date on which the offense occurred, the county where it\n\noccurred, and the name of the alleged victim. Id.\n\n      The purpose of article 37.07, § 3(g) is to avoid unfair surprise and to enable\n\nthe defendant to prepare to answer the extraneous-offense evidence. See Luna v.\n\nState, 301 S.W.3d 322, 326 (Tex. App.—Waco 2009, no pet.); Apolinar v. State,\n\n106 S.W.3d 407, 414-15 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003) aff’d, 155 S.W.3d\n\n184 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005); Roethel v. State, 80 S.W.3d 276, 282 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2002, no pet.). To determine harm in light of that purpose, an appellate\n\ncourt should examine the record to determine whether the deficient notice resulted\n\nfrom prosecutorial bad faith or prevented the defendant from preparing for trial.\n\nRoethel, 80 S.W.3d at 282. In determining whether the defendant was prevented\n\nfrom preparing for trial, appellate courts look at whether the defendant was\n\nsurprised by the substance of the testimony and whether that affected his ability to\n\nprepare cross-examination or mitigating evidence. Id.\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      Of the five offenses or acts committed against Amy Franks listed in the\n\nState’s Notice of Extraneous Offenses, only one does not identify the specific date\n\non which the offense was committed: the one describing Appellant’s abusive\n\nbehavior and his drug and alcohol use. (CR14:4468). Although the notice does\n\nnot provide the month and day, it does identify the year that the offenses were\n\n\n                                        162 \n \n\fcommitted, 1993, and it states that the offenses were committed in Dallas County,\n\nTexas. (CR14:4468).\n\n      The record contains no indication that the State acted in bad faith when it\n\nfailed to comply with article 37.07, § 3(g).         To the contrary, the record\n\ndemonstrates that the State provided Appellant notice of the extraneous conduct to\n\nthe best of its ability and that the only reason the notice did not identify the date\n\nmore specifically was because more specific information was not known to the\n\nState. There is no indication from the record that the omission was intended to\n\nmislead Appellant or prevent him from preparing a defense.\n\n      Notably, Appellant does not argue that he was surprised by the substance of\n\nFranks’ testimony. He does not point to anything in the record that would support\n\nthe notion that his ability to mount an adequate defense was hindered by the lack of\n\nnotice; nor does he argue on appeal that his ability to prepare cross-examination or\n\nmitigating evidence was affected by the lack of adequate notice. Appellant has\n\nfailed to make any showing of how his defense strategy might have been different\n\nhad the State identified the exact days and months when the abuse and substance\n\nabuse occurred.    See, e.g., Hernandez v. State, 176 S.W.3d 821, 825-26 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2005) (finding any error in admitting evidence of extraneous offense\n\nduring punishment phase despite failure to provide notice was harmless because\n\nHernandez did not contend that witness’s testimony caused him surprise, that\n\n\n                                        163 \n \n\fomission from notice prevented him from preparing a defense, or that had he\n\nknown, his defense strategy would have been different). As such, any error by the\n\ntrial court in admitting evidence of this offense was harmless.\n\n      Appellant also contends that the offenses associated with Franks were too\n\nremote to be relevant on the issue of mitigation.           However, this Court has\n\nspecifically declined to fashion a “per se” rule that an extraneous transaction is too\n\nremote in time to be introduced into evidence at trial. See Templin v. State, 711\n\nS.W.2d 30, 34 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986).           Indeed, the fact that Appellant abused\n\nFranks and drugs and alcohol in 1993 shows his penchant for violence and\n\naddiction to mind-altering substances is long lived, which is most definitely\n\nrelevant to both future danger and mitigation.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nthe complained-of evidence was relevant and admissible. This decision was not\n\noutside of the zone of reasonable disagreement. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the evidence.\n\n      Even if the trial court erred, any alleged error is harmless. Error in admitting\n\nevidence with insufficient notice under article 37.07, § 3(g) is non-constitutional\n\nerror. See Apolinar, 106 S.W.3d at 414.          The evidence at issue was no more\n\nserious and potentially inflammatory than the facts of the offense and the other\n\npunishment evidence admitted without objection. There is nothing in the record to\n\n\n                                         164 \n \n\findicate that the jury was not equipped to evaluate the probative force of the\n\nevidence. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that any testimony regarding\n\nextraneous offenses committed by appellant could be considered only if they\n\nbelieved appellant committed the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and even\n\nthen only in determining their answers to the special issues.17 (CR14:4517). This\n\nminimized any potential for improper influence on the jury. See, e.g., Lane v. State,\n\n933 S.W.2d 504, 520 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\n              Issues 43 and 44 should be overruled.\n\n\n\nSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 45 THROUGH 48: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED EVIDENCE OF APPELLANT’S ARRESTS AND CERTAIN JUDGMENTS AND\nSENTENCES.\n\n              In Issues 45, 46, 47, and 48, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\nadmitting, over his objection, evidence of certain prior arrests and convictions. He\n\ncontends that the evidence was not sufficiently tied to him.                          Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n17\n  Specifically, the instruction stated: “You are instructed that if there is any evidence before you\nin this case regarding the defendant having committed an offense or offenses other than the\noffense alleged against him in the indictment, you cannot consider this evidence for any purpose\nunless you find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed such other\noffenses, if any were committed, and even then you may only consider the same in determining\nthe answers to the special issues.” (CR14:4517).\n                                                               165 \n \n\f                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n                        Issue No. 45: State’s Exhibit #166\n\n       Lieutenant John Spera testified he responded to “a family disturbance” call\n\nat 4263 Rose Hill Road on September 13, 2004. (RR47:78-79). The complainant\n\nwas Daphne Johnson. (RR47:80). “[T]here was a suspect there attempting to kick\n\nthe door in and that there was also a protective order on him.” (RR47:79). Spera\n\nfound Appellant and arrested him for the offense of violation of a protective order.\n\n(RR47:86-89, 92). The State offered State’s Exhibit #166, Appellant’s judgment\n\nand sentence in Cause No. MA04-28690, convicting him of the offense of\n\nviolation of a protective order. (RR47:97; SX#166).      The judgment recites that\n\nthe offense was committed on September 13, 2004. (SX#166).\n\n       Appellant objected that the information contained in State’s Exhibit #166\n\nwas not “sufficiently tied to” him.      (RR47:93).     Appellant’s objection was\n\noverruled. (RR47:94).\n\n                        Issue No. 46: State’s Exhibit #169\n\n       Officer M.G. Clark testified that on August 7, 1995 was dispatched to locate\n\na suspect involved in an earlier aggravated assault, deadly weapon.     (RR47:132-\n\n33).    Appellant was the suspect. (RR47:134-36).         Clark located Appellant,\n\narrested him, and booked him for, among other offenses, aggravated assault,\n\ndeadly weapon. (RR47:136). The State offered State’s Exhibit #169, a certified\n\n\n                                        166 \n \n\fcopy of Appellant’s prior conviction for aggravated assault, deadly weapon in\n\nCause No. F95-25906. (RR47:141; SX#169). Appellant objected to this exhibit,\n\narguing that it was not “sufficiently tied to [Appellant].”      (RR47:142).     His\n\nobjection was overruled. (RR47:142, 143).\n\n                        Issue No. 47: State’s Exhibit #171\n\n       Officer St. Clair testified about the events leading to Appellant’s arrest for\n\nrobbery and evading arrest on June 19, 2004.           (RR47:165-174).     St. Clair\n\nrecognized Appellant from the car chase and arrest. (RR47:170).          During St.\n\nClair’s testimony, the State offered State’s Exhibit #171, which is a pen packet\n\ncontaining a judgment and sentence for robbery in Cause No. F04-26727.\n\n(RR47:175; SX#171). It also contains a judgment and sentence for evading arrest\n\nor detention in Cause No. F04-26728. (RR47:175; SX#171). The date of offense\n\non both cases is June 19, 2004. (RR47:175; SX#171). Appellant objected to this\n\nexhibit, arguing that there was a lack of sufficient identifying information.\n\n(RR47:175). His objection was overruled. (RR47:175).\n\n                        Issue No. 48: State’s Exhibit #170\n\n      Officer Steadman testified that on October 9, 2002 at about 1:50 a.m., he\n\nwas dispatched as back up on a hit-and-run call. (RR47:154-55).           Steadman\n\nlocated the suspect – Appellant – and, after a foot chase, captured and arrested him\n\nfor evading arrest. (RR47:155-59).      The State offered State’s Exhibit #170, a\n\n\n                                        167 \n \n\fcertified copy of Appellant’s judgment and sentence for the offense of evading\n\narrest in Cause No. M02-27021. (RR47:160). Appellant objected, arguing that\n\nthere was not sufficient identifying information to tie the documents to Appellant.\n\n(RR47:160-61). Appellant’s objection was overruled. (RR47:161).\n\n                                   Applicable Law\n\n      To establish a defendant’s prior criminal conviction, the State must prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt the following: (1) that a prior conviction exists, and (2)\n\nthat the defendant is linked to that conviction. See Flowers v. State, 220 S.W.3d\n\n919, 921 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).         Texas law does not require that the prior\n\nconviction be proven in any specific manner. Id. at 922. “Any type of evidence,\n\ndocumentary or testimonial, might suffice.” Id.\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n      Appellant has failed to properly brief these issues. He recites trial counsel’s\n\nobjections and the law, but he does not provide any specific argument as to why\n\nthe exhibits are inadmissible.   See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n      Regardless, all four exhibits were properly admitted as the testimony linked\n\nthe convictions to Appellant.      Spera testified that he arrested Appellant on\n\nSeptember 13, 2004 for the offense of violation of a protective order. (RR47:78-\n\n79, 86-89, 92). State’s Exhibit #166 is a certified copy of a judgment regarding\n\nAppellant’s prior conviction for violation of a protective order, alleged to have\n\n\n                                         168 \n \n\fbeen committed on September 13, 2004. (RR47:97; SX#166). Clark testified that\n\nhe arrested Appellant on August 7, 1995 for aggravated assault, deadly weapon.\n\n(RR47:136). State’s Exhibit #169 is a certified copy of a judgment regarding\n\nAppellant’s prior conviction for aggravated assault, deadly weapon alleged to have\n\nbeen committed on August 7, 1995. (RR47:141; SX#169). St. Clair testified that\n\nhe participated in Appellant’s arrest for robbery and evading arrest on June 19,\n\n2004. (RR47:165-174). State’s Exhibit #171 is a penitentiary packet containing a\n\ncopy of a judgment regarding Appellant’s conviction for robbery alleged to have\n\nbeen committed on June 19, 2004. (RR47:175; SX#171).          Steadman testified that\n\nhe arrested Appellant on October 9, 2002 for evading arrest. (RR47:154-59).\n\nState’s Exhibit #170 is a certified copy of a judgment regarding Appellant’s prior\n\nconviction for evading arrest alleged to have been committed on October 9, 2002.\n\n(SX#170).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant was the individual who committed the\n\naforementioned extraneous offenses.      As such, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting them. See Flowers, 220 S.W.3d at 922 (noting that there\n\nare many ways to prove a prior conviction; “Just as there is more than one way to\n\nskin a cat, there is more than one way to prove a prior conviction.”).\n\n      Issues 45, 46, 47, and 48 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                         169 \n \n\fSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 49: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ADMITTED THE\nTESTIMONY OF WARDEN MELODYE NELSON.\n\n      In Issue 49, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing\n\ntestimony from Warden Melodye Nelson regarding prison violence and the nature\n\nof weapons found in prison. (Appellant’s Br. pp. 122-1240. Appellant contends\n\nthat Nelson’s testimony violated his right to individualized sentencing as her\n\ntestimony concerned the conduct of individuals other than Appellant. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                   Pertinent Facts\n\n      In a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected to the\n\ntestimony of Warden Melodye Nelson. (RR48:16-17). Specifically, he objected to\n\n“testimony by Warden Nelson, concerning violence and weapons and - - and things\n\ndone by other inmates.”       (RR48:16).        Appellant’s objection was overruled.\n\n(RR48:17).\n\n                                   Applicable Law\n\n      Rule 702 of the Texas Rules of Evidence provides as follows:\n\n      If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the\n      trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\n      a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\n      training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or\n      otherwise.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 702. “The proponent of scientific evidence must show, by clear and\n\nconvincing proof, that the evidence is sufficiently relevant and reliable to assist the\n                                         170 \n \n\fjury in accurately understanding other evidence or in determining a fact in issue.”\n\nGallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 765 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\n      Additionally, the trial court must determine whether the expert “make[s] an\n\neffort to tie pertinent facts of the case to the scientific principles which are the\n\nsubject of his testimony.” Jordan v. State, 928 S.W.2d 550, 555 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1996). The testimony must be “sufficiently tied to the facts” to be helpful to the\n\njury. Id.; see Griffith v. State, 983 S.W.2d 282, 288 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998)\n\n(holding that expert witness “fit” his expert knowledge with the particular facts of\n\nthe case in his evaluation of appellant’s future dangerousness).\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting Warden Nelson’s testimony because\n\nit was relevant to helping the jury determine Special Issue No. 1, whether\n\nAppellant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society.   It is well settled that “society” includes the prison\n\npopulation. See Estrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d 274, 281 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\nNelson’s testimony described for the jury what Appellant’s life would be like if\n\nAppellant were sentenced to life in prison and his “society” became prison society.\n\nSee Jordan, 928 S.W.2d at 555-56.        Prison society is not something within a\n\njuror’s common knowledge. Nelson testified regarding staffing, classification,\n\nhousing, daily routine, discipline and the potential for violence.      She did not\n\n\n                                         171 \n \n\fspecifically testify that Appellant would be more or less likely to commit violent\n\nacts in prison, only that there is a potential for drugs and violence, even in prison.\n\nNelson showed weapons that were found and confiscated in prison over the years\n\nin an effort to illustrate her testimony for the jury. Indeed, Nelson testified, “for\n\nsomeone who hasn’t worked inside of one of our prisons, [the inmates are] very\n\ncreative in how they can construct a weapon. I will tell you there’s - - we still find\n\nweapons and things of that nature that it shocks me.” (RR48:59). See Threadgill,\n\n146 S.W.3d at 670-671 (finding no abuse of discretion in admitting criminal\n\ninvestigator’s testimony regarding the prevalence of violence in prison as well as\n\nphotographs of weapons made by inmates in prison).\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting Nelson’s testimony, any alleged\n\nerror was harmless. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). The jury had already seen and\n\nheard evidence regarding the instant capital murder.     The jury had already heard\n\nabout Appellant’s violent and threatening behavior with his wife, sister-in-law and\n\nex-girlfriend, his oppositional behavior with police, his prior violent criminal\n\noffenses and the assault he committed against Jenkins while he was in prison. The\n\njury would later hear about his failure to obey orders while incarcerated, even\n\nwhile awaiting trial on the instant charges. Furthermore, the prejudicial effect of\n\nNelson’s testimony was minimized by its general nature. It was neither graphic\n\nnor disturbing in content. That fact, in conjunction with the admission of other\n\n\n                                         172 \n \n\fmore compelling punishment evidence by the State, rendered harmless any error in\n\nthe admission of Warden Nelson’s testimony.\n\n      Issue 49 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 50: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\nSUPPORT THE JURY’S FINDING THAT APPELLANT IS A FUTURE DANGER.\n\n      In Issue 50, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s finding that there is a probability that he will commit criminal\n\nacts of violence in the future.    Appellant contends that he has no prior violent\n\noffense convictions and several of his witnesses testified that he was a low risk for\n\nfuture dangerousness.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The State has the burden of proving the future dangerousness punishment\n\nissue beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, §§\n\n2(b)(1), 2(c); Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at 557. In its determination of the issue, the jury is\n\nentitled to consider all of the evidence presented at both the guilt and punishment\n\nstages of trial. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 § 2(d)(1).\n\n      A jury may consider a variety of factors when determining whether a\n\ndefendant will pose a continuing threat to society:       the circumstances of the\n\noffense, the defendant’s state of mind, whether he was working alone or with other\n\nparties, the calculated nature of his acts, the forethought and deliberation exhibited\n\nby the crime’s execution, the existence of a prior criminal record, the defendant’s\n                                         173 \n \n\fage and personal circumstances at the time of the offense, whether the defendant\n\nwas acting under duress or the domination of another at the time of the offense,\n\npsychiatric evidence, and character evidence. See Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d\n\n727, 730 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthis Court views all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding\n\nand determines whether, based on that evidence and reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nanswer to the future-dangerousness issue was “yes.” Id. at 730.\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n       The evidence from both phases of trial unquestionably demonstrates\n\nAppellant’s propensity for violence. Indeed, the facts of the offense, standing\n\nalone, are sufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness.        Appellant\n\npoured lighter fluid over the upper body of an elderly woman, robbed her, lit her\n\non fire, and then casually walked away as she tried in vain to extinguish the flames\n\nravaging her upper body.\n\n       The State did not rely on the facts of the offense alone, however. The State\n\npresented the following additional evidence showing Appellant’s future\n\ndangerousness:\n\n\n     In 1993, at the age of 17, Appellant was physically violent with his then-\n      girlfriend, Franks. (RR47:38-40). Over the course of their short relationship,\n      he hit her, grabbed her, and threatened her. (RR47:38-40). One time, he\n                                         174 \n \n\f       threw a burning piece of wood onto her patio, setting a rug on fire.\n       (RR47:49).\n\n     Also in 1993, Appellant was arrested when an officer saw him walking\n      down the street with a joint. (RR47:101, 104–107). In addition to the\n      joint, Appellant had a bag of marijuana on his person. (RR47:105, 107).\n      He was arrested for the marijuana and an outstanding warrant. (RR47:105,\n      108).\n\n     The following year, in 1994, Appellant was arrested when officers\n      responding to a call of a man and woman fighting on the side of the road\n      determined that he had outstanding warrants. (RR48:111-12). Appellant\n      struggled with police when he was informed that he would be arrested.\n      (RR48:114). He bit both officers’ arms. (RR48:114). He bit one of the\n      officers so hard that he bit through the officer’s watch. (RR48:114).\n\n     Also in 1994, Appellant instructed Daphne not to stop when an officer tried\n      to pull them over. (RR47:125). After a slow-speed chase, Appellant jumped\n      out of the vehicle and tried to flee. (RR47:118–23).\n\n     In 1995, Appellant was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly\n      weapon. (RR47:134-37). He had been making threatening phone calls for\n      hours. (RR47:133-34). When he was booked in, he threatened the arresting\n      officer. (RR47:138-40).\n\n     In 2002, Appellant evaded arrest. (RR47: 150–151, 155–58).\n\n     In 2003, Daphne filed an application for a protective order. (SX#193). In\n      her application, she detailed assaults he committed on her in October,\n      November and December of 2003. She wrote that Appellant punched her,\n      pushed her, and kicked in their door. (SX#193). Daphne wrote, “Over the\n      last nine years [Appellant] . . . hit me, punched me, slapped me, kicked me\n      once, strangled me, pushed and shoved me, and thrown me around. I’ve had\n      bruises, black eyes, a bloody nose, a busted lip, scratches[,] soreness,\n      swelling, and pain.” (SX#193).\n\n     In 2004, Appellant attacked Salmeron in her driveway, threw her out of her\n      truck, and stole it. (RR47:183-86, 191). After a high-speed chase, he\n\n\n                                       175 \n \n\f       wrecked Salmeron’s truck, rendering it inoperable. (RR47:166-68, 170,\n       188, 197).\n\n     Also in 2004, while Daphne’s protective order was still in effect, Appellant\n      went to Daphne’s apartment and attempted to kick down her door.\n      (RR47:78-80, 84).\n\n     While in prison in 2005, Appellant refused to attend school or go to work.\n      He fought with his bunkmate, Jenkins. (RR47:223). He grabbed Jenkins\n      below his knees and flipped him, causing Jenkins’ head to strike the concrete\n      floor and “split [his] head open.” (RR47:226-27, 233). Jenkins’ injuries\n      required nine staples. (RR47:230–231; SX#172).\n\n     In 2006, while still in prison, Appellant masturbated at the door of his cell in\n      front of a female guard while leering at her. (RR47:263-64).\n\n     In 2011, Appellant broke into his employer’s safe and stole $325 in cash and\n      three state inspection books valued at $2,100. (RR48:158, 172-73). He also\n      stole a computer monitor. (RR48:172-73). He returned the monitor but not\n      the inspection booklets or cash. (RR48:175, 178; SX#174).\n\n     In 2012, Appellant was brought into the emergency room by Dallas police\n      and paramedics. (RR48:190-91; SX#188). He was handcuffed, “highly\n      agitated” and “somewhat combative.” (RR48:194). He was in a substance-\n      induced psychosis. (RR48:202-03). It took eight or nine people to hold him\n      to the bed. (RR48:194). A body net bound him to the bed. (RR48:194-95).\n\n     Later in 2012, Appellant approached Pinzon as she cleaned a bathroom at\n      the Express Inn and exposed his erect penis to her. (RR48:101-04, 108).\n\n     While in jail awaiting trial on the instant offense, Appellant violated the\n      rules by disobeying staff orders and tattooing himself. (RR48:147-49;\n      RR49:132-33).\n\n       Appellant argues that he has no prior convictions for violent offenses.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. at 124). Appellant is incorrect. In 1994, he was convicted of\n\nresisting arrest after he resisted arrest and bit two police officers. (RR48:114-16;\n\n                                         176 \n \n\fSX#189). In 1995, Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault, deadly weapon\n\nafter he made repeated threatening phone calls to his sister-in-law Courtney\n\nJohnson.   (RR47:132-34, 140-41, 143; SX#169).             In 2004, Appellant was\n\nconvicted of robbery and evading arrest after he robbed Salmeron of her truck in\n\nher driveway. (RR47:175-76; SX#171). In 2004, Appellant was also convicted of\n\nthe offense of violation of a protective order when he tried to kick Daphne’s door\n\nin. (RR47:79-80, 97; SX#166).\n\n      Additionally, the State presented substantial evidence of unadjudicated\n\noffenses, many of which involved violence:           the domestic violence between\n\nAppellant and Franks, including when he threw a burning piece of wood onto her\n\npatio; the domestic violence between Appellant and Daphne; the assault on Jenkins\n\nwhile in prison; and, the time he exposed himself to Pinzon.\n\n      The State notes that many of Appellant’s most violent offenses, both\n\nadjudicated and unadjudicated, involve violence against women: Franks, Daphne,\n\nSalmeron, Pinzon, and Nancy.      Appellant apparently has no trouble threatening,\n\nhitting, punching, kicking, strangling or robbing a woman. He has no problem\n\nsetting a woman on fire.   His history also demonstrates an inability to follow the\n\nrules, whether he is in the free world, whether he is in prison, or whether he is in\n\njail awaiting trial on a charge of capital murder.     Cf. Reese v. State, 33 S.W.3d\n\n238, 247 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (noting that it was in capital “[defendant’s] best\n\n\n                                        177 \n \n\finterest to behave well while in jail awaiting trial”).   Appellant blames all of his\n\noffenses on his drug use and depression. (RR49:99-100).         Importantly, multiple\n\nwitnesses – including Appellant’s own experts – testified that drugs are available\n\nin prison. (RR47:253, 272; RR48:47, 69, 72; RR50:85-86; RR51:37, 52, 63).\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence here is more\n\nthan sufficient to support the jury’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nAppellant would constitute a continuing threat to society.          The evidence is\n\nsufficient to support the jury’s answer to the future dangerousness special issue.\n\n      Issue 50 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 51 THROUGH 53: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND OVERRULED HIS\nOBJECTIONS TO THE CHARGE.\n\n      In Issues 51, 52, and 53, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his requested instructions and overruling his objections to the court’s\n\npunishment charge. (Appellant’s Br. 129-38). Appellant’s contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Prior to trial, Appellant filed Pre-Trial Motion No. 63, “Defendant’s\n\nRequested Instructions for Punishment Charge.”       (CR3:660-73). In that motion,\n\nAppellant requested 13 instructions to be included in the court’s punishment\n\ncharge. He also requested 2 additional special verdict forms. (CR3:660-73).\n\n\n                                         178 \n \n\fAppellant also filed Pre-Trial Motion No. 64, “Defendant’s Objections to the\n\nCharge at Punishment.”     (CR3:641-58).      In this motion, Appellant raised 61\n\nobjections to the trial court’s punishment charge. (CR3:641-58).\n\n      Both of Appellant’s motions were presented during a hearing outside the\n\npresence of the jury. (RR51:92-106). Both of Appellant’s motions were denied.\n\n(RR51:92-106).\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      Issues 51, 52, and 53 are inadequately briefed. Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h). In\n\nthree issues, Appellant asserts 76 challenges to the court’s punishment charge.\n\nThe bulk of his briefing on these issues, however, consists of simply a shorthand\n\nrecitation of the challenges raised in Pre-Trial Motion Nos. 63 and 64. Only 15 of\n\nthe 76 challenges contain citations to authority. Appellant neither challenges the\n\nreasoning of the existing case law nor asserts any novel legal arguments to support\n\nhis claims.   Conclusory assertions of error, unsupported by substantive legal\n\nanalysis, present nothing for review. See Rocha v. State, 16 S.W.3d 1, 20 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2000). Moreover, this Court has held that an issue that embraces more\n\nthan one legal theory is multifarious and risks rejects on that basis alone. See\n\nDavis v. State, 329 S.W.3d 798, 803 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Without adequate\n\nbriefing, the State cannot respond to Appellant’s complaints.      Issues 51, 52, and\n\n\n\n\n                                       179 \n \n\f53 should be overruled as multifarious and inadequately briefed. See Wood v.\n\nState, 18 S.W.3d 642, 649 n.6 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n      To the extent that the State is able to discern Appellant’s objections or\n\nrequested instruction, the State agrees that with Appellant his claims are foreclosed\n\nby well-settled law.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Appellant’s\n\nobjections to the charge. At a minimum, the rulings fall within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n      Issues 51, 52, and 53 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 54 THROUGH 65: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES TO THE DEATH PENALTY STATUTE.\n\n      In Issues 54 through 65, Appellant challenges the constitutionality of the\n\nTexas death penalty statute.      He acknowledges that these issues have been\n\npreviously submitted to this Court and overruled, citing Saldano, 232 S.W.3d 77,\n\nbut invites the Court to review its prior stance on these issues. He claims that he\n\nasserts these issues not to cause unnecessary litigation but to preserve the issues for\n\nfederal court review. (Appellant’s Br. at 138).\n\n      In Issue 54, Appellant contends the statute under which he was sentenced to\n\ndeath violates the Eighth Amendment by allowing the jury too much discretion in\n\n\n                                         183 \n \n\fdetermining who should live and who should die and results in the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious imposition of the death penalty. (Appellant’s Br. at 138).\n\n        In Issue 55, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty statute violates\n\nthe due process mandates of the Fourteenth Amendment because it implicitly puts\n\nthe burden of proving the mitigation special issue on him rather than placing the\n\nburden on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no circumstances\n\nwarrant a life sentence rather than a death sentence. (Appellant’s Br. at 139).\n\n        In Issue 56, Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to\n\nhold that Article 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) violates Article I, §§ 10 and 13 of the Texas\n\nConstitution. (Appellant’s Br. at 140).\n\n        In Issue 57, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme violates\n\nthe due process protections of the U.S. Constitution because it does not require the\n\nState to prove the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, contrary to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and its\n\nprogeny. (Appellant’s Br. at 140).\n\n        In Issue 58, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme violates\n\nhis rights against cruel and unusual punishment and to due process of law under\n\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by requiring at least ten “no” votes for the\n\njury to return a negative answer to a punishment special issue. (Appellant’s Br. at\n\n141).\n\n\n                                          184 \n \n\f        In Issue 59, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme violates\n\nhis rights against cruel and unusual punishment, to an impartial jury, and to due\n\nprocess of law under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments because\n\nvague, undefined terms in the punishment jury instructions effectively determine\n\nthe difference between a life or death sentence. (Appellant’s Br. at 142).\n\n        In Issue 60, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to hold Art. 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) unconstitutional because it fails to\n\nrequire the jury to consider all mitigating evidence. (Appellant’s Br. at 143).\n\n        In Issue 61, Appellant contends that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the State to prove\n\nthat aggravating evidence exists beyond a reasonable doubt. (Appellant’s Br. at\n\n141).\n\n        In Issue 62, Appellant claims that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.\n\nConstitution because it permits an open-ended discretion which was condemned by\n\nFurman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). (Appellant’s Br. at 144).\n\n        In Issue 63, Appellant contends that Texas’ statutory capital sentencing\n\nscheme is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because\n\nit lacks meaningful appellate review. (Appellant’s Br. at 144).\n\n\n\n\n                                         185 \n \n\f      In Issue 64, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to quash the indictment as being unconstitutional based on the numerous\n\nconstitutional defects of the Texas death penalty scheme. (Appellant’s Br. at 145).\n\n      In Issue 65, Appellant contends that the cumulative effect of these alleged\n\nconstitutional violations denied him due process of law in violation of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and due course of law under\n\nArticle I, § 19 of the Texas Constitution. (Appellant’s Br. at 147).\n\n      Appellant invites the Court to revisit its prior decisions on these issues,\n\nwhich he agrees have all been previously overruled. See Appellant’s Brief at 138;\n\nSaldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107-09 (overruling multiple challenges to death penalty\n\nstatute); Escamilla, 143 S.W.3d at 828-829 (overruling similar challenges).\n\nAppellant presents no new arguments for the State to address. Accordingly, the\n\nState asks this Court to decline his invitation to revisit these legal claims and to\n\noverrule issues 54 through 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                         186 \n \n\f                                      PR\n                                       RAYER\n \n\n       The\n       T State prays\n               p     that this Hono\n                                  orable Couurt will afffirm the juudgment off the\n\ntrial cou\n        urt.\n\n                                                      Respecctfully subm\n                                                                       mitted,\n\n\nCraig Watkins\n       W                                              Christiine Womb   ble\nCriminnal Districtt Attorney\n                           y                          Assistaant Districct Attorneyy\nDallas County,\n       C       Teexas                                 State B\n                                                            Bar No. 240035991\n                                                      Frank CCrowley Courts Buildding\n                                                      133 N.

See Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(h). The trial court sentenced Appellant to death on\n\nNovember 8, 2013 for the capital murder of Nancy Harris. Appellant filed his\n\nbrief on direct appeal on August 1, 2014. He filed an amended brief on August 21,\n\n2014. He presents sixty-five allegations of reversible error.\n\n                                                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n                                                                  Guilt/Innocence\n\n                                                                    The Offense\n\n              On May 20, 2012, 76-year-old great-grandmother Nancy Judith Harris went\n\nto her job as a clerk at the Fina Whip-In (hereinafter, “the Whip-In”) convenience\n\nstore. (RR44:23; RR46:10; SX#2, 25). At 7:071 a.m., Appellant entered the store\n\n\n\n                                                            \n1\n The surveillance video is time stamped 6:07 a.m. (RR44:49; SX#17). Anna Lunceford, the\nmanager of the Whip-In, testified that the time was off by one hour; at the time she had not\n                                                                         1 \n \n\fcarrying a lighter and a clear plastic bottle filled with lighter fluid. (RR44:50, 230;\n\nSX#17, 79, 83, 85). Once inside, Appellant walked straight to the sales counter,\n\nthen around and behind and into the area reserved for employees.                                                                                                      (RR44:43;\n\nSX#17).                  Nancy was standing behind the counter. (SX#17). She tried to push\n\nAppellant back. (SX#17). Appellant poured the contents of the plastic bottle over\n\nNancy’s head. (SX#17).\n\n              Appellant stood behind Nancy and watched as she tried to open the cash\n\nregister. (SX#17). He took two lighters from a display to the right of the register.\n\n(RR44:231; SX#17, 85).                                           Then, he took two packages of cigarettes from an\n\noverhead dispenser. (RR44:231; SX#17, 87, 88).                                                                              He tried to remove Nancy’s\n\nring from her right finger. (RR44:231; SX#17, 89, 90). The ring did not come\n\noff easily; Appellant licked his fingers to help slide it off. (RR44:232; SX#17, 90,\n\n91). Nancy finally got the register open2 and Appellant took all of the cash from\n\nthe cash tray. (RR44:232; SX#17, 96, 97). Then, he removed the cash tray out of\n\nthe drawer and took some of the coins. (SX#17).\n\n              Almost immediately after Appellant took the money from the register,\n\nflames are reflected on the screen above the cash register. (RR44:232; SX#17, 97).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nrealized she would have to manually change the time following the time change. (RR44:35, 49-\n50; SX#17).\n2\n Nancy opened the register for a no sale transaction at 7:10:54 a.m. (RR44:54, 128-29; SX#19,\n20). \n\n                                                                                              2 \n \n\fNancy, engulfed in flames from her shoulders up, ran out from behind the counter.\n\n(RR44:233; SX#17, 98). Appellant followed close behind. (RR44:233; SX#17).\n\nNancy ran to a nearby sink and leaned over to put out the flames. (SX#17).\n\nAppellant calmly walked out of the store with his bottle, stopping only to take a\n\nfew pieces of candy and stuff them in his pocket. (RR44:233-34; SX#17, 98, 99,\n\n100).\n\n        Nancy bent over the sink, trying to put out the flames consuming the upper\n\nportion of her body. (SX#17). She stopped to pull her shirt over her head and\n\ndropped it on the floor. (SX#17). As Nancy leaned back over the sink, her shirt,\n\nwhich was still burning on the floor, lit her left leg on fire. (SX#17). Unable to\n\nput out all of the flames, Nancy, still on fire, walked outside and waited for help.\n\n(SX#17).\n\n        On the morning of the offense, Garland Police Officers Billy Coffey and\n\nSimon were dispatched to “the 3300 block of Broadway at the Soulman’s Bar-B-\n\nQue and also at the plasma center.” (RR44:62, 64).        Police had received calls\n\nregarding an audible alarm. (RR44:62). When the officers arrived at the plasma\n\ncenter, they found the area secure. (RR44:64).     They got back into their squad\n\ncars and began to proceed to Soulman’s when Simon noticed flames across the\n\nstreet inside the Whip-In. (RR44:62, 65-66; SX#24).        Concerned, the officers\n\nmade their way to the Whip-In. (RR44:66). At that point, they had no idea what\n\n\n                                         3 \n \n\fwas on fire. (RR44:83). Coffey was at the red light, waiting to turn into the Whip-\n\nIn, when he saw “the flames move across the inside of the building.” (RR44:66).\n\nNow, it was an emergency situation. (RR44:84). Coffey turned on his lights and\n\nsirens and hurried into the parking lot. (RR44:66).\n\n              By the time the officers pulled into the parking lot, Nancy was standing\n\noutside. (RR44:84; SX#17). She was still on fire. (RR44:68; SX#17).                               Coffey\n\nretrieved a fire extinguisher from the trunk of his patrol vehicle, ran up, and\n\nextinguished the remaining flames.                             (RR44:68, 84-85; SX#17).      Nancy was\n\n“screaming for help.” (RR44:69). She told the officers that a man had robbed her\n\nand poured something on her. (RR44:69).                             She gave a description of the robber:\n\na “heavy-set black male with blue jeans . . . and a T-shirt.” (RR44:70).\n\n              Garland firefighter and paramedic William Crews was in the area on an\n\nunrelated call when a police officer flagged him down for help. (RR44:89, 92).\n\nCrews pulled up to the Whip-In in the ambulance and began to treat Nancy.\n\n(RR44:93). “She was in a lot of pain. She was very worried.” (RR44:93). She\n\nhad “first, second, and third degree burns to her face, her shoulders, her abdomen,\n\nboth of her upper arms, and to her - - her legs.” (RR44:93). Crews loaded Nancy\n\ninto the ambulance and left for the hospital.3                        (RR44:94).    At first, Nancy was\n\n\n                                                            \n3\n  Crews was familiar with Nancy. He had “made runs on her before” and was aware of her\ndiabetes, high blood pressure and the fact that she had a pacemaker. (RR44:94, 97, 102). He\nand his fellow firefighters also patronized the Whip-In. (RR44:94, 101-02).\n                                                               4 \n \n\fconscious and able to provide her name and history. (RR44:98). As they drove,\n\nher airway began to close and she had a harder time communicating. (RR44:98).\n\n      At the hospital, Nancy was still conscious and able to speak. (RR45:80-81).\n\nApril Gradel, a trauma nurse clinician in the burn unit, gave police a few minutes\n\nto speak with Nancy. (RR45:85, 172, 178; SX#143).           Nancy had “at minimum\n\nsecond to third-degree burns over her entire head, including her face, her neck, her\n\nupper torso, and both of her arms.” (RR45:174). Given the location of Nancy’s\n\nburns, Gradel knew that she was going to have to be intubated.           (RR45:175).\n\nGradel saw a police officer in the hallway and told him that if he was going to\n\nspeak with Nancy, it had to be immediately. (RR45:175).           Gradel was “quite\n\nconvinced it would be [Nancy’s last opportunity to speak].” (RR45:176). Nancy\n\ntold Officer Larry Wilson that “a man she described as a black male, heavy-set,\n\nshort dark hair, and a chubby face, came into the store and demanded money from\n\nher. She advised he took the money and then he poured something on her. She\n\ndidn’t know what - - what it was, and then he lit her on fire.” (RR45:82).\n\n      Dr. John Hunt was also involved in Nancy’s care in the Burn Unit.\n\n(RR46:5). Dr. Hunt testified when an individual is on fire, the mechanism of\n\ninjury is the heat. (RR46:7). “Heat destroys.” (RR46:7). Dr. Hunt described the\n\nthree types of burns:\n\n      The way I usually tell it to family is if the skin is an inch thick, a\n      sunburn is a first-degree burn, and let’s say hypothetically that’s 1/16th\n                                          5 \n \n\f      of an inch. So you’ve got, you know, 15/16ths of an inch left, and\n      that’s not injured and it heals very quickly. A third-degree burn goes\n      through that entire inch of skin. Now, the skin is not an inch thick,\n      but just vision [sic] it as it would be. When that inch of skin is\n      destroyed, that is a third-degree burn. By definition, it destroys any\n      potential for that area that’s third-degree to heal on its own. So a\n      second-degree is anyplace between that sunburn which is 1/16th and\n      that total inch, which is third-degree, in between. So potentially\n      second-degree burns will heal, depends on how deep they are and how\n      long it takes. But the skin elements are there in a second-degree burn,\n      and potentially it will heal. A third-degree, it will not.\n\n(RR46:8-9).    There is also a fourth-degree burn. (RR46:17). This type of burn\n\ndoes not stop at the underside of the skin; it goes all the way through the skin into\n\nthe fat. (RR46:17).\n\n      Dr. Hunt testified that Nancy had burns over 40% of her body. (RR46:10).\n\nThe burns to Nancy’s upper body and face were third and fourth-degree burns.\n\n(RR46:18; SX#146). The burns to her left arm and hand were second and third-\n\ndegree burns. (RR46; SX#147). The burns to her right shoulder and breast were\n\nthird and fourth-degree. (RR46:19; SX#148). The lower portion of her right arm\n\nand hand were second and third-degree burns. (RR46:19; SX#148). The burns to\n\nthe top of her head were third-degree. (RR46:19-20; SX#149).\n\n      Because Nancy’s injuries were to her face and neck, she was intubated and\n\nplaced on a ventilator. (RR46:11). Her face was swollen and her eyes were shut.\n\n(RR46:14). She was able, however, to nod her head and gesture with her hands.\n\n(RR46:14).\n\n\n                                         6 \n \n\f              Nancy’s treatment team determined that Nancy was not going to survive her\n\ninjuries and that treatment would be futile. (RR44:31; RR46:23).                 Prior to the\n\ninstant offense, Nancy executed a DNR, a do-not-resuscitate order.4 (RR44:30-31;\n\nSX#8).                 On May 25, 2012, given the severity and the extent of Nancy’s injuries\n\nand in accordance with her DNR, the decision was made to discontinue life\n\nsupport, and Nancy passed away. (RR46:23-24).\n\n              Dr. Tracy Dyer, a medical examiner with the Dallas County Medical\n\nExaminer’s Office, performed Nancy’s autopsy. (RR46:25, 29-30; SX#9, 151-59).\n\nDuring the autopsy, Dr. Dyer observed “significant serious burns that involved her\n\nentire head, chest, portions of the upper back, and portions of, I believe, it was the\n\nleft lower extremity or left thigh and leg.” (RR46:32). Her hands and palms were\n\ncompletely burned, destroying Nancy’s fingerprints. (RR46:32). On the back of\n\nher left hand, there were “some areas of skin slippage”; the thermal injuries caused\n\nloosening under the layers of Nancy’s skin, causing it to peel off. (RR46:36;\n\nSX#155, 156). Nancy’s right hand was more severely affected. (RR46:37). On\n\nthat hand, “the superficial layers of the skin are gone, and what you have is that\n\nreddened deep tissue in this case, underneath.” (RR46:37; SX#157). Dr. Dyer\n\nobserved skin slippage on Nancy’s left leg and thighs. (RR46:37; SX#158).\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n4\n    Nancy’s DNR is dated May 17, 2002. (SX#8).\n                                                               7 \n \n\f         Nancy’s injuries were consistent with flame burns. (RR46:38). Fire was a\n\ndeadly weapon in this case. (RR46:38). The cause of Nancy’s death was thermal\n\ninjury. (RR46:34, 39). The manner of her death was homicide. (RR46:39).\n\n                                  Appellant’s Capture\n\n         Shortly after police arrived at the Whip-In that morning, calls started coming\n\nin about a man hiding in the alleyways and between the homes in the neighborhood\n\ndirectly behind the store.        (RR44:70, 86). That person matched Nancy’s\n\ndescription. (RR44:70-71, 86). Officers set up a perimeter around the\n\nneighborhood behind the Whip-In. (RR44:71). Officer Rafael Perez participated\n\nin the search. (RR44:178).       In the alley behind Mt. Vernon Street, he noticed a\n\n“heavy-set black male, no shirt, with dark pants” matching the suspect’s\n\ndescription. (RR44:181-82). Perez identified Appellant as the man he saw in the\n\nalley.     (RR44:182-83).      When Appellant saw Perez, he took off running.\n\n(RR44:182-83). Perez lost sight of him briefly, but then he saw Appellant’s leg\n\nsticking out from under a bush. (RR44:184-85).           “He was laid back, kind of\n\nleaning against the wall with one leg out.” (RR44:185). Perez drew his weapon\n\nand instructed Appellant to come out from the bushes and get on the ground.\n\n(RR44:185-86). Coffey arrived and they placed Appellant in handcuffs.\n\n(RR44:186). Appellant asked the officers, “What took you so long[?] Y’all are\n\ngetting slow.” (RR44:186). Appellant was arrested and searched before he was\n\n\n                                            8 \n \n\fplaced in the squad car. (RR44:74). From Appellant’s pockets, Coffey collected a\n\nused lighter, a red lighter, a purple lighter, a gold ring, a car key, coins, and cash.\n\n(RR44:75-78; SX#6, 26, 28-30, 59, 60). Appellant did not appear intoxicated.\n\n(RR44:187).\n\n              Coffey transported Appellant to the police station.5 (RR44:74).        On the\n\ndrive to the station, Appellant tried repeatedly to engage Coffey in conversation.\n\n(RR44:80-81; SX#31). He asked, “What am I being booked for, man?” (SX#31,\n\n1:01). When Coffey advised Appellant was arrested for attempted capital murder,\n\nAppellant asked, “Attempted capital murder of who?”                 (SX#31, 11:38-1:39).\n\nAppellant continued to try to engage Coffey in conversation. (See SX#31). He\n\nasked if Coffey was a family man. (SX#31, 2:55). He asked whether Coffey was\n\nCoffey or Perez. (SX#31). Coffey did not respond to Appellant’s questions.\n\nAppellant stated, “I can tell you everything, man. I can tell you what you want to\n\nknow.” (SX#31, 3:32-3:36). A few minutes later, Appellant told Coffey that he\n\nhad been waiting for police. (SX#31, 6:25). He said that the police came “because\n\nI want[ed] you to.” (SX#31, 6:32). Coffey testified that during the transport,\n\nAppellant did not appear intoxicated. (RR44:79, 87). Appellant did not slur his\n\nspeech and he did not smell of alcohol. (RR44:79, 87). Appellant appeared “[to\n\nbe] coming down from [an] adrenaline rush, maybe fatigued.” (RR44:79-80).\n                                                            \n5\n  A video recording of the transport video was admitted into evidence as State’s Exhibit #31.\n(RR44:80-81).\n                                                               9 \n \n\f      Detective Stacy Tooke was the lead detective on the case. (RR44:213-14).\n\nTooke contacted Appellant at the jail after his arrest. (RR44:219). He requested\n\nand was granted consent to take a sample of Appellant’s DNA. (RR44:219-21;\n\nSX#103).     A forensic investigator collected Appellant’s DNA and took\n\nphotographs of Appellant’s person. (RR44:221). Tooke interviewed Appellant at\n\nthe jail. (RR44:237).\n\n      The jury heard testimony from three of the residents from the neighborhood\n\nbehind the Whip-In, where Appellant hid after the instant offense.   Jim Medley\n\nlives across the alley, behind the Whip-In. (RR44:142-43). On the morning of the\n\noffense, he was at home alone. (RR44:143-44). He heard his dog barking in the\n\nbackyard, so he went outside to investigate. (RR44:144). The gate to his rear-\n\nentry driveway was open. (RR44:144).         On his way back inside the house,\n\nMedley saw a “black man without a shirt, pushing a bicycle. That was about, oh,\n\ntwo houses away.” (RR44:148). At the time, it “seemed like a lot of commotion\n\nin the neighborhood.” (RR44:145).       Medley saw police cars and could hear\n\nsirens. (RR44:145). He noticed his garbage container had been moved and a pack\n\nof cigarettes in his driveway. (RR44:146; SX#48, 78). Medley is not a smoker.\n\n(RR44:146). He picked them up and put them in the garbage. (RR44:146, 151-\n\n53; SX#50). Inside the garbage can, he found a t-shirt. (RR44:147; SX#77).\n\n\n\n\n                                       10 \n \n\f              Ken Marecle was at home with his daughter on the morning of the offense.\n\n(RR44:155-56). At one point, Marecle’s daughter said a man was on their back\n\nporch and was heading for their front door. (RR44:156). Marecle cracked open\n\nthe front door.                             (RR44:157).           Appellant was standing on the front porch.\n\n(RR44:159, 166-67; SX#55).                                        Appellant’s “eyes were really wide and big.”\n\n(RR44:169). He did not smell of alcohol. (RR44:168-69). He was wearing pants\n\nand “military style black rim glasses” but he did not have a shirt on. (RR44:162).\n\nAppellant told Marecle he needed help. (RR44:157, 159). Then, he tried to force\n\nhis way into Marecle’s home. (RR44:159-60). Marecle used his shoulder to push\n\nAppellant outside into the courtyard. (RR44:160, 169). Appellant started fighting\n\nand flailing his arms.                                     (RR44:161, 169).    He pushed Marecle backwards.\n\n(RR44:162).                       Marecle fell and skinned his arms and knee.                 (RR44:162, 165;\n\nSX#56). When he stood up, Appellant took the glasses off of Marecle’s face and\n\nfled.6 (RR44:162-63, 170). Marecle and his daughter were later shown a lineup\n\nbut neither was able to identify the man they saw that morning. (RR44:210-11).\n\n              Lawrence Denson lives on Colonial, near the Whip-In. (RR45:7-8; SX#65).\n\nOn the morning of the offense, Denson was in his kitchen when he noticed\n\n“[Appellant], looked like he was trying to get inside my gate on the side of my\n\nhouse.”                 (RR45:9).                     Denson went outside to confront him.      (RR45:9, 11).\n                                                            \n6\n    The glasses were found several weeks later in the hedges by a neighbor. (RR44:165-66).\n\n\n                                                                       11 \n \n\fAppellant approached Denson “with his arms out, and said, man, I’m in a bad\n\nway.” (RR45:9, 11-12; SX#51-53).                                     Denson told him that “he needed to get his\n\nbad way out of my yard.” (RR45:12). A family friend staying at Denson’s home\n\ncame outside. (RR45:12-13). Appellant turned around and ran toward an alley.\n\n(RR45:13-15). Appellant did not appear to be intoxicated. (RR45:16). Denson\n\npicked Appellant out of a lineup. (RR44:210; RR45:18-19; SX#62-63).\n\n                                                               The Investigation\n\n              On the morning of the offense, Anna Lunceford, Nancy’s manager and\n\nfriend, was notified that the panic button had been activated at the Whip-In.\n\n(RR44:35, 38, 44; SX#25). When she arrived at the store, Nancy was not there.\n\n(RR44:44). The police asked Lunceford to retrieve the footage from the\n\nsurveillance cameras.7 (RR44:46). Lunceford rewound the DVR and played the\n\nsurveillance video for the police. (RR44:45-46; SX#15, 16, 17).\n\n              After she reviewed the surveillance video, Arson Investigator Nancy\n\nCarpenter instructed firefighters to look around for the bottle that Appellant was\n\ncarrying in the video. (RR44:110-11; RR45:48-49). Firefighter Gary Church went\n\noutside and walked toward the back of the building. (RR44:111, 113-14). He\n\nfound a drinking bottle on the ground in the grass. (RR44:111-12; SX#35, 36).\n\n\n                                                            \n7\n  Lunceford testified that the Whip-In is equipped with three surveillance cameras. (RR44:39-\n40; SX#10-12). The images from the cameras are recorded on a digital video recorder.\n(RR44:45).\n                                                                      12 \n \n\fInside the bottle was a paper towel, “down inside the bottle, kind of in the neck[.]”\n\n(RR45:49; SX#36). The bottle smelled of a petroleum-type product. (RR45:49).\n\nCarpenter collected the plastic bottle. (RR45:50-51; SX#36, 114, 115).\n\n      Inside the store, Carpenter pulled back the mat on the floor behind the sales\n\ncounter. (RR45:60).     Carpenter discovered a liquid pooled beneath and collected\n\na sample.     (RR45:60-62; SX#117, 118, 129). Carpenter transported all of the\n\nevidence she collected to the Armstrong Laboratory, a lab capable of testing\n\nevidence involved in an arson investigation. (RR45:69).\n\n      Dr. Kelly Wouters is a chemist with Armstrong Lab.             (RR45:106-07;\n\nSX#136). He testified to the results of the chemical testing. (RR45:110, 112, 113;\n\nSX#137, 138). Analysis of the contents of the plastic drinking bottle and Nancy’s\n\nclothing showed “a medium petroleum distillate of the primary recovery, and . . . a\n\nlower level of isopropyl alcohol.”       (RR45:113-14; SX#137).          A medium\n\npetroleum distillate is “the type of ignitable liquid that we encounter as charcoal\n\nstarter fluid or paint thinners - - we call it mineral spirits sometimes[.]”\n\n(RR45:114).      Isopropyl alcohol is rubbing alcohol.     (RR45:115).      Medium\n\npetroleum distillates and isopropyl alcohol are “immiscible”; they do not mix.\n\n(RR45:115).     The pooled liquid collected from under the mat behind the sales\n\ncounter contained medium petroleum distillate. (RR45:116). Appellant’s t-shirt,\n\npants, belt, left shoe and sock, and his right shoe also contained medium petroleum\n\n\n                                         13 \n \n\fdistillate.   (RR45:116-17; SX#138).    Neither the pooled liquid nor Appellant’s\n\nclothes and shoes contained isopropyl alcohol. (RR45:116-17). No ignitable\n\nliquids were detected on the swabs of Appellant’s hands. (RR45:116).\n\n       Dr. Wouters testified that the liquid contained in SX#60, the cigarette\n\nlighter, was “probably butane[,]” which is not a medium petroleum distillate.\n\n(RR45:118).       The same is true for the liquid contained in SX#59, the other\n\ncigarette lighter. (RR45:119).\n\n       The plastic drinking bottle was swabbed for a DNA sample.       (RR45:128-\n\n30; SX#160-164). Appellant’s DNA was found on the swab of the exterior of the\n\nplastic bottle.   (RR45:154; SX#142).         He was also included as a possible\n\ncontributor of a DNA profile from the interior and exterior opening of the bottle.\n\n(RR45:155; SX#142). Appellant was included as a possible contributor of a low\n\nlevel sample of DNA from the cash drawer. (RR45:156; SX#142).           The swab\n\nfrom the cash drawer was not a very strong match to Appellant. (RR45:160). A\n\npartial DNA profile from the cigarette package matched Appellant. (RR45:156;\n\nSX#142). No DNA profile was obtained from one of the swabs of the T-shirt, one\n\nof the stains from the counter, or the door handle. (RR45:150, 152; SX#142).\n\nAnother stain from the T-shirt was a match to Appellant. (RR45:150; SX#142).\n\nThere was also a profile of an unknown male and an unknown female obtained\n\nfrom that stain. (RR45:150; SX#142). Nancy Harris was excluded as a possible\n\n\n                                        14 \n \n\fcontributor to the unknown female profile. (RR45:153). A sample from a cutting\n\nof the t-shirt was also a match to Appellant. (RR45:153; SX#142). This sample\n\ncontained a profile of an unknown female and an unknown female as well.\n\n(RRR45:153-54).\n\n                                    Punishment\n\n                            The State’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      At punishment, the State presented evidence of Appellant’s criminal history\n\nand bad behavior while in prison:\n\n      In 1993, Appellant lived with Amy Armstrong Franks and three of her\n\nchildren.   (RR47:35-37). At the time, Appellant was Franks’ boyfriend.\n\n(RR47:36). He was 17 and she was 23. (RR47:38).           Appellant was good to\n\nFranks’ children, but over time, he and Franks started fighting. (RR47:37, 39).\n\nAppellant “put his hands on [Franks]” and would grab her and hit her. (RR47:40).\n\nFranks fought back. (RR47:40, 68).\n\n      On one occasion, after a fight, Franks left the apartment and went to a\n\nfriend’s apartment upstairs.   (RR47:41).     She left her two-year-old daughter\n\ndownstairs. (RR47:41). While Franks was gone, Appellant took Franks’ two-\n\nyear-old and left.   (RR47:41).     He eventually returned, and he and Franks\n\nreconciled. (RR47:42).\n\n\n\n\n                                        15 \n \n\f      The last straw for Franks was when, during yet another fight, Appellant hit\n\nFranks while she was holding her daughter. (RR47:42). Her daughter “caught the\n\nback part of his hand.” (RR47:42). When Appellant left, Franks locked him out\n\nand refused to let him back in her apartment. (RR47:42).      She called the police\n\nand told them what had happened. (RR47:44). Appellant returned after the police\n\nleft but Franks refused to let him in.         (RR47:45). She told him that their\n\nrelationship was over. (RR47:46). Appellant banged on the door and threatened\n\nto kick it in. (RR47:46). He threatened to beat her behind. (RR47:70, 75).\n\nFranks barricaded the door and blocked the windows with mattresses and a bunk\n\nbed. (RR47:46, 51).      She turned off the lights and waited in the hallway with a\n\ngun – Appellant’s gun. (RR47:47, 70). “And then [Appellant] went around and\n\nset my patio on fire.” (RR47:46). Appellant threw something onto the patio,\n\nsetting a rug on fire.    (RR47:49).   Franks saw the flames and went outside.\n\n(RR47:50). She shot at Appellant as he ran away. (RR47:50-51, 73). Then she\n\nput out the fire. (RR47:50-51).\n\n      On September 8, 1993, Dallas Police Officer Eric Hagen was dispatched to\n\nFranks’ apartment. (RR47:21). When he arrived, Franks was “extremely agitated\n\nand upset” but would not let Hagen inside. (RR47:22). Hagen walked around to\n\nthe back porch of the ground-floor apartment. (RR47:23, 26). He looked over the\n\n\n\n\n                                         16 \n \n\ffence and saw “a burned piece of wood and burned patio carpet.” (RR47:24). It\n\nappeared someone had tried to set the carpet on fire. (RR47:26).\n\n      On November 9, 1993, Garland Police Investigator Berry Oliver was on\n\nroutine patrol when he saw Appellant walking down the street smoking a joint.\n\n(RR47:101, 104–107).      When Appellant saw Oliver, he attempted to conceal the\n\njoint by “stick[ing] it down the back of his neck and then [he] immediately starts\n\ntrying to get into the trunk of the car[.]” (RR47:104-05). Oliver stopped Appellant\n\nand patted him down. (RR47:105). He found the joint “between [the] coat and\n\n[the] shirt [Appellant was wearing]” and he found a bag of marijuana inside a\n\ntowel that Appellant was carrying. (RR47:105, 107). Oliver arrested Appellant for\n\npossession of marijuana and an outstanding warrant. (RR47:105, 108). Appellant\n\npleaded guilty and received six months’ probation. (RR47:109-110; SX#167). His\n\nprobation was subsequently revoked and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\n\n(RR47:110; SX#167).\n\n\n      On July 23, 1994, while on patrol Garland Police Officer Blaine Ralston ran\n\na routine check of a license plate on a black four-door Cadillac to check for\n\noutstanding warrants. (RR47:116-17). There was an outstanding warrant on the\n\nvehicle, so Ralston attempted to initiate a traffic stop.       (RR47:117-18).      He\n\nactivated his red and blue lights, but the vehicle did not stop; it “just continue[d] to\n\nroll down the road.” (RR47:118). Ralston could see there were two people in the\n\n                                          17 \n \n\fvehicle. (RR47:118).     The female driver made eye contact via the rear view\n\nmirror. (RR47:118, 120). Ralston activated his siren but the vehicle still did not\n\nstop. (RR47:119).    The vehicle ran a stop sign. (RR47:119). Ralston could see\n\nthe male passenger motioning for the driver to ignore Ralston. (RR47:12021).\n\nThe vehicle “started to slow roll” at which point Appellant jumped out and ran\n\ntoward a house, ignoring commands to stop. (RR47:122–23).      Appellant tried but\n\nwas unable to open the front door of the house. (RR47:123).       Ralston and his\n\npartner apprehended him. (RR47:123–24). He told the officers “he had told [the\n\ndriver, his wife Daphne Johnson] to continue to go and not stop because he had\n\nwarrants for his arrest.” (RR47:125). Appellant was later convicted of evading\n\narrest and given one year of probation. (RR47:127-28; SX#168). His probation\n\nwas subsequently revoked and he was sentenced to 180 days in jail. (RR47:128;\n\nSX#168).\n\n\n      On August 7, 1995, Garland Neighborhood Police Officer M.G. Clark was\n\ndispatched to locate Appellant, who was wanted on an ongoing aggravated assault\n\nwith a deadly weapon call. (RR47:132-33). Throughout the night, Appellant had\n\nbeen making threatening phone calls and police had received a tip he was at a\n\nparticular location. (RR47:133-34). Clark located Appellant and arrested him for\n\noutstanding warrants and the aggravated assault case. (RR47:134-37). At the jail,\n\nAppellant threatened Clark so Clark filed a retaliation case against Appellant,\n\n                                       18 \n \n\fprimarily for record purposes. (RR47:138-40). Appellant was later convicted of\n\nthe aggravated assault and sentenced to ten years in prison, probated for five years.\n\n(RR47:140–41, 143; SX #169).       The complainant on the aggravated assault case\n\nwas Courtney Johnson. (RR47:143; SX#169).           The retaliation charge was no-\n\nbilled. (RR47:144).\n\n\n      On October 9, 2002, Garland Police Officers Clay Lacey and Gary\n\nSteadman responded to a hit-and-run call. (RR47:147, 155).         The person who\n\ncalled police was following the vehicle that was involved in the hit-and-run.\n\n(RR47:148, 155).      By the time Lacy arrived at the scene, “the person in the car\n\nwas getting out.” (RR47:148-49).       Lacy and Steadman searched the area and\n\neventually found and apprehended Appellant.            (RR47: 150–151, 155–57).\n\nAppellant repeatedly ignored Steadman’s commands to stop running and to get on\n\nthe ground. (RR47:157-58). Steadman eventually tackled Appellant and arrested\n\nhim for evading arrest.    (RR47:158-60). Appellant was later convicted of the\n\noffense and sentenced to 75 days in jail. (RR47:160-61; SX#170).\n\n\n      On June 14, 2004, Digna Salmeron was in her truck preparing to leave for\n\nwork when she heard a knock on the window. (RR47:182, 191). The man stated\n\nhe was sick and needed to use a phone to call an ambulance. (RR47:183). Scared,\n\nSalmeron told the man she did not have a phone. (RR47:183-84). The man “just\n\nwent at [her].” (RR47:184). He tried to force his way into the truck. (RR47:184–\n                                         19 \n \n\f85, 191). The man eventually wrested the keys away from Salmeron and threw her\n\ninto the yard. (RR47:186). He then started the truck and left. (RR47:186). He later\n\nwrecked Salmeron’s truck, rendering it inoperable. (RR47:188, 197). Salmeron\n\ncould not fully identify the person who did this to her, except that he was a big and\n\nstrong Black man. (RR47:189, 192-93).\n\n\n      Garland Police Officer Matthew St. Clair was dispatched as backup on the\n\ncall regarding the carjacking of Salmeron’s truck.    (RR47:165, 167).     When St.\n\nClair arrived in the area, Officer McClendon had already located the stolen vehicle\n\nand “was in the midst of a . . . high speed vehicle pursuit through some\n\nneighborhoods.” (RR47:166-67).        The driver – Appellant – “lost control and\n\nwrecked out and struck a wall, some parked cars in a driveway, and the corner of a\n\nhouse.” (RR47:168, 170). At that point, Appellant got out and attempted to flee\n\non foot.   (RR47:170). He was eventually taken into custody. (RR47:171-72).\n\nAppellant was subsequently convicted of robbery and sentenced to five years in\n\nprison and assessed a $1,500 fine.       (RR47:175-76; SX#171).        He was also\n\nconvicted of evading arrest, sentenced to a year in state jail, and assessed a $1,500\n\nfine. (RR47:175-76; SX#171).\n\n\n      On September 13, 2004, Garland Police Lieutenant John Spera responded to\n\n“a family disturbance” call.      (RR47:78-79). “[T]here was a suspect there\n\nattempting to kick the door in and that there was also a protective order on him.”\n                                         20 \n \n\f(RR47:79-80). The complainant was Daphne Johnson. (RR47:80). Daphne told\n\npolice that Appellant “had told her he was coming over to get some money and that\n\nhe would kick in the door if he had to.” (RR47:84).    Footprints were visible on\n\nthe door. (RR47:85). There were two children in the apartment at the time.\n\n(RR47:87). Appellant was subsequently convicted for violation of a protective\n\norder and sentenced to 330 days in jail. (RR47:97; SX#166).\n\n      The State also presented evidence of a theft committed by Appellant against\n\nhis former employer. David Contente owns Kwik Kar Oil and Wash in Mesquite.\n\n(RR48:157).   Appellant worked for him in December 2010, performing State\n\ninspections and helping out in the shop. (RR48:158-61). He later became a\n\ncashier. (RR48:161, 183). Appellant worked ten hours a day, five days a week.\n\n(RR48:180).   He was reliable and was given a set of keys to the business.\n\n(RR48:162, 164). Appellant did not handle conflict well, however. (RR48:163).\n\n“He was too rigid, in our rules, you know.” (RR48:163).\n\n      On November 14, 2011, Appellant called Contente at 5:00 in the morning.\n\n(RR48:163-64). Appellant “said I needed to come down to the store so he could\n\ntalk to me and that he had done a bad thing.” (RR48:164). Contente went to his\n\ncomputer and tried to access the surveillance cameras at the store, but the camera\n\nwas blacked out. (RR48:165, 166; SX#175-178). Contente “went to the police\n\ndepartment and asked a policeman to go down there with me.” (RR48:170). He\n\n\n                                       21 \n \n\f“thought the worst.” (RR48:171). The police accompanied him to the store.\n\n(RR48:171). There, Contente discovered that three state inspection booklets, $325\n\nin cash, and a monitor were missing. (RR48:172-73). The inspection booklets and\n\nthe cash were taken from the safe. (RR48:172-73). The booklets are valued at\n\n$2100. (RR48:172). Footage from surveillance camera showed Appellant in the\n\nstore earlier that morning and that Saturday night. (RR48:174; SX#173, 174).\n\nAppellant was arrested. (RR48:178). The monitor was returned but the inspection\n\nbooklets and the cash were not. (RR48:175, 178; SX#174).\n\n      On April 15, 2012, at 5:30 in the morning, Appellant was brought into the\n\nemergency room by Dallas police and paramedics. (RR48:190-91; SX#188).        He\n\nwas handcuffed, “highly agitated” and “somewhat combative.” (RR48:194). He\n\nwas in a substance-induced psychosis. (RR48:202-03). It took eight or nine\n\npeople to hold Appellant on the bed. (RR48:194). He had to be placed in a body\n\nnet, a four-point restraint that lays over the patient and attaches to the bed.\n\n(RR48:194-95).   The more the staff tried to hold Appellant down, the more\n\nagitated it made him. (RR48:195). Appellant made several statements: “I hope\n\nthey’re getting this on TV, God is watching all of this, XLT and divorce is a bad\n\nthing, and I’m going to grab your gun.”      (RR48:197).    Once Appellant was\n\nmedicated he calmed down. (RR48:198). He reported that he had being smoking\n\n\n\n\n                                       22 \n \n\fcrack cocaine, ice, and marijuana laced with PCP. (RR48:198). He did not report\n\nany mental health concerns. (RR48:199-200, 208).\n\n      Parker was not involved in his discharge, but per hospital protocol,\n\nAppellant would have been offered information and resources regarding drug\n\ntreatment. (RR48:200-01, 205, 208-09).\n\n      On the morning of April 26, 2012, Carina Pinzon was working as a\n\nhousekeeper at the Express Inn in Garland. (RR48:101). She was cleaning one of\n\nthe rooms and left the door propped open with her cart. (RR48:102). When she\n\nwas cleaning the bathroom, a man moved her cart and entered the room.\n\n(RR48:102-03).    Pinzon turned around when the man touched her shoulder.\n\n(RR48:103-04). He said something to her in English, but she did not understand\n\nhim. (RR48:103). She asked if he needed something. (RR48:103). At that point,\n\nshe noticed that the zipper on his pants was down. (RR48:104, 108). “[H]e had\n\nhis penis outside and that’s when I got scared.” (RR48:104). His penis was erect.\n\n(RR48:108).   He tried to grab her hand. (RR48:105). Pinzon threw a bucket of\n\nwater at him, pushed him and ran away. (RR48:105). She ran to the office and\n\nher manager called the police. (RR48:105-06).\n\n      Garland Police Officer Mark Mendoza was dispatched to the Express Inn.\n\n(RR48:117-18). There, he spoke with Pinzon and got a description of the suspect.\n\n(RR48:119). He then consulted with the manager to determine whether the suspect\n\n\n                                         23 \n \n\fwas a guest at the motel. (RR48:119). The manager gave him some names and\n\nMendoza went to those rooms. (RR48:120). Appellant was one of the possible\n\nsuspects.   (RR48:120). Mendoza recognized Appellant from a prior arrest.\n\n(RR48:120). Appellant allowed Mendoza into his motel room, which smelled of\n\nmarijuana. (RR48:121, 129). Mendoza noticed that Appellant’s clothes were wet.\n\n(RR48:121, 123).     Appellant told Mendoza that he had been smoking crack all\n\nnight, but he did not appear intoxicated. (RR48:121, 123, 130). Mendoza asked if\n\nAppellant had anything illegal in his room. (RR48:122). Appellant advised that he\n\n“probably had a crack pipe or something somewhere in the room.” (RR48:122).\n\nMendoza asked Appellant about the incident with Pinzon. (RR48:122). Appellant\n\ntold him that “he was just trying to drop off some towels to the room.”\n\n(RR48:122). Pinzon confirmed Appellant was the man who had exposed himself to\n\nher.   (RR48:124).   Appellant was not arrested, but he was issued a criminal\n\ntrespass warning and was ordered to leave the motel. (RR48:124-25).\n\n       Mendoza had previously arrested Appellant on May 31, 1994. Mendoza and\n\nhis partner, Officer Ehrman, were dispatched to the scene of a man and woman\n\nfighting on the side of the road. (RR48:111-12).      Upon arrival, the officers\n\nseparated Appellant and the woman and ran a check for outstanding warrants.\n\n(RR48:112). They seated Appellant in the patrol car. (RR48:113). When Officer\n\nMendoza opened the door to notify Appellant that he would be arrested on a\n\n\n                                       24 \n \n\fwarrant, Appellant “came charging out of the back [of the] squad car, like trying to\n\nget away, and we began wrestling with him.” (RR48:113). Appellant put up “a\n\npretty good struggle.” (RR48:114).     He bit Mendoza on the arm. (RR48:114).\n\nHe bit Ehrman. (RR48:114). He bit Ehrman so hard that he bit through the\n\nofficer’s watch. (RR48:114). Appellant later pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and\n\nwas sentenced to twelve months’ probation.         (RR48:115-16; SX#189).       His\n\nprobation was revoked and he was sentenced to 365 days in jail. (RR48:116;\n\nSX#189).\n\n      Carlton Jenkins was incarcerated with Appellant at the Rudd Unit for two\n\nmonths in 2005. (RR47:201, 203, 238). They were bunkmates. (RR47:202). At\n\nfirst, Appellant and Jenkins had “a decent relationship.” (RR47:205).       Jenkins\n\ntestified that Appellant “stopped going to work . . . [and] was confined to the\n\nhousing unit then.” (RR47:207).      Several times, Appellant was not able to buy\n\ngroceries at the commissary. (RR47:210). Jenkins shared some of his food with\n\nhim. (RR47:211).     The bunkmates’ relationship began to change. (RR47:214).\n\nJenkins saw Appellant sitting on the head of his bed, which is a sign of disrespect.\n\n(RR47:214).    Appellant’s “demeanor went south.” (RR47:215). Appellant “quit\n\nschool, too.” (RR47:216). He “was on confined housing.” (RR47:216). Jenkins\n\ntried to talk to Appellant but “It went bad.” (RR47:219).\n\n\n\n\n                                        25 \n \n\f      July 25, 2005 “was GI day.” (RR47:220). “[E]verybody cleans the dorm.”\n\n(RR47:220).     Afterwards, Appellant “was sitting on [Jenkins’] bunk.”\n\n(RR47:222). Jenkins told Appellant that they needed to talk because he wanted\n\nAppellant to stop disrespecting him. (RR47:223, 247). The men went to the back\n\nof the dorm. (RR47:223, 248). There, “[Appellant] assaulted [Jenkins].       He\n\nswung at [him].” (RR47:223). He hit Jenkins in the head. (RR47:224). The men\n\n“sort of grabbed each other[.]” (RR47:224). They separated when they thought a\n\nguard was approaching. (RR47:225). Then, they “went back and then [they]\n\nfought some more.” (RR47:225). Appellant grabbed Jenkins below his knees and\n\nflipped him, causing Jenkins’ head to his the concrete floor. (RR47:226, 233).\n\nJenkins “split [his] head open.” (RR47:227).     He was bleeding; “[t]here was\n\nblood everywhere.” (RR47:227-28).     Jenkins was transferred to another unit to\n\nreceive medical treatment. (RR47:230).      The injury to his head required nine\n\nstaples. (RR47:230–231; SX #172). Jenkins also suffered bruising from blows to\n\nhis face and head. (RR47:232). Appellant was sent to solitary confinement.\n\n(RR47:230).\n\n\n      Ashley Villegas worked for a year as a correctional officer with the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice (“TDCJ”) at the Price Daniel Unit in Snyder,\n\nTexas. (RR47:256-57). Villegas worked the overnight shift, from 9:00 p.m. to\n\n5:00 a.m., which required that every two hours she walk the unit and count the\n\n                                      26 \n \n\finmates. (RR47:260, 262).        On February 14, 2006, when she arrived at\n\nAppellant’s cell during her 1:00 a.m. count, she “noticed the offender having one\n\narm up on his door and the other arm on his penis masturbating and looking at me\n\nand smiling like with a grin, I guess as if he thought it was funny.” (RR47:263-\n\n64).   Appellant’s pants were down and his penis was visible.         (RR47:264).\n\nVillegas testified that Appellant was “known as . . . a high profile inmate so that\n\nmeans that all the officers knew who he was, but not in a good way, because they\n\nhad also written disciplinary reports on him, too.” (RR47:271).\n\n\n       Jennifer Pyburn is a detention officer at the Lew Sterrett Jail. (RR48:134).\n\nAt one time, Appellant was under her supervision. (RR48:137). One time when\n\nPyburn was escorting Appellant to a visit, he turned around “and he was like, I\n\nought to just pull you in here, which is like the visitation door.” (RR48:145).\n\nAppellant “didn’t say it in a mean - - mean way[.]” (RR48:145). He was smiling.\n\n(RR48:145). Appellant later apologized. (RR48:155).\n\n       On another occasion, Pyburn observed an interaction between Appellant and\n\nanother detention officer when Appellant was disrespectful. (RR48:147-48). The\n\nofficer told Appellant the shower he was supposed to be cleaning was not clean\n\nenough.    (RR48:147).    Appellant told her that was the way he cleaned it.\n\n(RR48:147-48). When Pyburn instructed Appellant how to clean the shower, he\n\ntold her that “we do not pay him enough to clean the shower.” (RR48:149).\n\n                                        27 \n \n\f      Pyburn testified that although it is against the rules, inmates tattoo\n\nthemselves while in jail.     (RR48:140-41).      The tattooing device is usually\n\nfashioned using staples or parts from a dismantled intercom and the ink is created\n\nusing colorful candy. (RR48:140-41).\n\n      Melodye Nelson, a 25-year veteran of TDCJ, testified as an expert on the\n\nprison system in Texas. (RR48:18). She is the senior warden of the female death\n\nrow located at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas. (RR48:19). She\n\npreviously served as a major at the male death row located at the Polunsky Unit in\n\nLivingston, Texas for over three years. (RR48:18-19). Nelson testified generally\n\nabout the types of facilities, number of inmates and guards statewide, and how\n\ninmates are classified within the system.\n\n      When an inmate arrives at TDCJ, he is sent to intake in order to determine\n\nhis custody level. (RR48:32).      Among the factors considered are the inmate’s\n\nhistory of incarceration and prior jail conduct, as well as the nature of his current\n\noffense and the length of his sentence. (RR48:31-32). General Population 1, or\n\n“G1,” are those offenders who are the lowest risk. (RR48:32, 34). A G1 may be a\n\ntrustee, which allows him or her to live and work outside of the facility’s perimeter\n\nfences. (RR48:34). General Population 2, or “G2,” is the largest percentage of\n\nthe general inmate population.      A G2 may live in a dormitory and work in\n\nmaintenance, food service or laundry. (RR48:41). General Population 3, or “G3,”\n\n\n                                            28 \n \n\fincludes inmates serving 50 years or more. (RR48:32). A G3 is not allowed into\n\npublic unrestrained and without armed supervision. (RR48:35). A G3 “cannot be\n\nassigned anywhere on a facility that they would have access to multiple areas, such\n\nas maintenance crews.” (RR48:41). G3s are permitted contact visits with their\n\nimmediate family. (RR48:58). General Population 4, or “G4,” are those inmates\n\nwho are disciplinary problems. (RR48:32). A G4’s movement and job assignment\n\nare very restricted. (RR48:42). General Population 5, or “G5,” are those inmates\n\nwho are disciplinary problems and exhibit assaultive behaviors. (RR48:32-33).\n\nFinally, administrative segregation is reserved for inmates with multiple\n\ndisciplinary incidents or gang affiliation or inmates who “have posed a threat - - a\n\ncontinuing threat to the safety and security of our institutions.” (RR48:44). The\n\ninmate’s initial classification is then referred to a State Classification Committee.\n\n(RR48:33). Based on that classification, the inmate will be assigned to a facility\n\nwithin TDCJ. (RR48:33). Once in that facility the Unit Classification Committee\n\nwill monitor and adjust the inmate’s custody level. (RR48:33).\n\n      An inmate convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without parole\n\nis classified as a G3 upon arrival at TDCJ. (RR48:48).           A capital murderer\n\nsentenced to life without parole will never receive a classification better than G3,\n\nalthough they may be classified as a G4 or G5 or placed in administrative\n\nsegregation. (RR48:48).\n\n\n                                         29 \n \n\f      With regard to death row inmates, there are three custody levels: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n(RR48:46). Nelson described them as follows:\n\n      Death Row 1 meaning no disciplinaries, not a behavior problem; 2\n      would be the same thing, had a major disciplinary case; and a Death\n      Row 3 would be assaultive death row, or assaultive disciplinary case.\n      And we keep them as a D3 30 days. We review them. If they haven’t\n      had another assaultive case, we move them up to a D2. A Death Row\n      2, Level 2 stays there 90 days. At the 90-day mark, we review them,\n      and if they haven’t had some continued disciplinary problems, we - -\n      we bump them back up to a Death Row Level 1, a D1.\n\n(RR48:46). All death row inmates are housed in one-man cells and most are\n\nallowed up to two hours of recreation per day. (RR48: 46, 77). They are allowed\n\ntwo hours of visitation once a week as well as a visit from a spiritual advisor.\n\n(RR48:77).\n\n      TDCJ maintains some records of inmates’ disciplinary infractions.\n\n(RR48:36). Records of minor infractions are not maintained; they are shredded.\n\n(RR48:36).    Minor infractions include:      being out-of-place; giving things to\n\nanother inmate; failing to obey a direct order; not going to school, etc. (RR48:38).\n\nOften, verbal confrontations between the inmate and a guard do not result in a\n\ndisciplinary case.   (RR48:38). Nelson testified death row inmates have been\n\ninvolved in assaults on other inmates, assaults on staff, sexual misconduct,\n\npossession of contraband, possession of weapons, possession of drugs, and\n\npossession of cell phones.     (RR48:47). For demonstrative purposes, Nelson\n\n\n\n                                        30 \n \n\fbrought some weapons she has confiscated from inmates over the years made from\n\nmaterials like cardboard, parts of a typewriter, screws, and pencils. (RR48:59-62).\n\n                                 Appellant’s Case\n\n      Appellant testified regarding his upbringing, drug use and the instant\n\noffense. He testified he has been using crack cocaine for “about 14 years[]” and\n\nhas experimented with alcohol and PCP.        (RR49:8).     He testified he began\n\nsmoking marijuana at seven years of age. (RR49:9). He bought it with his\n\nallowance money. (RR49:9).\n\n      Appellant testified he was released from prison in July 2009 and relapsed in\n\nOctober of 2011. (RR49:11). He started smoking crack and “ice.” (RR49:11).\n\nAt first, it was only on weekends. (RR49:12).        He was still paying his bills.\n\n(RR49:12). His relapse was “devastating.” (RR49:16). It made him lazy and he\n\nfell into a deep depression. (RR49:16). “I stayed home in the dark, you know, just\n\nwas embarrassed, ashamed.” (RR49:16).\n\n      On the night before the offense, Appellant went by himself to his brother\n\nAnthony’s wedding reception.       (RR49:19).     He stayed for about an hour.\n\n(RR49:24). Everybody was happy and having a good time, but Appellant felt like\n\nhe was in his own personal hell. (RR49:19-20). Because he had missed so much\n\nwork due to his drug use, Appellant had lost his job. (RR49:20).       He also felt\n\nashamed of his clothes and hair. (RR49:22).\n\n\n                                        31 \n \n\f         Appellant went home, ate dinner, then walked back to the party. (RR49:25-\n\n26).     He told his cousin that he messed up his car when he put gas mixed with\n\nwater in the tank. (RR49:26-28). The cousin gave him $30 and suggested how to\n\nfix it. (RR49:27-28). Appellant was drunk, so he used the money “to get high.”\n\n(RR49:28).      For the next several hours, Appellant “[c]ontinued to smoke, sell a\n\nlittle bit, smoke, sell a little bit, smoke.” (RR49:28).   He also had some Xanax to\n\nuse when it was time to return home to babysit his daughter. (RR49:29).\n\n         At about 6 o’clock in the morning, Appellant walked back to his brother’s\n\nhouse. (RR49:30). He found a bottle of wine on the patio and drank the whole\n\nthing.     (RR49:30).   He “wanted money.         I wanted to get high on crack.”\n\n(RR49:30). He saw a plastic water bottle. (RR49:30). He put lighter fluid in it.\n\n(RR49:30). He was “[j]ust going to take it and scare the person.” (RR49:30). He\n\nplanned to “[p]our it on her.” (RR49:30). It was going to be a “scare tactic.”\n\n(RR49:31). Although he did not remember having a lighter, he acknowledged he\n\nwould have had to have one to smoke crack. (RR49:32).\n\n         Appellant walked across the street to the Whip-In. (RR49:31). He wanted\n\nto get the money and leave. (RR49:32). He did not intend to set Nancy on fire.\n\n(RR49:31).      Appellant walked inside and “saw a lady.” (RR49:33). She was\n\ngetting the mop bucket ready. (RR49:33). Appellant walked behind the counter.\n\n(RR49:33). Nancy followed him and told him he was not supposed to be behind\n\n\n                                          32 \n \n\fthe counter. (RR49:33). When she got close to him “I just poured the fluid over\n\nher head. At that time I remember she was - - started trembling.” (RR49:33).\n\n      Appellant told Nancy to open the cash register because he wanted the\n\nmoney. (RR49:33).        While she was opening the register, he took a lighter and\n\nsome cigarettes.      (RR49:33).    He did not remember taking Nancy’s ring.\n\n(RR49:33-34).      Nancy opened the register and moved away.           (RR49:34).\n\nAppellant took the money. (RR49:34). He warned Nancy to stand back because\n\nhe had a lighter. (RR49:34). She moved toward him and he “flipped [the lighter]\n\nonce to try to scare her but that didn’t stop her.” (RR49:34). Nancy reached\n\nacross him again. (RR49:34). It “spooked” Appellant so he flicked the lighter\n\n“again, twice, hoping that she would move back.” (RR49:34).           That’s when\n\nNancy’s clothes ignited. (RR49:35). Appellant was not thinking. (RR49:35-36).\n\nHe was intoxicated; he had smoked nearly $100 worth of crack, consumed alcohol,\n\nand had taken a Xanax. (RR49:36). He did not think to help Nancy once she was\n\non fire. (RR49:36).\n\n      Appellant “knew [he] had [done] a bad thing, so [he] just - - [he] just ran.”\n\n(RR49:41). He ran and hid in some bushes and smoked a cigarette. (RR49:41).\n\nHe “got tired of laying in those bushes, so when [he] came out, that’s when [he]\n\nsaw the police car parked at the end of the street.” (RR49:40-41). Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                                        33 \n \n\fstarted running. (RR49:41).                                      When he tired of running, he sat on a porch and\n\nwaited for the police. (RR49:41).\n\n              Appellant remembered “tussling” with Marecle but did not remember his\n\nencounter with Denson.                                         (RR49:41). He remembered stealing a bicycle.\n\n(RR49:41-42).                           He testified he thought the ride to the police station was “very\n\nshort. It was like I just closed my eyes and opened my eyes and I was there.”\n\n(RR49:42).                      When he was in the patrol car, he did not understand what he had\n\ndone. (RR49:43).\n\n              Appellant’s testified that his parents were married. (RR49:46, 90). His\n\nmother worked during the day and his father worked at night. (RR49:46). They\n\ntook him to church and taught him right from wrong. (RR49:90). Appellant has\n\ntwo brothers, Anthony and Timothy. (RR49:47). Anthony went into the military.\n\n(RR49:47). Timothy “has been in prison half his life.” (RR49:47).\n\n              When Appellant was five years old, a cousin “put his penis in my mouth,\n\n[and] peed in my mouth.”8 (RR49:50). Appellant’s cousins and uncle laughed at\n\nhim. (RR49:50). When he was eight, the family friend he bought drugs from,\n\nfondled him.                        (RR49:48).                 “He pulled my penis out and wanted to suck it.”\n\n(RR49:48).                      Appellant “let him do it for a little while, but then [he] knew that\n\n\n                                                            \n8\n  Appellant testified he never said anything about childhood sexual abuse prior to counsel on the\ninstant offense. (RR49:91). He never mentioned it during previous incarcerations or when he\nwas hospitalized because he thought it “was irrelevant at the time.” (RR49:91).\n                                                                        34 \n \n\fwasn’t right.” (RR49:48). He told him to stop. (RR49:48). Appellant still bought\n\ndrugs from him. (RR49:48-49).       Appellant used the fondling incident “to hold\n\nover [the friend’s] head.” (RR49:49). Appellant threatened to tell about the abuse\n\nand the man “gave [him] what [he] wanted.” (RR49:49).\n\n      Appellant testified that when he dated Amy Armstrong they fought and\n\nargued. (RR49:53-54). He admitted that he hit Armstrong, but “I didn’t just hit\n\nher enough just to really hurt her, but just enough to make her stop hitting me[.]”\n\n(RR49:53). He testified he threw the burning log on her patio “to get her to come\n\noutside, get her to let me in. I had nowhere to go.” (RR49:54).\n\n      Appellant is married to Daphne Johnson.        They have three daughters.\n\nAppellant and Daphne started dating when he was fifteen years old and married\n\nwhen they were eighteen. (RR49:52, 55). Appellant admitted that he used to hit\n\nDaphne. (RR49:55). He never hit her “enough to just hurt her, just enough to back\n\nher off.” (RR49:57).\n\n      Appellant dropped out of school when he was in eleventh grade. (RR49:46).\n\nHe was never placed in special education classes, but he was in “basic classes.”\n\n(RR49:91).     He took courses in auto body technology at Richland College.\n\n(RR49:91). Appellant testified he “learn[s] at a slow pace[,]” but he does not have\n\na learning disability. (RR49:92).\n\n\n\n\n                                        35 \n \n\f      Appellant worked at a company called Sanden for about five years, from\n\n1997 until 2002. (RR49:58). He started on the assembly line, but was promoted\n\nfour times, all the way to repairman. (RR49:59). He was eventually fired because\n\nhe missed too many days of work. (RR49:58-59).        At the time, he was using\n\ndrugs on the weekends and “it carried on until the Mondays and Tuesdays[.]”\n\n(RR49:59).   After he was fired, Appellant checked himself into Green Oaks\n\nHospital to be treated for drug abuse. (RR49:59).   He was there for a week and\n\nwas diagnosed with depression. (RR49:60).      After Green Oaks, he was sent to\n\nSummer Sky in Stephenville for further inpatient treatment.           (RR49:60).\n\nAppellant spent 35 days at Summer Sky. (RR49:60). He “wasn’t ready [to leave],\n\nbut [his] insurance ran out.” (RR49:61). He spent a week in a halfway house, then\n\nreturned home to his wife. (RR49:61). Upon his return home, he stayed sober for\n\na few weeks, then went back to using crack and marijuana and drinking alcohol.\n\n(RR49:61-62).\n\n      Appellant testified he was “under the influence[]” when he stole Salmeron’s\n\ntruck and “coming down off of [drugs]” during the theft of the Kwik Kar’s money\n\nand inspection books. (RR49:62, 75). Appellant testified he did not remember the\n\nincident with Pinzon. (RR49:118). Every time he has been in trouble, it was\n\nbecause of the drugs and depression. (RR49:99-100). He was depressed “because\n\nI couldn’t do more for my family and myself.” (RR49:99). He testified the first\n\n\n                                       36 \n \n\ftime he spoke with Daphne after the instant offense, he “couldn’t remember what\n\n[he] had done.” (RR49:80). Appellant confirmed his criminal history:\n\n       September 15, 1991: At 15, Appellant was arrested driving a stolen car.\n        (RR49:100).\n\n       February 4, 1992:     He was arrested for pushing a police officer.\n        (RR49:100).\n\n       December 9, 1992: He was arrested for theft. (RR49:100).\n\n       August 13, 1993:        He was arrested for assaulting Armstrong.\n        (RR49:100-01).\n\n       September 8, 1993: He was arrested after he threw the burning object\n        onto Armstrong’s patio. (RR49:101).\n\n       September 9, 1993: He was arrested for possession of marijuana.\n        (RR49:102). This is the only drug charge Appellant has ever had.\n        (RR49:102).\n\n       February 8, 1994: Appellant was arrested for outstanding warrants.\n        (RR49:102).\n\n       April 16, 1994: He was arrested for an outstanding warrant on the\n        marijuana charge. (RR49:102).\n\n       May 31, 1994: He was arrested for assault warrants. (RR49:103). This\n        is when he bit Officers Mendoza and Ehrman. (RR49:103).\n\n       July 23, 1994: Appellant directed Daphne not to stop the car when the\n        police were trying to pull her over. (RR49:103).\n\n       August 7, 1995: He was arrested for aggravated assault against Daphne’s\n        sister, Courtney Johnson. (RR49:104).\n\n       June 9, 2002: He was issued a Class C assault citation for hitting\n        Daphne. (RR49:105).\n\n                                      37 \n \n\f       October 9, 2002: He was arrested for evading arrest. (RR49:105).\n\n       November 15, 2002: He was arrested for assaulting Daphne.\n        (RR49:105).\n\n       July 3, 2003: Appellant did not remember walking up and hitting Daphne\n        as she sat in the drive though at Braum’s. (RR49:106). But, he did not\n        deny that the incident happened. (RR49:47).\n\n       September 7, 2003: He was arrested for assaulting Daphne. (RR49:107).\n\n       January 5, 2004: He was arrested for theft. (RR49:107)\n\n       June 19, 2004: He was arrested for robbing Salmeron. (RR49:107).\n\n       September 13, 2004:            He violated Daphne’s protective order.\n        (RR49:108).\n\n      Appellant testified the reason he set Nancy on fire was because she was\n\ncoming at him. (RR49:120). Appellant acknowledged that when he was arrested,\n\nhe only told police that he had consumed cocaine and two beers prior to the\n\noffense.      (RR49:120).   He did not mention the bottle of wine or the Xanax.\n\n(RR49:120). “It was irrelevant. I was intoxicated.” (RR49:120).\n\n      Photographs of Appellant’s tattoos were admitted into evidence.\n\n(RR49:130-33; SX#179-186). Appellant testified he got several of them while he\n\nwas in prison.       He acknowledged that he was never caught for those rule\n\nviolations.     (RR49:132). Recently, while incarcerated for the instant offense,\n\n\n\n\n                                         38 \n \n\fAppellant had “Gift from God” tattooed around his collarbone. (RR49:132, 133).\n\nHe did not get caught for this rule violation. (RR49:132).\n\n        Appellant’s supervisor from Sanden testified that Appellant was a good\n\nworker. (RR49:137-38, 141). His only problem was his attendance. (RR49:142).\n\nSeveral co-workers testified Appellant was polite and friendly. (RR49:149-50,\n\n157, 162). They testified this offense was out-of-character. (RR49:153, 158-59,\n\n166).\n\n        Daphne Johnson testified she is Appellant’s wife. (RR49:184). She testified\n\nwhen they married, they were immature. (RR49:186). They struggled financially,\n\nthey did not communicate well, and their arguments got physical. (RR49:186).\n\nThey hit each other. (RR49:217). Daphne did not remember reporting to police\n\nthat Appellant had made threatening phone calls. (RR49:219).          She did not\n\nremember her sister filing an aggravated assault charge against Appellant.\n\n(RR49:220).\n\n        In an application for protective order, Daphne alleged that on December 9,\n\n2003, Appellant “became angry and punched [her] in the face.”          (RR49:223;\n\nSX#193). She also wrote that Appellant “very frequently” did the following:\n\ncalled her names and criticized her; tried to keep her from doing something; going\n\nout with friends; gave her angry looks or stares; prevented her from having money\n\nfor her own use; threatened to hit or throw something at her; pushed, grabbed, or\n\n\n                                         39 \n \n\fshoved her; put down her family or friends; and, slapped, hit or punched her.\n\n(RR49:222; SX#193). In the affidavit, Daphne also detailed Appellant’s prior\n\nassaults.   (RR49:223-24; SX#193).      In November of 2003, Daphne locked\n\nAppellant out when he came home very late. (RR49:224). He beat and banged on\n\nthe door.     (RR49:224).   When Daphne finally let him in, he pushed her.\n\n(RR49:224). In October of 2003, Daphne again locked the door when Appellant\n\nwent out. (RR49:224). Appellant kicked in the door and punched her in the face\n\nand chest. (RR49:224). She suffered a black eye, scratches on her face and neck,\n\nand soreness and pain. (RR49:224). She was unable to work for two weeks.\n\n(RR49:224). Daphne wrote:\n\n      Over the last nine years, Matthew has been physically violent and\n      abusive to me. He has hit me, punched me, slapped me, kicked me\n      once, strangled me, pushed and shoved me, and thrown me around.\n      I’ve had bruises, black eyes, a bloody nose, a busted lip, scratches;\n      soreness, swelling and pain.\n\n(SX#193).\n\n      Daphne first became aware of Appellant’s drug use after his grandmother\n\ndied. (RR49:187). He “would go off on binges” and disappear for a day or two.\n\n(RR49:188).     Appellant would get physical with Daphne when he was high.\n\n(RR49:198). Daphne kicked him out of the house four to six times. (RR49:190).\n\nShe tried to talk to him about his drug use. (RR49:195). He tried to stop using on\n\nhis own. (RR49:195). Appellant also suffers from depression. (RR49:209). The\n\n\n                                       40 \n \n\fdepression became more frequent after the Kwik Kar incident. (RR49:210). In\n\nDaphne’s opinion, Appellant was high at the time of the offense. (RR49:243). She\n\ntestified that Appellant “was an awesome father” to their three daughters.\n\n(RR49:192).\n\n      Pharmacologist Dr. John Roache testified as an expert regarding illegal\n\ndrugs and addiction. (RR50:27). Roache testified addiction is “a learning process\n\nthat happens with repeated use of drugs of abuse.” (RR50:30-31).\n\n      Cocaine is a stimulant. (RR50:33). It increases wakefulness and vigilance\n\nand produces feelings of intense euphoria and motivation. (RR50:34). Marijuana\n\nis a plant and a mild hallucinogen. (RR50:34). Phencyclidine or, PCP, is a\n\nhallucinogen. (RR50:35). A user feels “superhuman empowered.” (RR50:35). It\n\ncan also produce “psychotic like effects, where you can have hallucinations,\n\nparanoia, and extreme agitation.” (RR50:35).      Methamphetamine or “ice,” is a\n\nstimulant, which produces effects similar to cocaine. (RR50:35).       Xanax is a\n\nbenzodiazepine. (RR50:36). It is a sedative and used to treat anxiety. (RR50:36).\n\n      Commonly, an addict will use multiple chemical substances. (RR50:37).\n\nThis is referred to as poly-substance dependence or poly-substance abuse.\n\n(RR50:37). When an individual is under the influence, he may be more impulsive.\n\n(RR50:37). “[T]he addict becomes more driven for the immediate consequences\n\nof the drug experience and less thoughtful or conscientious or cognitively decisive\n\n\n                                        41 \n \n\fabout longer term consequences.” (RR50:37-38). Often, addicts have relapses\n\nafter periods of sobriety. (RR50:43).\n\n      Roache conceded that when Appellant checked himself into the hospital in\n\n2002, he was depressed because he was unable to quit using drugs. (RR50:44).\n\nIndeed, the discharge instructions indicate “The patient was profoundly depressed\n\nbecause of his inability to stop doing drugs, and having observed his many losses,\n\nincluding job, family, financial, and clearly self esteem.” (RR50:53; DX#22).\n\nRoache conceded that while incarcerated prior to trial, Appellant was not\n\ndiagnosed with depression, but with poly-substance abuse and substance-induced\n\nmood disorder. (RR50:45).\n\n      Although Roache did not review the surveillance video of this offense, he\n\nopined Appellant was intoxicated at the time he committed the offense.\n\n(RR50:45). Roache did not think it was “necessary[]” to review the surveillance\n\nvideo. (RR50:45-46).\n\n      Frank AuBuchon testified as an expert on the Texas prison system. He\n\ndescribed the various classification levels and the types of housing available.\n\n(RR50:146-47, 151, 158, 160-61). AuBuchon reviewed Appellant’s entire\n\nclassification file, records of Appellant’s incarceration at the Dallas County Jail, a\n\nsummary of Appellant’s extraneous offenses, and a summary of the instant offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                         42 \n \n\f(RR50:145-46). AuBuchon testified Appellant will go into TDCJ as a G3 and will\n\nbe placed in a high security unit. (RR50:157).\n\n              Dr. Jonathan Sorensen testified that he conducted an actuarial analysis to\n\ndetermine the probability that Appellant will be violent in prison. (RR51:22, 27;\n\nDX#25). Sorensen opined that Appellant “will fare better than the average\n\nincoming capital offender.” (RR51:30; DX#26). The factors that decreased\n\nAppellant’s risk of violence include: his age; his educational level; a lack of a\n\ndisruptive group or gang affiliation; his prior prison behavior and classification\n\nlevel; and, the fact that he would be serving life without the possibility of parole.\n\n(RR51:30-31, 38, 42, 44). The factors that increased Appellant’s level of risk\n\ninclude: his prior incarceration; his prior assaults while incarcerated; and, the fact\n\nthat his capital murder involved a contemporaneous robbery. (RR51:45-46, 20-\n\n51).\n\n              James Aiken, a prison consultant who has never worked in a Texas prison,\n\ntestified that Appellant “fares low on the factors of providing unusual risk to staff,\n\ninmates, or the general public.” (RR51:58, 60, 61; DX#27).\n\n              Appellant’s older brother Timothy9 testified about their family and their\n\nhistory of drug use.                                  All three brothers used drugs. (RR50:74). Timothy was\n\naware that Appellant used drugs at a young age. (RR50:73). Twice, he took away\n                                                            \n9\n At the time of trial, Timothy was serving a 40-year sentence for a 2004 conviction for theft of a\nperson and assault on a public servant. (RR50:67).\n                                                                     43 \n \n\fAppellant’s marijuana. (RR50:75). Then, Timothy went to prison when Appellant\n\nwas 15 years old and was gone for eleven years. (RR50:85). Timothy returned\n\nhome for a couple of years, then went back to prison on two 40-year sentences.\n\n(RR50:85).\n\n      Timothy was present during one fight between Appellant and Daphne.\n\n(RR50: 80-81). Appellant tried to slap Daphne. (RR50:81). Timothy intervened\n\nand he and Appellant “had a fight - - a tussle.” (RR50:81). In Timothy’s opinion,\n\nAppellant was intoxicated at the time because “he was big and I’m smaller and I\n\nhandled him - - I mean, real easy.” (RR50:82).\n\n      Appellant’s mother-in-law, Hazel Johnson, testified that Appellant is a good\n\nperson and a good father. (RR50:88, 90, 92). In the month before the offense,\n\nAppellant was stressed and depressed. (RR50:93-94).       Daphne’s aunt, Frances\n\nWilson, testified she learned that Appellant had a drug problem about five years\n\nafter he and Daphne were married. (RR50:100). She started talking to him about\n\nit in 2011. (RR50:101-02). Appellant was depressed and Wilson worried that he\n\nwould harm himself. (RR50:103). Wilson was not aware of any physical abuse\n\nbetween Appellant and Daphne. (RR50:100). Daphne’s sister Courtney Johnson\n\ntestified Appellant and Daphne’s relationship was “a normal relationship, just like\n\nany other married couple would have.” (RR50:111-12). She never saw Appellant\n\nphysically abuse Daphne, but she would “hear stuff from [her] sister.”\n\n\n                                        44 \n \n\f(RR50:112). Courtney was aware of Appellant’s drug problem and has seen him\n\nunder the influence. (RR50:113).      She did not recall the incident on August 7,\n\n1995 when Garland police were called to her apartment. (RR50:126-27). She did\n\nnot recall telling police that Appellant pointed a gun at her. (RR50:128). She did\n\nnot recall trying to drop charges with the district attorney’s office. (RR50:128).\n\nShe has no recollection of the fact that Appellant pleaded guilty to that offense and\n\nserved out a probation. (RR50:126-27).\n\n        A week before this instant offense, Courtney went with Appellant to the\n\nGarland Police Station when he asked them to “lock him up” because he was on\n\ndrugs and wanted to avoid getting into trouble. (RR50:123). Without any active\n\nwarrants, the police did not arrest him. (RR50:124).\n\n        Valerie Braziel is Appellant’s daughter Matduxx’s godmother. (RR50:166,\n\n169).    They met in 2009 after Appellant’s release from prison. (RR50:169-70).\n\nSince that time, they have become friends. (RR50:170). In the time leading up to\n\nthis offense, Appellant was withdrawn and Braziel felt as though he was depressed.\n\n(RR50:174). Braziel had no idea that he was a drug addict. (RR50:174). She was\n\nnot aware of any domestic violence between Appellant and Daphne. (RR50:173).\n\n                           The State’s Case-in-Rebuttal\n\n        Nurse Kelly Nelson treated Nancy in the Burn Intensive Care Unit at\n\nParkland Hospital. (RR51:71-73). Nancy was in pain. (RR51:74). She was\n\n\n                                         45 \n \n\funable to speak because she had a breathing tube.              (RR51:74).   Nelson\n\ncommunicated with Nancy using non-verbal pain scales “based on how the patient\n\nis acting or like body language, emotion.” (RR51:74). Nelson was able to ask\n\nNancy “yes” or “no” questions and Nancy responded using hand signals and nods.\n\n(RR51:74-75).     On May 23, Nancy was “in critical condition.”         (RR51:75).\n\nNancy was concerned about her prognosis.          (RR51:75).     “She attempted to\n\ncommunicate to me by using her finger and writing in the air, and she spelled out\n\nthe word die, d-i-e. I clarified that that’s what she had spelled out to me, and she\n\nnodded, yes. . . . She nodded yes to the question, are you wondering if you are\n\ngoing to die.” (RR51:75). When Nelson explained all of the “interventions” that\n\nthe medical team was performing, Nancy “was shaking her head no.” (RR51:76).\n\nNancy “didn’t want all the interventions that we were providing for her.”\n\n(RR51:76).\n\n      The State published the recording from Officer Coffey’s dashboard camera.\n\n(RR51:81; SX#187). On the video, when the officers pull up to the Whip-In,\n\nNancy is standing outside. (SX#187). She is still on fire. (SX#187).     She can be\n\nheard screaming and pleading for help. (SX#187).\n\n      Nancy’s daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Harris, testified briefly regarding the\n\neffect of Nancy’s death on the family. (RR51:82). Elizabeth is married to Chris\n\nHarris, Nancy’s youngest son. (RR51:82). She was very close to Nancy. (RR51:\n\n\n                                        46 \n \n\f84).   Elizabeth and Chris have three daughters, Lorelei, Hanna, and Olivia.\n\n(RR51:84). Every Friday Nancy would pick up the girls from school and have a\n\n“Mimi day[.]” (RR51:84). Nancy was an “amazing” grandmother. (RR51:85).\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Issue Nos. 1-7:      The trial court properly denied Appellant’s Batson\n\nchallenges to the State’s exercise of peremptory challenges against seven minority\n\nveniremembers. Appellant has not met his burden to show that the State’s strikes\n\nwere the product of racial discrimination.\n\n       Issue Nos. 8-19: The trial court properly granted the State’s challenges for\n\ncause against 4 prospective jurors. These jurors possessed biases against the law\n\nthe State was entitled to rely upon.      Appellant has failed to show that he was\n\ndeprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n       Issue Nos. 20-27: The trial court properly denied Appellant’s challenges for\n\ncause against 8 prospective jurors. All of the denials were proper and Appellant\n\nhas failed to show that he was denied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory\n\nchallenge.\n\n       Issue Nos. 28-30: The trial court properly granted the State’s challenges for\n\ncause against 3 prospective jurors. These jurors possessed biases against the law\n\nthe State was entitled to rely upon.      Appellant has failed to show that he was\n\ndeprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n\n                                           47 \n \n\f      Issue Nos. 31-32: Appellant’s argument that he was deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury lacks merit. Appellant has failed to prove that any of the trial\n\ncourt’s rulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was\n\nbiased or prejudiced.\n\n      Issue No. 33: The evidence is sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction\n\nfor capital murder. Contrary to the assertions in his brief, the record is replete with\n\nevidence showing his specific intent to kill Nancy Harris. Further, the evidence\n\nalso shows that the murder took place during the course of committing or\n\nattempting to commit robbery.\n\n      Issue No. 34-35: The trial court properly admitted the surveillance video of\n\nthe instant offense as well as the still photographs from that video. While the\n\nvideo is graphic, it simply depicts the reality of Appellant’s crime. The probative\n\nvalue of this evidence was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\n      Issue Nos. 36-37: The trial court properly admitted the photographs of\n\nNancy at autopsy and at the hospital prior to her death. The photographs helped\n\nthe medical examiner and her physician in their testimonies, and they depict\n\nnothing more than the reality of Appellant’s brutal crime.\n\n      Issue Nos. 38-40: The trial court properly admitted evidence of statements\n\nNancy made prior to her death. These statements were admissible as excited\n\nutterances and/or dying declarations. Alternatively, any error is harmless.\n\n\n                                          48 \n \n\f      Issue No. 41: The trial court properly admitted evidence of Appellant’s\n\nactions after he fled the Whip-In.        This evidence was admissible as same-\n\ntransaction contextual evidence. Alternatively, any error is harmless.\n\n      Issue No. 42: The trial court properly instructed the jury regarding voluntary\n\nintoxication. Appellant’s cross-examination may have led the jury to believe his\n\nactions were excused by his intoxication.\n\n      Issue Nos. 43-44: The trial court properly admitted during the punishment\n\nphase, evidence of Appellant’s extraneous conduct with former girlfriend, Amy\n\nFranks. There is no evidence that the State acted in bad faith and Appellant has\n\nfailed to show that he was surprised or that his defensive strategy would have\n\nchanged in any way.\n\n      Issue Nos. 45-48: The trial court properly admitted during the punishment\n\nphase, evidence of Appellant’s prior convictions. The State presented evidence\n\ntying Appellant to each of the complained-of exhibits.\n\n      Issue No. 49: The trial court properly admitted the expert testimony of\n\nWarden Melodye Nelson as her testimony was relevant and helpful to the jury in\n\ndeciding the first special issue. Alternatively, any error is harmless.\n\n      Issue No. 50: The evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nanswer to the future dangerousness special issue.        Based upon the facts of the\n\ninstant offense, as well as the evidence of Appellant’s past acts of crime and\n\n\n                                          49 \n \n\fviolence, a rational jury could find that Appellant would constitute a continuing\n\nthreat to society.\n\n      Issue Nos. 51-53: Appellant’s arguments regarding the punishment charge\n\nare inadequately briefed and multifarious. Regardless, the trial court properly\n\ndenied his requested instructions and properly overruled his objections to the\n\ncharge.\n\n      Issue Nos. 54-65: Appellant’s admittedly meritless federal constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Texas death penalty statute are presented only to preserve the\n\ncomplaints for federal habeas review. And while Appellant invites this Court to\n\nrevisit its prior holdings against his position, he provides no new authority for this\n\nCourt or the State to address.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 1 THROUGH 7:        THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nDENYING APPELLANT’S BATSON CHALLENGES.\n\n      In Issues 1 through 7, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his objection based on Batson v.

The\n\nultimate plausibility of that race-neutral explanation is to be considered as part of\n\nthe third step of the analysis, in which the trial court determines whether the\n\nopponent of the strike (usually the defendant) has satisfied his burden of\n\npersuasion to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the strike was\n\nindeed the product of the proponent’s racial discrimination.

Id.\n\n       This Court should not overturn the trial court’s resolution of the Batson issue\n\nunless it determines that the trial court’s ruling was clearly erroneous.         See\n\nWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447-48. In assaying the record for clear error, vel non, this\n\nCourt should consider the entire record of voir dire; it need not limit itself to\n\narguments or considerations that the parties specifically called to the trial court’s\n\nattention so long as those arguments or considerations are manifestly grounded in\n\nthe appellate record. Id. at 448. But this Court should examine a trial court’s\n\nconclusion that a facially race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge is\n\ngenuine, rather than a pretext, with great deference, reversing only when that\n\nconclusion is, in view of the record as a whole, erroneous. Id.\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n     I.   Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, but\n          the issue is moot.\n\n       After the parties exercised their peremptory strikes, Appellant asserted that\n\nhe “would have Batson objections to some of the State’s strikes.” (RR43:19).\n\nAppellant identified seven African-Americans veniremembers that the State struck.\n\n(RR43:19-20). The State argued that Appellant failed to establish a prima facie\n\ncase. (RR43:20).       Without ruling on the State’s objection, the trial court stated\n\nthat it “would prefer that the State explain their strikes.” (RR43:20). The State did\n                                             52 \n \n\fnot object to the trial court’s failure to rule. Consequently, this Court must assume\n\nthat Appellant satisfied his step-one obligation to make a prima facie case of\n\npurposeful discrimination and address only the second and third steps.

Question No. 2 on the questionnaire asked: “With reference to the\n\ndeath penalty, which of the following statements best represents your feelings?”\n\n(RR4-RR34; RR36-RR42; Q. p. 1).           A ranking of “3” indicates the following\n\nopinion: “Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed,\n\nas long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of\n\n\n                                          53 \n \n\fcircumstances.” (RR4-RR34; RR36-RR42; Q. p. 1).                      The State explained that it\n\nstruck every person on the qualified-juror panel that selected number “3,”\n\nincluding Sheppard Brown (Juror 2A, an African-American male), Percy Phillips10\n\n(Juror 60A, an African-American male), Telli White (Juror 329A, an African-\n\nAmerican female), Dionne Hashaway (Juror 911A, an African-American female),\n\nand Christylynn Kyles (Juror 1133A, an African-American female), Christina\n\nMoore (Juror 271A, a Caucasian female), Laura Luna (Juror 340A, a Caucasian\n\nfemale), Ronald Drake (Juror 759A, a Caucasian male), and Scot McComas (Juror\n\n1331A, a Caucasian male).

(RR43:21; Matlock, Juror 1500A, Q. p.1).\n\n              The State’s reason was grounded in these jurors’ opinion about the death\n\npenalty and is race-neutral.

(RR43:20). Indeed, during individual voir dire, the State challenged\n\nWilson for cause because Wilson vacillated on Special Issue No. One. (RR8:225-\n\n26).   The State questioned Wilson at length on this issue. (RR8:205-09).     She\n\ntestified that she could never answer Special Issue No. 1 “yes” because she\n\nbelieves there is no way to predict an individual’s future actions. (RR8:205-09).\n\nWhen questioned by the defense, Wilson initially repeated her earlier position,\n\n\n                                       55 \n \n\fstating “I can’t see what you can really show to me [to prove] what the future is\n\ngoing to hold.

The State’s challenge for cause was denied. (RR8:227).          Given\n\nWilson’s vacillation regarding Special Issue No. One, the State chose to\n\nperemptorily strike Wilson.     Vacillating is a race-neutral reason for exercising a\n\nperemptory strike. See Cook v.

(Appellant’s Br.\n\nat 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47). The jurors’ qualifications for jury service are\n\nirrelevant to the analysis, however.    Factors relevant to determining whether\n\npurposeful discrimination has been proven include the following:\n\n            1. whether the State utilized its option to shuffle the jury panels\n               in a manner that supported an inference of race\n               discrimination;\n            2. whether the prosecutor’s office trying the case followed a\n               formal policy to exclude minority venire members from jury\n               service which was known to at least one of the prosecutors\n               at trial;\n            3. whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges to\n               eliminate a far greater proportion of minority venire\n               members than non-minority venire members;\n            4. whether the reasons the State asserted for eliminating the\n               minority venire members in question appeared to apply\n               equally well to many non-minority venire members whom\n               the State did not challenge; and\n            5. whether the State directed questions expressly designed to\n               elicit grounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately,\n               in a manner that suggested an intent to single out minority\n               venire members for elimination.\n\n\n\n                                         57 \n \n\fWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448-49 (relying on Miller-El v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240-\n\n64, 266 (2005)). This Court looks to the collective and cumulative impact of these\n\nnon–exclusive factors in determining whether an inference of racial discrimination\n\nis so powerful that it overcomes the deference given to trial courts. See id. at 449,\n\n457.\n\n       An analysis of these factors demonstrates that Appellant’s claim of\n\npurposeful discrimination lacks merit.\n\n             1. Jury Shuffle\n\n       There is no evidence of jury shuffling in this case. The parties selected the\n\ngroup of qualified jurors from a June 21, 2013 special venire. (RR4). Appellant\n\ndoes not assert or demonstrate that the venire was shuffled or otherwise arranged in\n\na manner to decrease the possibility of a minority member.\n\n             2. Formal Policy Prohibits Discrimination\n\n       The Dallas County District Attorney’s office’s notorious formal policy of\n\nexcluding minorities is a relic of a bygone era. It is common knowledge that the\n\noffice policy of the last several years not only forbids such discrimination, it\n\nrequires an investigation into sustained Batson challenges and authorizes discipline\n\nranging from reprimand to termination. The State asks this Court to take judicial\n\nnotice of this well-known fact. Tex. R. Evid. 201.\n\n\n\n\n                                         58 \n \n\f                             3. Proportionality of Strikes\n\n              Appellant argues that even one racially motivated peremptory strike violates\n\nBatson and he makes no effort to demonstrate a pattern of discriminatory strikes.\n\nHe does not identify the size or racial makeup of the pool of qualified venire\n\nmembers. Nor does he analyze the number of strikes used by either side or how\n\nthey were used. He merely argues that the State used 7 of its 12 peremptory strikes\n\nto eliminate 60% of the African-Americans on the qualified prospective jury panel,\n\na statistic with which the State disagrees. 11 (Appellant’s Br. at 50).\n\n              For statistical evidence to be relevant, data concerning the entire pool is\n\nnecessary. See Medellin v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 278 (5th Cir. 2004). By itself,\n\nthe number of African Americans struck is an irrelevant statistic. Woodward v.\n\nEpps, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"67497\"><a href=\"/opinion/67497/woodward-v-epps/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that the State’s striking 100% of\n\nthe black jurors alone does not support a finding of discrimination and does not\n\nshow any disparity in relation to the non-minority jurors).\n\n              The data evinces no discriminatory intent by the State. The panel of\n\nqualified venire members consisted of 44 people.                                Of these, 12 (27%) were\n\nAfrican-American, 27 (61%) were Caucasian, 4 (9%) were Hispanic, and 1 (2%)\n\ndeclined to indicate his race.                                 The State exercised 15 peremptory strikes.\n\n                                                            \n11\n  Appellant states in his brief that the State “used 7 of its 12 peremptory strikes to eliminate 60%\nof the African-Americans on the qualified prospective jury panel.” (Appellant’s Br. p. 50). In\nfact, the State exercised all 15 of its statutorily authorized peremptory strikes. The State\npresumes that Appellant’s reference to the State’s use of 12 strikes is a clerical error.\n                                                                  59 \n \n\f(RR43:8-19). Seven of those 15 strikes (47%) were used on African-Americans, 7\n\n(47%) were used on Caucasians, and 1 (6%) was used on a Hispanic juror.\n\n(RR43:8-19). Appellant exercised 17 peremptory strikes. (RR43:8-19). Of his 17\n\nstrikes, 2 were used on African-American jurors, 11 were used on Caucasian\n\njurors, and 3 were used on Hispanic jurors. (RR43:8-19). The result was a 12-\n\nmember jury consisting of 3 African-American jurors and 9 Caucasian jurors, with\n\n2 Caucasian alternate jurors.\n\n      The State’s use of 7 strikes on African-American venire members is not\n\ndefinitive of the inquiry in Batson’s third step; instead, a reviewing court must look\n\nat all relevant factors. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 452 (upholding the trial court,\n\ndespite the State’s disproportionate use of 6 of its 11 peremptory challenges\n\nagainst a racial group making up only 22% of the venire). Of the 44 venire\n\nmembers who could conceivably be chosen for the jury, 12 (27%), were African-\n\nAmerican. A random selection would yield either 3 or 4 African-American jurors\n\nin the 14 jurors selected (12 plus 2 alternates) (or 27% of fourteen, equaling 3.78\n\njurors). See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 451-52 (holding a random selection from a\n\n22% African-American venire would yield 2 or 3 black jurors because 22% of 12\n\njurors, plus 1 alternate, was 2.86). This jury panel had 3 African-American jurors.\n\nThus, 27% of the qualified jurors were African-American and 25% of the 12-\n\nperson jury was African-American. This jury had the expected amount of African-\n\n\n                                         60 \n \n\fAmerican members as would be expected from a random selection of the 44\n\nqualified jurors. Statistical analysis simply fails to show any racial discrimination.\n\n             4. Comparative Analysis\n\n      Appellant contends on appeal that the prosecutor’s stated reasons are a\n\npretext for racial discrimination because non-minority jurors with similar responses\n\nor characteristics were not struck by the State. (Appellant’s Br. at 50). At the\n\nBatson hearing, however, defense counsel failed to provide a comparative analysis\n\non the jurors. (RR43:21-22). Counsel did not cross-examine the prosecutor about\n\nher reasons for not striking any similarly situated venire members. (RR43:20-23).\n\nAs such, the prosecutor had no opportunity to respond to counsel’s allegations.\n\nAppellant should not be permitted to raise claims of disparate treatment for the first\n\ntime on appeal. By failing to properly present this claim at trial, he denied the\n\nprosecutor the opportunity to create a record on the prosecutor’s strategy, and he\n\ndenied the trial court an opportunity to rule on the claim.\n\n      Whether a prosecutor intended to discriminate on the basis of race is a\n\nquestion of historical fact properly decided in the trial courts. See Hernandez v.\n\nNew York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367-69 (1991). State procedural rules demand that\n\nallegations of disparate treatment by the prosecutor be raised in the trial court, so\n\nthat they can be properly answered by the State and decided by that court. See\n\nTex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457-58 (Keller, P.J., concurring);\n\n\n                                          61 \n \n\fYoung v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147-49 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (Campbell, J.,\n\ndissenting).\n\n      The State acknowledges this Court’s majority opinion in Young that a non-\n\ncapital defendant is not required to raise a comparative analysis in the trial court to\n\nhave evidence of such considered on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 145-46. The\n\nFifth Circuit has applied Young to a capital case and criticized this Court’s\n\ninconsistency in its application of the contemporaneous objection rule to Batson\n\nclaims in capital cases. Reed, 555 F.3d at 370.\n\n      This Court should explicitly overrule Young. See generally Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457-58 (Keller, P.J., concurring); Young, 826 S.W.2d at 147-49\n\n(Campbell, J., dissenting). Its majority—and the courts that rely on it—view the\n\ncomparative analysis as merely an appellate argument that can be fairly addressed\n\nfor the first time on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 146. In truth, it is a factual\n\nallegation of unfair treatment between jurors. If properly raised in the trial court,\n\nthe prosecution’s response may provide additional facts for the appellate court to\n\nconsider when reviewing the Batson ruling. If raised at trial successfully, the trial\n\ncourt can cure the error before trial even begins.        If not raised at trial, the\n\nprosecutor’s mental process and the trial judge’s credibility decision concerning\n\nthe non-strikes are simply omitted from the record. Jurors are not products of a set\n\nof cookie cutters, and the unexplained decision not to strike a non-minority juror\n\n\n                                          62 \n \n\fwho shares one trait in common with a minority juror is held against the State on\n\nappellate review. See, e.g., Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 244 (stating, “If, indeed, Fields’s\n\nthoughts on rehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have worried\n\nabout a number of white panel members he accepted with no evident\n\nreservations.”) (emphasis added). The prosecutor’s explanation of her voir dire\n\nstrategy and the trial court’s ruling on the strategy is critical to a fair appellate\n\nreview.\n\n      At the very least, a prosecutor should enjoy favor on appeal when the matter\n\nis not raised at trial, much like the presumption against a finding of ineffective\n\nassistance of defense counsel.       In claims regarding violations of a client’s\n\nconstitutional right to counsel, this Court has stated that “counsel should ordinarily\n\nbe accorded an opportunity to explain her actions before being condemned as\n\nunprofessional and incompetent.” Bone v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2099804\"><a href=\"/opinion/2099804/bone-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002). A prosecutor’s credibility is the heart of Batson review, and she\n\nshould be accorded no less of an opportunity to explain her actions.\n\n      This Court should conclude that the comparative analysis is not preserved\n\nfor review or, alternatively, presume that the comparative analysis favors the\n\nprosecutor absent affirmative evidence on the record.\n\n      In any event, Appellant has wholly failed to establish that the potential jurors\n\nwho are the focus of his Batson challenge were similarly situated to non-minority\n\n\n                                          63 \n \n\fpotential jurors who were not struck.\n\n                                           Brown, Phillips, White, Hashaway, and Kyles\n\n              As argued above, the State struck each and every qualified prospective juror\n\nregardless of race who ranked him/herself as a “3,” indicating a belief that,\n\n“Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long\n\nas the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of circumstances.”\n\n(RRR43:20-21).                                The State struck all 9 “3s” on the qualified prospective juror\n\npanel.               (RR43:20-21). Appellant points to no evidence to the contrary.                      He\n\ncannot show disparate treatment of Brown, Phillips, White, Hashaway, and Kyles\n\ncompared to accepted non-minority veniremembers. As such, Appellant has failed\n\nto show that the prosecutor’s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n                                                               Kimberly Houston\n\n              The State explained that it struck Houston because she is an attorney12 and\n\nbecause “we don’t think that attorneys are generally good on jury panels.”\n\n(RR43:21; Houston, Juror 27A, Q. p.1). Houston was the only attorney on the\n\nqualified-juror panel. (RR43:21). As such, this rationale was a unique explanation\n\nfor the strike, which applied to no other prospective juror.                            Importantly, during\n                                                            \n12\n   The State expressed this same opinion during the voir dire of another juror, Sheppard Brown.\nIn explaining the terms used in the special issues, the prosecutor commented that “That’s a whole\nlot of legal words. I’m going to try to talk to you about it in terms that - - that anybody would\nget, because we’re - - we’re not putting lawyers on this jury.” (RR5:30). She also stated that,\n“We’re going to put air conditioning techs and people who don’t know the law [on the jury].\nAnd there’s a good reason for that, by the way. Lawyers are not always the smartest people in\ntown.” (RR5:30).\n                                                                      64 \n \n\fthe Batson hearing, defense counsel did not challenge the prosecutor’s stated\n\nreason. Whether Appellant’s counsel personally felt such information should be\n\nthe basis for a strike, is irrelevant; nothing indicates this was a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination.     He cannot show that Houston was treated differently from non-\n\nminority venire members who the State accepted.\n\n                                     Shirley Wilson\n\n         The State struck Wilson because it did not believe that she was a qualified\n\njuror.    During the State’s questioning, Wilson stated repeatedly that she did not\n\nbelieve that the State could ever present proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a\n\ndefendant would be a future danger. The following exchange took place:\n\n         [Prosecutor]: Now we’re talking about punishment, and that Special\n         Issue Number 1, about what he’s going to do in the future, because\n         you can see how that’s asking the jury to decide if this person is going\n         to continue to constitute a continuing threat, if he’s going to continue\n         to commit criminal acts of violence. Do you see that?\n\n         [Wilson]: Yes, I see it.\n\n         [Prosecutor]: I mean, basically we’re asking you to look into the\n         future and decide whether it’s more likely than not he’s going to be a\n         continuing threat to society. How are you going to decide that?\n\n         [Wilson]: I can’t decide that.\n\n         [Prosecutor]: You can’t decide that?\n\n         [Wilson]: Huh-uh.\n\n         [Prosecutor]: Is there anything that I could do to prove to you beyond\n         a reasonable doubt - -\n                                           65 \n \n\f    [Wilson]: No.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: - - that a person is going to do something in the future?\n\n    [Wilson]: No.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Or is more likely than not going to do something in the\n    future?\n\n    [Wilson]: You can’t.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: And why is that?\n\n    [Wilson]: Because we just can’t determine what the future going [sic]\n    to be and what that person is going to do.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Okay. So there’s - - there’s nothing that I could do, no\n    evidence I could bring to you - -\n\n    [Wilson]: No.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: - - that would get you to answer Special Issue Number 1\n    yes?\n\n    [Wilson]: No. I don’t think there’s any - - you know, we just don’t\n    know. We don’t know what a person would do, whether it’s good or\n    bad in the future.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Sure. I mean, people can change?\n\n    [Wilson]: Yes, they can.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: But you don’t know 100 percent, but you’re telling me\n    you - - there’s no way I’m going to be able to tell you - - or bring to\n    you proof to convince you that it’s more likely than not that a person\n    is going to do something in the future?\n\n    [Wilson]: I just don’t - - no, I don’t think there’s any evidence just - -\n    you can bring and just - - to tell me what the future hold for that\n                                       66 \n \n\f     person, if that person going to be able to do it or not, no.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. And you understand that - - that the law would -\n     - well, let me rephrase that. I guess - - I mean, I totally see where\n     you’re coming from. We don’t have a crystal ball.\n\n     [Wilson]: Huh-uh.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: But in a trial situation there’s not - - no evidence,\n     there’s nothing I could present to you to convince you of what the\n     future is going to hold for somebody?\n\n     [Wilson]: No.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: So you’re automatically going to answer that Special\n     Issue Number 1 no because there’s nothing I can do. You’re always\n     going to say no to Special Issue Number 1? Do you see what that\n     question is asking?\n\n     [Wilson]: Let me just read it again. Maybe I’m - - I mean, maybe\n     I’m - - I’m just saying I just don’t see how you can - - how - - I’m not\n     saying you, but who can present what a person is going to do in the\n     future when it come [sic] down to criminal acts.\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Sure. And I’m not arguing with you. Please don’t - -\n     please don’t think that.\n\n     [Wilson]: So I guess I have to answer no.\n\n     [. . . ]\n\n     [Prosecutor]: Okay. And there’s nothing I assume that I could say to\n     change your mind about that?\n\n     [Wilson]: Probably not.\n\n(RR8:205-08).     The prosecutor questioned Wilson at length on this issue and\n\nWilson maintained her stance. (RR8:205-08).\n\n\n                                         67 \n \n\f      During questioning by the defense, counsel asked Wilson whether she could\n\n“keep an open mind to Special Issue Number 1 and wait until you hear all the\n\nevidence before you decide what the appropriate answer is[.]” (RR8:219). Wilson\n\nresponded that, now that she understood that special issue, she would “have to just\n\nwait before I could just say this person is no good to nothing, anymore, period,\n\nthere’s no chance.” (RR8:219). But that line of questioning did not ask whether\n\nshe could ever find a defendant to be a future danger. This question simply asked\n\nwhether she could keep an “open mind.” When defense counsel specifically asked\n\nwhether she could answer Special Issue No. 1 “yes,” Wilson maintained, as she did\n\nunder questioning by the State, that she could not say that she would do so.\n\n(RR8:220). She stated that “I can’t see what you can really show to me what the\n\nfuture is going to hold. I’m not for sure if I could answer that yes[.]” (RR8:220).\n\nVery shortly thereafter, however, she gave a response that seemed to indicate that\n\nshe changed her mind and could answer Special Issue No. 1 in the affirmative:\n\n“Yes, I guess, if I’m presented with the evidence and here it is [. . .] then I would\n\nhave to say yes, now that I understand the question better.” (RR8:221).\n\n      Importantly, a review of Wilson’s testimony under questioning by the\n\ndefense indicates that Wilson may have been confused about the fact that in order\n\nfor the death penalty to be assessed, she would have to answer the first special\n\nissue “yes.”   And, that in order to answer special issue No. 1 “yes,” she would\n\n\n                                         68 \n \n\fhave to find a defendant to be a future danger. Defense counsel asked Wilson\n\nwhether she understood that life without the possibility of parole and death are the\n\nonly two possible punishments. (RR8:215). She did. (RR8:215). Then, he asked\n\nwhether she understood that “in order for someone to receive the death sentence,\n\nyou would have to answer Special Issue Number 1 yes?” (RR8;216-17). Wilson\n\nsaid, “No. I read that over and over, but I didn’t know I needed to answer yes in\n\norder for a person to receive the death penalty[.]” (RR8:217). They discuss the\n\nterms “probability” and “criminal acts of violence.” (RR8:217-20). Then, she\n\nreiterates the position she took when under questioning by the State, “I can’t see\n\nwhat you can really show to me [to prove] what the future is going to hold.”\n\n(RR8:220).\n\n      Wilson’s responses indicate that she was either unwilling or unable to\n\nanswer Special Issue No. 1 in the affirmative or that she was a vacillating juror.\n\nSince the trial court denied the State’s challenge, the State exercised a peremptory\n\nchallenge.   Indeed, the State struck all jurors that it had unsuccessfully challenged\n\nfor cause. Of the 44 qualified jurors, the State unsuccessfully challenged for cause\n\n4 potential jurors: Wilson (Juror 196A, an African-American female), Chad Davis\n\n(Juror 265A, a Caucasian male), Ronald Drake (Juror 759A, a Caucasian male),\n\nand Wanda Benjamin (Juror 1369A, an African-American female).

Appellant has failed to show Wilson was treated differently from\n\naccepted non-minority venire members.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has wholly failed to show that Jurors Brown, Phillips, White,\n\nHashaway, Kyles, Houston, or Wilson were similarly-situated to non-minority\n\njurors that were not struck by the State.\n\n             5. Disparate Questioning\n\n      Appellant points to no instances of disparate questioning by the State. Cf.\n\nMiller-El, 545 U.S. at 256-57 (prosecutors used a graphic script when describing\n\nthe death penalty to African-American jurors who were ambivalent to the death\n\npenalty more often than with white jurors who also were ambivalent). Nor is any\n\ndisparate questioning apparent in the record.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nState’s exercise of its peremptory challenges against 7 African-Americans was the\n\nproduct of racial discrimination. Appellant has not shown that the State’s\n\nexplanations did not apply equally to non-minority venire members that the State\n\ndid not challenge, that the State directed questions expressly designed to elicit\n\ngrounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately, or that a formal policy\n\nexcludes minorities from jury service. The record before this Court supports the\n\n\n                                            70 \n \n\ftrial court’s resolution of the fact question of pretext. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Appellant’s Batson challenges. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at\n\n456-57.\n\n      Issues 1 through 7 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 8 THROUGH 19:        THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\nGRANTING THE STATE’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n      In Issues 8 through 19, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting the State’s challenges for cause against potential jurors Mary Boulos,\n\nJudith McDaniel, Terry Plank, and Floyd Stanmore. (Appellant’s Br. pp.51-64).\n\nHe contends the exclusion of these jurors and the failure of the trial court to allow\n\nhim to voir dire these jurors violated article 35.16 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure as well as his right to counsel under the federal and state constitutions.\n\nSee U.S. CONST. amends VI & XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, § 10; Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 35.16 (West 2006). Appellant’s contentions lack merit and should\n\nbe overruled.\n\n                                   Applicable Law\n\n      Article 35.16(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides as\n\nfollows:\n\n      A challenge for cause may be made by the State for any of the following\n      reasons:\n\n             1. That the juror has conscientious scruples in regard to the infliction\n                of the punishment of death for crime, in a capital case, where the\n                                          71 \n \n\f                 State is seeking the death penalty.\n\n              2. That he is related within the third degree of consanguinity or\n                 affinity as determined under Chapter 573, Government Code, to\n                 the defendant; and\n\n              3. That he has a bias or prejudice against any phase of the law upon\n                 which the State is entitled to rely for conviction or punishment.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(b). A “bias against the law” is the refusal to\n\nconsider or apply the relevant law. Sadler v.

In fact, on that questionnaire, Boulos made statements in four\n\nplaces in which she indicated that she does not believe she has the right to judge\n\nanother human being: “I don’t feel that I have the right to judge someone’s future”\n\n(RR11:18; Boulos, Juror 285A, Q. p.2); the best argument against the death\n\npenalty is “judging whether a person has the right to live or not” (Boulos, Juror\n\n285A, Q. p. 2); “still don’t have the right to judge whether someone lives or dies”\n\n(Boulos, Juror 285A, Q. p.2); and “I do not feel that I have the right to judge\n\nwhether or not someone is given the death penalty or life.” (Boulos, Juror 285A,\n\nQ. p.18).\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor probed Boulos as to how she felt about\n\nsitting in judgment and answering questions in such a way that a death sentence\n\nwould be imposed.     (RR11:17-18).     Boulos responded she was not comfortable\n\n\n                                         73 \n \n\fbecause “[she’s] not somebody to sit there and judge somebody else[.]”\n\n(RR11:18).     The prosecutor tried to get a definitive answer regarding Boulos’\n\nability to sit in judgment. The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Okay. And like I told you in the beginning, the law is\n      not going to require - - we’re not going to require that you sit in\n      judgment of an individual in this situation - -\n\n      [Boulos]: Yeah.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: - - if it’s going to do violence to your conscience.\n\n      [Boulos]: Yeah.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: If it is something you cannot do because of personal,\n      moral, or religious reasons; is that where you stand?\n\n      [Boulos]: Yes.\n\n(RR11:18). The State challenged Boulos for cause.           (RR11:19).     Appellant\n\nobjected and stated that Boulos had not said “that her feelings would impair her\n\nability to answer the questions and follow the law.”     (RR11:19-20).      The trial\n\ncourt granted the State’s challenge. (RR11:20). The totality of Boulos’ voir dire\n\nshows Boulos could not sit in judgment of another individual and her statements\n\nsupport the trial court’s decision. To the extent, if any, that some of Boulos’ other\n\nremarks could be interpreted as contradictory, the trial court was the fact finder\n\nduring voir dire and, thus, free to resolve her conflicting answers in the State’s\n\nfavor. See King v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1473088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1473088/king-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">556</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (Tex.

To\n\nconclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy of encouraging trial\n\ncourt’s to liberally grant challenges for cause rather than err by denying a\n\nchallenge on a close question.

Crim.\n\nApp. 1998).\n\n      The record reflects that the State challenged Boulos for cause and that the\n\ntrial court granted the State’s challenge. (RR11:19-20). Contrary to the statements\n\nin Appellant’s brief, there is no evidence that the trial court excused Boulos sua\n\nsponte.\n\n      Finally, on appeal, Appellant contends that he was denied the opportunity to\n\nquestion Boulos.     (Appellant’s Br. p. 57). During voir dire when the State\n\nchallenged this juror, however, Appellant did not request an opportunity to\n\nquestion Boulos. (RR11:20). See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.17, § 2\n\n(stating that “In a capital felony case . . . on demand of the State or defendant,\n\neither is entitled to examine each juror on voir dire individually and apart from the\n\nentire panel, and may further question the juror on the principles propounded by\n\nthe court.”). As a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate review,\n\nhowever, the record must show that the complaint was made to the trial court by a\n\ntimely request, objection, or motion and that the trial court either (1) ruled on the\n\nrequest, objection, or motion; or (2) refused to rule on the request, objection, or\n\n\n                                         75 \n \n\fmotion, and the complaining party objected to the refusal. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1\n\n(a).   Given Appellant’s failure to request the opportunity to question Boulos, he\n\nfailed to preserve any issue for this Court’s review.\n\n                                  Judith McDaniel\n\n       On her questionnaire, Judith McDaniel wrote that she is not in favor of the\n\ndeath penalty.    (McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.1).        Among other reasons, she\n\nbelieves in “the possibility of redemption” and in light of “Craig Watson’s [sic]\n\npush to find those wrongfully convicted,” McDaniel wrote she is against the death\n\npenalty. (McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.1).         McDaniel ranked herself as a “3,”\n\nindicating, “Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be\n\nimposed, as long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of\n\ncircumstances.” (McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.1). She noted, however, “Maybe I\n\nshould circle #5[,]” which provides that “I could never, under any circumstances,\n\nreturn a verdict which assessed the death penalty.”\n\n       Additionally, McDaniel wrote that although it is improving, she does not\n\nbelieve that the death penalty is applied fairly in Dallas County. (McDaniel, Juror\n\n317A, Q. p.4). She wrote that the death penalty is used too often in Texas.\n\n(McDaniel, Juror 317A, Q. p.4).\n\n       During voir dire, McDaniel reiterated her general opposition to the death\n\npenalty and gave answers suggesting considerable discomfort in participating in a\n\n\n                                          76 \n \n\fprocess where an individual may be sentenced to death.     McDaniel testified that\n\neven though her opinion about the death penalty has wavered over the years, “I\n\nreally doubt that I - - I could be in favor of the death penalty.” (RR11:101).\n\nWhen asked whether she could participate in death penalty decision, she stated, “I\n\ndon’t want to. I don’t - - I don’t think I can.” (RR11:104).       The prosecutor\n\nexplained the death penalty is not automatic.       (RR11:105).    The prosecutor\n\nexplained the special issues and asked McDaniel if she could answer them in such\n\na way that would result in a death sentence. (RR11:105-07). McDaniel testified\n\nthat she “can’t honestly say, but I am pretty sure I would not go for the death\n\npenalty.” (RR11:107). When finally pinned down, McDaniel testified she could\n\nnot guarantee the ability to set aside her personal feelings. (RR11:121).       The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: I’m going to - - I - - “I don’t think” and “maybe” and\n      “probably” are not - - are not words that lawyers are very good at\n      accepting, and I apologize, but the record has to be very clear, so I’m\n      going to ask it a different way. You don’t think you could. I’m going\n      to turn that around and ask you, can you guarantee both sides of this,\n      the State and the Defense, that you could set aside your personal\n      feelings and be a juror in this case, even if it resulted in the death\n      sentence?\n\n      [McDaniel]: No, I can’t guarantee it.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Thank you.\n\n(RR11:121).   The State challenged McDaniel for cause, which was granted over\n\nAppellant’s objection, based on the fact that “she would not be able to make that\n                                        77 \n \n\fdecision or at minimum could not guarantee us that she could set aside her\n\npersonal feeling and assess a sentence that may result in execution.” (RR11:122).\n\n      A venireperson may not be excused for her general opposition to the death\n\npenalty.

A juror must be able to set aside her personal\n\npreferences and biases to consider as death eligible all those defined as death\n\neligible by section 19.03 of the penal code and article 37.071 of the criminal\n\nprocedure code. Rachal, 917 S.W.2d at 812.\n\n      Clearly, the totality of McDaniel’s voir dire testimony demonstrates that her\n\nbeliefs about capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the\n\nperformance of her duties as a juror as required by law. She had a bias against the\n\nlaw governing a defendant’s eligibility for the death penalty. The record supports\n\nthe trial court’s decision to grant the State’s challenge.

He wrote, “I feel no one has the right to\n\ntake the life of another, including the State.” (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p.1). In six\n\nseparate places, Plank wrote that he does not believe in the death penalty. (Plank,\n\nJuror 320A, Q. p.1, 2, 3). In one instance, he described the death penalty as “state\n\nsanctioned murder.” (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p.2). In contradiction, Plank ranked\n\nhimself as a “3,” indicating that “Although I do not believe that the death penalty\n\nshould ever be imposed, as long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under\n\nthe proper set of circumstances.” (Plank, Juror 320A, Q. p. 1).\n\n      During voir dire, Plank testified he was “ambivalent” about the death\n\npenalty. (RR12:24).    Ultimately, he conceded that he could not guarantee that he\n\ncould set aside his personal feelings about the death penalty and follow the law.\n\n(RR12:29). The following exchange took place:\n\n\n                                        79 \n \n\f    [Prosecutor]: We’ve got to have people whose feelings are the death\n    penalty is appropriate in some cases, based on the evidence. And\n    yours is never.\n\n    [Plank]: Right.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: And so I would - - I would tell you that you’d be a great\n    juror on a case where the punishment range was 5 to 99 or life or even\n    on a capital murder case where we weren’t seeking the death penalty.\n    Sounds to me like you could give the State a fair trial in the first part\n    of the case on guilt/innocence, no issues there, but it’s the penalty\n    phase that causes you some concerns because of your personal\n    beliefs?\n\n    [Plank]: Absolutely.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: And if I had to ask you for today for a guarantee those\n    [beliefs] wouldn’t interfere, you couldn’t guarantee me that?\n\n    [Plank]: I don’t - - I know I disagree, so it’s hard to - - it’s hard to say\n    that I would just all of a sudden agree.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Right. And - - and you don’t have to - - I’m not trying\n    to change your opinion about the death penalty.\n\n    [Plank]: Right.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Just because you don’t agree with it, doesn’t necessarily\n    disqualify you from the jury pool. But you’ve got to be able to\n    promise me today and guarantee me today that your feelings against\n    the death penalty would not interfere with your ability to follow the\n    law, listen to the evidence, and base your verdict only on the\n    evidence, even if that meant that the death penalty was imposed. And\n    you’ve kind of already told me that this isn’t - - this isn’t really for\n    you, the death penalty; is that right?\n\n    [Plank]: I believe so.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: This won’t be the last jury summons you get, I promise.\n    And hopefully the next one wouldn’t be on a case where the death\n                                        80 \n \n\f      penalty was at issue. And I know it’s hard to say what you could or\n      couldn’t do in the future because you’ve never been put in those\n      shoes, but I’m telling you, you don’t have to be put in that position, if\n      you can’t guarantee me you could - - you could do it.\n\n      [Plank]: Right. I don’t think I can guarantee anything, not - - not\n      knowing, you know - - not ever having been in that position before.\n\n(RR12:27-29). The State challenged Plank for cause because “he cannot guarantee\n\nthe State that he would be able to follow the law and base his verdict on the\n\nevidence because of his strong opposition to the death penalty.” (RR12:29). The\n\ntotality of Plank’s voir dire testimony clearly demonstrates his beliefs about capital\n\npunishment would prevent or substantially impair his ability to follow the law.\n\nSee Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517. The record supports the trial court’s decision to\n\ngrant the State’s challenge. See King, 29 S.W.3d at 568. To conclude otherwise\n\nwould controvert this Court’s policy as stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Appellant argues that he was denied the opportunity to question Plank.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. p. 61-62). After the State challenged Plank for cause, Appellant\n\nrequested the opportunity to question him. (RR12:30).        The judge said that he\n\nwould “give [the defense] a chance,” but that the court “[didn’t] think he’s\n\nqualified.”   (RR12:30).    Then he granted the State’s challenge.        (RR12:30).\n\nAppellant objected. (RR12:30).        He did not, however, renew his request to\n\nquestion Plank as the court had previously said it would allow.           (RR12:30).\n\nInstead, he “object[ed] to not being able to rehabilitate him.” (RR12:30).\n\n\n                                         81 \n \n\f      Any error in denying Appellant’s request to question Plank is harmless.

Moreover, Appellant did not make a proffer of the\n\nquestions that he would have asked Plank had he been given the opportunity.\n\n(RR12:29-30).    As such, it cannot be determined whether he was denied the\n\nopportunity to properly question Plank.      Appellant has failed to show that he was\n\ndeprived of a lawfully constituted jury.\n\n                                  Floyd Stanmore\n\n      In his questionnaire, Floyd Stanmore ranked himself as a “2,” which\n\nindicates that he believes the death penalty is appropriate in some murder cases and\n\nthat he could return a verdict in a proper case which assessed the death penalty.\n\n(Stanmore, Juror 1118A, Q. p.1).       Stanmore later contradicted this statement,\n\n\n                                           82 \n \n\fhowever, when asked whether there was any reason why he would not want to\n\nserve as a juror in this case. He wrote, “I am not sure that I could vote for the\n\ndeath [penalty] [sic].” (Stanmore, Juror 1118A, Q. p18).       In his questionnaire,\n\nStanmore stated his concern that the death penalty is applied unfairly to minorities\n\nin Texas, including Dallas County. (Stanmore, Juror 1118A, Q. pp.2-3). Beyond\n\nthe death penalty, Stanmore wrote that the biggest problem in our criminal justice\n\nsystem is that “I do not think that minorities are treated fairly always.” (Stanmore,\n\nJuror 1118A, Q. p.4).\n\n      During voir dire, Stanmore reiterated his concern about whether all\n\ndefendants receive a fair trial. (RR32:70). He wondered “how many defendants\n\nor convicted individuals have actually been executed who were actually innocent.”\n\n(RR32:70). Stanmore testified as follows:\n\n      I can’t [100%] [sic] say that I would be able to sit through the process,\n      look at all the evidence, and listen to the evidence and still be able to\n      come to a conclusion that the death penalty is warranted in this case.\n\n(RR32:72). The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: So just from what you’re telling me, it kind of sounds\n      like, Mr. Stanmore, that you kind of did come in, you know, not\n      knowing - - most people, when we say the word you come in with a\n      bias or already come in with a preconceived notion, people think of\n      that negatively. I’m not saying it in a negative way. But I’m saying it\n      in such a way that as you sit here right now, you already kind of\n      know, based on your reservation, how you’d feel or how you would\n      lean toward, you know, a certain outcome of the trial. Like I said,\n      maybe this particular case isn’t the one for you. You know, maybe\n      another type of case that you don’t know as much information about\n                                         83 \n \n\f      or another type of case that the death penalty is nowhere near it.\n      Would you say that’s a true statement?\n\n      [Stanmore]: That’s pretty close to the truth, yes. I would say, yes.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: And that as you sit here right now, and you said you\n      can’t guarantee, let’s say the State, [100%] that you could base all of\n      you[r] information on the facts and evidence that come in this case,\n      that you’re still going to bring with you some of these reservations\n      because you didn’t leave those at the door, did you?\n\n      [Stanmore]: Not at all.\n\n      [Prosecutor]: All right.\n\n      [Stanmore]: That reservation is about the death penalty itself, not\n      about conviction.\n\n(RR32:73-74). The prosecutor explained the procedure involved in a capital case\n\nand that the State believed that it had the type, quality, and quantity of evidence\n\nthat would require the jury to answer the first special issue in the affirmative and\n\nthe second special issue in the negative. (RR32:76-77). Stanmore stated that “it\n\nwould bother [him] as an individual” to participate in the process. (RR32:78). At\n\nthat point, the State successfully challenged Stanmore for cause. (RR32:78).\n\nAppellant argued that Stanmore’s “reservations” and his reluctance to participate\n\nwere insufficient to sustain the State’s challenge. (RR32:79).\n\n      The totality of Stanmore’s voir dire testimony clearly shows his beliefs\n\nabout the criminal justice system and capital punishment would prevent or\n\nsubstantially impair his ability to carry out his obligations as a juror.       At a\n\n\n                                         84 \n \n\fminimum, Stanmore vacillated.

Appellant\n\nhas failed to show that he was deprived of a lawfully constituted jury.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State’s challenges\n\nfor cause regarding Boulos, McDaniel, Plank, and Stanmore. Even assuming their\n\nexcusal was erroneous, it was harmless. The erroneous excusal of a venireperson\n\nwarrants reversal only if the record shows that the error deprived the defendant of a\n\nlawfully constituted jury. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 393. Appellant makes no such\n\nshowing.

See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747. Before a venire member can be excused\n\nfor bias, the law must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can\n\nfollow that law regardless of his personal views.

(RR43). During this hearing, Appellant exhausted all 15 of his statutory\n\nperemptory strikes as well as 2 additional strikes granted by the court. (RR43:9-\n\n18). He struck James Couch (Juror 80A), Craig Matthews (Juror 154A), Kevin\n\nPowell (Juror 179A), Kimberly Turvan (Juror 295A), Laura Carroll (Juror 433A),\n\nMolli Elliston (Juror 532A), Jerry Mace (Juror 615A), Rudy Ochoa (Juror 617A),\n\nHolly Sanders (Juror 636A), Debra Filler (Juror 701A), Sandra Gromacki (Juror\n\n756A), Sabastian Coleman (Juror 1023A), Jessica Magee (Juror 1149A), Sarah\n\nWagler (Juror 1168A), Deemie Naugle (Juror 1196A), Raul Ibarra-Avila (Juror\n\n1351A), and Christina Salazar (Juror 1365A). (RR43:8-17). Appellant requested\n\na third additional strike.   (RR43:17).    That request was denied and the next\n\nqualified prospective juror, Shonquidria Jenkins (Juror 1368A), was seated on the\n\njury. (RR43:17-18).    Appellant identified Jenkins as an “objectionable juror” and\n\n\n\n\n                                          89 \n \n\fagain requested an additional strike.13 (RR43:17-18).                                    That request was denied.\n\n(RR43:18). After Jenkins, the next qualified prospective juror, Jerri Adams (Juror\n\n1393A), was seated on the jury. (RR43:18). Appellant did not identify Adams as\n\nan “objectionable juror.” (RR43:18).\n\n              At trial, Appellant did not identify Powell, Matthews, Carroll, Elliston,\n\nMace, Gromacki, Wagler, or Adams as “objectionable jurors.” (RR43:9, 10, 11,\n\n12, 15-16).                    The only juror he identified as objectionable was Jenkins. (RR43:17-\n\n18, 23).                  And, of the pool of jurors identified in Issues 20 through 27, the only\n\njuror Appellant was forced to accept who actually sat on the jury and deliberated\n\nwas Jerri Adams.\n\n              Since Appellant received 2 extra peremptory challenges in addition to the 15\n\nallotted by statute for use on the pool in selecting 12 jurors, he must show that the\n\ntrial court erroneously denied at least three of his challenges for cause. See, e.g.,\n\nSaldano, 232 S.W.3d at 93 (noting that Saldano would have to show 3 erroneous\n\ndenials because he received two extra peremptory strikes). Appellant has not met\n\nhis burden.\n\n                                                               Issue #20: Kevin Powell\n\n              During voir dire, Appellant challenged Kevin Powell for cause because\n\nPowell answered in his questionnaire that he would give more credibility to police\n                                                            \n13\n  Later in the hearing, Appellant explained that Jenkins was objectionable “primarily because\nshe had indicated that she was a victim of family violence or domestic violence[.]” (RR43:23).\n                                                                         90 \n \n\fofficers.

Crim. App. 1991).\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor questioned Powell regarding his view of\n\npolice officer credibility. (RR8:15-16).      Powell affirmed he could wait until a\n\nwitness testifies before he judges their credibility.         (RR8:15-16). Under\n\nquestioning by defense counsel, Powell affirmed his belief that police officers are\n\nmore likely to tell the truth than the average person.     (RR8:41-42).    Defense\n\ncounsel explained the law required that “you have to start all witnesses off the\n\nsame, that just because of a person’s occupation, they are not deemed more\n\ncredible than anyone else.” (RR8:42).      Powell affirmed he understood the law.\n\n(RR8:42). Counsel asked whether Powell would agree that the opinion expressed\n\nin his questionnaire is different than his testimony in court. (RR8:42). Powell\n\n\n                                        91 \n \n\fresponded, “Well, you asked me about my feelings, and that’s what I responded\n\nto.” (RR8:42). Apparently, Powell was attempting to distinguish that the opinions\n\nexpressed in his questionnaire were his “feelings” as opposed to the law.       The\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Okay. And are your feelings that even knowing\n      what the law says, that you give police officers more credibility than\n      you do the average citizen? And as I said, there’s no such thing as a\n      right answer or wrong answer. I just want to know how you feel.\n\n      [Powell]: Right. Again, I understand, you know, what you’re saying\n      to me, and - - and I base this on, you know, my feelings, but I can be,\n      you know, fair with every witness that - - if I heard that testimony.\n\n(RR8:42-43). Later, defense counsel returned to the subject and asked whether, if\n\nhe served on the jury and understood the law, Powell would give police officers\n\nmore credibility. (RR8:44). Powell testified he “would look at everything that has\n\nbeen given and all the testimony that, you know, I hear and I believe I can give a\n\ngood and fair response to it.” (RR8:44).\n\n      The totality of Powell’s testimony indicates he would wait to hear a\n\nwitness’s testimony before judging that witness’s credibility.   To the extent that\n\nany of his responses may be interpreted as contradictory, this Court should defer to\n\nthe trial court’s resolution of his responses. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The\n\nreviewing court must give great deference to the trial court’s decision on a\n\nchallenge for cause based on the trial judge’s opportunity to observe the venire\n\nmember during voir dire. Id. When the record reflects that a prospective juror\n                                           92 \n \n\fvacillated or equivocated on her ability to follow the law, the reviewing court must\n\ndefer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 295. Given Powell’s assurances\n\nthat he could follow the law, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nPowell was not biased against Appellant. See Lane, 822 S.W.2d at 45 (holding\n\nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a challenge for cause\n\nwhere, venire member said she would “evaluate a police officer[’s credibility] as\n\nshe would any other [witness]”).\n\n      Appellant also challenged Powell on the basis that he would automatically\n\nassess the death penalty after finding a guilty verdict on capital murder.    In his\n\nquestionnaire, Powell wrote he is in favor of the death penalty and “If a person is\n\nproven guilty of taking someones [sic] life in commission of a crime their life\n\nshould be taken.” (Powell, Juror 179A, Q. p.2.).     On its face, Powell’s response\n\nsuggests he believed that all murders warrant a death sentence. The remainder of\n\nPowell’s questionnaire and voir dire indicates otherwise, however.\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor explained that a verdict of guilty as to\n\ncapital murder does not automatically lead to the death penalty. (RR8:25, 29, 34-\n\n35). The jurors would then have to consider the special issues. (RR8:25-26, 29-\n\n35). Powell affirmed that he understood. (RR8:25-26, 29-353). He affirmed that\n\nhe would hold the State to its burden of proof on the first special issue. (RR8:37-\n\n38). Importantly, Powell wrote in his questionnaire and affirmed during voir dire\n\n\n                                        93 \n \n\fthat in some circumstances, a life sentence is appropriate. (RR8:17; Powell, Juror\n\n179A, Q. p.2).     Thus, although Powell believed that the death penalty was an\n\nappropriate punishment for murder he did not believe the death penalty should be\n\nautomatic for every murder.       His answer to the first special issue would be\n\ndetermined by an examination of all the evidence, rather than solely the guilty\n\nverdict.\n\n      Lastly, Appellant contends that Powell should have been excused based on\n\nhis belief that the death penalty is appropriate in circumstances involving robbery,\n\nsexual assault, torture, or abuse of children and the elderly. (Appellant’s Br. at 65).\n\nThis complaint was not asserted at trial and is not properly preserved for this\n\nCourt’s review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Regardless, Appellant’s contention\n\nlacks merit. During voir dire, Appellant briefly questioned Powell about his belief\n\nthat other offenses should be eligible for the death penalty. (RR8:48-49). Powell\n\naffirmed his belief that the death penalty should be available for sexual assault,\n\ntorture, or abuse of children or the elderly. (RR8:49).      Defense counsel did not\n\nask Powell whether this belief would interfere with his ability to follow the law in\n\nthis case. (RR8:48-49). Indeed, counsel simply moved on to a different line of\n\nquestioning. (RR8:49). As such, he failed to show that Powell was challengeable\n\nfor cause on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                          94 \n \n\f      Based on the totality of the voir dire testimony, sufficient evidence supports\n\nthe trial court’s ruling, and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nAppellant’s challenge for cause against Powell. No evidence sustains that Powell\n\nwas biased in any way against Appellant or the law. During voir dire, Powell\n\naffirmed he would afford Appellant the presumption of innocence; he would hold\n\nthe State to its burden of proof; he would not require the defense to present any\n\nevidence; he would not consider Appellant’s silence as evidence; he would wait to\n\nhear a witness’s testimony before determining credibility; and, he understood that\n\nthe death penalty is not automatic for capital murder. (RR8:12-18, 25-26, 29, 34,\n\n37-38). Accordingly, Issue 20 should be overrruled.\n\n                            Issue #21: Craig Matthews\n\n      Appellant challenged Craig Matthews for cause on the basis that he would\n\nbe “predisposed or leaning toward answering Special Issue Number 1 yes” if he\n\nfound Appellant guilty of capital murder. (RR9:111). The trial court stated:\n\n      I don’t think a disqualifying question was asked him on that matter.\n      And I think after hearing all of his testimony, I think he can follow the\n      law and be a fair juror, so I’m going to deny your challenge.\n\n(RR9:111). The record supports the trial court’s determination.\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor explained, “There are no automatics in this\n\nprocess.” (RR9:54). She further explained that after a verdict of guilt, jurors do\n\nnot vote whether the defendant should receive a life or death sentence; the jurors\n\n\n                                         95 \n \n\fwould have to answer the special issues. (RR9:55).          Matthews affirmed his\n\nunderstanding. (RR9:55-56). The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Prosecutor]: Absolutely. And, you know, we ask you all these\n      things before the law has been explained to you, and that’s why I just\n      want to make sure that even though this is your personal belief that\n      you are completely entitled to at all times, that you would then be able\n      to - - and you’re not going to have to memorize this. You’ll see it\n      again in the jury’s charge, the special issues. I just want to make sure\n      that if the law is given to you by the Court, you would then be able to\n      render your verdict based on the law and the evidence and not have\n      any automatics. No automatic response because somebody is found\n      guilty of the offense of capital murder and no matter how cold,\n      horrible, and heinous, that you will be able to deliberate with regards\n      to Special Issue Number 1 and make the State prove that to you\n      beyond a reasonable doubt before answering it yes.\n\n      [Matthews]: Yeah.\n\n(RR9:71). Matthews repeatedly affirmed his understanding that the verdict must\n\nbe based on the law and the evidence and with no automatic answers.        (RR9:56,\n\n58, 59, 60, 67, 68, 74, 81). When defense counsel asked Matthews what his\n\n“feelings on the death penalty” would be after he (on a hypothetical jury) found a\n\ndefendant guilty of capital murder, Matthews responded:\n\n      I don’t know. My understanding of the law as it’s been presented to\n      me is that - - if those causes and consequences are proven, then - -\n      then it’s an option relative to the two special issues.\n\n(RR9:85).     Matthews accepted that the appropriate punishment for someone\n\nfound guilty of capital murder could be life without parole. (RR9:85). The record\n\nreflects that Matthews’ examination of the law and evidence as related to the two\n\n\n                                        96 \n \n\fspecial issues would control his answers rather than the verdict.        As such, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant’s challenge for cause\n\nagainst Matthews.\n\n      Issue 21 should be overruled.\n\n                              Issue #22: Laura Carroll\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Laura Carroll for cause because she was\n\n“mitigation impaired” and because “someone would have to convince her that life\n\nwas the more appropriate verdict.” (RR15:74).             The trial court denied this\n\nchallenge. (RR15:74). The record reflects no bias against the law governing the\n\nmitigation special issue and, thus, supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n      During voir dire, Carroll affirmed that if she were to find someone guilty of\n\ncapital murder, she would not “be leaning toward the death penalty[.]” (RR15:49).\n\nShe testified, “No. It would depend on the circumstances throughout the entire\n\ntrial. I can’t make a presumption like that without having any kind of evidence to\n\nsay that, yes, I would go either way.” (RR15:49).         Carroll testified that Special\n\nIssue No. 2 “always matters.” (RR15:57). “There could be” evidence that would\n\nconvince her that life is the appropriate punishment. (RR15:57). She testified she\n\nwould “lean more closely toward the death penalty” (after having found someone\n\nguilty of capital murder and found him a future danger), “but [she] would have no\n\nproblem listening to others and discussing why we should go with a life sentence\n\n\n                                           97 \n \n\finstead.” (RR15:57-58).

Crim. App. 1999)). Nevertheless, Carroll testified she would not require the\n\ndefense to present such evidence. (RR15:58).            The following exchange took\n\nplace:\n\n         [Defense counsel]: If you - - if - - on your hypothetical jury, you\n         found somebody guilty of capital murder, you found beyond a\n         reasonable doubt that they are going to be a threat in the future, is the\n         Defense going to have to bring you some kind of evidence to convince\n         you that life is appropriate at that point?\n\n         [Carroll]: You would think that they would. I would think that they\n         would.\n\n         [Defense Counsel]: Would you require that?\n\n         [Carroll]: No.\n\n(RR15:58). Defense counsel later returned to the topic and asked whether Carroll’s\n\npersonal feeling, after having found someone a future danger, would be that the\n\ndeath penalty is appropriate. (RR15:71). Carroll testified, “It would be, yes.”\n\n(RR15:71). Counsel asked whether her feeling would remain unless “somebody\n                                            98 \n \n\fcan convince you otherwise[.]” (RR15:71). Carroll testified, “I would be, yes.”\n\n(RR15:71).     Carroll never testified the defense must bring any evidence to\n\nconvince her that life was the appropriate sentence. (RR15:71). The totality of\n\nCarroll’s testimony indicates she would be fair and impartial and would listen to all\n\nevidence in order to answer the two special issues. This Court should defer to the\n\ntrial court’s resolution of any of her possible conflicting responses. See Feldman,\n\n71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n      Issue 22 should be overrruled.\n\n                               Issue #23: Molli Elliston\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Molli Elliston for cause because, as to Special\n\nIssue No. 1, Elliston would only require one criminal act of violence. (RR16:56).\n\nThe trial court denied Appellant’s challenge for cause. (RR16:56).\n\n      During voir dire, defense counsel questioned Elliston regarding Special\n\nIssue No. 1.     When discussed “criminal acts of violence,” he asked Elliston\n\nwhether she would require a single act of violence or multiple and instructed her\n\nthat the term had no definition. (RR16:44). Elliston testified she would “have to\n\nthink about that, if that truly means acts plural and not a singular act.” (RR16:44).\n\nShe testified that it “seems a little bit like splitting hairs to whether it would be just\n\none or multiple.” (RR16:45). The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Defense counsel]: But that seems to be a hair that the legislature has\n      split.\n                                           99 \n \n\f    [Elliston]: Okay. Well, I’d have to think about that.\n\n    [. . .]\n\n    [Defense counsel]: Well, do you want me to - - to - - to come back to\n    it? Do you - - or - - because it’s - - it’s an important question, and it’s\n    - - it’s what the legislature requires, that you would have to believe\n    that the Defendant would commit criminal acts, plural, of violence.\n\n    [Elliston]: I’m thinking. Criminal acts of violence - - If - - I - - if you\n    think a person is - - is likely to commit another act of violence which\n    would constitute a threat to society, then I’m having trouble\n    distinguishing it it’s - - if you have - - if anybody can be so specific as\n    saying, one - - they can do one future act of violence but not five. I\n    don’t know how - - I don’t know how you ever - - I’m not sure they\n    did intend that. I think it’s maybe - - I don’t know. I don’t know. If I\n    - - if I thought - - if that act of violence is to kill somebody else, that’s\n    a continuing threat to society. One person being killed is a threat,\n    whether it’s a prison - -\n\n    [. . .]\n\n    [Defense Counsel]: And hopefully we can - - we can figure this out.\n    Are you saying that if you thought there’s a probability that the\n    Defendant would commit a criminal act, singular, that would be\n    sufficient for you to answer Special Issue Number 1 yes, as opposed\n    to criminal acts, plural?\n\n    [Elliston]: Yeah, I think so. I think when you’ve already got a strike\n    against you and if you - - if some - - I just don’t - - you’re - - you’re -\n    - you’re speculating anyway at best whether or not they will commit\n    future acts. It’s - - no one really knows that. So I do not see how you\n    can break it down and say I think they’ll possibly commit one other\n    act, but that would certainly be their limit. I just don’t think you can\n    do that. If that’s what the legislature intended, I’m a believer in\n    following the law, regardless of my beliefs, but I just got to - - I don’t\n    - - I’d love to - -\n\n\n\n                                        100 \n \n\f(RR16:46-47). Importantly, Elliston testified that she would have to “think about\n\nthat.” (RR16:45).    Elliston vacillated on this issue. (RR16:45-47).    When the\n\nrecord reflects that a prospective juror vacillated or equivocated on her ability to\n\nfollow the law, the reviewing court must defer to the trial judge. Gardner, 306\n\nS.W.3d at 295.\n\n      Issue 23 should be overruled.\n\n                              Issue #24: Jerry Mace\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Jerry Mace for cause for the following\n\nreasons: (1) he would presume future danger if the individual is guilty of capital\n\nmurder; and (2) he is “mitigation impaired.” (RR18:68). Appellant’s challenge\n\nwas denied. (RR18:68). The record supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n      The State must prove the future dangerousness special issue beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(c). Any venire\n\nmember who would automatically answer the future dangerousness special issue in\n\nthe affirmative or who would place the burden of proof on the defense is\n\nchallengeable for cause under article 35.16(c)(2) for having a bias or prejudice\n\nagainst a law applicable to the case upon which the defense is entitled to rely.\n\nFeldman, 71 S.W.3d at 745.\n\n      Mace’s voir dire testimony shows he held no bias against the law governing\n\nthe first special issue. During voir dire, the prosecutor explained the various\n\n\n                                        101 \n \n\faspects of the first special issue, particularly that the State must prove that the\n\nanswer to that question is “yes.” (RR18:26-31, 30).    She explained that while the\n\njury could consider the facts of the case in answering the question, “it’s not an\n\nautomatic answer. In other words, just because you’re convicted of capital murder\n\ndoesn’t always mean that Special Issue Number 1 is yes.” (RR18:30). Mace\n\nindicated he understood.     (RR18:31).    He testified, “Well, you have to be\n\nconcerned about [the facts of the offense], but you’ve got to listen to everything\n\nthat went down and just determine then was it - - or is he going to do it again or\n\nmore than likely will he do it again[.]” (RR18:31). Moreover, when he was\n\nquestioned by the defense, Mace denied that a robbery indicates a person is a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. (RR18:57). Clearly, Mace understood the State had\n\nto prove future danger and he would hold the State to its burden.\n\n      Appellant’s complaint that Mace is “mitigation impaired” is also refuted by\n\nthe record.   On his questionnaire, Mace was asked what he thought about the fact\n\nthat “[s]ome people feel genetics, circumstances of birth, upbringing and\n\nenvironment should be considered when determining the proper punishment of\n\nsomeone convicted of a crime.”      Mace wrote, “B.S.! I’m not concerned about\n\nhow they were raised. Only that a horrific crime was committed.” (Mace, Juror\n\n615A, Q. p.6). Notably, this answer was given before Mace was instructed on the\n\n\n\n\n                                        102 \n \n\fapplicable law. During voir dire, defense counsel questioned Mace about his\n\nanswer. The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: You don’t have to use the - - use the word, but\n      does the B.S. represent the way you feel?\n\n      [Mace]: To bring it in as - - yes, in a sense. The - - the act itself was\n      the individual’s - - at that moment, what transpired growing up and - -\n      and such, probably got him to that point or got her to that point or\n      helped to get to that point, but that didn’t - - that doesn’t come into\n      play when it’s the act itself.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Okay. And does it come into play when you’re\n      considering punishment?\n\n      [Mace]: It may, depending on Special Issue Number 2 and the\n      mitigation circumstances. I don’t know. You know, if certain\n      circumstances say that - - I’d have to - - I’d have to hear it. I don’t\n      know. You know, I mean, I would be open to listening to it, and I\n      definitely wouldn’t be qualified to say that, well, background and\n      generics [sic] - - genetics have a lot of pull on this. I wouldn’t know\n      that. I would expect you all to tell me what is going on here.”\n\n(RR18: 58-59).    Mace testified he could consider mitigating circumstances, which\n\ncould warrant a life sentence. (RR18:60).      His testimony shows that he would\n\nconsider the evidence but that he might not regard it as mitigating. His testimony\n\ndoes not show that he would not consider the evidence at all. That Mace could\n\nconsider mitigating evidence is all that is constitutionally required.

He also complained that “she would consider\n\nit if the Defendant failed to testify during the penalty phase in consideration of\n\nSpecial Issue Number 2.”       (RR20:104).      Appellant’s challenge was denied.\n\n(RR20:104). The record supports the trial court’s ruling.\n\n      The law does not require that a juror presume a life sentence is the proper\n\npunishment. See Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 303. Nevertheless, the record shows\n\nGromacki would apply such a presumption.         During voir dire, defense counsel\n\nasked whether, if Gromacki found someone guilty of capital murder, she would\n\n“lean heavily toward the death penalty?” (RR20:81). Gromacki admitted that she\n\nwould but testified that “[her] answer for that, though, would not be like\n\n[100%][.]”   (RR20:81).     Defense counsel later returned to this subject and\n\nGromacki affirmed her previous stance.         (RR20:94).   Defense counsel asked\n\nwhether Gromacki was “telling us that you could not follow the presumption that\n\nlife without parole would be the appropriate punishment[.]” (RR20:95). Gromacki\n\n\n                                        104 \n \n\fresponded, “No[,]” that while she might lean toward the death penalty, she would\n\nstill follow the presumption regarding life without parole. (RR20:95).\n\n      Next, Gromacki was asked whether she agreed that she would have to hear\n\nfrom Appellant in order to answer Special Issue No. 2 “yes.”             (RR20:88).\n\nGromacki testified, “Not - - not necessarily, no.” (RR20:88). Then, the following\n\nexchange took place:\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Well, there are people that come in and say, you\n      know what, I could never find something sufficiently mitigating\n      unless - - without hearing from him, without hearing if he was sorry or\n      how he felt about it. Do you know what I mean?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Uh-huh, yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: How do you feel about that?\n\n      [Gromacki]: I could see that playing a part in the mitigating\n      circumstances.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: So it is something that you would consider?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: If the Defendant didn’t testify in the penalty\n      phase with regard to Special Issue Number 2, that is something you\n      would take into consideration?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Despite the fact that the law says he doesn’t have\n      to testify?\n\n      [Gromacki]: Yes.\n\n\n\n                                       105 \n \n\f(RR20:89). The trial court later rehabilitated Gromacki. The judge explained the\n\nlaw and asked whether Gromacki could follow the law. (RR20:103). Gromacki\n\nsaid she could. (RR20:103). The judge then asked whether Gromacki, knowing\n\nthe law, would require Appellant to testify as to Special Issue No. 2. (RR20:103).\n\nGromacki said “no.” (RR20:103).\n\n       The totality of Gromacki’s testimony indicates that she would be fair and\n\nimpartial and would listen to all evidence to answer the two special issues. This\n\nCourt should defer to the trial court’s resolution of any possible contradictory\n\nresponses. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n      Issue 25 should be overruled.\n\n                            Issue #26: Sarah Wagler\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Sarah Wagler for cause on the basis that she\n\ncould not fairly apply the presumption of innocence and that she “would require\n\nthe Defense to do something.” (RR34:83).        Appellant’s challenge was denied.\n\n(RR34:83). The record reflects that Wagler had no bias against the presumption of\n\ninnocence.   Although she would expect Appellant to present evidence in his\n\ndefense, she would not require him to.\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor asked Wagler whether she was familiar with\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. (RR34:17). Wagler responded, “That’s not to incriminate\n\nyourself, correct?” (RR34:17).    The prosecutor explained a defendant cannot be\n\n\n                                         106 \n \n\fcompelled to testify. (RR34:17). Wagler affirmed she understood. (RR34:17).\n\nThe prosecutor asked what Wagler’s verdict would be if the State failed to prove\n\nits case and Wagler responded she “would have to acquit.” (RR34:17).           The\n\nrecord is clear that Wagler could fairly apply the presumption of innocence.\n\n      Then, defense counsel questioned Wagler regarding the fact that the defense\n\nhas no burden of proof:\n\n      [Defense counsel]: You understand that this table has absolutely no\n      burden to present any evidence to the jury at all.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n      [Defense counsel]: And you can’t require that.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n      [. . .]\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: But under the law, we don’t have to prove a thing\n      to you.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: We don’t have to prove that Matthew Johnson is\n      not guilty. We don’t have to prove that Matthew Johnson would not\n      be a continuing threat to society.\n\n      [Wagler]: Uh-huh.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:     And we don’t have to prove any kind of\n      mitigation to you.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right. My reasonable expectation would be that if the\n      State presented X, Y, and Z, that the Defense would come back and\n      counter why X, Y, and Z did not exist or what made changes to X, Y,\n                                        107 \n \n\f      and Z, not just sit there and let them make a statement and not say\n      anything back. That’s what I meant by both good and bad - -\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: Okay.\n\n      [Wagler]: - - in play.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]: But you understand the State has got the burden\n      of proving it. We don’t have - - we don’t have to prove why the\n      State’s wrong or that the State’s wrong or - - or anything like that.\n\n      [Wagler]: Right.\n\n(RR34:60-61).    Later, however, when defense counsel asked whether she would\n\nrequire the defense to “counter” the State’s evidence, Wagler testified, “[I]f there’s\n\nno counter, then to me, you’re accepting what’s being said.”              (RR34:62).\n\nEssentially, Wagler would require the defense to “counter what is being said or\n\nwhat is being presented[.]” (RR34:62-63). Defense counsel explained the law did\n\nnot place any burden on the defense. (RR34:64). Wagler testified she “would\n\nhave an expectation that [the defense] would want to counter something that was\n\nnegative.” (RR34:64). Without that “counter,” Wagler testified that “then it’s just\n\nmy personal belief as to whether or not I happen to feel whichever person is\n\nspeaking for the State is saying the truth or not the truth.” (RR34:65). Wagler\n\ntestified she would require the defense to counter the State’s evidence or “assume\n\nthe responsibility that I’m going to make a personal judgment on my own as to\n\nwhether or not I believe what the State is presenting or not presenting.”\n\n(RR34:65).\n                                         108 \n \n\f      The trial court interjected and instructed Wagler regarding the presumption\n\nof innocence and the fact that a defendant has no burden of proof. (RR34:66).\n\nWagler affirmed she understood. (RR34:66). Wagler testified she could presume\n\ninnocence and return a verdict of not guilty even if the defense did not present any\n\nevidence. (RR34:67). She also testified she could answer Special Issue No. 1 “no”\n\nwithout hearing anything from the defense. (RR34:72).\n\n      The totality of Wagler’s testimony shows that she could apply the\n\npresumption of innocence and that she would not require the defense to present any\n\nevidence. This Court should defer to the trial court’s resolution of any possible\n\ncontradictory responses. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744.\n\n      Issue 26 should be overruled.\n\n                             Issue #27: Jerri Adams\n\n      At trial, Appellant challenged Jerri Adams for cause for the following\n\nreasons:   (1) she would disregard trial court instructions that conflicted with\n\nScripture; (2) she would extend more credibility to police officers; and, (3) she is\n\n“mitigation challenged based on her answers in her questionnaire and her answers\n\nto the Court.” (RR39:99). The trial court denied Appellant’s challenge, and with\n\ngood cause. (RR39:99).\n\n      Adams testified that she attends church regularly and that her faith is very\n\nimportant to her. (RR39:61-62). She testified her religious beliefs do not conflict\n\n\n                                        109 \n \n\fwith the death penalty. (RR39:16). On her questionnaire, in response to a question\n\nasking if the death penalty should be available for murder in the course of robbery,\n\nAdams wrote that she agreed and that the “laws of the land should be followed as\n\nlong as there is no contradiction with Scripture – the Bible gives several\n\nreasons/examples in both the old and new testaments where death was the\n\npunishment.” (Adams, Juror 1393A, Q. p.2). Defense counsel questioned Adams\n\nat length about this subject. (RR39:61-68). Adams clarified when she wrote the\n\naforementioned statement in her questionnaire, she “meant in the bigger picture[.]”\n\n(RR39:62). She testified, “If the law says you can do it, I still don’t think you can\n\ndo it, because I believe it is against [S]cripture.” (RR39:62). She mentioned\n\nabortion as an example. (RR39:62, 64). Adams “didn’t mean that [she was] not\n\ngoing to obey whatever the law is in the court for determining [a legal outcome].”\n\n(RR39:62).\n\n      Defense counsel again pursued the subject and at one point, Adams\n\nconceded if the instructed law conflicted with Scripture, Adams would follow\n\nScripture. (RR39:64-65).      Adams noted, however, she had never encountered\n\nsuch a situation and she could not imagine one. (RR39:65, 67).         She testified,\n\n“There’s not any - - there’s not a law that I - - that I know of that’s going to not\n\nallow me to follow.” (RR39:66).        Ultimately, Adams testified that she would\n\nfollow the law applicable in a death penalty case. (RR39:68).\n\n\n                                        110 \n \n\f      In Gardner, a prospective juror testified, like Adams, that if the law violated\n\nScripture, he would follow Scripture. Gardner, 306 S.W.3d at 298. Also like\n\nAdams, the juror testified he had never encountered such a situation. Id.       This\n\nCourt held the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in denying Gardner’s\n\nchallenge for cause because the existence of “some unknown, hypothetical\n\nsituation in which man’s law was in conflict with [the juror’s] understanding of\n\nScripture does not mean that he was unable or unwilling to follow the law in a\n\ndeath-penalty case.” Id. at 299.    The same logic applies here. Adams testified\n\nsome unknown situation may cause the law to conflict with Scripture. (RR39:65-\n\n66). Even so, she testified she would follow the law in a death penalty case.\n\n(RR39:68).    The trial judge was in the best position to evaluate Adams’ responses\n\nregarding her ability to follow the law, and he found them credible.\n\n      On her questionnaire, Adams wrote police officers are more likely to tell the\n\ntruth “because they are a group that has been culled from all that apply & they\n\nlikely better understand the repurcussions [sic] of not telling the truth.” (Adams,\n\nJuror 1393A, Q. p. 5). During voir dire, she affirmed she would wait to hear what\n\na witness had to say and would not automatically assume credibility based on one’s\n\nposition as a police officer. (RR39:29-30). Defense counsel posed the question to\n\nAdams again later. (RR39:95). Adams reiterated that she would not give the\n\nofficer more credibility. (RR39:95). She “would expect them to be telling the\n\n\n                                        111 \n \n\ftruth on things, but [. . .] I don’t think anybody else stepping up here would be any\n\nless credible than the officer just because he had a uniform.” (RR39:95-96). The\n\ntotality of Adams’ testimony indicates she would wait to hear a witness’s\n\ntestimony before passing judgment on credibility. Given her assurances to follow\n\nthe law, the trial court reasonably concluded that Adams held no bias. See Lane,\n\n822 S.W.2d at 45.\n\n        Finally, Appellant’s complaint that Adams was “mitigation challenged”\n\nlacks merit. Adams affirmed that if she heard evidence that was sufficiently\n\nmitigating, she would answer “yes” to Special Issue No. 2. (RR39:44, 46-47). She\n\ncould not envision a situation in which she would answer that issue “yes,” but she\n\ncould imagine the possibility. (RR39:46-47).       She affirmed she would keep an\n\nopen mind as to Special Issue No. 2. (RR39:53). In short, the record reflects no\n\nbias against Appellant on the mitigation issue, and Appellant fails to articulate one.\n\n        At trial, Appellant did not specify how Adams was “mitigation challenged”\n\nexcept by “her answers in her questionnaire.” (RR39:99). Appellant failed to\n\nidentify, however, which answers on Adams’ 19-page questionnaire indicated a\n\nbias.\n\n        In his brief, Appellant argues Adams’ emotional state during voir dire shows\n\na lack of objectivity to consider some of the evidence presented at trial.       This\n\n\n\n\n                                         112 \n \n\fcomplaint was not asserted at trial and was not properly preserved. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a).\n\n      Issue 27 should be overruled.\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has not shown even one erroneous ruling on his challenges for\n\ncause, much less three erroneous rulings. See Gonzales, 353 S.W.3d at 837.\n\nTherefore, he has not shown this Court that he was denied the use of a statutorily\n\nprovided peremptory strike. Issues 20 through 27 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 28 THROUGH 30:       THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR\nIN GRANTING THE STATE’S CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.\n\n      In Issues 28, 29, and 30, Appellant contends the trial court erred in granting\n\nthree of the State’s challenges for cause over his objection against venire members\n\nAlan Avidon, John Cavner, and Douglas Green. (Appellant’s Br. pp.87-91). He\n\ncontends the trial court abused its discretion in excusing these jurors. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                             Issue #28: Alan Avidon\n\n      Prior to voir dire, the State notified the trial court that Avidon had not\n\nanswered a question on his questionnaire truthfully. (RR13:4). Avidon checked\n\n“no” in response to a question asking “Have you . . . ever been accused, arrested or\n\nconvicted (including probation, deferred adjudication, conditional discharge, fine,\n\netc.) of a crime above the level of a traffic ticket.” (Avidon, Juror 247A, Q. p. 8)\n                                         113 \n \n\f(emphasis in original). The State ran Avidon’s criminal history and discovered\n\nAvidon had “received deferred [adjudication] in Dallas County for a DWI back in\n\n1980, as well as an arrest in New York for possession of a dangerous drug.”\n\n(RR13:4-5). Given Avidon’s lack of candor, the State challenged Avidon for\n\ncause. (RR13:5). Appellant objected. (RR13:5). The trial court brought Avidon\n\ninto the courtroom to inquire about his criminal history. (RR13:7).           Avidon\n\nadmitted to the two arrests. (RR13:9). He testified he “didn’t indicate it on the\n\nquestionnaire thinking that it was, you know, so long that the statute of limitation\n\npassed.” (RR13:9). The court excused the juror and granted the State’s challenge.\n\n(RR13:10).\n\n      A challenge for cause may properly be asserted on grounds not specifically\n\nenumerated in article 35.16 if the challenge is based on facts that show the\n\nprospective juror would be “incapable or unfit to serve on the jury.” See Mason v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1517032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1517032/mason-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).             These challenges are\n\naddressed to the trial court’s discretion.      See id.    Avidon withheld critical\n\ninformation when he failed to truthfully answer the question regarding his criminal\n\nhistory. Importantly, Avidon did not simply forget the arrests. (RR13:9). Instead,\n\nhe claimed he thought the statute of limitations had passed. (RR13:9).        Avidon\n\nplaced his veracity – and, therefore, his fitness to serve – in question.   The trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by granting the State’s challenge for cause against\n\n\n                                         114 \n \n\fAvidon.    To conclude otherwise would controvert this Court’s policy as stated in\n\nconnection with the State’s response to Issues 8-19. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Regardless, even if this Court finds that the trial court erred in granting the\n\nState’s challenge for cause against Avidon (which the State does not concede), any\n\nalleged error is harmless.    The erroneous excusing of a venire member will call\n\nfor a reversal only if the record shows that the error deprived the defendant of a\n\nlawfully constituted jury. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394. Appellant has made no such\n\nshowing.\n\n      Issue 28 should be overruled.\n\n                              Issue #29: John Cavner\n\n      During voir dire, the prosecutor explained the phases of a death penalty trial\n\nand asked Cavner whether he would be more inclined to answer the special issues\n\nin such a way that a life sentence would result. (RR17:122). Cavner responded, “I\n\nthink there is - - that I would be constantly trying to prove to myself that is not the\n\nright answer. In other words, that would be my - - my - - my leaning, my bias\n\nprobably.” (RR17:122). When asked whether he could guarantee he would set\n\naside his personal feelings and beliefs and decide the case based on the facts and\n\nevidence, Cavner testified that he could not make that guarantee. (RR17:124-25).\n\n      On the other hand, when questioned by the defense, Cavner testified he “can\n\nkeep an open mind.” (RR17:127). He testified he could listen to the evidence but\n\n\n                                         115 \n \n\f“I - - as I’ve said before, I know I’m going to have a, going in, bias[.]”\n\n(RR17:130). At one point, he finally said that if he “could find nothing mitigating,\n\nthen [he could assess the death sentence].” (RR17:130). Apparently recognizing\n\nCavner’s inconsistent answers, the trial court attempted to clarify Cavner’s\n\nresponses. The following exchange took place:\n\n      [Trial Court]: All I want you to do is tell me, and I know you will,\n      how - - exactly how you feel and believe. Would - - will you always\n      find mitigating evidence regardless of the evidence?\n\n      [Cavner]: Well, I answered his question the way I did because I think\n      it will be very difficult for there not to be mitigating evidence.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Well, that’s all right, too. Can there ever be - - with\n      your opinion about the death penalty and your opposition to it, again,\n      if you want to look at Special Issue Number 2, can you - - will you\n      ever be - - regardless of the evidence, will you ever be able to answer\n      that issue yes, knowing death - - I’m sorry, no, knowing that the death\n      penalty will result? Whatever you say that’s it.\n\n      [Cavner]: I don’t believe I could do it.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Well - -\n\n      [Cavner]: I can’t do it.\n\n      [Trial Court]: Any doubt in your mind?\n\n      [Cavner]: No doubt.\n\n(RR17:132-33). The State challenged Cavner for cause because “he would never\n\never be able to answer Special Issue Number 2 in such a way that would result in\n\n\n\n\n                                        116 \n \n\fthe death sentence.” (RR17:134).       The trial court granted the State’s challenge\n\nover Appellant’s claim that Cavner was qualified. (RR17:134).\n\n      The totality of Cavner’s voir dire testimony clearly shows his beliefs about\n\ncapital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his\n\nduties as a juror in accordance with the court’s instructions and his oath.\n\nSee Colburn, 966 S.W.2d at 517.       At a minimum, he was a vacillating juror and\n\nthe Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on the challenge for cause.\n\nGranados, 85 S.W.3d at 231.        To conclude otherwise would controvert this\n\nCourt’s policy as stated earlier. Jones, 982 S.W.2d at 394.\n\n      Issue 29 should be overruled.\n\n                            Issue #30: Douglas Green\n\n      Douglas Green gave multiple contradictory answers during voir dire. The\n\nState challenged him for cause and that challenge was granted. (RR21:122-23).\n\n      In his questionnaire, in response to convictions based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, Green wrote that he agreed, “If DNA or forensic evidence to 100%\n\nconclusion.” (Green, Juror 597A, Q. p.3). When questioned by the prosecutor,\n\nGreen affirmed that “[u]nder the circumstances with a death penalty, yes[,]” he\n\nwould require the State to prove its case beyond all doubt.        (RR21:98).    He\n\nunderstood that this would be holding the State to a higher burden of proof than\n\nrequired. (RR21:97-98).      When questioned by the defense, Green testified he\n\n\n                                         117 \n \n\fwould “follow the law” and affirmed he would not hold the State to a higher\n\nburden of proof. (RR21:115). Jurors may be challenged and removed for bias\n\nagainst the law, which includes the burden of proof. See Bodde v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788261\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788261/bodde-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978) (finding juror properly excluded where\n\njuror insisted she would hold the state to a more stringent standard of proof than\n\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt\").\n\n      Next, the prosecutor explained that at trial, the State is required to prove\n\ncertain elements for a conviction of capital murder.   (RR21:75-77). She gave a\n\nhypothetical in which the State alleged a murder committed during the course of a\n\nsexual assault. (RR21:75, 77). In the hypothetical, the State proved the murder,\n\nbut instead of sexual assault, proved a robbery. (RR21:74-76). Green testified that\n\nhe “might” still convict of capital murder even though the State did not prove the\n\noffense as alleged. (RR21:78). The defense attempted to rehabilitate Green on this\n\nissue, but Green testified that “if [he] knew someone had committed murder, [he]\n\nwould have a hard time[.]” (RR21:107-08). Then, he testified he would follow the\n\nlaw. (RR21:108).\n\n      Finally, in his questionnaire, in response to a question asking what would be\n\nimportant to him in deciding whether a person should receive a life or death\n\nsentence, Green wrote, “Does the person have an evil heart.” (Green, Juror 597A,\n\nQ. p.3). When questioned by the prosecutor, he testified he would “rather hear the\n\n\n                                       118 \n \n\fperson tell me why than someone else speak for them.” (RR21:95). He testified,\n\n“I can’t imagine if I was in that - - in the other position that I wouldn’t want to tell\n\nmy story.” (RR21:95). When defense counsel asked whether Green could follow\n\nan instruction on the Fifth Amendment right to silence, Green testified, “I could. I\n\nwould feel it’s strange, but I - - I could.” (RR21:119).\n\n      Green gave contradictory answers regarding several critical issues: (1) his\n\nability to apply the proper standard of proof; (2) his ability to require that the State\n\nprove each and every element; and, (3) a defendant’s right to remain silent. The\n\nState challenged him on all three of these bases, and the trial court acted well\n\nwithin its discretion in granting the challenge. (RR21:122-23). Green was a\n\nclassic vacillating juror. The Court should defer to the trial court’s judgment on\n\nthe challenge for cause. Granados v.

He fails to specify, however, whether he is referring to the trial court’s\n\ndenial of his challenges for cause or the granting of the State’s challenges for\n\ncause.\n\n         In any event, Appellant has failed to show he was deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury.

He\n      took two lighters from a display to the right of the register. He took two\n      packages of cigarettes from an overhead dispenser. He took the ring Nancy\n      was wearing on her right hand. When Nancy opened the register, Appellant\n      took all of the cash and some of the coins.\n\n     After Appellant took the money from the register he flicked his lighter and\n      the flame ignited the liquid on Nancy.\n\n     While Nancy, engulfed in flames from her shoulders up, ran out from behind\n      the counter, Appellant calmly walked out of the store with his plastic bottle\n      and the stolen property. On his way out, he stopped to take some candy and\n      stuff it in his pocket.\n\n     Appellant made no effort to help Nancy extinguish the flames.\n\n\n                                         122 \n \n\f     Appellant fled the store and hid from police in the neighborhood behind the\n      Whip In.\n\n     Nancy told police that “a black male, heavy-set, short dark hair, and a\n      chubby face, came into the store and demanded money from her. She\n      advised he took the money and then he poured something on her. She didn’t\n      know what - - what it was, and then he lit her on fire.” (RR45:82).\n\n     Nancy was rushed to the hospital. She suffered second-, third-, and fourth-\n      degree burns over forty percent of her body.\n\n     Five days after Appellant set her on fire, life support was discontinued.\n      Nancy died as a result of her burns.\n\n     Appellant was arrested shortly after the offense in the neighborhood behind\n      the Whip-In. When he was handcuffed, he asked the officers what had taken\n      them so long. He commented that they were “getting slow.” (RR44:186).\n\n     Three lighters, Nancy’s ring, coins, and cash were recovered from\n      Appellant’s pocket after his arrest.\n\n     A plastic bottle was found in the grass behind the Whip-In. DNA on the\n      plastic water bottle was identified as Appellant’s.\n\n     Testing of the contents of the plastic water bottle and Nancy’s clothing\n      showed a medium petroleum distillate of the primary recovery and a lower\n      level of isopropyl alcohol. A medium petroleum distillate is an ignitable\n      fluid, which is found in charcoal starter fluid, paint thinner, and mineral\n      spirits.\n\n       Despite the aforementioned evidence, Appellant nevertheless contends that\n\nno evidence proves he went to the Whip-In “to murder the Complainant in order to\n\nrob her[,]” and that, as such, no evidence shows his specific intent to kill.   In\n\nsupport of his contention, he cites his own testimony from the punishment phase\n\nthat he had no intent to murder Nancy. (Appellant’s Br. p. 96).

Crim. App. 1980)). Appellant walked in to the Whip-In\n\narmed with his plastic bottle of flammable liquid and his lighter. The first thing\n\nthat he did when he walked behind the counter was pour that liquid over Nancy’s\n\nupper body. Immediately after he robbed her, he flicked his lighter and ignited the\n\nfluid on her body. That Appellant actually poured the lighter fluid over Nancy and\n\nlater ignited it supports a conclusion of specific intent. Notably, he made no effort\n\nto call an ambulance or extinguish the flames. He simply left by walking casually\n\n\n                                        124 \n \n\fout of the store as his elderly victim was left to contend with the flames now\n\nengulfing her entire upper body. Based on this evidence, a rational jury could have\n\nfound Appellant intended to kill Nancy. See Patrick, 906 S.W.2d at 487 (finding\n\nevidence legally sufficient to prove intent to kill in light of the extent of the\n\ncomplainant’s injuries, how the injuries were inflicted, and the relative size and\n\nstrength of the parties).\n\n       Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to prove the murder took place during\n\nthe course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. Appellant argues the\n\ntheft was unrelated to the murder and was an afterthought, and thus is insufficient\n\nto prove capital murder. (Appellant’s Br. at 97). Appellant’s argument is once\n\nagain contradicted by the surveillance video. The video shows that Appellant went\n\ninto the Whip-In that morning with his plastic bottle of flammable liquid and his\n\nlighter.   He was fully prepared to commit robbery.        Once inside the store, he\n\npoured the fluid over Nancy.       Then he took the lighters, the cigarettes, Nancy’s\n\nring, and the money.        After he had what he wanted and had no further need for\n\nNancy, he flicked his lighter and the flame ignited the fluid on her body.      This\n\ngave him the opportunity to flee the scene. In short, the murder and the robbery\n\nare closely intertwined. Appellant poured the lighter fluid over Nancy so that she\n\nwould cooperate and open the register. He waited to set her on fire until after she\n\nopened the register and he had a chance to take all that he wanted. Once he had\n\n\n                                          125 \n \n\fwhat he wanted, he set Nancy on fire and left. The robbery was anything but an\n\nafterthought.\n\n      Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict,\n\na rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of capital murder\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the evidence is legally sufficient to support\n\nthe conviction.\n\n      Issue 33 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 34 AND 35:     THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF THE INSTANT OFFENSE AS WELL AS STILL\nPHOTOGRAPHS FROM THAT VIDEO. ALTERNATIVELY, ANY ERROR IS HARMLESS.\n\n      In his Issue 34, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to 24 still photographs from the surveillance video of the instant offense.\n\nIn Issue 35, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the\n\nsurveillance video over his Rule 403 objection. Appellant’s contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      During a hearing outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected that the\n\nsurveillance video of the instant offense was unfairly prejudicial and asked the trial\n\ncourt to conduct “a 403 balancing test.” (RR44:33). The trial court overruled\n\nAppellant’s objection and stated that “the evidence about to be presented by the\n\n\n\n\n                                         126 \n \n\fState is more probative than prejudicial.” (RR44:33). The surveillance video was\n\noffered and admitted and published to the jury.14 (RR44:48-49; SX#16-17).\n\n              Later, the State moved to admit State’s Exhibits 79-102, which are still\n\nphotographs taken from the surveillance video.

The fact is that\n              the content contained in these photographs is already in evidence\n              through the video, and this just allows the State to show this and point\n              out the - - the specific - - the specific aspects of the video without\n              playing it again.\n                                                            \n14\n   Two copies of the surveillance video were admitted.

State’s Exhibit #17 is the compilation version, which combines the footage\nfrom the cameras for ease of the viewer. (RR44:47-49; SX#17). State’s Exhibit #17 is the\nversion that was shown to the jury. (RR44:49; SX#17).\n                                                               127 \n \n\f      [Trial Court]: All right.

The footage from the surveillance video is in black-and-white and\n\nis 4 minutes and 44 seconds long. (SX#17). Given the relative positions of the\n\ncameras, at times, some angles offer a closer view of Nancy and Appellant behind\n\nthe sales counter as she opens the register and as he takes lighters, cigarettes,\n\nmoney, and her ring. (SX#17).      The later portion of the video is graphic as it\n\nshows an elderly woman on fire and the removal of her shirt in an attempt to put\n\nout the flames engulfing her upper body. (SX#17). The video is without a doubt,\n\nboth graphic and disturbing.     Yet, the video simply shows the offense as it\n\noccurred.     It depicts nothing more than the reality of the brutal crime that\n\nAppellant committed.\n\n      Furthermore, the video aided the jury in understanding how the crime\n\noccurred. In Gordon v. State, this Court described the utility of video recordings\n\nas follows:\n\n      Video recordings in general may be more helpful to a jury than still\n      photographs. While still photographs offer to the jury an isolated and\n      fixed content, a video recording allows a more panoramic\n      representation of the physical and forensic evidence.\n\nGordon v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1636794\"><a href=\"/opinion/1636794/gordon-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).           Beyond the\n\ndepiction of the offense itself, the video helped the jury understand the testimony\n                                       130 \n \n\fregarding the crime scene, including the layout of the sales counter at the Whip-In\n\nand Appellant and Nancy’s position during the offense.\n\n      Appellant correctly states “There was no question for the jury as to how the\n\nvictim died.” (Appellant’s Br. p. 104).     It was undisputed that Nancy died as a\n\nresult of thermal injuries.   What was disputed, however, was Appellant’s intent.\n\nAt no time did Appellant concede his guilt for the offense of capital murder.\n\nIndeed, during voir dire, defense counsel told many of the potential jurors that in\n\ncounsel’s opinion, the jury would never reach the punishment phase because they\n\nwould not find Appellant guilty. (RR5-RR42). The State was obligated to prove\n\neach and every element of the offense, including Nancy’s identity and all of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding her robbery and murder.        The video of the offense is\n\nrelevant because it shows the offense as it happened. It establishes not only that\n\nAppellant committed the instant offense, but also the way in which he committed\n\nit. And, the way in which Appellant committed the offense – walked into the\n\nWhip-In with a flammable liquid, went straight to the sales counter, poured the\n\nliquid over the elderly female clerk’s head and upper body, robbed her, set her on\n\nfire, then walked casually out of the store leaving his victim engulfed in flames – is\n\nhighly probative of his intent. In sum, the video of the offense is highly probative\n\nof Appellant’s specific intent to kill Nancy Harris, and is in no way unfairly\n\n\n\n\n                                         131 \n \n\fprejudicial to Appellant. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting it.\n\n                            Issue #34: Still Photographs\n\n       The trial court did not err in admitting the still photographs as they are not\n\ncumulative of the video. This Court has held that “a still photograph is not\n\ncumulative of a videotape.” Matamoros v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454539\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454539/matamoros-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 476 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1995). A still photograph allows the jury to examine the scene in detail.\n\nId.   Like the video, the twenty-four still photographs are in black-and-white.\n\n(SX#79-102). These photographs were used by Detective Tooke as he described\n\nthe details of the offense. (RR44:229-34).        While it is true that the jury had\n\nalready seen the surveillance video, a single viewing of a 5 minute video is hardly\n\nsufficient time for the jury to take in all of the details. Rather than play the video\n\nmultiple times during Detective Tooke’s testimony, the prosecutor used the\n\nphotographs to describe the critical details from the offense.\n\n       For example, State’s Exhibits #79-82 shows Appellant as he enters the\n\nWhip-In. (SX#79-82). State’s Exhibit #83 shows Appellant carrying the plastic\n\nbottle in his right hand. (SX#83).      State’s Exhibit #84 shows Appellant as he\n\nstarts to walk behind the sales counter. (SX#84). State’s Exhibit #85 shows\n\nAppellant behind the sales counter with Nancy. (SX#85). He has a lighter in his\n\nhand and is taking lighters from a display. (RR44:230; SX#85).

State’s\n\nExhibits #87 and 88 show Appellant taking cigarettes. (RR44:231; SX#87, 88).\n\nState’s Exhibit #89 shows Appellant’s hand on Nancy’s hand.              (RR44:231;\n\nSX#89).     State’s Exhibits #90 and 91 show Appellant licking his fingers.\n\n(RR44:232; SX#90, 91). State’s Exhibits #92 again shows Appellant’s hand on\n\nNancy’s hand. (RR44:232; SX#92). State’s Exhibit #93 shows Appellant’s hand\n\non the counter. (RR44:232; SX#93). State’s Exhibits #94 and 95 show the register\n\ndrawer open. (RR44:232; SX#94, 95).          State’s Exhibit #96 shows Appellant’s\n\nhand going from the register drawer. (RR44:232-33; SX#96). State’s Exhibit #97\n\nshows the fire as it is reflected on the register monitor. (SX#97). State’s Exhibits\n\n#98-102 show Nancy on fire and Appellant as he walks out of the store. (SX#98-\n\n102).\n\n        Each photograph provided an additional detail critical to the jury’s\n\nunderstanding of the offense and the crime scene.         Notably, the prosecutor’s\n\nquestioning of Detective Tooke regarding the photographs was very brief,\n\ncomprising only six pages of an otherwise lengthy record. (RR44:229-34).\n\n        Appellant argues that State’s Exhibits #98, 99, and 100 “are exceptionally\n\nprejudicial in that they depict Ms. Harris on fire. . . . The jury did not need to see\n\nstill photographs of a burning woman to discern what had taken place.”\n\n(Appellant’s Br. p. 99). The State acknowledges that State’s Exhibits #98, 99, and\n\n\n                                         133 \n \n\f100 are graphic in that these photographs show Nancy on fire. (SX#98, 99, 100).\n\nNevertheless, these photographs are not overly gruesome, and they provided the\n\njury with the means to focus on some highly relevant details of the offense.\n\n       State’s Exhibit #98 shows Nancy from the chest down, as she runs out from\n\nbehind the counter and Appellant walks out behind her. (SX#98). State’s Exhibit\n\n#99 shows Nancy on fire, and provides another view of Appellant casually leaving\n\nthe store. (SX#99). State’s Exhibit #100 shows Nancy on fire as she walks toward\n\nthe sink. (SX#100). Importantly, the left side of the photograph shows Appellant\n\nwalking out of the store carrying the plastic bottle. (SX#100). The complained-of\n\nexhibits helped the jury to understand not only what Appellant did to Nancy but\n\nalso how, afterward, he fled the scene, taking his bottle of flammable liquid with\n\nhim.\n\n       The probative value of all 24 photographs was not substantially outweighed\n\nby their prejudicial effect. See Tex. R. Evid. 403. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting them.    See Matamoros, 901 S.W.2d at 476 (finding no\n\nabuse of discretion in admitting crime scene photographs over Matamoros’\n\nobjection that they were cumulative of a crime scene video previously admitted as\n\nthe photographs provided different vantage points, which might enhance the jury’s\n\nunderstanding of the crime scene and they permitted the jurors to examine the\n\n\n\n\n                                        134 \n \n\fscene in detail). At a minimum, its decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n                           Any Alleged Error is Harmless\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting the video and the still photographs,\n\nAppellant was not harmed.       The erroneous admission of photographs is non-\n\nconstitutional error governed by Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.2(b). See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 44.2(b). Nonconstitutional error that does not affect the substantial rights\n\nof the defendant is disregarded by the appellate court. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\nA substantial right is affected when the error has a “substantial and injurious effect\n\nor influence in determining the jury’s verdict.” See King v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518709\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518709/king-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n271 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). In making this determination, this Court may consider\n\nthe entire record, including the nature of the evidence supporting the verdict, and\n\nthe character of the error and its relationship to other evidence. See Morales v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2187950\"><a href=\"/opinion/2187950/morales-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n      Here, overwhelming evidence supported the jury’s verdict. When officers\n\narrived at the Whip-In, Nancy told them that a man had robbed her and poured\n\nsomething on her. (RR44:69). She described her attacker as a “heavy-set black\n\nmale with blue jeans . . . and a T-shirt.” (RR44:70).       At the hospital, she told\n\nWilson that “a black male, heavy-set, short dark hair, and a chubby face, came into\n\nthe store and demanded money from her. She advised he took the money and then\n\n\n                                         135 \n \n\fhe poured something on her. She didn’t know what - - what it was, and then he lit\n\nher on fire.” (RR45:82).\n\n      When Perez searched the neighborhood behind the Whip-In, he saw a man\n\nmatching Nancy’s description. (RR44:178, 181-82).            After a foot chase, Perez\n\narrested the man, Appellant. (RR44:181-86). Appellant asked police, “What took\n\nyou so long[?] Y’all are getting slow.” (RR44:186). From Appellant’s pockets,\n\npolice collected a used lighter, a red lighter, a purple lighter, a gold ring, a car key,\n\ncoins, and cash. (RR44:75-78; SX#6, 26, 28-30, 59, 60).\n\n      Investigators collected pooled liquid underneath the floor mat behind the\n\nsales counter as well as a plastic drinking bottle found in the grass behind the store.\n\n(RR44:111-12; RR45:50-51, 60-62; SX#35, 36, 114, 115, 117, 118, 129). Testing\n\nof contents of the plastic bottle and Nancy’s clothing showed “a medium\n\npetroleum distillate of the primary recovery, and . . . a lower level of isopropyl\n\nalcohol.” (RR45:113-14; SX#137). The pooled liquid from under the floor mat\n\nalso contained medium petroleum distillate as did Appellant’s t-shirt, pants, belt,\n\nleft shoe and sock, and his right shoe. (RR45:116-17; SX#138). A medium\n\npetroleum distillate is an ignitable liquid often encountered as charcoal starter\n\nfluid, paint thinner or mineral spirits. (RR45:114).\n\n      Appellant’s DNA was found on the exterior of the plastic bottle and he was\n\nincluded as a possible contributor of a DNA profile from the interior and exterior\n\n\n                                          136 \n \n\fopening of the bottle. (RR45:154-55; SX#142).         Appellant was included as a\n\npossible contributor of a low level sample of DNA from the cash drawer.\n\n(RR45:156; SX#142).      And, a partial DNA profile from the cigarette package\n\nmatched Appellant.     (RR45:156; SX#142).        Finally, the jury heard medical\n\ntestimony regarding the severity and extent of Nancy’s injuries.\n\n      Accordingly, taking the entire record into consideration, Appellant was not\n\nharmed by the admission of the surveillance video or the still photographs taken\n\nfrom the video. Issues 34 and 35 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 36 AND 37: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED THE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VICTIM IN\nTHE HOSPITAL. ALTERNATIVELY, ANY ERROR IS HARMLESS.\n\n      In Issue 36, Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting, over his\n\nRule 403 objection, nine photographs taken during Nancy’s autopsy. In Issue 37,\n\nAppellant contends the trial court erred in admitting, over his Rule 403 objection,\n\nseven photographs of Nancy taken at the hospital prior to her death. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      During trial, in a hearing outside the presence of the jury, the State offered\n\ninto evidence nine autopsy photographs: State’s Exhibit Nos. 9, 151, 152, 153,\n\n\n\n                                        137 \n \n\f154, 155, 156, 157, and 158.15 (RR45:182). An additional 34 photographs taken\n\nduring the autopsy were not offered. (RR45:183). The State also offered seven\n\nphotographs taken of Nancy at the hospital prior to her death: State’s Exhibit Nos.\n\n144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150. (RR45:182).                                    An additional 22 photographs\n\ntaken at the hospital were not offered. (RR45:183-84).\n\n              Appellant objected to all sixteen photographs on the basis of his previously\n\nfiled Pretrial Motion #57 as well as Rule 403. (RR45:183).                                     The trial court\n\naffirmed it had reviewed all of the photographs, including those not offered into\n\nevidence, and overruled Appellant’s objection.                                   (RR45:184-85).      The nine\n\nautopsy photographs were admitted through Dr. Dyer, the medical examiner.\n\n(RR46:30). The seven hospital photographs were admitted through Dr. Hunt, the\n\nphysician who treated Nancy at the Burn Unit at Parkland Hospital. (RR46:16).\n\n                                                                    Analysis\n\n                                                         Issue #36: Autopsy Photographs\n\n              The trial court did not err in admitting nine photographs taken during\n\nNancy’s autopsy. All 9 photographs of Nancy’s deceased body were displayed to\n\nthe jury in color. (RR45:182; SX#9, 151-58).                                    Although Nancy is not clothed,\n\nmost of the photographs are close-ups of specific parts of her body. And, the\n\n\n                                                            \n15\n  Prior to trial, the State offered into evidence State’s Pretrial Exhibit #2, which contains copies\nof all photographs taken during Nancy’s autopsy and all photographs taken of Nancy at the\nhospital prior to her death. (RR41:25; State’s Pretrial Exhibit #2).\n                                                                      138 \n \n\fphotographs are not repetitious; each depicts a different area of injury.       For\n\nexample, State’s Exhibit #9, the autopsy identification photograph, is a close up of\n\nNancy’s face. (RR46:37; SX#9). State’s Exhibit #152 shows the back of Nancy’s\n\nhead and top of her shoulders. (RR46:35; SX#152). State’s Exhibit #153 shows\n\nNancy’s back. (RR46:36; SX#153). State’s Exhibit #154 shows the back of\n\nNancy’s left leg. (RR46:36; SX#154). State’s Exhibit #155 shows the top of\n\nNancy’s left hand. (RR46:36; SX#155). State’s Exhibit #156 shows the underside\n\nof Nancy’s left hand. (RR46:36-37; SX#156). State’s Exhibit #157 shows the top\n\nof Nancy’s right hand. (RR46:37; SX#157). State’s Exhibit #158 shows Nancy’s\n\nleft foot. (RR46:37; SX#158).\n\n      State’s Exhibit #151 is not a close-up photograph.         It shows Nancy’s\n\nunclothed body from the waist down. (RR46:33; SX#151). Her private area is\n\ncovered on the photograph by what appears to be a white box.             (RR46:33;\n\nSX#151). A photograph, which is used to describe the complainant’s injuries, is\n\nnot inadmissible simply because it depicts an unclothed body.

Like the autopsy photographs, Nancy is not clothed but\n\nmost of the photographs are close-ups of specific body parts. The photographs are\n\nnot repetitious; each depicts a different area of injury. State’s Exhibit #144 shows\n\nNancy’s badly burned left leg next to her unburned right leg.

State’s Exhibit #146 shows Nancy’s\n\nseverely burned upper body. (SX#146). She is attached to a ventilator. (RR46:18;\n\nSX#146). She is unclothed, but because she is so severely burned, her breasts are\n\nnot easily discerned. (SX#146). State’s Exhibit #147 shows the underside of\n\nNancy’s left arm. (RR46:18-19; SX#147). State’s Exhibit #148 shows the top of\n\n\n                                        141 \n \n\fNancy’s right arm and a small part of her unclothed right side.         (RR46:19;\n\nSX#148). State’s Exhibit #149 is a close-up of the top of Nancy’s severely burned\n\nhead and face. (RR46:19-20; SX#149). State’s Exhibit #150 shows Nancy’s\n\nunclothed lower back.

They were used by Dr. Hunt to explain those injuries. (RR46:16-20). Dr.\n\nHunt testified Nancy was burned over 40% of her body. (RR46:10). He used the\n\nphotographs to identify Nancy’s second-, third-, and fourth-degree burns.\n\n(RR46:16-20; SX#144-150).       It would have been impossible for the jury to\n\nunderstand the nature and extent of her injuries without seeing photographs of\n\nthem.\n\n        Moreover, the photographs are probative of Appellant’s intent.

The prosecutor noted that the statement was an excited utterance and\n\nthat it was nontestimonial. (RR44:69).         Appellant’s objection was overruled.\n\n(RR44:69).

And I believe under the law, we’re entitled to\n      present victim impact testimony so that the jury has something to\n      weigh as it relates to Special Issue 2 and the mitigation. The question\n      is, is it sufficiently mitigating, and the impact on the victim is\n      certainly relevant to that.\n\n            I would also argue as to the hearsay objection that it is a dying\n      declaration, and that by the Defendant setting her on fire and causing\n      her death, he’s waived a confrontation argument.\n\n             And, as to 403, I think the Court should watch the video, but it\n      would be - - certainly before making the ruling, we would ask the\n      Judge to watch the video to make that determination, but there’s\n      nothing more probative as to the impact of this crime on the victim\n      than the jury being able to see it themselves.\n\n(RR51:69).      The trial court watched the video and overruled Appellant’s\n\nobjection. (RR51:70; SX#187).\n\n      State’s Exhibit #187 was offered and admitted over Appellant’s objection\n\nthrough the testimony of Officer Simon. (RR51:81; SX#187). On the video,\n                                        146 \n \n\fNancy can be heard shouting repeatedly, “Help me,” “Oh God, help me,” “Help\n\nme, please.” (SX#187).       Nancy provides her name, date of birth, address, and\n\ntelephone number. (SX#187).       She says that she is “going to faint.” (SX#187).\n\nShe says, “guy tried to rob me.” (SX#187). When she is asked whether the man\n\nthrew something on her, she says that the man threw Chlorox and fire. (SX#187).\n\nNancy described the man as a young Black male, short and heavy set with a round\n\nface. (SX#187).\n\n                                   Applicable Law\n\n                                       Hearsay\n\n      Hearsay is defined as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant\n\nwhile testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted.” Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). The matter asserted is defined as “any\n\nmatter explicitly asserted, and any matter implied by a statement, if the probative\n\nvalue of the statement as offered flows from declarant’s belief as to the matter.”\n\nTex.

State, this court described the\n\nbasis for this exception as follows:\n\n      [It is] a psychological one, namely, the fact that when a man is in the\n      instant grip of violent emotion, excitement or pain, he ordinarily loses\n      the capacity for reflection necessary to the fabrication of a falsehood\n      and the truth will come out.

See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h). Appellant cites\n\nthe complained-of testimony and generally asserts that it is hearsay, but he fails to\n\noffer any specific argument or authority in support of his contentions.

Nancy’s statements were admissible as an\n\nexcited utterance. See Tex. R. Evid. 803(2). When Nancy made the complained-of\n\nstatements, she had just experienced a startling event: she was robbed and set on\n\nfire.   Indeed, the flames on her body were extinguished only seconds before she\n\nmade the complained-of statements.           She was screaming for help.    She was\n\nclearly still under the stress or excitement caused by the offense and her statements\n\nconcerned the startling event.   See Tex. R.

Statements are\n\nnon-testimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under\n\ncircumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation\n\nis to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.

When the police arrived at the Whip-In, Nancy was still on fire.\n\nShe made the complained-of statements shortly after the flames were extinguished.\n\nAt the time, police were trying to help Nancy and determine what had happened;\n\nthey had not yet received notification regarding the store’s panic alarm. (RR44:68-\n\n69). It was clearly an ongoing emergency situation.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nstatements.   At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n                  Issue #39: Nancy’s Statements at the Hospital\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting Officer Wilson’s testimony regarding\n\nNancy’s statements to him at the hospital. Nancy’s statements were admissible as\n\na dying declaration. See Tex. R. Evid. 804(b)(2). Nancy made the complained-of\n\nstatements to Officer Wilson minutes after she arrived in the hospital emergency\n\nroom to be treated for severe burns. (RR45:80). Shortly before she arrived at the\n\n\n                                       150 \n \n\fhospital, Nancy, a 76-year-old woman with a pacemaker and diabetes, had been\n\ndoused with a flammable liquid and set on fire.     She was about to be intubated.\n\nGiven the fact that she was in the emergency room and considering the nature and\n\nextent of her injuries as well as her own medical history, the trial court could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Nancy believed she was dying when she made the\n\nstatements regarding the cause or circumstances of her impending death. See\n\nGardner, 306 S.W.3d at 291-92 (finding no abuse of discretion in admitting\n\ncomplainant’s statements to 911 operator that her husband shot her even though\n\ncomplainant did not expressly state that she was dying and no one explicitly told\n\nher that she was dying).   Because the complained-of statements were admissible\n\nas a dying declaration, Appellant’s confrontation right was not violated.        See\n\nGardner, 306 S.W.3d at 288 n.20.\n\n      The complained-of statements were also admissible as an excited utterance.\n\nZuliani, 97 S.W.3d at 595. Nancy was still under the stress of the startling event\n\ndescribed above. The fact that some time had passed between the event and her\n\nstatements is merely a factor to be considered in the analysis. Id. at 596 (noting\n\nthat whether time has elapsed since the startling event is only one factor to be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a statement is an excited utterance). As stated,\n\nNancy made the statements shortly after she arrived in the emergency room and\n\n\n\n\n                                        151 \n \n\fwhile she was being treated for her burns. She was still under the pain and stress\n\nof the startling event and her statements concerned that startling event.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nstatements.      At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of reasonable\n\ndisagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542.\n\n        Issue #40: Nancy’s Statements at the Whip-In (Punishment Phase)\n\n      The trial court did not err in admitting during the punishment phase of trial,\n\nthe in-car police video containing Nancy’s statements to police regarding the\n\ninstant offense.    As previously argued in response to Issue 38, Nancy’s statements\n\nto police when they arrived at the Whip-In were admissible as excited utterances\n\nand because they were non-testimonial in nature. Since the testimony of the two\n\nofficers was admissible, the video is therefore admissible. See Williams v.

Nancy’s descriptions of the man who attacked her did not have a\n\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s verdicts.\n\nBefore any of the officers testified about Nancy’s statements to them, the jury saw\n\nthe surveillance video. (RR44:49; SX#17).       The jury saw with their own eyes,\n\nhow on May 20, 2012, Appellant walked in to the Whip-In, robbed Nancy, and set\n\nher on fire.    (SX#17). Nancy’s descriptions to police regarding the person who\n\nrobbed her and set her on fire only confirmed what the jury had already seen.\n\n      Issues 38, 39, and 40 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 41: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ADMITTED\nEVIDENCE OF APPELLANT’S ACTIONS AFTER HE FLED THE WHIP-IN.\n\n      In Issue 41, Appellant contends that, during the guilt phase, the trial court\n\nerred under Rule 404(b) in admitting evidence of the bad acts and offenses he\n\ncommitted after he fled the Whip-In.

Medley’s testimony helped the jury\n\nto understand where Appellant went when he fled the Whip-In and how he tried to\n\nget rid of the t-shirt he wore while he committed the offense.

Marecle testified that Appellant\n\nappeared on his porch, asking for help. (RR44:157, 159, 166-67; SX#55).       His\n\n“eyes were really wide and big.” (RR44:169).     He was wearing pants and black-\n\nrim glasses, but no shirt. (RR44:162). He tried to push his way into Marecle’s\n\nhome. (RR44:159-60). Marecle pushed Appellant outside. (RR44:160, 169).\n\nThere, Appellant pushed Marecle to the ground. (RR44:161, 169). When Marecle\n\nstood up, Appellant took the glasses off of Marecle’s face and fled.

When\n\nDenson confronted him, Appellant approached him saying “man, I’m in a bad\n\nway.” (RR45:9, 11-12; SX#51-53).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse it’s discretion in admitting the testimony of the\n\nthree neighborhood residents. At a minimum, the decision falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement. See Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542. Even if this Court\n\nfinds that the trial court erred, however, any alleged error is harmless. As argued in\n\ndetail above, the State presented overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt.\n\n      Issue 41 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 42:     THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY INSTRUCTED THE\nJURY ON VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.\n\n      In Issue 42, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the jury instruction regarding voluntary intoxication. Appellant’s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      The court’s charge during the guilt/innocence phase of trial included the\n\nfollowing instruction:\n\n      Voluntary intoxication does not constitute a defense to the\n      commission of a crime. “Intoxication” means the disturbance of\n      mental or physical capacity resulting from the introduction of any\n      substance into the body.\n\n\n\n\n                                         157 \n \n\f(CR14:4508).

Tex. Penal Code Ann. §\n\n8.04(a). It is appropriate to include an § 8.04(a) instruction in the guilt/innocence\n\ncharge if there is evidence from any source that might lead a jury to conclude that\n\nthe defendant’s intoxication somehow excused his actions.

It is not necessary that the evidence conclusively establish\n\nthe defendant’s intoxication for the instruction to be included in the charge. See id.\n\nat 27-28.\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n      The trial court did not err when it included the complained-of instruction\n\nduring guilt/innocence as there was evidence that might have led the jury to believe\n\nthat Appellant was intoxicated and that his intoxication excused his actions.\n\n\n                                         158 \n \n\fAppellant cross-examined Officer Coffey regarding his opinion of whether\n\nAppellant was intoxicated after he was arrested and was being transported to jail.\n\n(RR44:87). Coffey testified he did not “smell anything on [Appellant.]”\n\n(RR44:87).      Appellant asked whether someone can be intoxicated “from a\n\nsubstance that didn’t have a smell[.]”         (RR44:87).    Coffey conceded that\n\npossibility. (RR44:87).    He also conceded that Appellant appeared “erratic” on\n\nthe transport video. (RR44:87).     Appellant also cross-examined Marecle about\n\nwhether Appellant appeared intoxicated at the time of their encounter. (RR44:168-\n\n69). Indeed, Marecle testified “It had to be something because he didn’t look - -\n\nhis eyes were really wide and big.” (RR44:169).        Finally, the State notes that\n\nduring closing argument, defense counsel argued that “any person with common\n\nsense can tell [Appellant] is under the influence” when he is in the patrol car.\n\n(RR46:54-55).\n\n      Because there was some evidence that Appellant may have been intoxicated,\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion when it included a § 8.04 instruction in\n\nthe charge during guilt/innocence. See Sakil, 287 S.W.3d at 24, 27-28 (finding no\n\nerror in including § 8.04(a) instruction where evidence of Sakil’s intoxication was\n\nequivocal: the complainant told the 911 operator that Sakil was not intoxicated, but\n\nthat he was behaving “oddly” during their fight; psychiatrist testified to Sakil’s\n\nhistory of poly-substance abuse).\n\n\n                                        159 \n \n\f              Issue 42 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 43 AND 44: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nADMITTED EVIDENCE DURING THE PUNISHMENT PHASE OF APPELLANT’S\nEXTRANEOUS OFFENSES.\n\n              In Issues 43 and 44, Appellant contends that, during punishment, the trial\n\ncourt erred in admitting over his objection, evidence of his extraneous bad acts.\n\nHe contends that the State’s notice of its intent to present the evidence was\n\ninadequate under article 37.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure in that it\n\nfailed to include the date of the acts and county in which they occurred.\n\nAppellant’s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                                               Pertinent Facts\n\n              On September 27, 2013, thirty days prior to trial, the State filed and served\n\nAppellant with its notice of extraneous offenses. (CR14:4461-69). Included in\n\nthat notice were four specific assaults Appellant committed against his former\n\ngirlfriend Amy Armstrong Franks.16 (CR14:4461-62). Also included was the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                        During the defendant’s relationship with Amy Armstrong, in or about\n                         the year 1993, the defendant was physically abusive. The defendant\n                         was jealous and would get violent if he thought she was with\n                         someone else. She said he punched her, pushed her, and choked her.\n                         He drank alcohol a lot and smoked marijuana. He threatened Ms.\n                         Armstrong, saying, “Nobody’s gonna have you if I can’t have you.”\n                         These incidents all occurred in Dallas County, Texas.\n                                                            \n16\n  At the time of trial, Amy Armstrong had married and gave her name as Amy Franks.\n(RR47:29-30).\n                                                                    160 \n \n\f(CR14:4468).      During the punishment phase of trial, Appellant objected to the\n\nState presenting evidence of ongoing abuse between Appellant and Amy\n\nArmstrong. (RR47:9). Appellant argued that the State’s notice “lacks detail with\n\nregard to specific dates.” (RR47:10). He objected that there was no date or time\n\nassociated with the claim regarding Appellant’s threat, “Nobody’s gonna have you\n\nif I can’t have you.” (RR47:10). He objected that the claims regarding drugs and\n\nalcohol were “very general and vague.” (RR47:10). Finally, he objected that the\n\n“offenses or transactions” were not relevant to Appellant’s death worthiness\n\nbecause they occurred 20 years ago and are “highly prejudicial.” (RR47:12).\n\nAppellant’s objection was overruled. (RR47:12).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The introduction of extraneous conduct evidence in the punishment phase of\n\na capital murder trial is governed by the notice requirements of Article 37.07, §\n\n3(g) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n37.071, § 2(a)(1). Article 37.07, § 3(g) requires the State, on timely request, to\n\ngive the defendant reasonable notice of extraneous crimes or bad acts that the State\n\nintends to use at trial. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, § 3(g)\n\n(incorporating Texas Rule of Evidence 404(b)’s reasonable notice requirement).\n\nThis statute also requires the State to give additional notice if it intends to use an\n\nextraneous offense that has not resulted in a final conviction. To be reasonable, the\n                                         161 \n \n\fnotice must include the date on which the offense occurred, the county where it\n\noccurred, and the name of the alleged victim. Id.\n\n      The purpose of article 37.07, § 3(g) is to avoid unfair surprise and to enable\n\nthe defendant to prepare to answer the extraneous-offense evidence.

App.—\n\nAustin 2002, no pet.). To determine harm in light of that purpose, an appellate\n\ncourt should examine the record to determine whether the deficient notice resulted\n\nfrom prosecutorial bad faith or prevented the defendant from preparing for trial.\n\nRoethel, 80 S.W.3d at 282. In determining whether the defendant was prevented\n\nfrom preparing for trial, appellate courts look at whether the defendant was\n\nsurprised by the substance of the testimony and whether that affected his ability to\n\nprepare cross-examination or mitigating evidence. Id.\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      Of the five offenses or acts committed against Amy Franks listed in the\n\nState’s Notice of Extraneous Offenses, only one does not identify the specific date\n\non which the offense was committed: the one describing Appellant’s abusive\n\nbehavior and his drug and alcohol use. (CR14:4468). Although the notice does\n\nnot provide the month and day, it does identify the year that the offenses were\n\n\n                                        162 \n \n\fcommitted, 1993, and it states that the offenses were committed in Dallas County,\n\nTexas. (CR14:4468).\n\n      The record contains no indication that the State acted in bad faith when it\n\nfailed to comply with article 37.07, § 3(g).         To the contrary, the record\n\ndemonstrates that the State provided Appellant notice of the extraneous conduct to\n\nthe best of its ability and that the only reason the notice did not identify the date\n\nmore specifically was because more specific information was not known to the\n\nState. There is no indication from the record that the omission was intended to\n\nmislead Appellant or prevent him from preparing a defense.\n\n      Notably, Appellant does not argue that he was surprised by the substance of\n\nFranks’ testimony. He does not point to anything in the record that would support\n\nthe notion that his ability to mount an adequate defense was hindered by the lack of\n\nnotice; nor does he argue on appeal that his ability to prepare cross-examination or\n\nmitigating evidence was affected by the lack of adequate notice. Appellant has\n\nfailed to make any showing of how his defense strategy might have been different\n\nhad the State identified the exact days and months when the abuse and substance\n\nabuse occurred.    See, e.g., Hernandez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1488444\"><a href=\"/opinion/1488444/hernandez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 825-26 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2005) (finding any error in admitting evidence of extraneous offense\n\nduring punishment phase despite failure to provide notice was harmless because\n\nHernandez did not contend that witness’s testimony caused him surprise, that\n\n\n                                        163 \n \n\fomission from notice prevented him from preparing a defense, or that had he\n\nknown, his defense strategy would have been different). As such, any error by the\n\ntrial court in admitting evidence of this offense was harmless.\n\n      Appellant also contends that the offenses associated with Franks were too\n\nremote to be relevant on the issue of mitigation.           However, this Court has\n\nspecifically declined to fashion a “per se” rule that an extraneous transaction is too\n\nremote in time to be introduced into evidence at trial. See Templin v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1500010\"><a href=\"/opinion/1500010/templin-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986).           Indeed, the fact that Appellant abused\n\nFranks and drugs and alcohol in 1993 shows his penchant for violence and\n\naddiction to mind-altering substances is long lived, which is most definitely\n\nrelevant to both future danger and mitigation.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nthe complained-of evidence was relevant and admissible. This decision was not\n\noutside of the zone of reasonable disagreement. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the evidence.\n\n      Even if the trial court erred, any alleged error is harmless. Error in admitting\n\nevidence with insufficient notice under article 37.07, § 3(g) is non-constitutional\n\nerror. See Apolinar, 106 S.W.3d at 414.          The evidence at issue was no more\n\nserious and potentially inflammatory than the facts of the offense and the other\n\npunishment evidence admitted without objection. There is nothing in the record to\n\n\n                                         164 \n \n\findicate that the jury was not equipped to evaluate the probative force of the\n\nevidence. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that any testimony regarding\n\nextraneous offenses committed by appellant could be considered only if they\n\nbelieved appellant committed the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and even\n\nthen only in determining their answers to the special issues.17 (CR14:4517). This\n\nminimized any potential for improper influence on the jury. See, e.g., Lane v.

Spera testified that he arrested Appellant on\n\nSeptember 13, 2004 for the offense of violation of a protective order. (RR47:78-\n\n79, 86-89, 92).

State’s Exhibit #171 is a penitentiary packet containing a\n\ncopy of a judgment regarding Appellant’s conviction for robbery alleged to have\n\nbeen committed on June 19, 2004. (RR47:175; SX#171).          Steadman testified that\n\nhe arrested Appellant on October 9, 2002 for evading arrest.

As such, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in admitting them. See Flowers, 220 S.W.3d at 922 (noting that there\n\nare many ways to prove a prior conviction; “Just as there is more than one way to\n\nskin a cat, there is more than one way to prove a prior conviction.”).\n\n      Issues 45, 46, 47, and 48 should be overruled.\n\n\n                                         169 \n \n\fSTATE’SRESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 49: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY ADMITTED THE\nTESTIMONY OF WARDEN MELODYE NELSON.\n\n      In Issue 49, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing\n\ntestimony from Warden Melodye Nelson regarding prison violence and the nature\n\nof weapons found in prison. (Appellant’s Br. pp. 122-1240. Appellant contends\n\nthat Nelson’s testimony violated his right to individualized sentencing as her\n\ntestimony concerned the conduct of individuals other than Appellant.

It is well settled that “society” includes the prison\n\npopulation. See Estrada v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890229/estrada-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\nNelson’s testimony described for the jury what Appellant’s life would be like if\n\nAppellant were sentenced to life in prison and his “society” became prison society.\n\nSee Jordan, 928 S.W.2d at 555-56.        Prison society is not something within a\n\njuror’s common knowledge. Nelson testified regarding staffing, classification,\n\nhousing, daily routine, discipline and the potential for violence.      She did not\n\n\n                                         171 \n \n\fspecifically testify that Appellant would be more or less likely to commit violent\n\nacts in prison, only that there is a potential for drugs and violence, even in prison.\n\nNelson showed weapons that were found and confiscated in prison over the years\n\nin an effort to illustrate her testimony for the jury. Indeed, Nelson testified, “for\n\nsomeone who hasn’t worked inside of one of our prisons, [the inmates are] very\n\ncreative in how they can construct a weapon. I will tell you there’s - - we still find\n\nweapons and things of that nature that it shocks me.” (RR48:59). See Threadgill,\n\n146 S.W.3d at 670-671 (finding no abuse of discretion in admitting criminal\n\ninvestigator’s testimony regarding the prevalence of violence in prison as well as\n\nphotographs of weapons made by inmates in prison).\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting Nelson’s testimony, any alleged\n\nerror was harmless. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). The jury had already seen and\n\nheard evidence regarding the instant capital murder.     The jury had already heard\n\nabout Appellant’s violent and threatening behavior with his wife, sister-in-law and\n\nex-girlfriend, his oppositional behavior with police, his prior violent criminal\n\noffenses and the assault he committed against Jenkins while he was in prison. The\n\njury would later hear about his failure to obey orders while incarcerated, even\n\nwhile awaiting trial on the instant charges. Furthermore, the prejudicial effect of\n\nNelson’s testimony was minimized by its general nature. It was neither graphic\n\nnor disturbing in content. That fact, in conjunction with the admission of other\n\n\n                                         172 \n \n\fmore compelling punishment evidence by the State, rendered harmless any error in\n\nthe admission of Warden Nelson’s testimony.\n\n      Issue 49 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NO. 50: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\nSUPPORT THE JURY’S FINDING THAT APPELLANT IS A FUTURE DANGER.\n\n      In Issue 50, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury’s finding that there is a probability that he will commit criminal\n\nacts of violence in the future.    Appellant contends that he has no prior violent\n\noffense convictions and several of his witnesses testified that he was a low risk for\n\nfuture dangerousness.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The State has the burden of proving the future dangerousness punishment\n\nissue beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, §§\n\n2(b)(1), 2(c); Ladd, 3 S.W.3d at 557. In its determination of the issue, the jury is\n\nentitled to consider all of the evidence presented at both the guilt and punishment\n\nstages of trial. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071 § 2(d)(1).\n\n      A jury may consider a variety of factors when determining whether a\n\ndefendant will pose a continuing threat to society:       the circumstances of the\n\noffense, the defendant’s state of mind, whether he was working alone or with other\n\nparties, the calculated nature of his acts, the forethought and deliberation exhibited\n\nby the crime’s execution, the existence of a prior criminal record, the defendant’s\n                                         173 \n \n\fage and personal circumstances at the time of the offense, whether the defendant\n\nwas acting under duress or the domination of another at the time of the offense,\n\npsychiatric evidence, and character evidence. See Martinez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271405\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271405/martinez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 730 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthis Court views all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding\n\nand determines whether, based on that evidence and reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nanswer to the future-dangerousness issue was “yes.” Id. at 730.\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n       The evidence from both phases of trial unquestionably demonstrates\n\nAppellant’s propensity for violence. Indeed, the facts of the offense, standing\n\nalone, are sufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness.        Appellant\n\npoured lighter fluid over the upper body of an elderly woman, robbed her, lit her\n\non fire, and then casually walked away as she tried in vain to extinguish the flames\n\nravaging her upper body.\n\n       The State did not rely on the facts of the offense alone, however. The State\n\npresented the following additional evidence showing Appellant’s future\n\ndangerousness:\n\n\n     In 1993, at the age of 17, Appellant was physically violent with his then-\n      girlfriend, Franks. (RR47:38-40). Over the course of their short relationship,\n      he hit her, grabbed her, and threatened her. (RR47:38-40). One time, he\n                                         174 \n \n\f       threw a burning piece of wood onto her patio, setting a rug on fire.\n       (RR47:49).\n\n     Also in 1993, Appellant was arrested when an officer saw him walking\n      down the street with a joint. (RR47:101, 104–107). In addition to the\n      joint, Appellant had a bag of marijuana on his person. (RR47:105, 107).\n      He was arrested for the marijuana and an outstanding warrant. (RR47:105,\n      108).\n\n     The following year, in 1994, Appellant was arrested when officers\n      responding to a call of a man and woman fighting on the side of the road\n      determined that he had outstanding warrants. (RR48:111-12). Appellant\n      struggled with police when he was informed that he would be arrested.\n      (RR48:114). He bit both officers’ arms. (RR48:114). He bit one of the\n      officers so hard that he bit through the officer’s watch. (RR48:114).\n\n     Also in 1994, Appellant instructed Daphne not to stop when an officer tried\n      to pull them over. (RR47:125). After a slow-speed chase, Appellant jumped\n      out of the vehicle and tried to flee. (RR47:118–23).\n\n     In 1995, Appellant was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly\n      weapon. (RR47:134-37). He had been making threatening phone calls for\n      hours. (RR47:133-34). When he was booked in, he threatened the arresting\n      officer. (RR47:138-40).\n\n     In 2002, Appellant evaded arrest. (RR47: 150–151, 155–58).\n\n     In 2003, Daphne filed an application for a protective order. (SX#193). In\n      her application, she detailed assaults he committed on her in October,\n      November and December of 2003. She wrote that Appellant punched her,\n      pushed her, and kicked in their door. (SX#193). Daphne wrote, “Over the\n      last nine years [Appellant] . . . hit me, punched me, slapped me, kicked me\n      once, strangled me, pushed and shoved me, and thrown me around. I’ve had\n      bruises, black eyes, a bloody nose, a busted lip, scratches[,] soreness,\n      swelling, and pain.” (SX#193).\n\n     In 2004, Appellant attacked Salmeron in her driveway, threw her out of her\n      truck, and stole it. (RR47:183-86, 191). After a high-speed chase, he\n\n\n                                       175 \n \n\f       wrecked Salmeron’s truck, rendering it inoperable. (RR47:166-68, 170,\n       188, 197).\n\n     Also in 2004, while Daphne’s protective order was still in effect, Appellant\n      went to Daphne’s apartment and attempted to kick down her door.\n      (RR47:78-80, 84).\n\n     While in prison in 2005, Appellant refused to attend school or go to work.\n      He fought with his bunkmate, Jenkins. (RR47:223). He grabbed Jenkins\n      below his knees and flipped him, causing Jenkins’ head to strike the concrete\n      floor and “split [his] head open.” (RR47:226-27, 233). Jenkins’ injuries\n      required nine staples. (RR47:230–231; SX#172).\n\n     In 2006, while still in prison, Appellant masturbated at the door of his cell in\n      front of a female guard while leering at her. (RR47:263-64).\n\n     In 2011, Appellant broke into his employer’s safe and stole $325 in cash and\n      three state inspection books valued at $2,100. (RR48:158, 172-73). He also\n      stole a computer monitor. (RR48:172-73). He returned the monitor but not\n      the inspection booklets or cash. (RR48:175, 178; SX#174).\n\n     In 2012, Appellant was brought into the emergency room by Dallas police\n      and paramedics. (RR48:190-91; SX#188). He was handcuffed, “highly\n      agitated” and “somewhat combative.” (RR48:194). He was in a substance-\n      induced psychosis. (RR48:202-03). It took eight or nine people to hold him\n      to the bed. (RR48:194). A body net bound him to the bed. (RR48:194-95).\n\n     Later in 2012, Appellant approached Pinzon as she cleaned a bathroom at\n      the Express Inn and exposed his erect penis to her. (RR48:101-04, 108).\n\n     While in jail awaiting trial on the instant offense, Appellant violated the\n      rules by disobeying staff orders and tattooing himself. (RR48:147-49;\n      RR49:132-33).\n\n       Appellant argues that he has no prior convictions for violent offenses.\n\n(Appellant’s Br. at 124). Appellant is incorrect. In 1994, he was convicted of\n\nresisting arrest after he resisted arrest and bit two police officers. (RR48:114-16;\n\n                                         176 \n \n\fSX#189). In 1995, Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault, deadly weapon\n\nafter he made repeated threatening phone calls to his sister-in-law Courtney\n\nJohnson.   (RR47:132-34, 140-41, 143; SX#169).             In 2004, Appellant was\n\nconvicted of robbery and evading arrest after he robbed Salmeron of her truck in\n\nher driveway. (RR47:175-76; SX#171). In 2004, Appellant was also convicted of\n\nthe offense of violation of a protective order when he tried to kick Daphne’s door\n\nin. (RR47:79-80, 97; SX#166).\n\n      Additionally, the State presented substantial evidence of unadjudicated\n\noffenses, many of which involved violence:           the domestic violence between\n\nAppellant and Franks, including when he threw a burning piece of wood onto her\n\npatio; the domestic violence between Appellant and Daphne; the assault on Jenkins\n\nwhile in prison; and, the time he exposed himself to Pinzon.\n\n      The State notes that many of Appellant’s most violent offenses, both\n\nadjudicated and unadjudicated, involve violence against women: Franks, Daphne,\n\nSalmeron, Pinzon, and Nancy.      Appellant apparently has no trouble threatening,\n\nhitting, punching, kicking, strangling or robbing a woman. He has no problem\n\nsetting a woman on fire.   His history also demonstrates an inability to follow the\n\nrules, whether he is in the free world, whether he is in prison, or whether he is in\n\njail awaiting trial on a charge of capital murder.     Cf. Reese v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1676450\"><a href=\"/opinion/1676450/reese-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (Tex.

Appellant blames all of his\n\noffenses on his drug use and depression. (RR49:99-100).         Importantly, multiple\n\nwitnesses – including Appellant’s own experts – testified that drugs are available\n\nin prison. (RR47:253, 272; RR48:47, 69, 72; RR50:85-86; RR51:37, 52, 63).\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence here is more\n\nthan sufficient to support the jury’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nAppellant would constitute a continuing threat to society.          The evidence is\n\nsufficient to support the jury’s answer to the future dangerousness special issue.\n\n      Issue 50 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE NOS. 51 THROUGH 53: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY\nDENIED APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND OVERRULED HIS\nOBJECTIONS TO THE CHARGE.\n\n      In Issues 51, 52, and 53, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his requested instructions and overruling his objections to the court’s\n\npunishment charge. (Appellant’s Br. 129-38). Appellant’s contentions lack merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Prior to trial, Appellant filed Pre-Trial Motion No. 63, “Defendant’s\n\nRequested Instructions for Punishment Charge.”       (CR3:660-73). In that motion,\n\nAppellant requested 13 instructions to be included in the court’s punishment\n\ncharge. He also requested 2 additional special verdict forms. (CR3:660-73).\n\n\n                                         178 \n \n\fAppellant also filed Pre-Trial Motion No. 64, “Defendant’s Objections to the\n\nCharge at Punishment.”     (CR3:641-58).      In this motion, Appellant raised 61\n\nobjections to the trial court’s punishment charge. (CR3:641-58).\n\n      Both of Appellant’s motions were presented during a hearing outside the\n\npresence of the jury. (RR51:92-106). Both of Appellant’s motions were denied.\n\n(RR51:92-106).\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n      Issues 51, 52, and 53 are inadequately briefed. Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h). In\n\nthree issues, Appellant asserts 76 challenges to the court’s punishment charge.\n\nThe bulk of his briefing on these issues, however, consists of simply a shorthand\n\nrecitation of the challenges raised in Pre-Trial Motion Nos. 63 and 64. Only 15 of\n\nthe 76 challenges contain citations to authority. Appellant neither challenges the\n\nreasoning of the existing case law nor asserts any novel legal arguments to support\n\nhis claims.   Conclusory assertions of error, unsupported by substantive legal\n\nanalysis, present nothing for review. See Rocha v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1448432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1448432/rocha-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (Tex.\n\nCrim.

He acknowledges that these issues have been\n\npreviously submitted to this Court and overruled, citing Saldano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685878\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685878/saldano-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nbut invites the Court to review its prior stance on these issues. He claims that he\n\nasserts these issues not to cause unnecessary litigation but to preserve the issues for\n\nfederal court review. (Appellant’s Br. at 138).\n\n      In Issue 54, Appellant contends the statute under which he was sentenced to\n\ndeath violates the Eighth Amendment by allowing the jury too much discretion in\n\n\n                                         183 \n \n\fdetermining who should live and who should die and results in the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious imposition of the death penalty. (Appellant’s Br. at 138).\n\n        In Issue 55, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty statute violates\n\nthe due process mandates of the Fourteenth Amendment because it implicitly puts\n\nthe burden of proving the mitigation special issue on him rather than placing the\n\nburden on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no circumstances\n\nwarrant a life sentence rather than a death sentence. (Appellant’s Br. at 139).\n\n        In Issue 56, Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to\n\nhold that Article 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) violates Article I, §§ 10 and 13 of the Texas\n\nConstitution. (Appellant’s Br. at 140).\n\n        In Issue 57, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme violates\n\nthe due process protections of the U.S. Constitution because it does not require the\n\nState to prove the absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, contrary to Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and its\n\nprogeny. (Appellant’s Br. at 140).\n\n        In Issue 58, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme violates\n\nhis rights against cruel and unusual punishment and to due process of law under\n\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by requiring at least ten “no” votes for the\n\njury to return a negative answer to a punishment special issue. (Appellant’s Br. at\n\n141).\n\n\n                                          184 \n \n\f        In Issue 59, Appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme violates\n\nhis rights against cruel and unusual punishment, to an impartial jury, and to due\n\nprocess of law under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments because\n\nvague, undefined terms in the punishment jury instructions effectively determine\n\nthe difference between a life or death sentence. (Appellant’s Br. at 142).\n\n        In Issue 60, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to hold Art. 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) unconstitutional because it fails to\n\nrequire the jury to consider all mitigating evidence. (Appellant’s Br. at 143).\n\n        In Issue 61, Appellant contends that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the State to prove\n\nthat aggravating evidence exists beyond a reasonable doubt. (Appellant’s Br. at\n\n141).\n\n        In Issue 62, Appellant claims that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.\n\nConstitution because it permits an open-ended discretion which was condemned by\n\nFurman v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108605\"><a href=\"/opinion/108605/furman-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972). (Appellant’s Br. at 144).\n\n        In Issue 63, Appellant contends that Texas’ statutory capital sentencing\n\nscheme is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because\n\nit lacks meaningful appellate review. (Appellant’s Br. at 144).\n\n\n\n\n                                         185 \n \n\f      In Issue 64, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to quash the indictment as being unconstitutional based on the numerous\n\nconstitutional defects of the Texas death penalty scheme. (Appellant’s Br. at 145).\n\n      In Issue 65, Appellant contends that the cumulative effect of these alleged\n\nconstitutional violations denied him due process of law in violation of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and due course of law under\n\nArticle I, § 19 of the Texas Constitution. (Appellant’s Br. at 147).\n\n      Appellant invites the Court to revisit its prior decisions on these issues,\n\nwhich he agrees have all been previously overruled. See Appellant’s Brief at 138;\n\nSaldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107-09 (overruling multiple challenges to death penalty\n\nstatute); Escamilla, 143 S.W.3d at 828-829 (overruling similar challenges).\n\nAppellant presents no new arguments for the State to address. Accordingly, the\n\nState asks this Court to decline his invitation to revisit these legal claims and to\n\noverrule issues 54 through 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                         186 \n \n\f                                      PR\n                                       RAYER\n \n\n       The\n       T State prays\n               p     that this Hono\n                                  orable Couurt will afffirm the juudgment off the\n\ntrial cou\n        urt.\n\n                                                      Respecctfully subm\n                                                                       mitted,\n\n\nCraig Watkins\n       W                                              Christiine Womb   ble\nCriminnal Districtt Attorney\n                           y                          Assistaant Districct Attorneyy\nDallas County,\n       C       Teexas                                 State B\n                                                            Bar No. 240035991\n                                                      Frank CCrowley Courts Buildding\n                                                      133 N.
