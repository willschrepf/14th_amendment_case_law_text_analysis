For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n                                                 I.\n                                  FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n       In April 2008, in Clearwater County, Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly filed an extremely lengthy\ncivil rights complaint against numerous correctional officials (Defendants), alleging various\nviolations due to disciplinary and classification actions taken against him during his\nincarceration. The situations at issue stemmed largely from Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s repeated\nsexual contact with other inmates and mistreatment of prison staff. Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was\nordered to file a condensed ten-page complaint, which he did. Venue was transferred to Ada\nCounty where Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly filed a lengthy amended complaint.            He was again\nordered to file a shortened version. He complied. In January 2010, Defendants filed a motion to\n\n                                                 1\n\fdismiss most of the claims and parties pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The\ndistrict court granted the majority of the Defendants’ motion. As to the remaining causes of\naction and defendants, the Court held:\n       [T]he plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to proceed against [certain]\n       defendants . . . for violation of his constitutional rights at his administrative\n       hearing. Likewise, the plaintiff may be able to prove constitutional deprivation\n       during his various DOR hearings against [certain] Defendants . . . . There are also\n       sufficient facts alleged to support a cause of action for use of excessive force\n       against [certain] defendants . . . .\n       The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, which the district court granted in\nfavor of the Defendants. Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly now appeals the district court’s judgment\nsummarily dismissing his civil rights complaint.\n                                                II.\n                                           ANALYSIS\n       Although it is clear from Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s appellate brief that he challenges the\ndistrict court’s memorandum decision granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment,\nhis actual arguments as to how the district court abused its discretion in granting the Defendants’\nmotion are difficult to discern. He does, however, mention facts and authority relating to two of\nthe three claims the district court addressed in its memorandum decision: that his procedural due\nprocess rights were violated over the course of various disciplinary proceedings, and that his\nprocedural due process rights were violated when he was placed in long-term administrative\nsegregation. We will address each in turn. 1\n       We first note that summary judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) is proper\nonly when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. On appeal, we exercise free review in determining whether a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nEdwards v. Conchemco, Inc., 111 Idaho 851, 852, 727 P.2d 1279, 1280 (Ct. App. 1986). When\nassessing a motion for summary judgment, all controverted facts are to be liberally construed in\nfavor of the nonmoving party. Furthermore, the trial court must draw all reasonable inferences\nin favor of the party resisting the motion. G & M Farms v. Funk Irrigation Co., 119 Idaho 514,\n\n1\n       To the extent Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly raises any issues on appeal for the first time, we do\nnot consider them. Sanchez v. Arave, 120 Idaho 321, 322, 815 P.2d 1061, 1062 (1991).\n\n\n                                                2\n\f517, 808 P.2d 851, 854 (1991); Sanders v. Kuna Joint Sch. Dist., 125 Idaho 872, 874, 876 P.2d\n154, 156 (Ct. App. 1994).\n       The party moving for summary judgment initially carries the burden to establish there is\nno genuine issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nEliopulos v. Knox, 123 Idaho 400, 404, 848 P.2d 984, 988 (Ct. App. 1992). The burden may be\nmet by establishing the absence of evidence on an element the nonmoving party will be required\nto prove at trial. Dunnick v. Elder, 126 Idaho 308, 311, 882 P.2d 475, 478 (Ct. App. 1994).\nSuch an absence of evidence may be established either by an affirmative showing with the\nmoving party’s own evidence or by a review of all the nonmoving party’s evidence and the\ncontention that such proof of an element is lacking. Heath v. Honker’s Mini-Mart, Inc., 134\nIdaho 711, 712, 8 P.3d 1254, 1255 (Ct. App. 2000). Once such an absence of evidence is\nestablished, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to show, via further depositions,\ndiscovery responses or affidavits, that there is indeed a genuine issue for trial or to offer a valid\njustification for the failure to do so under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f). Sanders, 125\nIdaho at 874, 876 P.2d at 156.\n       The United States Supreme Court, in interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c),\nwhich is identical in all relevant aspects to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), has stated:\n       In our view, the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary\n       judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who\n       fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n       essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof\n       at trial. In such a situation, there can be “no genuine issue as to any material\n       fact,” since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the\n       nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The\n       moving party is “entitled to judgment as a matter of law” because the nonmoving\n       party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case\n       with respect to which she has the burden of proof . . . .\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986) (citations omitted). The language and\nreasoning of Celotex have been adopted in Idaho. Dunnick, 126 Idaho at 312, 882 P.2d at 479.\n       In granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the district court noted the\nfacts relied upon were gleaned from the affidavits of the parties and, although the parties agreed\nas to many of the facts, to the extent there was disagreement, the court viewed the facts in the\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motion. It then addressed the remaining claims.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fA.     Disciplinary Hearings\n       According to the district court, Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly asserted his procedural due\nprocess rights were violated over the course of four separate disciplinary hearings 2 and\nsummarized the claimed violations thusly:\n       a) that Plaintiff was not provided with legal representation in the hearings;\n       b) that there was ex parte contact at one hearing; i.e., the hearing officer discussed\n       the facts of the case with a witness outside Plaintiff’s presence;\n       c) that the hearing officer was biased and refused to recuse herself; and\n       d) that witness statements were not produced for Plaintiff’s use at the hearing\n       such that Plaintiff was not allowed to present his case.\n       To determine whether an individual’s due process rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment have been violated, a court must engage in a two-step analysis. Schevers v. State,\n129 Idaho 573, 575, 930 P.2d 603, 605 (1996); Briggs v. Kempf, 146 Idaho 172, 175, 191 P.3d\n250, 253 (Ct. App. 2008). It must first decide whether the individual’s threatened interest is a\nliberty or property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment. Schevers, 129 Idaho at 575, 930\nP.2d at 605; Smith v. Meridian Joint Sch. Dist. No. 2, 128 Idaho 714, 722, 918 P.2d 583, 591\n(1996); Briggs, 146 Idaho at 175, 191 P.3d at 253. Only if it finds a liberty or property interest\nwill the court reach the next step, in which it determines the extent of due process procedural\nprotections. Schevers, 129 Idaho at 575, 930 P.2d at 605; Briggs, 146 Idaho at 175, 191 P.3d at\n253. Put another way, if a court concludes an individual lacked a protected liberty interest, this\nleads to the conclusion the individual was not entitled to procedural due process under either the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article 1, Section 13 of the Idaho\nConstitution. See Schevers, 129 Idaho at 577-78, 930 P.2d at 607-08; Briggs, 146 Idaho at 176,\n191 P.3d at 254.\n       Thus, we must examine whether a protected liberty interest was implicated by these\ndisciplinary hearings.    Specifically, we examine the punishment Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly\nreceived as a result of the hearings, which, the district court found, ranged from five to thirty\n\n\n\n\n2\n      The district court identified these disciplinary hearings as numbers 060060, 060113,\n060139, and 060168.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fdays in disciplinary segregation. 3 To determine whether an inmate has a protected liberty\ninterest, the Idaho Supreme Court adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court\nfrom Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995). Schevers, 129 Idaho at 575-77, 930 P.2d at\n605-07. Shifting from a focus on regulations to a focus on hardship, the court looks to whether\nthe restriction imposed an “atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the\nordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84. In other words, the court looks at\nwhether the restrictions constitute a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of prison life.\nId. at 485-86.\n       In Schevers, 129 Idaho at 576, 930 P.2d at 606, the Court identified two factors to\nconsider in determining whether the punishment is atypical and a significant hardship: the\nlikelihood it will affect the prisoner’s sentence, and the duration of the segregation. In that case,\nSchevers was moved from a minimum security general population placement to disciplinary\nsegregation. He was thereafter reclassified as medium security. His placement in disciplinary\nsegregation resulted in the denial of certain minimum security privileges and the loss of access to\npersonal property. Although he was placed in disciplinary segregation for fifty-five days, the\nCourt concluded this hardship was not a serious departure from what one would normally expect\nfrom prison life. Id. at 577, 930 P.2d at 607. The Court’s declaration that Schevers lacked a\nprotected liberty interest led to the conclusion he was not entitled to procedural due process\nunder either the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article 1,\nSection 13 of the Idaho Constitution. Schevers, 129 Idaho at 577-78, 930 P.2d at 607-08. See\nalso Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486 (holding that thirty days of disciplinary segregation was not an\natypical or significant hardship).\n       Upon examination of the foregoing authority, the district court in this case concluded\nnone of the four disciplinary hearings Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly complains about resulted in\n“atypical or significant hardship,” as all four disciplinary segregation periods were well within\nthe boundaries of Sandin and Schevers. 4 Then, having determined Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly did\n\n\n3\n        The Defendants point out that the practical result of the sanctions imposed following at\nleast two of the hearings was that Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly did not spend any additional time in\ndisciplinary segregation after the disciplinary hearings were held.\n4\n       We also note there is no indication these punishments extended Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s\nsentence.\n\n                                                 5\n\fnot have a protected liberty interest at stake, the court indicated it need not continue the\nprocedural due process analysis, instead granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment\non those claims. The district court applied the correct standards of law and came to a soundly\nreasoned decision. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting the Defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment as to this claim. 5\nB.     Administrative Segregation\n       The district court also granted the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s claim that his procedural due process rights were violated when he\nwas placed in long-term administrative segregation, due largely to his sexual contact with fellow\ninmates and behavior towards prison staff.            Even assuming, without deciding, that\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s long-term placement in administrative segregation implicates a liberty\ninterest, i.e., it amounts to an “atypical and significant hardship,” Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly has not\nshown the district court erred in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Idaho\ncourts have not yet confronted the issue of what procedural due process applies when an\ninmate’s placement in administrative segregation implicates a liberty interest. However, the\nUnited States Supreme Court addressed the issue in Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Sandin, 515 U.S. 472. 6 There, the Supreme Court\nconsidered whether prison inmates were entitled to due process before being placed in solitary\nconfinement for administrative--rather than disciplinary--reasons. The Court expressly rejected\n\n5\n        To the extent Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly argues he should not have been punished for sexual\ncontact with other inmates because it was consensual, his argument does not have merit. During\nthe period of confinement in prison, the right of intimate association, “‘a fundamental element of\npersonal liberty,’” is necessarily abridged. Gerber v. Hickman, 291 F.3d 617, 621 (9th Cir.\n2002) (quoting Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984)). In addition, prisons\nhave a legitimate penological interest in preventing sexual contact between inmates. See Veney\nv. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 733-34 (4th Cir. 2002).\n6\n        Although it is clear Hewitt was overruled by Sandin in regard to the initial inquiry as to\nwhether an inmate has a liberty interest at stake (with the focus now on the nature of the\ndeprivation rather than the regulation at issue), Sandin did not speak to the process due where a\nprotected liberty interest is found. In this regard, we agree with the Second Circuit, which held\nthe procedural due process protections of Hewitt survived Sandin in cases where a liberty interest\nis found pursuant to Sandin’s new strictures. See Sealey v. Giltner, 197 F.3d 578, 585 (2d Cir.\n1999) (“[I]f Sandin had meant to overrule Hewitt to the extent of precluding a protected liberty\ninterest for all administrative confinements, we would expect to see more pointed language to\nthat effect.”).\n\n                                                 6\n\fthe idea that due process required a “detailed adversary proceeding” on the ground that it would\nnot materially assist the decision to be made. Id. at 473-74. The Court further held that, in these\nsituations, an “informal, nonadversary evidentiary review,” at which the prisoner has the\nopportunity to state his views, satisfies the requirements of due process:\n       An inmate must merely receive some notice of the charges against him and an\n       opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding\n       whether to transfer him to administrative segregation. Ordinarily a written\n       statement by the inmate will accomplish this purpose, although prison\n       administrators may find it more useful to permit oral presentations in cases where\n       they believe a written statement would be ineffective. So long as this occurs, and\n       the decisionmaker reviews the charges and then-available evidence against the\n       prisoner, the Due Process Clause is satisfied.\n\nId. at 476.   The Court also noted that extended confinement in administrative segregation\nrequires a periodic review of the prisoner’s status to determine if the reasons for placement in\nsegregation continue to exist. Id. at 477 n.9. Accord Toussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080,\n1101 (9th Cir. 1986), overruled in part on other grounds by Mennick v. Smith, 459 F. App’x 649\n(9th Cir. 2011) (holding that for placement in administrative segregation, due process requires a\nnonadversarial hearing be held within a reasonable time, the prisoner be informed of the charges\nor reasons segregation is being considered and the prisoner be allowed to present his views, but\ndoes not require written notice of charges, representation by counsel or counsel-substitute, the\nopportunity to present witnesses, or a written decision describing the reasons for placing a\nprisoner in administrative segregation).\n       The inmate in Hewitt received notice of the charges against him the day after his\nmisconduct took place. Only five days after his transfer to administrative segregation, a hearing\ncommittee reviewed the existing evidence against him. Moreover, the inmate acknowledged on\nhis misconduct form that he “had the opportunity to have [his] version reported as part of the\nrecord” and, thus, had an opportunity to present a statement to the committee. Hewitt, 459 U.S.\nat 477. The Supreme Court held this proceeding plainly satisfied the due process requirements\nfor confinement of the inmate in administrative custody. Id.\n       Based on the above analysis, to address Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s claim, an inquiry into\nthe circumstances surrounding his placement in administrative segregation is necessary.\nHowever, evidence regarding those circumstances is not properly contained in the record. The\nrelevant facts appear only in the affidavit of Kevin Burnett, a paralegal at the Idaho Department\n\n                                                 7\n\fof Correction, and the exhibits attached thereto. Although apparently submitted to the district\ncourt in support of the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the affidavit is not contained\nin the record on appeal. Rather, the Defendants attached the affidavit and its attached exhibits to\ntheir appellate brief, indicating that although the affidavit was listed in the register of actions, it\nwas “inadvertently omitted from the Clerk’s record.” It is well settled that this Court is bound by\nthe record and cannot consider matters or materials that are not part of the record or not\ncontained in the record. Chisholm v. Idaho Dep’t of Water Res., 142 Idaho 159, 162-63, 125\nP.3d 515, 518-19 (2005). In addition, it is the responsibility of the appellant to provide a\nsufficient record to substantiate his or her claims on appeal. Powell v. Sellers, 130 Idaho 122,\n127, 937 P.2d 434, 439 (Ct. App. 1997). In the absence of an adequate record on appeal to\nsupport the appellant’s claims, we will not presume error. Id. Thus, we will not presume the\ndistrict court erred in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment where\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly has not provided a sufficient record for us to assess the claim.\n       Even if we were to consider the affidavit and its attached exhibits and reach the merits of\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s claim, we would conclude the district court did not err in granting the\nDefendants’ motion.      Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was referred for placement in administrative\nsegregation on May 10, 2006. The form indicated the reasons for the referral: “To protect you\nfrom other offenders”; “To protect other offenders from you”; and “To stabilize a volatile or\ndifficult situation.”    The referral provided forty-eight hours’ notice of the hearing.\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly waived the forty-eight hour preparation time for the hearing and a\n“Restrictive Housing Placement” hearing was held on May 11 before the Housing Placement\nCommittee (Committee).        The Committee considered Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s disciplinary\nrecord, prison records from his past incarceration, attitude towards authority, willingness and\nability to live with other offenders, classification (close custody at the time), and documented\ncurrent and past behavior. In its summary of the evidence, the Committee also noted that\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly had expressed “intimate feelings” for another inmate and had prior\nsexual predator “points,” which created a possible security risk and a Prison Rape Elimination\nAct (PREA) threat. Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly indicated to the Committee he would be in danger if\nmoved to the Idaho Maximum Security Institution (IMSI) and contended the previous PREA\ndesignation was unfounded.         The Committee unanimously recommended Lerajjareanra-\nO-Kel-Ly be placed in administrative segregation and forwarded their recommendation to\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fWarden Kimberly Jones, who authorized the placement on May 12. Over the next five years,\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly continued to be housed at IMSI in administrative segregation. He had\nperiodic reviews by the Committee, some of which recommended continued placement in\nadministrative segregation that were approved by the warden, and others recommending release\nfrom administrative segregation that were rejected by the warden.\n       From these facts, we would conclude Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly clearly received the\nprocess due him both prior to and during his prolonged placement in administrative segregation.\nAs required by Hewitt, Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was given notice of the placement hearing and\nthe reasons segregation was being considered and a committee considered evidence and\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s statement at a nonadversarial hearing held the day after he was given\nnotice. In addition, although Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly remained in administrative segregation for\nan extended period, periodic reviews of his status were held. There is, therefore, no question\nthat, on its face, the procedure provided to Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was constitutionally\nadequate.   The district court did not err in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment on this issue.\n                                               III.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly did not have a protected liberty interest at stake in any of the four\ndisciplinary hearings at issue because his punishments did not amount to “atypical or significant\nhardship” such that his procedural due process rights were implicated. Also, even assuming\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly has a liberty interest in regard to his extended placement in\nadministrative segregation, and that we may reach the issue given the deficient record on appeal,\nhe was afforded constitutionally adequate procedural due process. Accordingly, the district court\ndid not err in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The district court’s\njudgment summarily dismissing Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s civil rights complaint is affirmed.\n        Judge GRATTON and Judge MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f",

For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n                                                 I.\n                                  FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n       In April 2008, in Clearwater County, Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly filed an extremely lengthy\ncivil rights complaint against numerous correctional officials (Defendants), alleging various\nviolations due to disciplinary and classification actions taken against him during his\nincarceration. The situations at issue stemmed largely from Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s repeated\nsexual contact with other inmates and mistreatment of prison staff. Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was\nordered to file a condensed ten-page complaint, which he did. Venue was transferred to Ada\nCounty where Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly filed a lengthy amended complaint.            He was again\nordered to file a shortened version. He complied. In January 2010, Defendants filed a motion to\n\n                                                 1\n\fdismiss most of the claims and parties pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The\ndistrict court granted the majority of the Defendants’ motion. As to the remaining causes of\naction and defendants, the Court held:\n       [T]he plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to proceed against [certain]\n       defendants . . . for violation of his constitutional rights at his administrative\n       hearing. Likewise, the plaintiff may be able to prove constitutional deprivation\n       during his various DOR hearings against [certain] Defendants . . . . There are also\n       sufficient facts alleged to support a cause of action for use of excessive force\n       against [certain] defendants . . . .\n       The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, which the district court granted in\nfavor of the Defendants. Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly now appeals the district court’s judgment\nsummarily dismissing his civil rights complaint.\n                                                II.\n                                           ANALYSIS\n       Although it is clear from Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s appellate brief that he challenges the\ndistrict court’s memorandum decision granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment,\nhis actual arguments as to how the district court abused its discretion in granting the Defendants’\nmotion are difficult to discern. He does, however, mention facts and authority relating to two of\nthe three claims the district court addressed in its memorandum decision: that his procedural due\nprocess rights were violated over the course of various disciplinary proceedings, and that his\nprocedural due process rights were violated when he was placed in long-term administrative\nsegregation. We will address each in turn. 1\n       We first note that summary judgment under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) is proper\nonly when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law. On appeal, we exercise free review in determining whether a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nEdwards v.

Heath v. Honker’s Mini-Mart, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569664\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569664/heath-v-honkers-mini-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569664\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569664/heath-v-honkers-mini-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255 (Ct. App. 2000). Once such an absence of evidence is\nestablished, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to show, via further depositions,\ndiscovery responses or affidavits, that there is indeed a genuine issue for trial or to offer a valid\njustification for the failure to do so under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f). Sanders, 125\nIdaho at 874, 876 P.2d at 156.\n       The United States Supreme Court, in interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c),\nwhich is identical in all relevant aspects to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), has stated:\n       In our view, the plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary\n       judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who\n       fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n       essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof\n       at trial. In such a situation, there can be “no genuine issue as to any material\n       fact,” since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the\n       nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The\n       moving party is “entitled to judgment as a matter of law” because the nonmoving\n       party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case\n       with respect to which she has the burden of proof . . . .\n\nCelotex Corp. v.

Dunnick, 126 Idaho at 312, 882 P.2d at 479.\n       In granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the district court noted the\nfacts relied upon were gleaned from the affidavits of the parties and, although the parties agreed\nas to many of the facts, to the extent there was disagreement, the court viewed the facts in the\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motion. It then addressed the remaining claims.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fA.     Disciplinary Hearings\n       According to the district court, Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly asserted his procedural due\nprocess rights were violated over the course of four separate disciplinary hearings 2 and\nsummarized the claimed violations thusly:\n       a) that Plaintiff was not provided with legal representation in the hearings;\n       b) that there was ex parte contact at one hearing; i.e., the hearing officer discussed\n       the facts of the case with a witness outside Plaintiff’s presence;\n       c) that the hearing officer was biased and refused to recuse herself; and\n       d) that witness statements were not produced for Plaintiff’s use at the hearing\n       such that Plaintiff was not allowed to present his case.\n       To determine whether an individual’s due process rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment have been violated, a court must engage in a two-step analysis.

Only if it finds a liberty or property interest\nwill the court reach the next step, in which it determines the extent of due process procedural\nprotections. Schevers, 129 Idaho at 575, 930 P.2d at 605; Briggs, 146 Idaho at 175, 191 P.3d at\n253. Put another way, if a court concludes an individual lacked a protected liberty interest, this\nleads to the conclusion the individual was not entitled to procedural due process under either the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article 1, Section 13 of the Idaho\nConstitution. See Schevers, 129 Idaho at 577-78, 930 P.2d at 607-08; Briggs, 146 Idaho at 176,\n191 P.3d at 254.\n       Thus, we must examine whether a protected liberty interest was implicated by these\ndisciplinary hearings.    Specifically, we examine the punishment Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly\nreceived as a result of the hearings, which, the district court found, ranged from five to thirty\n\n\n\n\n2\n      The district court identified these disciplinary hearings as numbers 060060, 060113,\n060139, and 060168.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fdays in disciplinary segregation. 3 To determine whether an inmate has a protected liberty\ninterest, the Idaho Supreme Court adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court\nfrom Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). Schevers, 129 Idaho at 575-77, 930 P.2d at\n605-07. Shifting from a focus on regulations to a focus on hardship, the court looks to whether\nthe restriction imposed an “atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the\nordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84. In other words, the court looks at\nwhether the restrictions constitute a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of prison life.\nId. at 485-86.\n       In Schevers, 129 Idaho at 576, 930 P.2d at 606, the Court identified two factors to\nconsider in determining whether the punishment is atypical and a significant hardship: the\nlikelihood it will affect the prisoner’s sentence, and the duration of the segregation. In that case,\nSchevers was moved from a minimum security general population placement to disciplinary\nsegregation. He was thereafter reclassified as medium security. His placement in disciplinary\nsegregation resulted in the denial of certain minimum security privileges and the loss of access to\npersonal property. Although he was placed in disciplinary segregation for fifty-five days, the\nCourt concluded this hardship was not a serious departure from what one would normally expect\nfrom prison life. Id. at 577, 930 P.2d at 607. The Court’s declaration that Schevers lacked a\nprotected liberty interest led to the conclusion he was not entitled to procedural due process\nunder either the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, or Article 1,\nSection 13 of the Idaho Constitution. Schevers, 129 Idaho at 577-78, 930 P.2d at 607-08. See\nalso Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486 (holding that thirty days of disciplinary segregation was not an\natypical or significant hardship).\n       Upon examination of the foregoing authority, the district court in this case concluded\nnone of the four disciplinary hearings Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly complains about resulted in\n“atypical or significant hardship,” as all four disciplinary segregation periods were well within\nthe boundaries of Sandin and Schevers. 4 Then, having determined Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly did\n\n\n3\n        The Defendants point out that the practical result of the sanctions imposed following at\nleast two of the hearings was that Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly did not spend any additional time in\ndisciplinary segregation after the disciplinary hearings were held.\n4\n       We also note there is no indication these punishments extended Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s\nsentence.\n\n                                                 5\n\fnot have a protected liberty interest at stake, the court indicated it need not continue the\nprocedural due process analysis, instead granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment\non those claims. The district court applied the correct standards of law and came to a soundly\nreasoned decision. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting the Defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment as to this claim. 5\nB.     Administrative Segregation\n       The district court also granted the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s claim that his procedural due process rights were violated when he\nwas placed in long-term administrative segregation, due largely to his sexual contact with fellow\ninmates and behavior towards prison staff.            Even assuming, without deciding, that\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s long-term placement in administrative segregation implicates a liberty\ninterest, i.e., it amounts to an “atypical and significant hardship,” Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly has not\nshown the district court erred in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Idaho\ncourts have not yet confronted the issue of what procedural due process applies when an\ninmate’s placement in administrative segregation implicates a liberty interest. However, the\nUnited States Supreme Court addressed the issue in Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Sandin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. 6 There, the Supreme Court\nconsidered whether prison inmates were entitled to due process before being placed in solitary\nconfinement for administrative--rather than disciplinary--reasons. The Court expressly rejected\n\n5\n        To the extent Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly argues he should not have been punished for sexual\ncontact with other inmates because it was consensual, his argument does not have merit. During\nthe period of confinement in prison, the right of intimate association, “‘a fundamental element of\npersonal liberty,’” is necessarily abridged. Gerber v.

In addition, prisons\nhave a legitimate penological interest in preventing sexual contact between inmates. See Veney\nv.

In this regard, we agree with the Second Circuit, which held\nthe procedural due process protections of Hewitt survived Sandin in cases where a liberty interest\nis found pursuant to Sandin’s new strictures. See Sealey v. Giltner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766872\"><a href=\"/opinion/766872/emmeth-sealey-v-th-giltner/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 (2d Cir.\n1999) (“[I]f Sandin had meant to overrule Hewitt to the extent of precluding a protected liberty\ninterest for all administrative confinements, we would expect to see more pointed language to\nthat effect.”).\n\n                                                 6\n\fthe idea that due process required a “detailed adversary proceeding” on the ground that it would\nnot materially assist the decision to be made. Id. at 473-74. The Court further held that, in these\nsituations, an “informal, nonadversary evidentiary review,” at which the prisoner has the\nopportunity to state his views, satisfies the requirements of due process:\n       An inmate must merely receive some notice of the charges against him and an\n       opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding\n       whether to transfer him to administrative segregation. Ordinarily a written\n       statement by the inmate will accomplish this purpose, although prison\n       administrators may find it more useful to permit oral presentations in cases where\n       they believe a written statement would be ineffective. So long as this occurs, and\n       the decisionmaker reviews the charges and then-available evidence against the\n       prisoner, the Due Process Clause is satisfied.\n\nId. at 476.   The Court also noted that extended confinement in administrative segregation\nrequires a periodic review of the prisoner’s status to determine if the reasons for placement in\nsegregation continue to exist.

Smith, 459 F. App’x 649\n(9th Cir. 2011) (holding that for placement in administrative segregation, due process requires a\nnonadversarial hearing be held within a reasonable time, the prisoner be informed of the charges\nor reasons segregation is being considered and the prisoner be allowed to present his views, but\ndoes not require written notice of charges, representation by counsel or counsel-substitute, the\nopportunity to present witnesses, or a written decision describing the reasons for placing a\nprisoner in administrative segregation).\n       The inmate in Hewitt received notice of the charges against him the day after his\nmisconduct took place. Only five days after his transfer to administrative segregation, a hearing\ncommittee reviewed the existing evidence against him. Moreover, the inmate acknowledged on\nhis misconduct form that he “had the opportunity to have [his] version reported as part of the\nrecord” and, thus, had an opportunity to present a statement to the committee. Hewitt, 459 U.S.\nat 477. The Supreme Court held this proceeding plainly satisfied the due process requirements\nfor confinement of the inmate in administrative custody. Id.\n       Based on the above analysis, to address Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s claim, an inquiry into\nthe circumstances surrounding his placement in administrative segregation is necessary.\nHowever, evidence regarding those circumstances is not properly contained in the record. The\nrelevant facts appear only in the affidavit of Kevin Burnett, a paralegal at the Idaho Department\n\n                                                 7\n\fof Correction, and the exhibits attached thereto. Although apparently submitted to the district\ncourt in support of the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the affidavit is not contained\nin the record on appeal. Rather, the Defendants attached the affidavit and its attached exhibits to\ntheir appellate brief, indicating that although the affidavit was listed in the register of actions, it\nwas “inadvertently omitted from the Clerk’s record.” It is well settled that this Court is bound by\nthe record and cannot consider matters or materials that are not part of the record or not\ncontained in the record.

In addition, it is the responsibility of the appellant to provide a\nsufficient record to substantiate his or her claims on appeal. Powell v. Sellers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1153070\"><a href=\"/opinion/1153070/powell-v-sellers/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n127, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1153070\"><a href=\"/opinion/1153070/powell-v-sellers/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (Ct. App. 1997). In the absence of an adequate record on appeal to\nsupport the appellant’s claims, we will not presume error. Id. Thus, we will not presume the\ndistrict court erred in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment where\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly has not provided a sufficient record for us to assess the claim.\n       Even if we were to consider the affidavit and its attached exhibits and reach the merits of\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s claim, we would conclude the district court did not err in granting the\nDefendants’ motion.      Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was referred for placement in administrative\nsegregation on May 10, 2006. The form indicated the reasons for the referral: “To protect you\nfrom other offenders”; “To protect other offenders from you”; and “To stabilize a volatile or\ndifficult situation.”    The referral provided forty-eight hours’ notice of the hearing.\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly waived the forty-eight hour preparation time for the hearing and a\n“Restrictive Housing Placement” hearing was held on May 11 before the Housing Placement\nCommittee (Committee).        The Committee considered Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s disciplinary\nrecord, prison records from his past incarceration, attitude towards authority, willingness and\nability to live with other offenders, classification (close custody at the time), and documented\ncurrent and past behavior. In its summary of the evidence, the Committee also noted that\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly had expressed “intimate feelings” for another inmate and had prior\nsexual predator “points,” which created a possible security risk and a Prison Rape Elimination\nAct (PREA) threat. Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly indicated to the Committee he would be in danger if\nmoved to the Idaho Maximum Security Institution (IMSI) and contended the previous PREA\ndesignation was unfounded.         The Committee unanimously recommended Lerajjareanra-\nO-Kel-Ly be placed in administrative segregation and forwarded their recommendation to\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fWarden Kimberly Jones, who authorized the placement on May 12. Over the next five years,\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly continued to be housed at IMSI in administrative segregation. He had\nperiodic reviews by the Committee, some of which recommended continued placement in\nadministrative segregation that were approved by the warden, and others recommending release\nfrom administrative segregation that were rejected by the warden.\n       From these facts, we would conclude Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly clearly received the\nprocess due him both prior to and during his prolonged placement in administrative segregation.\nAs required by Hewitt, Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was given notice of the placement hearing and\nthe reasons segregation was being considered and a committee considered evidence and\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s statement at a nonadversarial hearing held the day after he was given\nnotice. In addition, although Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly remained in administrative segregation for\nan extended period, periodic reviews of his status were held. There is, therefore, no question\nthat, on its face, the procedure provided to Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly was constitutionally\nadequate.   The district court did not err in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment on this issue.\n                                               III.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly did not have a protected liberty interest at stake in any of the four\ndisciplinary hearings at issue because his punishments did not amount to “atypical or significant\nhardship” such that his procedural due process rights were implicated. Also, even assuming\nLerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly has a liberty interest in regard to his extended placement in\nadministrative segregation, and that we may reach the issue given the deficient record on appeal,\nhe was afforded constitutionally adequate procedural due process. Accordingly, the district court\ndid not err in granting the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The district court’s\njudgment summarily dismissing Lerajjareanra-O-Kel-Ly’s civil rights complaint is affirmed.\n        Judge GRATTON and Judge MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f</pre>",
