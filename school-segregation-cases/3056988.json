XIV,\n§ 4, and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, U.S.\nConst. amend. V. He seeks relief declaring the Debt Limit\nStatute unconstitutional and enjoining the Secretary from\nenforcing the statute. Because Williams fails to allege\nplausible factual allegations to establish the constitutional\nminimum requirements for Article III standing, either in the\nfirst amended complaint filed with the district court or in his\nproposed amended complaint filed with this Court under 28\nU.S.C. § 1653, we affirm the decision of the district court\ndismissing Williams’s claims for lack of standing. We also\naffirm the district court’s order denying Williams’s motion to\namend his first amended complaint and deny Williams’s\nmotion to amend his complaint on appeal.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     This case is an outgrowth of the continuing debate\nsurrounding the statutory limit on U.S. debt. The Debt Limit\nStatute, 31 U.S.C. § 3101(b), imposes an upper limit on “[t]he\nface amount of obligations issued under this chapter and the\nface amount of obligations whose principal and interest are\nguaranteed by the United States Government.” The United\nStates first instituted a ceiling on the federal debt in 1917 to\naccompany the United States’ entrance into World War I. See\n\f                              3\nD. Andrew Austin, Cong. Research Serv., The Debt Limit:\nHistory and Recent Increases 2-3 (2008), http://fpc.state.gov/\ndocuments/organization/105193.pdf; see also Act of Sept. 24,\n1917, Pub. L. No. 65-43, 40 Stat. 288 (codified as amended at\n31 U.S.C. § 3101). The original purpose of the Debt Limit\nStatute was to increase the Treasury Department’s flexibility\nto manage the government’s financial obligations. See\nAustin, supra, at 3; see also Josh Hazan, Unconstitutional\nDebt Ceilings, 103 Geo. L.J. Online 29, 30-32 (2014). Yet\nboth in 2011 and in 2013, congressional budgeting disputes\nthreatened default on U.S. obligations as outstanding debt\nbroached the debt ceiling. See Hazan, supra, at 29-30.\nFollowing the 2011 impasse, “U.S. government debt was\ndowngraded, the stock market fell, measures of volatility\njumped, and credit risk spreads widened noticeably . . . .”\nU.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, The Potential Macroeconomic\nEffect of Debt Ceiling Brinksmanship 1 (2013), https://\nwww.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Report-on-\nMacroeconomic-Effect-of-Debt-Ceiling-\nBrinkmanship.aspx. Likewise, the 2013 dispute “further\neroded confidence in the United States government, and\nwounded the already fragile economy.” Chad DeVeaux, The\nFourth Zone of Presidential Power: Analyzing the Debt-\nCeiling Standoffs Through the Prism of Youngstown Steel, 47\nConn. L. Rev. 395, 407 (2014). In the wake of these political\nimpasses, Congress presently has suspended the Debt Limit\nStatute through March 15, 2017. See Bipartisan Budget Act\nof 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-74, § 901(a), 129 Stat. 584, 620.\n\n     Williams holds various Treasury-issued public debt\ninstruments, including “savings bonds and Treasury bills,\nnotes, bonds, and TIPS [Treasury Inflation Indexed\nSecurities] of various durations (4-weeks, 13-weeks, 26-\nweeks, 52-week[s], 3-years, 5-years, 7-years, [and] 30-\nyears).” J.A. 20 ¶ 39. Seeking a judicial solution to what he\n\f                               4\nviews as the perpetual “political conflict regarding the\ninevitable need to raise the debt limit,” J.A. 6 ¶ 2, on February\n7, 2014, Williams filed suit, challenging the constitutionality\nof the Debt Limit Statute, against the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury and the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury (collectively,\nthe “Treasury Department”). Before the Treasury Department\nlodged a responsive pleading or Rule 12(b) motion, Williams\nfiled a first amended complaint as-of-right on March 5, 2014.\nCf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). The first amended complaint\nsought a judgment declaring the Debt Limit Statute\nunconstitutional and a permanent injunction prohibiting the\nTreasury Department from “relying upon, invoking, or\nenforcing” the statute. J.A. 34.\n\n     Williams asserted three alleged constitutional infirmities\nin the Debt Limit Statute before the district court. First, he\nclaimed that the statute violates the Public Debt Clause, U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, § 4, which states, in relevant part:\n\n       The validity of the public debt of the United\n       States, authorized by law, including debts\n       incurred for payment of pensions and\n       bounties for services in suppressing\n       insurrection or rebellion, shall not be\n       questioned.\n\n\nSee J.A. 21 ¶ 42(A); see also Amended Complaint Filed on\nAppeal Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1653 ¶¶ 65(A), 66, Williams v.\nLew, No. 15-5065 (D.C. Cir. May 14, 2015) [hereinafter Pr.\nAm. Compl.]. Second, Williams alleged a violation of the\nFifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause based on the\nTreasury Department’s “arbitrary enforcement” of the Debt\nLimit Statute. J.A. 21 ¶ 42(A); see also Pr. Am. Compl.\n¶¶ 65(A), 66. Finally, Williams made a separation-of-powers\n\f                               5\nargument that the Debt Limit Statute “prevent[s] the\nExecutive from carrying out sworn Article II § 3 duties to\n‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” J.A. 21\n¶ 42(B); see also Pr. Am. Compl. ¶ 65(B).\n\n     The Treasury Department moved to dismiss Williams’s\nfirst amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of\nstanding. Williams then moved under Rule 15(a)(2) for leave\nto file a second amended complaint, in part “to clarify his\nclaims [and to] further explain and develop the basis for his\nstanding . . . .” J.A. 96. The district court denied Williams’s\nmotion to amend without explanation via minute order on\nMay 18, 2014. On January 6, 2015, the district court granted\nthe Treasury Department’s motion to dismiss, concluding that\nWilliams lacked standing to pursue his claims in federal court.\nWilliams now appeals from the district court’s denial of his\nmotion to amend and from the order dismissing his claims for\nlack of standing. Williams also moves this Court for leave to\namend his complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1653. Request To\nAllow Filing of an Amended Complaint & Alternative Motion\nTo Vacate, Reverse, & Remand, Williams v. Lew, No. 15-\n5065 (D.C. Cir. May 1, 2015). We have jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\n     Williams makes only a fleeting reference in his opening\nbrief, within a section ostensibly discussing his Public Debt\nClause claim, to his separation-of-powers argument.\nAppellant’s Br. 15-16 (stating that the debt limit “traps the\nExecutive in an arbitrary ‘trilemna’ [sic] . . . [which] works a\nstructural constitutional violation”). Because he fails to\ndevelop that argument, or his standing to assert it, Williams\nhas therefore forfeited the claim. See Abdullah v. Obama,\n753 F.3d 193, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (A “bare and conclusory\n\f                              6\nassertion” in the opening brief “fail[s] to preserve the\nclaim.”); N.Y. Rehab. Care Mgmt., LLC v. NLRB, 506 F.3d\n1070, 1076 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“It is not enough merely to\nmention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving\nthe court to do counsel’s work.”). The only remaining issues\non appeal are: (1) whether the district court erred in denying\nWilliams’s motion to amend the first amended complaint, and\n(2) whether Williams has Article III standing to bring his\nclaims in federal court. We affirm as to both.\n\n       A. ANY ERROR IN THE DENIAL OF WILLIAMS’S\n          MOTION TO AMEND WAS HARMLESS\n\n     Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), when unable to do so as-\nof-right, “a party may amend its pleading only with the\nopposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The\ncourt should freely give leave when justice so requires.” We\nreview a district court’s denial of a motion to amend a\ncomplaint for abuse of discretion. See Sierra Club v. U.S.\nArmy Corps of Engineers, 803 F.3d 31, 53 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\nUnder our case law it is an abuse of discretion for a district\ncourt to deny leave to amend without providing a reasoned\njustification for the denial. See Barkley v. U.S. Marshals\nServ., 766 F.3d 25, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citing Foman v.\nDavis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). In this case, the district\ncourt denied Williams’s motion to file a second amended\ncomplaint in a minute order lacking any reasons for the\ndenial. Such an unsubstantiated order may amount to an\nabuse of discretion. Barkley, 766 F.3d at 38. However, this\nomission of reasons is at worst harmless error.\n\n     Governing law permits litigants to amend their pleadings\n“in . . . appellate courts” to cure “[d]efective allegations of\njurisdiction . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 1653. As noted above,\nWilliams filed both a § 1653 motion and an amended\n\f                                7\ncomplaint (the “Proposed Amended Complaint”) with this\nCourt. “Courts may deny a motion to amend a complaint as\nfutile . . . if the proposed claim would not survive a motion to\ndismiss.” James Madison Ltd. by Hecht v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d\n1085, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Accordingly, because we hold\nthat Williams’s Proposed Amended Complaint fails to state a\nplausible basis for standing, we deny the pending § 1653\nmotion as futile and affirm the district court’s minute order.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2111 (Appellate courts must disregard “errors\nor defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the\nparties.”).\n\n       B. WILLIAMS LACKS ARTICLE III STANDING\n\n               1. Standard of Review\n\n     We review the district court’s standing determinations de\nnovo. See Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d\n905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015). “To survive a motion to dismiss\nfor lack of standing, a complaint must state a plausible claim\nthat the plaintiff has suffered an injury in fact fairly traceable\nto the actions of the defendant that is likely to be redressed by\na favorable decision on the merits.” Humane Soc’y v. Vilsack,\n797 F.3d 4, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). While we accept all\n“well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all\nreasonable inferences from those allegations in the plaintiff’s\nfavor,” we do not assume the truth of legal conclusions.\nArpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Neither\ndo we accept “threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s\nelements, supported by mere conclusory statements.”\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009).\n\f                               8\n               2. Williams Does Not Allege a Cognizable\n                  Injury-In-Fact\n\n     The operative complaint before the district court was\nWilliams’s first amended complaint. See J.A. 2. This\ncomplaint clearly fails to allege a plausible basis for standing.\nWilliams asserts only that he holds United States public debt\nand “avers direct, individual, concrete, and certainly\nimpending harm from the unconstitutional debt ceiling\nstatute.” J.A. 20 ¶ 39; cf. id. at 5-6 ¶ 1 (noting the “threat[]\n[of] Defendants’ arbitrary default on Plaintiff’s securities”);\nid. at 27 ¶ 50 (alleging “concrete and certainly impending\nharm”). Because such conclusory statements and legal\nconclusions are insufficient to state a plausible basis for\nstanding, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663, Williams can only avoid\ndismissal if the Proposed Amended Complaint accompanying\nhis § 1653 motion with this Court cures the defect, see James\nMadison Ltd. by Hecht, 82 F.3d at 1099. We therefore focus\nour attention on the Proposed Amended Complaint.\n\n     In that complaint, Williams alleges past, current, and\nfuture harms from the Debt Limit Statute to his public debt\nholdings. Specifically, Williams discusses how the market\ndevalued public debt as a result of the 2013 “default crisis,”\nincluding, for example, how “[o]n October 15, 2013, interest\nrates on commercial interbank loans were lower than interest\nrates on Treasury bills.” Pr. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30-35. As to\ncurrent harms, Williams claims that the Debt Limit Statute\ndegrades the low-risk profile of his investments and devalues\nthose investments. Id. ¶¶ 2, 21, 30, 41, 44. Such harms\nsupposedly worsen when the Treasury Department resorts to\n“extraordinary measures” following breach of the debt\nceiling. Id. ¶¶ 4, 45. Williams also alleges that he suffered\nand continues to suffer noneconomic harms in the form of\n“increasing[] worry and concern” about his public debt\n\f                               9\ninvestments. Id. ¶¶ 2, 21. Finally, Williams avers to\n“certainly-impending” future economic and noneconomic\nharms from the full enforcement of the Debt Limit Statute—\ni.e., an actual default on United States debts. Id. ¶¶ 4, 45, 50.\n\n     Williams’s allegations of past injury are irrelevant to the\nstanding inquiry in this case. We stated in Arpaio v. Obama\nthat, where a plaintiff “seeks prospective declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, he must establish an ongoing or future injury\nthat is ‘certainly impending’; he may not rest on past injury.”\n797 F.3d at 19. Williams seeks “a declaratory judgment that\nthe debt ceiling statute is unconstitutional” along with a\npermanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the statute.\nPr. Am. Compl. at 60-61. He therefore must rely on concrete\nand particular current or future injuries-in-fact to establish\nstanding.\n\n     Unfortunately for Williams, his claims of future injuries\nare entirely conjectural. It is indisputable that the United\nStates has never defaulted on its debt obligations. See\nWilliams v. Lew, 77 F. Supp. 3d 129, 132-33 (D.D.C. 2015);\nAppellees’ Br. 3. Further, as the district court correctly noted,\nany future injury that Williams might suffer follows from an\nextended chain of contingencies. Williams v. Lew, 77 F.\nSupp. 3d at 133. In particular: (1) federal debt must reach the\nstatutory ceiling; (2) the Treasury Department must exhaust\nany “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default; (3) the\nUnited States must be unable to pay its obligations with “cash\non hand” in a given day; (4) payment on Williams’s securities\nmust come due during such time; and (5) Williams must\ncontinue to hold those securities. Id. Furthermore, Congress\nmust fail to enact legislation suspending or increasing the debt\nlimit despite an impending breach of the statutory ceiling—\nsomething it has done on over seventy occasions since 1962.\nSee Austin, supra, at 8. “When considering any chain of\n\f                               10\nallegations for standing purposes, we may reject as overly\nspeculative those links which are predictions of future events\n(especially future actions to be taken by third parties) . . . .”\nArpaio, 797 F.3d at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because Williams fails plausibly to allege that any\nfuture injuries are “certainly impending to constitute injury in\nfact,” he cannot rely on such injuries to establish Article III\nstanding. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138,\n1147 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphasis in original).\n\n     Thus, in order to satisfy Article III’s standing\nrequirements, Williams must put forth plausible allegations of\ncurrent and ongoing injuries. An analysis of the Proposed\nAmended Complaint shows that Williams fails to meet this\nstandard. The crux of Williams’s argument is that the Debt\nLimit Statute degrades the risk profile of his public debt\nholdings and devalues those investments. To support this\nposition, Williams cites in his briefs, but not in the complaint,\na July 2015 report from the Government Accountability\nOffice (“GAO”) discussing the market effects of “debt limit\nimpasses.” See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, DEBT\nLIMIT: Market Response to Recent Impasses Underscores\nNeed To Consider Alternative Approaches (2015) [hereinafter\nGAO Report], http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/671286.pdf.\nThe GAO Report admittedly details numerous effects that the\n2011 and 2013 debt limit impasses had on U.S. financial\nmarkets. For example, investors avoided “at-risk” Treasury\nsecurities; interest rates on “at-risk” securities rose; the\nliquidity of “at-risk” securities declined; investors substituted\n“at-risk” Treasury securities for other investments; and\ninvestors refused to accept “at-risk” Treasury securities as\ncollateral. Id. at 12-28.\n\f                               11\n     The Court may take judicial notice of the GAO Report.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); see also Farah v. Esquire\nMagazine, 736 F.3d 528, 534 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“And, [i]n\ndetermining whether a complaint states a claim, the court may\nconsider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents\nattached thereto or incorporated therein, and matters of which\nit may take judicial notice.” (alteration in original) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted)). However, the GAO\nReport does not make Williams’s alleged current injuries\nplausible. To the contrary, the report suggests that prior debt\nlimit impasses only affected “at-risk” Treasury securities, i.e.,\nholdings with payments due during the impasse. See, e.g.,\nGAO Report 13 (“Market participants said that investors were\nprimarily concerned with shorter-term Treasury bills that\nwere maturing during this time [late-October through mid-\nNovember 2013].”); U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO\nHighlights: Highlights of GAO-15-476, A Report to the\nCongress 1 (2015), http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/\n671287.pdf (“During the 2013 debt limit impasse, investors\nreported taking the unprecedented action of systematically\navoiding certain Treasury securities—those that matured\naround the dates when the [Treasury Department] projected it\nwould exhaust . . . extraordinary measures . . . .”). Williams’s\ncurrent investment holdings are not “at-risk.” As the Treasury\nDepartment states, the Debt Limit Statute is suspended until\nMarch 15, 2017. See Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Pub. L.\nNo. 114-74, § 901(a). Any effect that the Debt Limit\nStatute’s specter may have on Williams’s current public debt\nholdings is therefore speculative and made no less so by the\nallegations in the Proposed Amended Complaint. See Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 560 (injury-in-fact cannot be “conjectural” or\n“hypothetical”). Nor is it clear that Williams’s securities will\nbecome “at-risk” in the future. Because Congress has\nsuspended the Debt Limit Statute, Williams must rely on rote\n\f                              12\nconjecture that another debt limit impasse will occur once the\nsuspension ends. See id.\n\n     Furthermore, Williams’s alleged noneconomic injuries do\nnot provide a plausible basis for standing. For the reasons\nstated above, any current harm to Williams’s investments is\nspeculative, and he fails to allege future harms that are\ncertainly impending. The Court cannot exercise jurisdiction\nbased on “worr[ies] and concern[s]” that lack a reasoned\nbasis. Pr. Am. Compl. ¶ 2; see Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1151\n(“[R]espondents cannot manufacture standing merely by\ninflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of\nhypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”).\n\n               3. Williams Separately Lacks Standing To\n                  Pursue His Due Process Claims\n\n     Williams asserts a Fifth Amendment due process\nviolation based on the Treasury Department’s “arbitrary”\nenforcement of the Debt Limit Statute. Pr. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5,\n11, 21, 46. In particular, Williams alleges that the Treasury\nDepartment cannot prioritize payments to holders of public\ndebt in the event of default, id. ¶ 5, and it “has no rational\nmethod to protect Treasury bondholders, insure Certificate of\nIndebtedness liquidity, or honor promises to repay the TSP G\nFund in the certain event of default,” id. ¶ 46. This claim\nturns entirely on hypothetical future injury from the arbitrary\nprioritization of Treasury funds and therefore fails plausibly\nto allege a cognizable injury-in-fact. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560;\nsee also Williams v. Lew, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 133 n.4 (noting\nthat “no . . . plan or policy for prioritizing debt payments has\neven been formed” by the Treasury Department).\n\f                               13\n               4. The Court Need Not Reach the Treasury\n                  Department’s Remaining Arguments\n\n     The Treasury Department also argues that we should\ndismiss Williams’s claims as “generalized grievances” that\n“do not state an Article III case or controversy.” Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 574. We need not parse the line between a\n“generalized grievance” and a “concrete, though widely\nshared” injury-in-fact. FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 23-24\n(1998). Williams fails to allege plausible facts to establish the\n“irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,” Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 560, thereby obviating the generalized grievance issue.\nFor the same reason, we find it unnecessary to revisit our\nprior cases discussing the availability, or lack thereof, of\n“bondholder standing.” See Reuss v. Balles, 584 F.2d 461,\n469-70 n.29 (D.C. Cir. 1978); cf. Riegle v. FOMC, 656 F.2d\n873, 876 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Comm. for Monetary Reform v.\nBd. of Govs. of Fed. Reserve Sys., 766 F.2d 538, 540 (D.C.\nCir. 1985).\n\n    We therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of\nWilliams’s claims for lack of standing.\n\n       C. WILLIAMS’S FACIAL CHALLENGE TO THE DEBT\n          LIMIT STATUTE DOES NOT PROVIDE AN\n          INDEPENDENT BASIS FOR STANDING\n\n     In the alternative, Williams cryptically alleges that his\nfacial challenge to the Debt Limit Statute is sufficient to\nconfer Article III standing. Williams’s argument is itself\nfacially suspect, and it is also unavailing under the Supreme\nCourt’s and our case law.\n\n    As the Supreme Court stated explicitly in Lujan, the three\nelements of standing—i.e., injury-in-fact, traceability, and\n\f                               14\nredressability—encompass “the irreducible constitutional\nminimum” under Article III. 504 U.S. at 560. Absent any\none of these requirements, federal courts lack jurisdiction to\nadjudicate a plaintiff’s claims. As the Court stated in Bond v.\nUnited States, 564 U.S. 211, 225 (2011), “If . . . a litigant who\ncommences suit fails to show actual or imminent harm that is\nconcrete and particular, fairly traceable to the conduct\ncomplained of, and likely to be redressed by a favorable\ndecision, the Federal Judiciary cannot hear the claim.” By\ncontrast, “the threshold for facial challenges is a species of\nthird party (jus tertii) standing, which . . . [is] a prudential\ndoctrine and not one mandated by Article III of the\nConstitution.” City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 55\nn.22 (1999) (Stevens, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg, JJ.);\nsee also LaRoque v. Holder, 650 F.3d 777, 791-92 (D.C. Cir.\n2011) (stating the “prudential principle” limiting third-party\nstanding); Anderson v. Holder, 647 F.3d 1165, 1172 (D.C.\nCir. 2011) (“The traditional rule is that a person to whom a\nstatute may constitutionally be applied may not challenge that\nstatute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied\nunconstitutionally to others in situations not before the\nCourt.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n     Because, as demonstrated above, Williams fails to allege\nplausible facts to establish the “irreducible constitutional\nminimum” requirements for Article III standing under Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 560, the district court also properly dismissed his\nfacial challenge to the Debt Limit Statute. Williams cites\nBrown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954), for the\nproposition that a facial violation of a constitutional interest\nconfers jurisdiction on the federal courts. But Williams\nmisreads that case. The plaintiffs in Brown each suffered an\ninjury-in-fact—“they [were] denied admission to schools\nattended by white children under laws requiring or permitting\nsegregation according to race.” Id. at 488. “This segregation\n\f                               15\nwas alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of\nthe laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id.\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court has expressly disavowed the\ntheory that Williams advances here; “an asserted right to have\nthe Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient,\nstanding alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.”\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 754 (1984), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components,\nInc., 134 S. Ct. 1377 (2014).\n\n     We recognize that the contours of Article III standing\nwith respect to facial constitutional challenges may be\nimprecise. Compare Los Angeles Police Dep’t v. United\nReporting Pub. Corp., 528 U.S. 32, 38-40 (1999) (citing cases\nin which the Court permitted facial challenges but reaffirming\nthe “traditional rule” limiting such claims), and United States\nv. Szabo, 760 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2014) (“While an\noverbreadth challenge may be brought where a statute is\nconstitutional as applied to the individual challenging it, such\nchallenges are exceptions to the ordinary standing\nrequirements, and are not ‘casually employed.’”), with\nPlanned Parenthood of Wis., Inc. v. Schimel, 806 F.3d 908,\n910 (7th Cir. 2015) (noting that “the Supreme Court has\nentertained both broad facial challenges and pre-enforcement\nas-applied challenges to abortion laws brought by physicians\non behalf of their patients” (quoting Isaacson v. Horne, 716\nF.3d 1213, 1221 (9th Cir. 2013))), and Dickerson v.\nNapolitano, 604 F.3d 732, 743 n.11 (2d Cir. 2010) (“One\npotential case where an as-applied challenge may not be\npermitted . . . but a facial challenge still conceivably could be\npermissible would be a challenge to a law that had not yet\nbeen, but potentially could be, applied unconstitutionally to\nthe party challenging it.”).         See generally Toghil v.\nCommonwealth, 768 S.E.2d 674, 678 (Va. 2015) (requiring an\nappellant making a facial challenge to “show[] . . . that the\n\f                              16\nstatute in question is unconstitutional as applied to him and\nthat the statute in question would not be constitutional in any\ncontext” and citing federal court cases).\n\n     But we know of no case stating that a facial challenge to\nthe constitutionality of a statute itself suffices to establish\nstanding, nor do we adopt such a holding. Unless there is an\nactual Article III “Case[]” or “Controvers[y]” before us, we\nlack jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 559-60; Grocery Mfrs. Ass’n v. EPA, 693 F.3d\n169, 174 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“The application of the standing\ndoctrine . . . ensures that federal courts act only within their\nconstitutionally prescribed role: resolving ‘Cases’ and\n‘Controversies,’ those disputes which are appropriately\nresolved through the judicial process.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Because Williams does not make\nthis constitutionally mandated showing, we therefore affirm\nthe district court’s dismissal of his claim that the Debt Limit\nStatute is facially unconstitutional.\n\nIII.     CONCLUSION\n\n     We express no opinion on the merits of Williams’s\nconstitutional claims. For the reasons stated herein, the Court\naffirms both the district court’s order denying Williams’s\nmotion to amend his complaint and the order dismissing\nWilliams’s claims for lack of standing. Williams’s motion\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1653 to amend his complaint on appeal is\naccordingly denied.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f",

XIV,\n§ 4, and the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, U.S.\nConst. amend. V. He seeks relief declaring the Debt Limit\nStatute unconstitutional and enjoining the Secretary from\nenforcing the statute. Because Williams fails to allege\nplausible factual allegations to establish the constitutional\nminimum requirements for Article III standing, either in the\nfirst amended complaint filed with the district court or in his\nproposed amended complaint filed with this Court under 28\nU.S.C. § 1653, we affirm the decision of the district court\ndismissing Williams’s claims for lack of standing. We also\naffirm the district court’s order denying Williams’s motion to\namend his first amended complaint and deny Williams’s\nmotion to amend his complaint on appeal.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     This case is an outgrowth of the continuing debate\nsurrounding the statutory limit on U.S. debt. The Debt Limit\nStatute, 31 U.S.C. § 3101(b), imposes an upper limit on “[t]he\nface amount of obligations issued under this chapter and the\nface amount of obligations whose principal and interest are\nguaranteed by the United States Government.” The United\nStates first instituted a ceiling on the federal debt in 1917 to\naccompany the United States’ entrance into World War I. See\n\f                              3\nD. Andrew Austin, Cong. Research Serv., The Debt Limit:\nHistory and Recent Increases 2-3 (2008), http://fpc.state.gov/\ndocuments/organization/105193.pdf; see also Act of Sept. 24,\n1917, Pub. L. No. 65-43, 40 Stat. 288 (codified as amended at\n31 U.S.C. § 3101). The original purpose of the Debt Limit\nStatute was to increase the Treasury Department’s flexibility\nto manage the government’s financial obligations. See\nAustin, supra, at 3; see also Josh Hazan, Unconstitutional\nDebt Ceilings, 103 Geo. L.J. Online 29, 30-32 (2014). Yet\nboth in 2011 and in 2013, congressional budgeting disputes\nthreatened default on U.S. obligations as outstanding debt\nbroached the debt ceiling. See Hazan, supra, at 29-30.\nFollowing the 2011 impasse, “U.S. government debt was\ndowngraded, the stock market fell, measures of volatility\njumped, and credit risk spreads widened noticeably . . . .”\nU.S. Dep’t of the Treasury, The Potential Macroeconomic\nEffect of Debt Ceiling Brinksmanship 1 (2013), https://\nwww.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Report-on-\nMacroeconomic-Effect-of-Debt-Ceiling-\nBrinkmanship.aspx. Likewise, the 2013 dispute “further\neroded confidence in the United States government, and\nwounded the already fragile economy.” Chad DeVeaux, The\nFourth Zone of Presidential Power: Analyzing the Debt-\nCeiling Standoffs Through the Prism of Youngstown Steel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 395, 407 (2014). In the wake of these political\nimpasses, Congress presently has suspended the Debt Limit\nStatute through March 15, 2017. See Bipartisan Budget Act\nof 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-74, § 901(a), 129 Stat. 584, 620.\n\n     Williams holds various Treasury-issued public debt\ninstruments, including “savings bonds and Treasury bills,\nnotes, bonds, and TIPS [Treasury Inflation Indexed\nSecurities] of various durations (4-weeks, 13-weeks, 26-\nweeks, 52-week[s], 3-years, 5-years, 7-years, [and] 30-\nyears).” J.A. 20 ¶ 39. Seeking a judicial solution to what he\n\f                               4\nviews as the perpetual “political conflict regarding the\ninevitable need to raise the debt limit,” J.A. 6 ¶ 2, on February\n7, 2014, Williams filed suit, challenging the constitutionality\nof the Debt Limit Statute, against the U.S. Department of the\nTreasury and the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury (collectively,\nthe “Treasury Department”). Before the Treasury Department\nlodged a responsive pleading or Rule 12(b) motion, Williams\nfiled a first amended complaint as-of-right on March 5, 2014.\nCf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). The first amended complaint\nsought a judgment declaring the Debt Limit Statute\nunconstitutional and a permanent injunction prohibiting the\nTreasury Department from “relying upon, invoking, or\nenforcing” the statute. J.A. 34.\n\n     Williams asserted three alleged constitutional infirmities\nin the Debt Limit Statute before the district court. First, he\nclaimed that the statute violates the Public Debt Clause, U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, § 4, which states, in relevant part:\n\n       The validity of the public debt of the United\n       States, authorized by law, including debts\n       incurred for payment of pensions and\n       bounties for services in suppressing\n       insurrection or rebellion, shall not be\n       questioned.\n\n\nSee J.A. 21 ¶ 42(A); see also Amended Complaint Filed on\nAppeal Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1653 ¶¶ 65(A), 66, Williams v.\nLew, No. 15-5065 (D.C. Cir. May 14, 2015) [hereinafter Pr.\nAm. Compl.]. Second, Williams alleged a violation of the\nFifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause based on the\nTreasury Department’s “arbitrary enforcement” of the Debt\nLimit Statute. J.A. 21 ¶ 42(A); see also Pr. Am. Compl.\n¶¶ 65(A), 66. Finally, Williams made a separation-of-powers\n\f                               5\nargument that the Debt Limit Statute “prevent[s] the\nExecutive from carrying out sworn Article II § 3 duties to\n‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” J.A. 21\n¶ 42(B); see also Pr. Am. Compl. ¶ 65(B).\n\n     The Treasury Department moved to dismiss Williams’s\nfirst amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of\nstanding. Williams then moved under Rule 15(a)(2) for leave\nto file a second amended complaint, in part “to clarify his\nclaims [and to] further explain and develop the basis for his\nstanding . . . .” J.A. 96. The district court denied Williams’s\nmotion to amend without explanation via minute order on\nMay 18, 2014. On January 6, 2015, the district court granted\nthe Treasury Department’s motion to dismiss, concluding that\nWilliams lacked standing to pursue his claims in federal court.\nWilliams now appeals from the district court’s denial of his\nmotion to amend and from the order dismissing his claims for\nlack of standing. Williams also moves this Court for leave to\namend his complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1653. Request To\nAllow Filing of an Amended Complaint & Alternative Motion\nTo Vacate, Reverse, & Remand, Williams v. Lew, No. 15-\n5065 (D.C. Cir. May 1, 2015). We have jurisdiction pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\n     Williams makes only a fleeting reference in his opening\nbrief, within a section ostensibly discussing his Public Debt\nClause claim, to his separation-of-powers argument.\nAppellant’s Br. 15-16 (stating that the debt limit “traps the\nExecutive in an arbitrary ‘trilemna’ [sic] . . . [which] works a\nstructural constitutional violation”). Because he fails to\ndevelop that argument, or his standing to assert it, Williams\nhas therefore forfeited the claim. See Abdullah v. Obama,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199 (D.C.

Cir. 2007) (“It is not enough merely to\nmention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving\nthe court to do counsel’s work.”). The only remaining issues\non appeal are: (1) whether the district court erred in denying\nWilliams’s motion to amend the first amended complaint, and\n(2) whether Williams has Article III standing to bring his\nclaims in federal court. We affirm as to both.\n\n       A. ANY ERROR IN THE DENIAL OF WILLIAMS’S\n          MOTION TO AMEND WAS HARMLESS\n\n     Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), when unable to do so as-\nof-right, “a party may amend its pleading only with the\nopposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The\ncourt should freely give leave when justice so requires.” We\nreview a district court’s denial of a motion to amend a\ncomplaint for abuse of discretion. See Sierra Club v. U.S.\nArmy Corps of Engineers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\nUnder our case law it is an abuse of discretion for a district\ncourt to deny leave to amend without providing a reasoned\njustification for the denial. See Barkley v. U.S. Marshals\nServ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (D.C.

In this case, the district\ncourt denied Williams’s motion to file a second amended\ncomplaint in a minute order lacking any reasons for the\ndenial. Such an unsubstantiated order may amount to an\nabuse of discretion. Barkley, 766 F.3d at 38. However, this\nomission of reasons is at worst harmless error.\n\n     Governing law permits litigants to amend their pleadings\n“in . . . appellate courts” to cure “[d]efective allegations of\njurisdiction . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 1653. As noted above,\nWilliams filed both a § 1653 motion and an amended\n\f                                7\ncomplaint (the “Proposed Amended Complaint”) with this\nCourt. “Courts may deny a motion to amend a complaint as\nfutile . . . if the proposed claim would not survive a motion to\ndismiss.” James Madison Ltd. by Hecht v.

Cir. 1996). Accordingly, because we hold\nthat Williams’s Proposed Amended Complaint fails to state a\nplausible basis for standing, we deny the pending § 1653\nmotion as futile and affirm the district court’s minute order.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2111 (Appellate courts must disregard “errors\nor defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the\nparties.”).\n\n       B. WILLIAMS LACKS ARTICLE III STANDING\n\n               1. Standard of Review\n\n     We review the district court’s standing determinations de\nnovo. See Food & Water Watch, Inc. v.

Williams Does Not Allege a Cognizable\n                  Injury-In-Fact\n\n     The operative complaint before the district court was\nWilliams’s first amended complaint. See J.A. 2. This\ncomplaint clearly fails to allege a plausible basis for standing.\nWilliams asserts only that he holds United States public debt\nand “avers direct, individual, concrete, and certainly\nimpending harm from the unconstitutional debt ceiling\nstatute.” J.A. 20 ¶ 39; cf. id. at 5-6 ¶ 1 (noting the “threat[]\n[of] Defendants’ arbitrary default on Plaintiff’s securities”);\nid. at 27 ¶ 50 (alleging “concrete and certainly impending\nharm”). Because such conclusory statements and legal\nconclusions are insufficient to state a plausible basis for\nstanding, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663, Williams can only avoid\ndismissal if the Proposed Amended Complaint accompanying\nhis § 1653 motion with this Court cures the defect, see James\nMadison Ltd. by Hecht, 82 F.3d at 1099. We therefore focus\nour attention on the Proposed Amended Complaint.\n\n     In that complaint, Williams alleges past, current, and\nfuture harms from the Debt Limit Statute to his public debt\nholdings. Specifically, Williams discusses how the market\ndevalued public debt as a result of the 2013 “default crisis,”\nincluding, for example, how “[o]n October 15, 2013, interest\nrates on commercial interbank loans were lower than interest\nrates on Treasury bills.” Pr. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30-35. As to\ncurrent harms, Williams claims that the Debt Limit Statute\ndegrades the low-risk profile of his investments and devalues\nthose investments. Id. ¶¶ 2, 21, 30, 41, 44. Such harms\nsupposedly worsen when the Treasury Department resorts to\n“extraordinary measures” following breach of the debt\nceiling. Id. ¶¶ 4, 45. Williams also alleges that he suffered\nand continues to suffer noneconomic harms in the form of\n“increasing[] worry and concern” about his public debt\n\f                               9\ninvestments. Id. ¶¶ 2, 21. Finally, Williams avers to\n“certainly-impending” future economic and noneconomic\nharms from the full enforcement of the Debt Limit Statute—\ni.e., an actual default on United States debts. Id. ¶¶ 4, 45, 50.\n\n     Williams’s allegations of past injury are irrelevant to the\nstanding inquiry in this case. We stated in Arpaio v. Obama\nthat, where a plaintiff “seeks prospective declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, he must establish an ongoing or future injury\nthat is ‘certainly impending’; he may not rest on past injury.”\n797 F.3d at 19. Williams seeks “a declaratory judgment that\nthe debt ceiling statute is unconstitutional” along with a\npermanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the statute.\nPr. Am. Compl. at 60-61. He therefore must rely on concrete\nand particular current or future injuries-in-fact to establish\nstanding.\n\n     Unfortunately for Williams, his claims of future injuries\nare entirely conjectural. It is indisputable that the United\nStates has never defaulted on its debt obligations. See\nWilliams v. Lew, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132-33 (D.D.C. 2015);\nAppellees’ Br. 3. Further, as the district court correctly noted,\nany future injury that Williams might suffer follows from an\nextended chain of contingencies. Williams v. Lew, 77 F.\nSupp. 3d at 133. In particular: (1) federal debt must reach the\nstatutory ceiling; (2) the Treasury Department must exhaust\nany “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default; (3) the\nUnited States must be unable to pay its obligations with “cash\non hand” in a given day; (4) payment on Williams’s securities\nmust come due during such time; and (5) Williams must\ncontinue to hold those securities. Id. Furthermore, Congress\nmust fail to enact legislation suspending or increasing the debt\nlimit despite an impending breach of the statutory ceiling—\nsomething it has done on over seventy occasions since 1962.\nSee Austin, supra, at 8. “When considering any chain of\n\f                               10\nallegations for standing purposes, we may reject as overly\nspeculative those links which are predictions of future events\n(especially future actions to be taken by third parties) . . . .”\nArpaio, 797 F.3d at 21 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because Williams fails plausibly to allege that any\nfuture injuries are “certainly impending to constitute injury in\nfact,” he cannot rely on such injuries to establish Article III\nstanding. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"821306\"><a href=\"/opinion/821306/clapper-v-amnesty-international-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1147 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphasis in original).\n\n     Thus, in order to satisfy Article III’s standing\nrequirements, Williams must put forth plausible allegations of\ncurrent and ongoing injuries. An analysis of the Proposed\nAmended Complaint shows that Williams fails to meet this\nstandard. The crux of Williams’s argument is that the Debt\nLimit Statute degrades the risk profile of his public debt\nholdings and devalues those investments. To support this\nposition, Williams cites in his briefs, but not in the complaint,\na July 2015 report from the Government Accountability\nOffice (“GAO”) discussing the market effects of “debt limit\nimpasses.” See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, DEBT\nLIMIT: Market Response to Recent Impasses Underscores\nNeed To Consider Alternative Approaches (2015) [hereinafter\nGAO Report], http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/671286.pdf.\nThe GAO Report admittedly details numerous effects that the\n2011 and 2013 debt limit impasses had on U.S. financial\nmarkets. For example, investors avoided “at-risk” Treasury\nsecurities; interest rates on “at-risk” securities rose; the\nliquidity of “at-risk” securities declined; investors substituted\n“at-risk” Treasury securities for other investments; and\ninvestors refused to accept “at-risk” Treasury securities as\ncollateral. Id. at 12-28.\n\f                               11\n     The Court may take judicial notice of the GAO Report.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); see also Farah v. Esquire\nMagazine, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“And, [i]n\ndetermining whether a complaint states a claim, the court may\nconsider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents\nattached thereto or incorporated therein, and matters of which\nit may take judicial notice.” (alteration in original) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted)). However, the GAO\nReport does not make Williams’s alleged current injuries\nplausible. To the contrary, the report suggests that prior debt\nlimit impasses only affected “at-risk” Treasury securities, i.e.,\nholdings with payments due during the impasse. See, e.g.,\nGAO Report 13 (“Market participants said that investors were\nprimarily concerned with shorter-term Treasury bills that\nwere maturing during this time [late-October through mid-\nNovember 2013].”); U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO\nHighlights: Highlights of GAO-15-476, A Report to the\nCongress 1 (2015), http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/\n671287.pdf (“During the 2013 debt limit impasse, investors\nreported taking the unprecedented action of systematically\navoiding certain Treasury securities—those that matured\naround the dates when the [Treasury Department] projected it\nwould exhaust . . . extraordinary measures . . . .”). Williams’s\ncurrent investment holdings are not “at-risk.” As the Treasury\nDepartment states, the Debt Limit Statute is suspended until\nMarch 15, 2017. See Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Pub. L.\nNo. 114-74, § 901(a). Any effect that the Debt Limit\nStatute’s specter may have on Williams’s current public debt\nholdings is therefore speculative and made no less so by the\nallegations in the Proposed Amended Complaint. See Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 560 (injury-in-fact cannot be “conjectural” or\n“hypothetical”). Nor is it clear that Williams’s securities will\nbecome “at-risk” in the future. Because Congress has\nsuspended the Debt Limit Statute, Williams must rely on rote\n\f                              12\nconjecture that another debt limit impasse will occur once the\nsuspension ends. See id.\n\n     Furthermore, Williams’s alleged noneconomic injuries do\nnot provide a plausible basis for standing. For the reasons\nstated above, any current harm to Williams’s investments is\nspeculative, and he fails to allege future harms that are\ncertainly impending. The Court cannot exercise jurisdiction\nbased on “worr[ies] and concern[s]” that lack a reasoned\nbasis. Pr. Am. Compl. ¶ 2; see Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1151\n(“[R]espondents cannot manufacture standing merely by\ninflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of\nhypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”).\n\n               3. Williams Separately Lacks Standing To\n                  Pursue His Due Process Claims\n\n     Williams asserts a Fifth Amendment due process\nviolation based on the Treasury Department’s “arbitrary”\nenforcement of the Debt Limit Statute. Pr. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5,\n11, 21, 46. In particular, Williams alleges that the Treasury\nDepartment cannot prioritize payments to holders of public\ndebt in the event of default, id. ¶ 5, and it “has no rational\nmethod to protect Treasury bondholders, insure Certificate of\nIndebtedness liquidity, or honor promises to repay the TSP G\nFund in the certain event of default,” id. ¶ 46. This claim\nturns entirely on hypothetical future injury from the arbitrary\nprioritization of Treasury funds and therefore fails plausibly\nto allege a cognizable injury-in-fact. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560;\nsee also Williams v. Lew, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 133 n.4 (noting\nthat “no . . . plan or policy for prioritizing debt payments has\neven been formed” by the Treasury Department).\n\f                               13\n               4. The Court Need Not Reach the Treasury\n                  Department’s Remaining Arguments\n\n     The Treasury Department also argues that we should\ndismiss Williams’s claims as “generalized grievances” that\n“do not state an Article III case or controversy.” Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 574. We need not parse the line between a\n“generalized grievance” and a “concrete, though widely\nshared” injury-in-fact. FEC v. Akins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23-24\n(1998). Williams fails to allege plausible facts to establish the\n“irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,” Lujan, 504\nU.S. at 560, thereby obviating the generalized grievance issue.\nFor the same reason, we find it unnecessary to revisit our\nprior cases discussing the availability, or lack thereof, of\n“bondholder standing.” See Reuss v. Balles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359858\"><a href=\"/opinion/359858/henry-s-reuss-v-john-j-balles/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n469-70 n.29 (D.C.

WILLIAMS’S FACIAL CHALLENGE TO THE DEBT\n          LIMIT STATUTE DOES NOT PROVIDE AN\n          INDEPENDENT BASIS FOR STANDING\n\n     In the alternative, Williams cryptically alleges that his\nfacial challenge to the Debt Limit Statute is sufficient to\nconfer Article III standing. Williams’s argument is itself\nfacially suspect, and it is also unavailing under the Supreme\nCourt’s and our case law.\n\n    As the Supreme Court stated explicitly in Lujan, the three\nelements of standing—i.e., injury-in-fact, traceability, and\n\f                               14\nredressability—encompass “the irreducible constitutional\nminimum” under Article III. 504 U.S. at 560. Absent any\none of these requirements, federal courts lack jurisdiction to\nadjudicate a plaintiff’s claims. As the Court stated in Bond v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 225 (2011), “If . . . a litigant who\ncommences suit fails to show actual or imminent harm that is\nconcrete and particular, fairly traceable to the conduct\ncomplained of, and likely to be redressed by a favorable\ndecision, the Federal Judiciary cannot hear the claim.” By\ncontrast, “the threshold for facial challenges is a species of\nthird party (jus tertii) standing, which . . . [is] a prudential\ndoctrine and not one mandated by Article III of the\nConstitution.” City of Chicago v. Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118299\"><a href=\"/opinion/118299/chicago-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55\nn.22 (1999) (Stevens, J., joined by Souter and Ginsburg, JJ.);\nsee also LaRoque v.

Williams cites\nBrown v. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954), for the\nproposition that a facial violation of a constitutional interest\nconfers jurisdiction on the federal courts. But Williams\nmisreads that case. The plaintiffs in Brown each suffered an\ninjury-in-fact—“they [were] denied admission to schools\nattended by white children under laws requiring or permitting\nsegregation according to race.” Id. at 488. “This segregation\n\f                               15\nwas alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of\nthe laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id.\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court has expressly disavowed the\ntheory that Williams advances here; “an asserted right to have\nthe Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient,\nstanding alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.”\nAllen v.

Unless there is an\nactual Article III “Case[]” or “Controvers[y]” before us, we\nlack jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 559-60; Grocery Mfrs. Ass’n v.
