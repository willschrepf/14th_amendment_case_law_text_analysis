No. CPF-08-508038)\nFRANCISCO,\n         Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n         After preparing an environmental impact report, respondent City and County of\nSan Francisco (city) approved a project to rezone land along the Market Street corridor\nnear Octavia Boulevard and to redevelop 22 vacant parcels created by the removal of the\nelevated Central Freeway. The city amended its general plan to include a new Market\nand Octavia Area Plan and conformed its planning code and zoning maps. Plaintiffs\nCoalition for Adequate Review and Alliance for Comprehensive Planning filed a writ\npetition in the trial court challenging the city’s amended general plan and environmental\nreview of the project. The trial court denied relief and we affirm.\n                         I.        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n         Over 10 years ago, in December 2002, the city published Market and Octavia\nNeighborhood Plan—Draft for Public Review, an area plan proposing modified land use\ncontrols for an area loosely centered around the Market Street corridor near Octavia\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fBoulevard. On January 23, 2004, the city gave notice it would, in compliance with the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), prepare an environmental impact report\n(EIR) evaluating the impacts of the area plan and redevelopment of 22 vacant parcels\nwithin the plan area created by the removal of the elevated Central Freeway.\n       On June 25, 2005, the city released its draft EIR. The report states it “covers\nadoption of the [Area] Plan, amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and\nZoning Maps, amendment to the San Francisco General Plan, and adoption of urban\ndesign guidelines.” Aside from addressing redevelopment of the 22 Central Freeway\nparcels, the report does not review the impact of specific development projects that might\noccur within the area plan’s boundaries. Instead, “[i]ndividual projects that could occur\nin the future under the [area] Plan would undergo project level evaluation to determine if\nthey would result in further impacts specific to the development proposal, the site, and\nthe time of development and additional environmental review would be required.” The\nreport identified potentially significant and unavoidable impacts, including shadows from\npossible new construction and increased traffic delays at several intersections.\n       The city solicited public comments on the draft EIR between June 25, 2005 and\nAugust 23, 2005. On September 26, 2006, the city released a Comments and Responses\ndocument, which, together with the draft EIR made up the final EIR.\n       On April 5, 2007, the city planning commission certified the EIR, issued CEQA\nfindings and a statement of overriding considerations, and recommended the city adopt\nthe area plan and redevelopment project, despite their likely impacts, by enacting\nlegislation to amend the city’s general plan to include the area plan and amend the city’s\nplanning code and zoning map. Plaintiffs appealed the EIR certification to the Board of\nSupervisors, which denied the appeal on June 19, 2007, by a vote of eight to one, with\ntwo abstaining.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       On October 23, 2007, the Board of Supervisors approved the general plan\namendment by ordinance No. 246-07. Later, on April 15 and 22, 2008, the Board\napproved the planning code and zoning map amendments.\n       Meanwhile, on January 22, 2008, plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate in\nSan Francisco Superior Court. Their first amended petition, filed May 30, 2008—after\napproval of the planning code and zoning map amendments, is the operative pleading.\nPlaintiffs alleged the city’s general plan, after amendment by ordinance No. 246-07 to\nincorporate the Market and Octavia Area Plan, was unlawful because it lacked elements\nrequired by Government Code section 65302. They further alleged the Market and\nOctavia Area Plan created inconsistencies with the General Plan, in violation of\nGovernment Code section 65300.51 and San Francisco’s Planning Code sections 101 and\n101.1 (also known as Proposition M). Finally, they alleged the city’s EIR for the Market\nand Octavia Area Plan was inadequate under CEQA. Plaintiffs prayed for a court order\nexcising the Market and Octavia Area Plan from the general plan, voiding related\nchanges to city codes and ordinances, and requiring the city to prepare a new general plan\nand new EIR before making any attempts to implement aspects of the Market and\nOctavia Area Plan.\n       Although challenges to a general plan should proceed expeditiously, and with\npreference, to trial within 90 days, this case took over two years to reach trial. (See\n§§ 65752 [preference]; 65753, subd. (a) [speedy trial].) Plaintiffs filed their opening\nmemorandum in support of their petition on August 20, 2010. The city filed opposition\non October 21, 2010, and plaintiffs filed a reply on November 19, 2010. After a day-long\nhearing on December 8, 2010, the trial court issued a brief written ruling, on\nDecember 15, 2010, denying the petition and requiring the city to submit a proposed\n\n\n       1\n         All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n                                              3\n\forder. The city subsequently submitted a 34-page, memorandum-format proposed order.\nOver petitioner’s objections, the trial court signed the proposed order on January 7,\n2011—more than eight years after the city first published the draft area plan and about\nfour and a half years since the final EIR was completed. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal\non March 7, 2011.\n       While the events giving rise to this litigation were unfolding, another case made its\nway through the courts, a case that challenged the adequacy of the 2004 housing element\nof the city’s general plan—a replacement for the 1990 housing element. The city had\nfound the 2004 housing element would have no significant adverse environmental\nimpacts and so issued a negative declaration and approved the element without preparing\nan EIR. A court of this district, however, concluded “substantial evidence . . .\nsupport[ed] a fair argument that the amendments to the Housing Element may have a\nsignificant impact on the environment.” (San Franciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v.\nCity and County of San Francisco (Cal. Ct. App., June 22, 2007 (A112987) 2007 WL\n1793881) at p. *1.) The appellate court reversed and ordered the trial court “to issue a\nwrit of mandate directing the City to set aside its adoption of the negative declaration and\nto order the preparation of an EIR.” (Id. at p. *14.)\n       On April 6, 2009, following this reversal, the trial court issued a preemptive writ\nof mandate. It enjoined the city from implementing some aspects of the 2004 housing\nelement, but allowed it to operate under the element’s remaining provisions—many of\nwhich derived from the previous 1990 housing element—until the city complied with\nCEQA’s mandates. An April 29, 2009, letter from the state’s Department of Housing and\nCommunity Development assured the city its gutted 2004 housing element still complied,\nin the department’s opinion, with the state’s planning laws.2\n\n       2\n        “If the Department finds the housing element substantially complies with\nhousing element law, the housing element has a rebuttable presumption of validity.\n(§ 65589.3.)” (Haro v. City of Solana Beach (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 542, 550.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                                    II.     DISCUSSION\nA.     General Plan\n       “The Legislature has required every county and city to adopt ‘a comprehensive,\nlong-term general plan for the physical development of the county or city . . . .’\n(§ 65300.) A general plan provides a ‘ “charter for future development” ’ and sets forth a\ncity or county’s fundamental policy decisions about such development.” (Friends of\nLagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 815.)\n       “ ‘[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and\ndevelopment depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its\nelements.’ [Citation.] ‘Since consistency with the general plan is required, absence of a\nvalid general plan, or valid relevant elements or components thereof, precludes enactment\nof zoning ordinances and the like.’ [Citation.] ‘The general plan consists of a “statement\nof development policies . . . setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan\nproposals.” [Citation.] The plan must include seven elements—land use, circulation,\nconservation, housing, noise, safety and open space—and address each of these elements\nin whatever level of detail local conditions require [citation].’ ” (Fonseca v. City of\nGilroy (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)\n       “The adoption or amendment of a general plan is a legislative act. (Gov. Code,\n§ 65301.5.) A legislative act is presumed valid, and a city need not make explicit\nfindings to support its action. [Citations.] A court cannot inquire into the wisdom of a\nlegislative act or review the merits of a local government’s policy decisions. [Citation.]\nJudicial review of a legislative act under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is limited\nto determining whether the public agency’s action was arbitrary, capricious, entirely\nwithout evidentiary support, or procedurally unfair. [Citations.]” (Federation of Hillside\n& Canyon Assns. v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1195\n(Federation).) “[O]nly those portions of the general plan which are impacted or\ninfluenced by the adoption or amendment can properly be challenged in the action which\n\n                                              5\n\fis brought.” (Garat v. City of Riverside (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259, 289–290, overruled in\npart on another ground as stated in Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara (1994)\n7 Cal.4th 725, 743, fn. 11.)3\n       Plaintiffs challenge the city’s general plan as deficient because it lacks an adequate\nland use element, circulation element, and housing element.\n       1.     Land Use Element\n       Section 65302 requires a general plan to include a “land use element that\ndesignates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of\nthe land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural\nresources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and\ngrounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and\nprivate uses of land.” (§ 65302, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          In their petition for rehearing, plaintiffs clarified and emphasized one of their\narguments concerning the city’s general plan—that the plan’s land use element,\ncirculation element, and housing element were all inadequate before amendment.\nPlaintiffs, however, did not timely challenge, in this case, the adequacy of the pre-\namendment general plan. In response to California’s “crisis”-level housing shortage and\nto “provide certainty for property owners and local government” (§ 65009, subds. (a)(1),\n(a)(3)), the Legislature has required challenges to the adequacy (as opposed to the\nexistence) of general plan elements to be made within 90 days, (id., subds. (c)(1)(A)). A\nplaintiff cannot use the occurrence of a general plan amendment to challenge the\nadequacy of any long-standing portions of that plan. Such challenges are time barred.\n(Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001)\n91 Cal.App.4th 342, 387–389; Garat v. City of Riverside, supra, 2 Cal.App.4th at p. 290\n[“This requirement of some sort of nexus of relevancy between the direct object of the\nchallenge (e.g., an amendment to a general plan) and the overall reach of the challenge\n(e.g., those portions of the general plan being amended or impacted by the amendment) is\nhardly startling and has been recognized in other contexts by other courts.”].) A contrary\nrule would chaotically upend the very certainty and confidence the statute explicitly seeks\nto promote. We may still, however, address plaintiffs’ contentions that certain general\nplan elements were entirely absent, or that the 2007 general plan amendments were\ninadequate.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       Plaintiffs contend the city’s general plan, after amendment with the Market and\nOctavia area plan, has no land use element at all. While the general plan does lack a\nsingle land use element, it contains a “Land Use Index” which refers the reader to other\nparts of the plan containing information that, if located in one place, would make up the\nland use element. The Market and Octavia Area Plan, as well as other area plans, also\ncontains land use information. Such a distributed approach to the land use element is\nacceptable. A “general plan may be adopted in any format deemed appropriate or\nconvenient by the legislative body, including the combining of elements.” (§ 65301,\nsubd. (a).) In addition, a “general plan may be adopted as a single document or as a\ngroup of documents relating to subjects or geographic segments of the planning area.”4\n(§ 65301, subd. (b).)\n       Plaintiffs next contend the land use element, as amended, fails to “include a\nstatement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for\nthe various districts and other territory covered by the plan.” (§ 65302, subd. (a).)\n       Yet the Land Use Index has a section labeled “Population Density and Building\nIntensity Standards.” The section points to density and intensity standards in the\ncommerce and industry and housing elements, and the various area plans. It also has a\nseries of maps. They depict citywide guidelines for building height and building bulk,\nand depict a citywide commercial and industrial density plan, which expresses densities\nin terms of a FAR (Floor Area Ratio), the ratio between gross floor area to lot area.\n       In addition, the Market and Octavia Area Plan states there should be no limit on\npopulation density within that already-established urban area, because the goal is to\nmaximize housing and limits would “unnecessarily constrain the housing potential.” The\n\n\n       4\n          Plaintiffs’ rehearing petition suggests, for the first time, that the Land Use Index\nmay not be part of the city’s general plan. They present no evidence of this.\nFurthermore, plaintiffs made no such argument in their appellate briefing, even though\nthe city relied heavily on its Land Use Index in its respondent’s brief.\n\n\n                                              7\n\fplan states it would be preferable to regulate building height, bulk, and other design\ncharacteristics to promote building design goals, not density per se.\n       To that end, the area plan divides the Market and Octavia neighborhood into use\ndistricts. A map, labeled map 1, shows the districts’ locations and a table, labeled figure\n3, establishes permitted uses for each district. For example, the Van Ness and Market\nDowntown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD), occupying the area by the\nintersection of those two streets, “will still have the area’s most intensive commercial\nuses, including offices, but balances those with a new residential presence.” Mixed\noffice, retail, and housing are allowed in an 85- or 120-foot building base, with\nresidential towers permitted above the base at heights ranging from 160 to 400 feet.\nAlthough there would be, explicitly, no limit on residential density, there is a minimum\n2:1 residential to non-residential use ratio. Certain retail, office, and cultural uses are\npermitted up to the fourth floor. No minimum residential or non-residential parking is\nrequired, but residential off-street parking is allowed at .25 spaces per unit (up to .75\nspaces per unit and 1 space per two-bedroom unit by conditional use permit) and non-\nresidential parking is allowed at approximately 1 space per 4,500 gross square feet.\n       On the other end of the spectrum is the Residential Transit Oriented (RTO)\ndistrict, which comprises less-dense pockets of the planned area. The RTO district “will\nencourage moderate-density, multi-family, residential infill, in scale with existing\ndevelopment” near robust transit infrastructure, with allowance for limited small-scale\nretail. Non-retail offices are not allowed, but retail on corner lots, up to 1,200 square\nfeet, is. Residential density is limited at one unit per 600 square feet lot area, with\nconditional use permits available for a higher density. Forty percent of units must be\ntwo-bedroom units unless an exception is made. There may be a maximum of .75 off-\nstreet parking spaces per residential unit; up to one space with a conditional use permit.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       Other area plan districts, falling between these two, are fleshed out similarly in the\nplan document.5\n       Plaintiffs cite no authority suggesting the foregoing do not constitute a sufficient\n“statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for\nthe various districts and other territory covered by the plan.” (§ 65302, subd. (a).)\n       While one “reasonable interpretation of the term ‘population density’ as used in\nGovernment Code section 65302 is one which refers to numbers of people in a given\narea” (Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. v. County of Tuolumne (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d\n664, 699 (Twain)), the area plan undoubtedly offers “standards of population density,”\neven if the standard is unlimited density (within other constraints). Unlimited density is\nno less a standard than limited density, and it is a choice the city reached quite\ndeliberately. Its policy 2.2.1 on page 15 of the area plan calls for elimination of density\nmaximums, which “unnecessarily constrain the housing potential . . . in relatively dense,\nestablished urban neighborhoods like the Market and Octavia area.” Plaintiffs may\ndebate the policy of having unlimited density constrained by other limits on development,\nbut our task is not to evaluate the wisdom of the general plan, only its compliance with\nthe law. (Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1195 [we do not “inquire into the\nwisdom of a legislative act or review the merits of a local government’s policy\ndecisions”].)\n       As to standards for building intensity, the area plan document gives standards for\nbuilding heights and permitted uses for each zoning district in the area, precisely the sorts\nof standards called for in Twain, supra, 138 Cal.App.3d 664, 699 [standards might\n\n\n       5\n         The general plan also contains a table, labeled I-27, that correlates certain extant\nzoning districts with average units and persons per acre. The parties dispute whether this\ntable meets the obligations of general plan, rather than zoning guidelines, to specify\npopulation density standards for the Market and Octavia area. We need not resolve this\ndispute in light of the conclusions we reach below.\n\n\n                                              9\n\finclude “restrictions such as height or size limitations, restrictions on types of buildings\nor uses to be permitted within a designated area”].)\n       2.     Circulation Element\n       A general plan must also contain a “circulation element consisting of the general\nlocation and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,\nterminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all\ncorrelated with the land use element of the plan.” (§ 65302, subd. (b)(1).) Correlation\nmeans “the circulation element of a general plan must provide meaningful proposals to\naddress changes reflected in the land use element, and the land use element must provide\nmeaningful proposals to reflect changes reflected in the circulation element.”\n(Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1196.)\n       Plaintiffs believe correlation is lacking because the Market and Octavia land use\nplan calls for increased density while the circulation plan calls for relatively fewer\nparking spaces (compared to other parts of the city) and a balanced use of city roadways.\nThe area plan, however, addresses this supposed conundrum. It recognizes “[a] common\nfear is that reducing the capacity available for cars will result in major increases in\ncongestion.” Yet notes “[m]uch research rejects this logic and shows that people’s\ntransportation choices are dynamic and respond to capacity, relative cost, time,\nconvenience, and other factors” and “[c]rucially . . . movement of people is more than\njust movement of cars.”\n       Plaintiffs may dislike this correlation, but there is undoubtedly correlation. Only\ntime will tell if the city’s “if we build it” approach to parking and transportation choices\nwill benefit the Market and Octavia area. Meanwhile, the conclusion reached in\nFederation is apt here: “Contrary to [Plaintiffs’] argument, the internal consistency and\ncorrelation requirements do not require a city or county to limit population growth or\nprovide traffic management measures to ensure that its transportation infrastructure can\naccommodate future population growth. The Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code,\n\n                                               10\n\f§ 65000 et seq.) does not require a city or county to avoid adverse impacts on\ntransportation. Rather, the city has broad discretion to weigh and balance competing\ninterests in formulating development policies, and a court cannot review the wisdom of\nthose decisions under the guise of reviewing a general plan’s internal consistency and\ncorrelation.” (Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1196.) Accordingly, we shall not\ndisturb the circulation element.6\n       3.     Housing Element\n       Plaintiffs claim, because of the June 2007 decision of this court in San\nFranciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v. City and County of San Francisco, supra,\n2007 WL 1793881, the city lacked a valid housing element at the time it amended its\ngeneral plan in October 2007 to include the Market and Octavia Area Plan. Plaintiffs\nalso contend the trial court’s eventual writ in that case, issued April 6, 2009, specifically\nenjoined the city from enforcing, relying upon, or approving any “ ‘no residential parking\nrequirement’ ” or “ ‘no density requirement[] for residential projects’ ” until those\npolicies received environmental review.\n       The 2007 Court of Appeal decision did not invalidate the city’s then-existing\nhousing element. That decision merely commanded the trial court to issue a writ “to\norder the preparation of an EIR” for the 2004 revisions to the previously-approved, and\nEIR-vetted, 1990 residency element. (San Franciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v.\nCity and County of San Francisco, supra, 2007 WL 1793881, at pp. *1, *14.) When the\ntrial court eventually issued a writ in 2009, it explicitly allowed the city to rely on the\n1990 residency element and certain valid portions of the 2004 housing element until the\ncity could conduct environmental review for, and approve, a new housing element.

City of Los\nAngeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1266.)\n       In fact, as of August 2007, the city, aware of the Court of Appeal decision,\naugmented its consistency findings for the Market and Octavia area plan such that it not\nonly found the area plan consistent with the 2004 housing element, but also the 1990\nresidence element. Thus, when the city amended the general plan in October 2007, it\noperated with a housing element in place.\n       Even if the 2009 writ forbade the city from adopting certain parking and density\npolicies in its housing element absent further environmental review, it did not,\nretroactively, forbid the city from adopting, in October 2007, an area plan with similar\nhousing policies for one area of the city, Market and Octavia, following the exact sort of\nextensive CEQA-compliant environmental review (discussed below) the writ demanded.\nPlaintiffs do not offer a cogent argument for why the city could not make this incremental\nchange to its housing element if it proceeded according to CEQA’s dictates.\n       Further, it appears the city has since completed review of and approved the 2004\nhousing element, and a subsequent 2009 housing element.7 Thus any arguable\nconsistency issues between the area plan and the 1990 residence element have been\n\n\n       7\n          We previously denied the city’s request for judicial notice of the ordinance\nadopting the revised housing element. The city had grouped it amongst a number of\nother documents outside the administrative record and post-dating the city’s approval of\nthe Market and Octavia area plan. We now take judicial notice pursuant to our own\nmotion. (Curcini v. County of Alameda (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 629, 647, fn. 13 [taking\njudicial notice of ordinance on court’s own motion].) Given the document pertains to\nmootness, not the propriety of agency action, it is relevant and taking judicial notice for\nthe purpose of providing an alternate basis for our ruling does not run afoul of Western\nStates Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 574, footnote 4. We need\nnot and do not draw any conclusion about the adequacy of the city’s operative housing\nelement, we have only noted plaintiffs cannot assert inconsistencies with a now-\nsupplanted 1990 residence element.\n\n\n                                            12\n\feliminated and, to this extent and in this case, the housing element issue is moot. (Davis\nv. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 1054, 1061 [if objections to a housing element\n“have been remedied, the issues will then be moot”]; Youngblood v. Board of Supervisors\n(1978) 22 Cal.3d 644, 648 [“While the appeal was pending before this court, the board of\nsupervisors amended the zoning for Rancho Del Dios to conform to the general plan, thus\nmooting the principal issue of this appeal.”].)\nB.     CEQA\n       “CEQA requires that an EIR include detailed information concerning, among\nother things, the significant environmental effects of the project under consideration.\n(Pub.

(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 826,\n836 . . . .) In CEQA cases, as in other mandamus cases, ‘we independently review the\nadministrative record under the same standard of review that governs the trial court.’\n(Federation of Hillside & Canyon Associations v.

We review\nan agency’s determinations and decisions for abuse of discretion. An agency abuses its\ndiscretion when it fails to proceed in a manner required by law or there is not substantial\nevidence to support its determination or decision. ([Pub. Resources Code,] §§ 21168,\n21168.5; Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp. 426–427.) ‘Judicial review of these two\ntypes of error differs significantly: While we determine de novo whether the agency has\n\n                                             13\n\femployed the correct procedures, “scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated\nCEQA requirements” [citation], we accord greater deference to the agency’s substantive\nfactual conclusions.’ (Vineyard, at p. 435.)” (Preserve Wild Santee v. City of Santee\n(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 275 (Santee).)\n       “Consequently, in reviewing an EIR for CEQA compliance, we adjust our\n‘scrutiny to the nature of the alleged defect, depending on whether the claim is\npredominantly one of improper procedure or a dispute over the facts.’ (Vineyard, supra,\n40 Cal.4th at p. 435.) For example, where a petitioner claims an agency failed to include\nrequired information in its environmental analysis, our task is to determine whether the\nagency failed to proceed in the manner prescribed by CEQA. Conversely, where a\npetitioner challenges an agency’s conclusion that a project’s adverse environmental\neffects are adequately mitigated, we review the agency’s conclusion for substantial\nevidence.

Regents of University of\nCalifornia (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, [392–]393 . . . .) Rather, we must resolve any\nreasonable doubts and any conflicts in the evidence in favor of the agency’s findings and\ndecision. (Laurel Heights, at p. 393; Citizens for Responsible Equitable Environmental\nDevelopment v. City of San Diego (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 515, 522–523.)” (Santee,\nsupra, 210 Cal.App.4th at p. 276.)\n       Further, “ ‘[i]n determining the adequacy of an EIR, the CEQA Guidelines look to\nwhether the report provides decision makers with sufficient analysis to intelligently\nconsider the environmental consequences of a project. ([Guidelines,] § 15151.) The\nCEQA Guidelines further provide that “the sufficiency of an EIR is to be reviewed in the\nlight of what is reasonably feasible . . . . The courts have [therefore] looked not for\nperfection but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full disclosure.”\n([Guidelines] § 15151.)’ [Citation.] The overriding issue on review is thus ‘whether the\n[lead agency] reasonably and in good faith discussed [a project] in detail sufficient [to\nenable] the public to discern from the [EIR] the “analytic route the . . . agency traveled\nfrom evidence to action.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (California Oak Foundation v.\nRegents of University of California (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 227, 262.)\n       Plaintiffs assert numerous defects in the city’s CEQA review.\n       1.     Project Description\n       “An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an\ninformative and legally sufficient EIR.” (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977)\n71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.)\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f              Boundaries\n       Plaintiffs first assail the EIR’s project description for not reflecting shifts in the\nproject’s boundaries over time, such that the project description ultimately failed to\ndisclose the project’s “precise location . . . on a detailed map.” (Guidelines, § 15124,\nsubd. (a) [setting forth requirements for an EIR’s project description].)\n       In reality, section 3.3 of the draft EIR defines the project location by providing the\nnames of bordering streets, the numbers of 89 included Assessor’s Blocks, and a map. In\nthe September 2006 response to comments, the city reduced the project area by about 12\nblocks—stating those blocks would be covered by other area plans—and provided a new\nmap showing the change. The city concluded this small reduction in project size “would\nhave either comparable or less impacts relative to the Plan analyzed in the DEIR.”\n       The project description should be stable and “ ‘[t]he defined project and not some\ndifferent project must be the EIR’s bona fide subject.’ ” (Western Placer Citizens for an\nAgriculture & Rural Environment v. County of Placer (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 890, 898.)\nNonetheless, “ ‘[t]he CEQA reporting process is not designed to freeze the ultimate\nproposal in the precise mold of the initial project; indeed, new and unforeseen insights\nmay emerge during investigation, evoking revision of the original proposal.’ (County of\nInyo v. City of Los Angeles[, supra,] 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199–200 . . . .” (Ibid.) Put\nanother way, “CEQA does not handcuff decisionmakers . . . .)” (Dusek v. Redevelopment\nAgency (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1041.) “The action approved need not be a blanket\napproval of the entire project initially described in the EIR. If that were the case, the\ninformational value of the document would be sacrificed. Decisionmakers should have\nthe flexibility to implement that portion of a project which satisfies their environmental\nconcerns.” (Ibid.) Thus, in Dusek, when a project description (redevelopment of a\nparcel) was broader than, but inclusive of, the project approved (demolition of a structure\non the parcel), the public was fully informed and had an opportunity to voice opposition.\n(Id. at pp. 1035, 1041.)\n\n                                              16\n\f       The city’s choice, here, to reduce the size of the plan area makes this case like\nDusek.9 The city’s EIR addressed a plan broader, and with greater impacts, than the plan\napproved. Plaintiffs dispute this, stating the city’s plan would still increase housing and\nresidency, but now distribute that growth more intensely over a smaller area. Not so.\nWhile the plan states fixed population growth targets, these targets are mere aspirations,\nnot mandatory. The plan quite plainly seeks population growth through zoning change.\nThus, the city’s rezoning of fewer parcels would in fact reduce the plan’s impacts.10\n              Description of VNSUD\n       Plaintiffs further claim the EIR omits a description of the VNMDR-SUD (standing\nfor Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District), and that this\ndistrict was only added to plans after EIR certification.\n       Though the draft EIR did not use the VNMDR-SUD acronym, it does describe the\nproject as creating a “Downtown Residential” (DTR) district “around the Market Street\nand Van Ness Avenue intersection.” This district “would permit . . . moderate- and large-\nsized commercial activities” up to the fourth floor. “[A]utomobile-oriented uses would\nnot be allowed.” Height limits—from 160 feet up to 400-foot towers would be\nallowed—and bulk limits would determine housing density. Thus, the EIR foreshadowed\nand accounted for the “huge towers already in the Planning process” plaintiffs oppose.\nThe draft EIR also provides a table, labeled 3-1, of characteristics of the DTR district and\n\n\n       9\n          Plaintiffs argue Dusek is inapposite, because it concerned a project-level\nsupplemental EIR, not a “defective EIR.” This argument, which plaintiffs flesh out no\nfurther, lacks discernable logic.\n       10\n           Other, later “changes” to the Market and Octavia area plan are inconsequential\nand have no bearing on CEQA compliance. There appears to have been a clerical error,\nby which the city approved a version of the plan with even fewer zoning changes than\ncalled for in the final EIR, and then later fixed this error in a later ordinance. There is no\ndispute the EIR addressed the full range of potential zoning changes and that the city\neventually implemented all of them, excluding the 12 blocks mentioned above. Plaintiffs\nhave not shown how there was any cognizable defect under CEQA.\n\n\n                                             17\n\fother proposed districts—a table that mirrors the table in the draft Market and Octavia\nArea Plan, labeled figure 3 and discussed above. It restates, for the DTR district, the\ncommercial activity and height restrictions, and states there will be no minimum parking\nrequired, but that there could be up to 1 commercial spot per 4,500 square feet and from\n.25 spaces (up to .5 spaces with conditional use permit) per residential unit. The draft\nEIR discusses impacts related to the DTR’s creation in section 4.2.2.\n       Comparing the draft EIR’s DTR district to the VNMDR-SUD found in the\napproved Area Plan, there is almost no difference. It appears city planners changed the\nname of district that would cover the Van Ness and Market intersection, but little else.\nThere are some differences. For example, the VNMDR-SUD allows somewhat more\nresidential parking (.75 spaces by conditional use permit rather than .5). But these\nchanges are noted and addressed in the response to comments. As for the additional\nparking that would be allowed under the revised project, the city’s response states the\nEIR evaluated a range of allowed parking—from zero to one space per unit—and\ntherefore no further analysis of the change was needed.\n       The public was on notice about the DTR and the VNMDR-SUD, and plaintiffs\ncannot complain about, in essence, a name change and minor tweaks arising from the\npublic comment process.\n       2.     EIR Tiering\n       Plaintiffs next raise a concern about the EIR’s limited scope—that is, the city’s\nchoice to segregate and postpone review of various endeavors, which plaintiffs argue\nshould have been reviewed in the EIR under consideration.\n       The city’s EIR delineated three types of proposed endeavors and handled each\ntype differently. It analyzed the Market and Octavia Area Plan’s proposed land use\nchanges at a “Program Level,” without addressing specific possible future developments\nthat might come to be on rezoned parcels. It analyzed near-term projects referenced in\nthe Area Plan—redevelopment of the 22 Central Freeway parcels and conversion of\n\n                                            18\n\fHayes and Fell to two-way streets—at a “project level.” The EIR also mentioned long-\nterm transportation initiatives mentioned in the Area Plan, but did not analyze these\nbecause, as it concluded, the city was not seeking approval for these initiatives, which\nwould be subject to additional environmental review when proposed.\n       Plaintiffs fault the EIR for treating land use changes at a “program level” and for\nnot addressing the long-term transportation initiatives.\n       A program-level EIR “is an EIR which may be prepared on a series of actions that\ncan be characterized as one large project and are related” by geography, by being “logical\nparts” in a chain of contemplated action, by “issuance of rules, regulations, plans, or other\ngeneral criteria to govern the conduct of a continuing program,” or by being “under the\nsame authorizing statutory or regulatory authority and having generally similar\nenvironmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways.” (Guidelines, § 15168,\nsubd. (a).)\n       Program EIRs play a key role in “tiered” CEQA analysis. (Guidelines, § 15152,\nsubd. (h).) “ ‘Tiering’ refers to using the analysis of general matters contained in a\nbroader EIR (such as one prepared for a general plan or policy statement) with later EIRs\nand negative declarations on narrower projects; incorporating by reference the general\ndiscussions from the broader EIR; and concentrating the later EIR or negative declaration\nsolely on the issues specific to the later project.” (Guidelines, § 15152, subd. (a).) The\nLegislature has declared “environmental impact reports shall be tiered whenever\nfeasible.” (Pub. Resources Code, § 21093, subd. (b); Al Larson Boat Shop, Inc. v. Board\nof Harbor Commissioners (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 729, 740.) Tiering “will promote\nconstruction of needed housing and other development projects by (1) streamlining\nregulatory procedures, (2) avoiding repetitive discussions of the same issues in successive\nenvironmental impact reports, and (3) ensuring that environmental impact reports\nprepared for later projects which are consistent with a previously approved policy, plan,\nprogram, or ordinance concentrate upon environmental effects which may be mitigated or\n\n                                             19\n\favoided in connection with the decision on each later project.” (Pub. Resources Code,\n§ 21093, subd. (a).)\n       The CEQA Guidelines specifically endorse tiering “in connection with an EIR for\na large-scale planning approval, such as a general plan or component thereof (e.g., an\narea plan or community plan),” noting in these cases, “development of detailed, site-\nspecific information may not be feasible but can be deferred, in many instances, until\nsuch time as the lead agency prepares a future environmental document in connection\nwith a project of a more limited geographical scale.” (Guidelines, § 15152, subd. (c); see\nIn re Bay-Delta etc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1174–1175 (In re Bay-Delta) [“Under\nCEQA’s tiering principles, it is proper for a lead agency to use its discretion to focus a\nfirst-tier EIR on only the general plan or program, leaving project-level details to\nsubsequent EIR’s . . . .”]; id. at p. 1176 [“an EIR on a construction project will\nnecessarily be more specific than an EIR on the adoption or amendment of a\ncomprehensive zoning ordinance or a local general plan”].)\n       The city’s programmatic treatment of land use changes, deferring analysis of\nspecific development projects, was entirely consistent with CEQA. (In re Bay-Delta,\nsupra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1176; Gilroy Citizens for Responsible Planning v. City of\nGilroy (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 911, 929 [approving a site-specific EIR tiered atop a\nbroader area EIR]; Al Larson Boat Shop, Inc. v. Board of Harbor Commissioners, supra,\n18 Cal.App.4th at p. 743 [first-tier EIR adequate when it analyzes goal of increased port\ncapacity while deferring full analysis of anticipated projects, discussing them only “for\nthe purposes of giving a reasonably detailed consideration to the overall five-year plan”];\nRio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 374\n[“Thus, an EIR on the adoption of a general plan, such as is under scrutiny here, must\nfocus on secondary effects of adoption, but need not be as precise as an EIR on the\nspecific projects which might follow.”]; City of Antioch v. City Council (1986)\n187 Cal.App.3d 1325, 1337 [“We do not believe that the EIR required in this case must\n\n                                             20\n\fdescribe in detail each and every conceivable development scenario. All it must analyze\nare the road and utility impacts in relation to the most probable development patterns.”],\nitalics added.)\n       The cases plaintiffs cite are unhelpful to them. Stanislaus Natural Heritage\nProject v. County of Stanislaus (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 182 (Stanislaus), makes the same\ndistinction between zoning and development projects as the cases just cited. In criticizing\nan EIR for a 25-year, phased project for a golf resort community, the Court of Appeal\nwas concerned the report disclosed a water plan sufficient to cover only the first five\nyears of the project, and deferred consideration of impacts related to future water needs\nuntil the project was well underway—and in need of water. (Id. at pp. 188, 195.) This\nwas not a case where the county “simply adopt[ed] or amend[ed] a general plan so as to\npermit the building of homes and golf courses. The County adopted a specific plan\ncalling for the construction of those facilities and of other particularly described facets of\nthe Diablo Grande Specific Plan.” (Id. at p. 203, italics added; see also Vineyard, supra,\n40 Cal.4th at p. 431 [agreeing with result in Stanislaus].)\n       Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d 376, is also distinguishable. That case involved\nUCSF acquiring a building which it planned to eventually use all of, but which it would\nuse only a portion of until current tenants’ leases expired. UCSF could not avoid an EIR\nthat addressed use of the whole building, since UCSF conceded it would in fact make that\nfull use. (Id. at pp. 388, 393, 397.) The project in Laurel Heights did not implicate the\nplanning and implementation dichotomy we have here (id. at p. 396 [“This is not the type\nof situation where it is unclear as to whether a parcel of land will be developed or as to\nwhether activity will commence.”]), but concerned, like Stanislaus, inevitable future\n“phases” of projects to be carried out by the same proponents of the initial projects.\n       Thus, no authority required the city to analyze, in connection with an area plan\nEIR, the specific development projects that might or might not occur on every parcel\nwithin the area, including private development projects by untold numbers of third-party\n\n                                              21\n\fdevelopers. Analysis of such development may be left to the future and may piggbyback\non the programmatic area plan EIR.\n       Following from this, the city also did not need to study “in-the-pipeline” projects\n(already subject to their own CEQA and EIR process) located within the confines of, and\nconsistent with, the area plan, such as the planned development of 500 residential units at\na former UC Berkeley site at 55 Laguna (the LHBHSUD district) or the construction of a\ngrocery store at 555 Fulton (the Fulton SUD). The city in fact conducted environmental\nreview of the 55 Laguna redevelopment project, and in 2010 a Court of Appeal\nconcluded that review was adequate.11 (Save Laguna Street Campus v. City and County\nof San Francisco (Cal. Ct. App., May 25, 2010, A124531) 2010 WL 2059470.) Also, the\ncity adopted a mitigated negative declaration when approving the 555 Fulton project.\nThis case is not akin to San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County of\nSan Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61, 67, 73–74 and footnote 2, in which the city\nsimultaneously pursued four downtown high-rise projects and produced EIRs for each\nproject that unlawfully ignored the likely impacts of the other three. That case did not\ninvolve tiering development projects atop broader land use planning, which is what the\ncity has done here. In no sense has the city “ ‘precluded informed decisionmaking and\ninformed public participation.’ ” (City of Long Beach v. Los Angeles Unified School\nDist. (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 889, 898.)\n       Finally, the city was free to postpone analysis of future, hypothetical\ntransportation initiatives that were not planned for implementation. The city was free to\n\n\n       11\n           In any event, the EIR does discuss the cumulative impacts of the 55 Laguna\nproject with the Market and Octavia plan on, at a minimum, pages 4-61 to 4-62, and 4-\n207, and in the response to comments at page 3-139. A city pre-approval memorandum\nresponding to public comments further discusses cumulative impacts from the project.\nPlaintiffs have acknowledged the memorandum, yet take no issue with its conclusion that\nthe alleged harm to historic resources from development at 55 Laguna would not have a\nnegative impact cumulatively with the Market and Octavia Area Plan project.\n\n\n                                             22\n\fdecline implementation of these changes, and could decline study of them as they were\nnot inevitable outgrowths of adopting the Area Plan’s land use changes. (See Laurel\nHeights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 396; Stanislaus, 48 Cal.App.4th at p. 203.) That is, the\ncity could adopt the zoning changes and not have, in the language of Stanislaus, a half-\nbuilt resort on its hands.\n       3.     Baseline\n       “To decide whether a given project’s environmental effects are likely to be\nsignificant, the agency must use some measure of the environment’s state absent the\nproject, a measure sometimes referred to as the ‘baseline’ for environmental analysis.”\n(Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.\n(2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 315 (Communities).) “Section 15125, subdivision (a) of the\nCEQA Guidelines provides: ‘An EIR must include a description of the physical\nenvironmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice\nof preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time\nenvironmental analysis is commenced, from both a local and regional perspective. This\nenvironmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which\na lead agency determines whether an impact is significant.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 320,\nitalics omitted.)\n              Historic Resources Baseline\n       Plaintiffs criticize the EIR’s treatment of historic resources, claiming it omits a\ndiscussion of certain historic buildings and thereby impedes the public’s understanding of\nimpacts to them.\n       Section 4.6.3 of the EIR summarizes architectural resources within the Market and\nOctavia neighborhood. It draws on eight surveys from between 1968 and 2004, plus the\ncity planning department’s Parcel Information Database. It notes hundreds of structures\n“contribute” to historical districts, such as the Hayes Valley Historic District, or have\nunique architectural or historical features, such as Mission Dolores and a U.S. Mint\n\n                                             23\n\fbuilding. The EIR notes infill development promoted by the area plan could differ in\ndesign and scale from historical resources, thus altering the context in which those\nresources exist. On the other hand, a goal of the area plan is preservation of historic\nbuildings and the plan’s urban design guidelines “would ensure that new development\nenhances the area’s physical fabric.” “Individual projects proposed within the\n[neighborhood] would be subject to existing city land use controls including design\nreview during the permitting stage to ensure compatibility with adjacent historical\nresources [and] to avoid demolition of historic resources.” These controls and reviews\nwould, claims the EIR, prevent significant impacts at the program level, but “[s]ite\nspecific impacts would need to be evaluated for individual projects before they are\napproved.”\n       Thus, despite plaintiffs’ claim of EIR omissions, the EIR does mention “omitted”\nbuildings by name (such as the U.S. Mint) or acknowledge them by reference to a group\nto which they belong (the Tudor on Waller street is one of the 200 structures\n“contributing” to the Hayes Valley Historic District). Having laid out in broad strokes\nthe historical resources in the Market and Octavia area, the EIR alerts the public that the\narea contains historic structures and promises further environmental review should any\nactual development plans threaten those structures.\n       This level of detail is sufficient for the program-level EIR at issue. Separate,\nproject-level review of specific developments will inform the public of impending\nchanges to historic resource, and the impacts of those changes, including those impacts\nthat would be cumulative with other projects. To hold otherwise would defeat the tiering\nprocess authorized by the CEQA Guidelines. (See In re Bay-Delta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\npp. 1174–1176.) As each historic resource is unique, to insist on further review now, at\nthe program level, would not be cost-effective and could bind the city to a course of\naction that it later found to be infeasible.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f        Moreover, the promise of later, second-tier review is not an empty one, but rather\na promise courts accept, and will enforce, in the context of an appropriately tiered EIR.\n(See In re Bay-Delta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1176; Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 268, 282 [“A program EIR\ndoes not always suffice for a later project.”].)\n        Nonetheless, plaintiffs are particularly concerned that new 400-foot towers could,\nif approved according to the area plan, block views of City Hall, whose spire reaches\nonly 300 feet. First, as the EIR discusses, the area around City Hall already has three\nhigh-rise towers and a maximum permitted height of 320 feet, which minimizes the\nimpact of the feared changes to city views. (Cf. Citizens for East Shore Parks v. State\nLands Com. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 549, 560-561 [existing conditions are part of the\nbaseline].) Second, as already discussed, future project-level reviews of the actual\nbuildings that will populate the area plan will protect particular resources, such as City\nHall.\n               Traffic Baseline\n        2006 Octavia Study. First, plaintiffs fault the city for not including in the traffic\nbaseline the latest data about the new, six-lane Octavia Boulevard freeway access road,\neven though the road opened in September 2005, after the public comment period but\nbefore the area plan’s EIR was finalized. They cite a March 2, 2006 city study, not cited\nin the EIR, showing use of Octavia was then already close to capacity and resulting in\ncongestion on nearby feeder streets.\n        But the city’s draft EIR had accounted for increased use of Octavia as a freeway\nfeeder, noting “a wide variation in terms of percent contribution at several of the study\nintersections . . . as future traffic volumes would be affected by implementation of the\nCentral Freeway Project.” While “future traffic volume” at some intersections “would be\nreduced due to the reassignment of vehicles . . . [to] new on- and off-ramps,” the city\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fmore than doubled the estimated use of the Market/Octavia/McCoppin intersection, the\nnew ramp location, even without the plan.\n       Then, when plaintiffs complained in late 2005 during the comment process about\nthe lack of an evaluation of current Octavia Boulevard conditions, the city responded\nwith information and action. In its September 2006 response, it told plaintiffs that the\nOctavia/Market freeway “touchdown” had been approved after environmental review in\n2000. The city also collected new traffic data in “November 2005 to determine actual\nshifts in traffic patterns related to” the freeway access changes, data it included with its\ncomment responses. The city also took stock data collected in October and December\n2005, and concluded “the volume estimates [from the draft EIR] are consistent with\nactual traffic volumes after the ramps and boulevard were opened.”\n       The city can only analyze the environmental baseline existing at the time of its\nreview. (Communities, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 321.) The city here used the data\navailable to it and supplemented its analysis after collecting new data in response to\ncomments. Plaintiffs have faulted the city for not incorporating still more-recent data on\ntraffic, available only months after the public comment period had closed, and making\nyet another review of traffic impacts. At some point, however, review must end.\n“ ‘ “ ‘CEQA requires an EIR to reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure; it does not\nmandate perfection, nor does it require an analysis to be exhaustive.’ ” ’ ” (City of\nMaywood v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 385–386.)\nThe city’s efforts here were adequate.\n       Year 2025 “baseline”. Plaintiffs next claim the EIR improperly uses hypothetical\nconditions in the year 2025 as a baseline for measuring traffic impacts. The EIR does\nindeed compare expected traffic impacts with and without the plan in the year 2025. It\nalso, however, contains information about actual, observed traffic conditions in the plan\narea, including data from 32 intersections collected by Wilbur Smith & Associates in\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f2004 and the supplemental data collected in late 2005 already discussed.12 In fact,\nAppendix C to the draft EIR has a chart that compares current intersection traffic with\nprojected traffic in 2025, both with and without the plan, giving a grade between A and F\nto each intersection in each scenario, with E and F representing unsatisfactory conditions.\nSuch information provides a sufficient traffic baseline, and plaintiffs have not met their\nburden to show otherwise. (Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council (2011)\n200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1572 (Pfeiffer).)\n       “This court’s decision in Sunnyvale West Neighborhood Assn. v. City of Sunnyvale\nCity Council (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1351 . . . (Sunnyvale West), on which [plaintiffs]\nrely, does not compel a different conclusion. The decision in Sunnyvale West involved a\nCEQA challenge to the city council’s approval of the proposed Mary Avenue extension\nproject. (Sunnyvale West, at p. 1358.) The trial court granted a peremptory writ of\nmandate setting aside the approval on the ground that the baseline used to measure traffic\nimpacts was ‘projected traffic conditions in the year 2020,’ and the final EIR did not\nconsider ‘the project’s traffic and related impacts on the existing environment.’ (Ibid.)\nThis court affirmed, finding that the city had erred in when it ‘chose the projected\nconditions in the year 2020, more than a decade after approval, as the “baseline” against\nwhich to assess the traffic and related impacts of the proposed project.’ (Id. at p. 1379\n. . . .) ‘Although “[n]either CEQA nor the CEQA Guidelines mandates a uniform,\ninflexible rule for determination of the existing conditions baseline” (Communities For A\nBetter Environment, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 328, italics added) nothing in the law\nauthorizes environmental impacts to be evaluated only against predicted conditions more\nthan a decade after EIR certification and project approval.’ (Id. at p. 1380.)” (Pfeiffer,\nsupra, 200 Cal.App.4th at p. 1573.)\n\n\n       12\n         Plaintiffs’ reply brief claims the record has “no actual traffic counts.” Plaintiffs\nsimply ignore the 2004 counts the city has cited.\n\n\n                                             27\n\f       “Sunnyvale West is therefore distinguishable from the present case, where the\ntraffic baselines included in the EIR were not limited to projected traffic condition . . . but\nalso included existing conditions . . . .” (Pfeiffer, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at p. 1573.)\n“Moreover, this court acknowledged in Sunnyvale West that future conditions may be\nconsidered in determining a proposed project’s impacts on the environment. . . . ‘[S]uch\ndiscussions may be necessary to an intelligent understanding of a project's impacts over\ntime and full compliance with CEQA.’ (Sunnyvale West, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1381.)” (Ibid.) In fact, “CEQA Guidelines expressly provide for consideration of\npotential future conditions. ‘Although “[i]n assessing the impact of a proposed project on\nthe environment, the lead agency should normally limit its examination to changes in the\nexisting physical condition in the affected area . . . ,” the EIR must still clearly identify\nand describe the “[d]irect and indirect significant effects of the project on the\nenvironment” and give “due consideration to both the short-term and long-term effects.”\n(CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) Further, “[w]here a proposed project is\ncompared with an adopted plan, the [EIR’s] analysis shall examine the existing physical\nconditions at the time the notice of preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation\nis published, at the time the environmental analysis is commenced as well as the potential\nfuture conditions discussed in the plan.” (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (e), italics\nadded.)’ [Citation.]” (Pfeiffer, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1573–1574.)\n       Baseline “corrupting”. Plaintiffs claim the EIR compounds its “baseline error” by\nusing its improper baseline as a starting point for the cumulative impacts analysis. As\njust discussed, however, the EIR properly sets forth a traffic baseline reflecting current\nconditions. Moreover, as shown in the Appendix C chart, the EIR calculated impacts by\nstarting with existing conditions and then forecasting traffic in 2025 both with and\nwithout the plan. Those intersections within the plan expected to receive unsatisfactory\ntraffic grades in 2025 because of “direct impacts” or “cumulative impacts” of the plan,\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\fwere highlighted and singled out for further analysis.13 At pages 4-220 to 4-221, the EIR\nprovides two numbers for each at-risk intersection: the percent of estimated total traffic\nin 2025 generated by the plan (contribution to total); and the percent of estimated traffic\ngrowth, from current conditions to those expected in 2025, generated by the plan\n(contribution to growth). The “contribution to growth” figure explicitly measures the\nplan’s impact against existing conditions. Thus, the EIR was able to identify\nintersections that would be negatively impacted by the plan most directly and those\nimpacted by a combination of the plan and other forces. It concluded the plan would\nhave a significant impact on seven intersections, but not on the five remaining\nintersections, based on “examination of the traffic volumes for the traffic movements\nwhich determine overall . . . performance at the[] intersections.” The five intersections\nwith insignificant cumulative impacts had the same performance grade in 2025\nprojections, with or without the plan.\n              Parking Baseline\n       Despite plaintiffs’ contrary assertion, the EIR adequately describes the existing\nstate of both on-street and off-street parking within the project area at pages 4-197 to 4-\n200. For instance, the EIR found on-street parking on weekdays at midday to be near\ncapacity. It also found, referencing a 2002 report parking study, on-street and many off-\nstreet parking options were full during performances at Civic Center14 venues. The EIR\ngoes on to measure parking shortfalls against current conditions, estimating the project\ncould create parking demand as high a 4,510 spaces during the weekday midday period\nand 5,640 spaces during the weekday evening period. (Taking into account, however,\n\n       13\n           The EIR considered the impacts to 32 intersections and further analyzed the\ncumulative impacts of the plan on those 12 intersection expected to fail in 2025 if the\nplan went forward. The EIR did not, as plaintiffs claim, use a baseline of only those\nintersections “already” failing.\n       14\n           There is no indication the EIR’s consideration of the Civic Center Garage, just\none block outside of the project area (a location the EIR notes), was erroneous.\n\n\n                                             29\n\flower vehicle ownership rates within the area—rates likely to persist under the plan due\nto the public transit available within the area—the EIR forecasts the plan would generate\ndemand for 2,430 spaces during the weekday midday period and 3,050 spaces during the\nweekday evening period.)\n       This baseline is not hypothetical, in contravention of Communities, supra,\n48 Cal.4th at pages 320–321, but based on observation of existing conditions. It is not\nbased on “potential new off-street parking.” Instead projections of future demand, to\nmeasure likely impacts, derive from this baseline data.\n              Land Use Baseline\n       Plaintiffs also claims the EIR improperly measures the effects of the plan’s land\nuse changes against current zoning, not existing conditions. Plaintiffs’ have, again,\nrefused to acknowledge portions of the EIR that undermine their position. The EIR,\nstarting at page 4-31, in fact summarizes actual, existing land use in addition to current\nzoning. It also reports on expected impacts to existing land use. For example, it projects\n4,400 new net housing units and 1.8 million square feet of new non-residential\ndevelopment. The EIR then discusses land use impacts sub-area by sub-area. For\ninstance, for the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue sub-area, the EIR states “[t]he most\nnoticeable change would be the introduction of residential towers . . . of up to 400 feet.”\nIt notes “[a]lthough current height limits allow buildings up to 320 feet . . . the existing\nscale of buildings at this intersection is mostly 8 to 12 stories (up to about 150 feet)” with\ntwo taller outliers. The EIR therefore does not conceal the fact that the plan will permit\nresidential towers where lower structures currently exist.\n       Not only does the EIR measure permitted changes in land use against present use,\nit would not be inappropriate, as plaintiffs assert it would be, to compare proposed zoning\nto current zoning, which, as noted, the EIR also does. After all, changes to zoning, not\nthe construction of a particular development, is the core of the Market and Octavia area\nplan. Thus, in this sort of case, current zoning is not a hypothetical measure of existing\n\n                                              30\n\fconditions at a project site; current zoning is the existing condition and therefore a proper\nbaseline. (Black Property Owners Assn. v. City of Berkeley (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 974,\n985, italics omitted [“when a proposed amendment to a general plan is the subject of an\ninitial study, . . . the question is the potential impact on the existing environment of\nchanges in the plan which are embodied in the amendment”]; cf. Communities, supra,\n48 Cal.4th at pp. 318, 321–322 [using a boiler’s permitted emissions as baseline instead\nof actual emissions was error when thrust of project was modification of the boiler, not\nchanging permit rules]; but see Environmental Planning & Information Council v.\nCounty of El Dorado (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 350, 358 [reaching a different conclusion\nwhen EIR for proposed general plan amendments failed to make any comparison to\nexisting conditions].)\n              Transit and Other Baseline Issues\n       Plaintiffs have also asserted the use of year 2025 projections as a baseline for\nassessing public transit, air quality, noise, and growth impacts was improper. But\nplaintiffs never challenged the baseline for air quality, noise, and growth impacts in the\ntrial court and have therefore waived these arguments. (A Local & Regional Monitor v.\nCity of Los Angeles (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1773, 1804.) Plaintiffs’ purport to cite to\npages of their trial court briefing in which they raise these claim, but the cited pages only\nraise an issue with the transit baseline, not the others.\n       As for the public transit baseline, the EIR in fact lays out the then existing, 2004\nstate of transit starting at page 4-185. From this data, the EIR, starting at page 4-223,\nextrapolates transit data for the year 2025 with and without the plan as a means of finding\nthe changes to existing conditions as a result of the plan, just as with the traffic analysis.\nThus, the EIR discloses such metrics as demand, capacity, and utilization for 2004\nconditions and those expected in 2025. As with the traffic baseline, this is a situation\nwhere an intelligent understanding of impacts requires an analysis of likely future\nconditions in the context of current ones, just as the EIR does here. It would be absurd to\n\n                                              31\n\fask the city to hypothesize the impacts of a long-term zoning plan taking hold\nimmediately. When an area plan takes a long view of city planning, the analysis of the\nplan’s impacts should do so as well. (Pfeiffer, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1572–1574.)\n       Implicitly conceding the transit baseline does address existing conditions,\nplaintiffs also take issue with the transit baseline’s assessment that, in 2004, the\nMarket/Octavia area was “well-served.” Whatever this amorphous conclusion may\nmean, plaintiffs say it is unwarranted because the city’s own data showed transit delays\nand overcrowding on buses as a result. The data the city cites, however, comes from an\nold August 2001 report and pre-dates the EIR. Plaintiffs then cite a chart in the EIR that\nsupposedly shows Muni lacks capacity to serve existing, 2004 needs. Yet the chart\nplaintiffs cite, showing loads on North/South Muni lines, belies their claim, showing all\nMuni lines operating at 58 percent to 100 percent of capacity (two lines were considered\nat capacity, not over it). At bottom, the EIR has provided a sufficient transit baseline and\nplaintiffs’ claimed defects are illusory.\n       4.     EIR’s Analysis of Environmental Impacts\n       “An EIR shall identify and focus on the significant environmental effects of the\nproposed project.” (Guidelines, 15126.2, subd. (a).) A significant environmental effect\nis “ ‘a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment.’ (Pub.\nResources Code, § 21068; see also Guidelines, § 15382.) ‘ “Environment” means the\nphysical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed\nproject, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, objects of historic or\naesthetic significance.’ (Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.5; see also Guidelines, §\n15360.)” (Ballona Wetlands Land Trust v. City of Los Angeles (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th\n455, 473, fn. omitted.)\n       Even if a project’s impact may be “individually limited” this impact may be\n“cumulatively considerable,” and an EIR “shall discuss” these impacts. (Pub. Resources\nCode, § 21083, subd. (b)(2); Guidelines, §§ 15065, subd. (a)(3), 15130, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              32\n\f“ ‘[C]umulatively considerable’ means that the incremental effects of an individual\nproject are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the\neffects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.” (Pub.\nResources Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(2); Guidelines, § 15065, subd. (a)(3).)\n       An agency decision to not identify an impact as significant is reviewed for\nsubstantial evidence. (California Oak Foundation v. Regents of University of California\n(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 227, 281-282.)\n               Traffic Impacts\n       Starting with traffic impacts, plaintiffs claim the EIR understates the project’s\noverall impact on traffic. They claim a contradiction between, on the one hand, San\nFrancisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) figures estimating 60.8 percent of\nall trips (both those internal to the city and those passing through) will be by car and, on\nthe other hand, the EIR’s claim that the project will generate approximately 35,970 daily\n“person trips” but only 10,955 “vehicles trips.” Plaintiffs divide 10,955 into 35,970 and\nget 30.45 percent trips by car. But plaintiffs are comparing apples and oranges. As noted\non page 4-208 of the EIR, one vehicle trip can amount to more than one person trip.\nMoreover, the SFCTA’s numbers are citywide and do not relate to goals and expectations\nfor the Market/Octavia plan area. As the Market/Octavia area is to have reduced parking\nand proximity to public transit, the EIR contemplates fewer vehicle trips in that area than\nin other parts of the city.\n       Plaintiffs also fault the EIR for not finding a significant traffic impact at the Van\nNess/Market intersection despite stating there would be “a 63% increase in traffic.”\nPlaintiffs mischaracterize the EIR. It actually shows traffic at the intersection would,\nwith the plan, undergo an overall increase of only 355 vehicles during peak weekday\nafternoon hours, or a 6 percent increase over the 5,610 vehicles at present. The 63\npercent figure refers not to the overall increase, but only to the portion of that increase,\n225 vehicles our of 355, due to the plan. Put another way, the plan would contribute only\n\n                                              33\n\f4 percent of the total expected traffic volume at the intersection in 2025. Furthermore,\nthe EIR notes that the Van/Ness Market intersection would operate at the same poor “E”\nLevel of Service (delay per vehicle) whether with or without the plan. Plaintiffs have not\nchallenged the Level of Service delay-per-vehicle grading rubric as a reasonable measure\nof impact, nor the underlying Wilbur Smith traffic study’s assertion that “operational\nimpacts on signalized intersections are considered significant if project-related traffic\ncauses the level of service to deteriorate from LOS D or better to LOS E or F, or from\nLOS E to LOS F.”\n       Plaintiffs cannot base a substantial evidence attack on the whole of the city’s\ncommissioned traffic analysis with such slender and unfounded complaints.\n       Nor can plaintiffs fault the city for using computerized SFCTA travel demand\nforecasting model, which incorporates data from 766 city-wide Transportation Analysis\nZones, to predict cumulative impacts to future traffic. Rialto, supra, 208 Cal.App.4th\n899, ratified a similar approach and forecloses plaintiffs’ complaint that the city should\nhave based its impacts analysis on different data, such as a separate list of all projected\nfuture projects.\n              Transit Impacts\n       Plaintiffs also challenge the EIR’s conclusion of no “significant adverse impact on\nMuni service.” Plaintiffs again point to purported contradictions in the EIR to suggest\nthe EIR’s conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.\n       Plaintiffs first highlight the EIR’s claim of just 205 additional Muni riders under\nthe plan, despite the plan’s likely addition of thousands of new area residents. Plaintiffs\nimply this figure is per day, juxtaposing it with projected daily person trips, but fail to\nnote this 205 figure is actually per hour and represents only an increase in ridership at\nselected outbound rides at “screenlines.” Thus, the screenline analysis, just one of the\nanalyses related to Muni impacts, explicitly excludes “many transit trips that would travel\nto/from the Project Area [and] . . . not cross any of the screenlines.” There is nothing\n\n                                              34\n\firrational about the 205 figure or the EIR’s screenline analysis, especially given the EIR\nincludes a “corridor” analysis: “a secondary analysis” undertaken precisely because the\nscreenline analysis was not capturing project-generated trips sufficiently.\n       Plaintiffs further fault the city for ignoring SFCTA’s projection that, across all San\nFrancisco, the percentage of trips on public transit would increase from 17.2 percent in\n2000 to 19.6 percent in 2025. The EIR, however, actually operates on the assumption\nthat an even higher percentage of area trips, 21 percent, would be by transit during peak\nhours. This is because the EIR starts with the SFCTA report, but applies its general\nprincipals to the planned Market and Octavia area.\n       Plaintiffs’ citation to San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County\nof San Francisco, supra, 151 Cal.App.3d at page 78, though it notes “cattle car” status on\nMuni is an impact to address, has no bearing on the adequacy of the EIR’s transit analysis\nin this case. In that case, the city turned a blind eye to contemporaneous development\nprojects that would, in combination with the high rise under consideration, likely create a\nsignificant impacts on Muni, impacts the city’s EIR did not address. Here, the EIR, at\npages 4-224 to 4-228 justifies its conclusion of no significant impact, explaining the\nprojected increase of riders at screenlines and corridors (with the plan in 2025, as\ncompared to without the plan in 2025) would not result in Muni exceeding its capacity\nutilization standard.\n              Parking Impacts\n       There is no dispute the plan would, in all likelihood, create a parking shortfall. As\nalready mentioned, the EIR estimates parking shortfalls as high a 4,510 spaces during the\nweekday midday period and 5,640 spaces during the weekday evening period, or 2,430\nspaces during the weekday midday period and 3,050 spaces during the weekday evening\nperiod if lower vehicle ownership rates persist. It weighs these shortfall numbers (both\nwithout and with reduced vehicle ownership) against three projected supply scenarios\nunder the plan: no new parking spaces (0 new spaces), creation of the maximum allowed\n\n                                             35\n\fspaces according to zoning without conditional use permits (2,080 new spaces), and\ncreation of the maximum spaces with conditional use permits (3,160 spaces). Under\nthese three scenarios, there would be a shortfall of 1,350 to 4,510 spaces on weekdays at\nmidday and 2,480 to 5,640 spaces on weekdays at evenings. If reduced vehicle demand\noccurs, the shortfall reduces to -730 (a surplus) to 2,430 spaces at midday and -110 (a\nsurplus) to 3050 spaces at evening. The EIR also makes clear there would be a parking\nshortfall even if the city applied its general requirement of one parking space per\nresidential unit.\n       The EIR acknowledges the potential shortfall, but states while “[p]arking deficits\nmay be an inconvenience to drivers,” they “are not considered significant physical\nimpacts on the environment.” Indeed, the Court of Appeal for this district has held,\nstanding alone, “[t]he social inconvenience of having to hunt for scarce parking spaces is\nnot an environmental impact.” (San Franciscans Upholding the Downtown Plan v. City\nand County of San Francisco (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 656, 697 (Downtown Plan); see\nalso City of Long Beach v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 889,\n917 (Long Beach).) This court found no requirement for “an EIR to identify specific\nmeasures to provide additional parking spaces in order to meet an anticipated shortfall in\nparking availability.” (Downtown Plan, supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at p. 697.) Public\nResources Code section 21060.5, which plaintiffs cite, does not say otherwise. It merely\ndefines the term “environment” to mean “the physical conditions which exist within the\narea which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals,\nflora, fauna, noise, objects of historic or aesthetic significance.” (Pub. Resources Code,\n§ 21060.5.)15\n\n       15\n          Nor do we find the recent case Taxpayers for Accountable School Bond\nSpending v. San Diego Unified School District (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1013,\n(Taxpayers) helpful to plaintiffs. That case “disagree[d]” with the “broad statement” in\nDowntown Plan “that a parking shortage is merely a social inconvenience and can never\nconstitute a primary physical impact on the environment.” (Taxpayers, at p. 1051.) Yet\n\n                                            36\n\f       To be sure, however, an EIR must address secondary physical impacts triggered\nby a social impact, which, in the case of parking, might mean physical impacts on traffic\nand air quality. (Downtown Plan, supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at p. 697; Long Beach, supra,\n176 Cal.App.4th at p. 917.) The EIR, however, does weigh increased traffic and\nreduction in air quality due to some circling cars against the likelihood that many would\ntake note of the constrained parking situation and take public transit or other modes of\ntransport. The EIR concludes, quoting from the Wilbur Smith transportation study, “any\nsecondary environmental impacts which may result from a shortfall in parking . . . would\nbe minor, and the traffic assignments used in the transportation analysis, as well as in the\nassociated air quality, noise and pedestrian safety analyses, reasonably addresses\npotential secondary effects.” Plaintiffs ignore this conclusion of the city’s experts\n(Guidelines, § 15384 [allowing reliance on expert opinion]; Downtown Plan, supra,\n102 Cal.App.4th at p. 681) and offer no viable challenge to it, and no evidence to dispute\nit. Thus, there is no evidence on which to base a fair argument that anticipated parking\n\n\n\nthe court also explained Downtown Plan as dealing with the precise “special\ncircumstances” in San Francisco (the setting for this case) where there is: “a strong\npublic policy, reflected in a city ordinance, against providing private off-street parking to\nencourage the use of public transit.” (Taxpayers, at p. 1051; ibid. & fn.24 [“the Project in\nthis case is not located in a downtown area, and there is no City ordinance absolving a\nproject from providing off-street parking. On the contrary, City apparently has an\nordinance generally requiring projects to provide off-street parking”]; see also Cal. Code\nRegs. tit. 14, § 15064, subd (b) [“an activity which may not be significant in an urban\narea may be significant in a rural area”].) We see no reason to depart from Downtown\nPlan in this case.\n       Furthermore, in Taxpayers, the school district, crucially, did not obtain a useful\nmeasure of parking supply and likely increased parking demand in the project area, and\nso could not hope to meaningfully articulate impacts, direct or indirect, of a parking\nshortfall. (Taxpayers, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054 [“because District did not have\nsufficient information relating to the Project’s impact on parking and therefore could not\nadequately consider the potential significance of the Project’s impact on parking, District\nabused its discretion”].) As discussed above, the city fully disclosed the expected\nparking shortfalls and surplusses for various scenarios under the plan.\n\n                                             37\n\fshortfall will cause significant impacts. (See Tracy First v. City of Tracy (2009)\n177 Cal.App.4th 912, 934–935 [“Tracy First simply makes the bare assertions that the\nopinion of the City’s expert that the project would not result in wasteful, inefficient, and\nunnecessary consumption of energy was not supported by facts”]; cf. Long Beach, supra,\n176 Cal.App.4th at p. 917 [petitioner “provided no facts to support its hypothesis that\nparking is scarce”].)\n              Growth Impacts\n       Plaintiffs’ challenge to the analysis of impacts from growth in the plan area is\ndifficult to parse and contains no reasoned explanation of how the EIR violates CEQA—\nplaintiffs cite only general CEQA guidelines and provide not a single case cite. On this\nbasis alone we reject plaintiffs’ growth argument. (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.\nColombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived when a party\nfails to support them with reasoned argument . . . .”].) In any event, it appears plaintiffs\nare distressed that the EIR considers the plan’s predictably light impact on citywide\ngrowth, but excludes analysis of growth limited to the plan area. This assertion, however,\nis without basis, as the EIR, starting at page 4-66, analyzes area-specific growth in\npopulation, housing, and employment. Plaintiffs have not presented a challenge to that\nanalysis.\n              Cumulative Analysis\n       According to plaintiffs “perfunctory cumulative analyses are tacked on to the no-\nimpact findings for the various categories” of potential impacts. We have found no error\nin any finding of no impact, and so there can be no shortcoming in the cumulative impact\nanalysis based upon the city’s alleged misperception of the project’s direct impacts. (See\nCitizens for East Shore Parks v. State Lands Com., supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at pp. 565–\n566 [“the EIR did not need to consider the cumulative impact of [water] discharges\nbecause they were not ‘effects of [the] individual project’ under consideration”].) To the\nextent plaintiffs contend the city should have analyzed other projects in its cumulative\n\n                                             38\n\fimpacts analysis, plaintiffs merely list these projects in their opening brief and offer no\nexplanation of their relevance. This does not raise a sufficient challenge to the adequacy\nof the analysis. (Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency (2003)\n108 Cal.App.4th 859, 877–878 [in the cumulative impacts context, a “ ‘ “reviewing court\nis not required to make an independent, unassisted study of the record in search of error\n. . .’ ” . . . and may treat an issue as waived ‘when an appellant makes a general assertion,\nunsupported by specific argument’ ”]; Al Larson Boat Shop, Inc. v. Board of Harbor\nCommissioners, supra, 18 Cal.App.4th at p. 749 [petitioners “do not identify, or even\nsuggest, any manner in which the omission of more detailed information underlying the\nBoard’s conclusions on [cumulative impacts] mislead the agency or the public, omitted or\nunderstated any problem, or was prejudicial in any way”].)16\n\n\n       16\n            In their petition for rehearing, plaintiffs, for the first time, assert the city failed\nto conduct any cumulative impact analysis, at least for certain types of impacts. Plaintiffs\nbriefing on appeal, while cataloging the various “perfunctory” cumulative impact\nanalyses in the EIR (noting cumulative impact analyzes were present for at least land use\nand zoning; population, housing, and employment; growth; visual quality; wind; historic\nresources; transit; air quality; noise; and public facilities and services), did assert in\npassing (in parentheticals) that cumulative impacts for parking and open spaces were “not\nanalyzed.” Plaintiffs, however, made no argument based on the lack of any given\nanalysis. Plaintiffs have thus waived this claim by failing to adequately brief it on\nappeal. (Nelson v. Avondale Homeowners Assn. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862\n[“ ‘When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with\nreasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.\n[Citations.]’ ”]; Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency, supra,\n108 Cal.App.4th at pp. 877–878 [in the cumulative impacts context, a “ ‘ “reviewing\ncourt . . . may treat an issue as waived ‘when an appellant makes a general assertion,\nunsupported by specific argument’ ”].) Moreover, plaintiffs’ cumulative impacts\nargument to the trial court focused entirely on the adequacy of the various cumulative\nimpact analyses, not the outright omission of any of them. For this additional reason, the\nomission argument is barred. (A Local & Regional Monitor v. City of Los Angeles,\nsupra, 12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1804.) We have not investigated, and need not investigate,\nwhether this issue was properly raised in during the administrative process. (Coalition\nfor Student Action v. City of Fullerton (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1194, 1197 [“ ‘ “It was\nnever contemplated that a party to an administrative hearing should withhold any defense\n\n                                                39\n\f       5.     Mitigation of Impacts\n       “An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant\nadverse impacts . . . .” (Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1).) “If a mitigation measure would\ncause one or more significant effects in addition to those that would be caused by the\nproject as proposed, the effects of the mitigation measure shall be discussed but in less\ndetail than the significant effects of the project as proposed.” (Guidelines, § 15126.4,\nsubd. (a)(1)(B).)\n              Community Improvements Program\n       Plaintiffs’ first argument concerning mitigation of impacts stems from the\nCommunity Improvements Program (CIP) the city adopted in conjunction with approving\nthe Market and Octavia Area Plan. The CIP seeks to raise $261 million for improvement\nwithin the plan area—such as open spaces; pedestrian, vehicle, transit, and bicycle\namenities; and childcare and recreational facilities—by charging development fees of $10\nper square foot for residential development and $4 per square foot for non-residential.\nThe city’s ordinance adopting the CIP’s fundraising mechanism, however, carefully\nnoted the city was “not committing to the implementation of any particular project” as\nthere would likely be the need for proposed projects to undergo further design and\nenvironmental review. The CIP itself acknowledges the need for further environmental\nreview, acknowledging the city will have to handle the “soft costs” for that review.\n       The CIP, according to plaintiffs, concedes the plan has impacts, impacts the EIR\nignores and fails to mitigate. The CIP, in justifying its fundraising, states, for example,\nthe transition of Western SOMA into a mixed-used neighborhood with some potentially\nhigh-density parcels “will create an exponentially greater demand on city infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n. . . or make only a perfunctory or ‘skeleton’ showing in the hearing and thereafter obtain\nan unlimited trial de novo, on expanded issues, in the reviewing court.” ’ ”].)\n\n\n                                             40\n\fsystems. The Plan supports this type of development, but must also plan for the\nnecessary infrastructure.”\n       Had the CIP proposed mitigations to significant environmental impacts, an EIR\nwould have needed to address those impacts and measures. (California Native Plant\nSociety v. County of El Dorado (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1059 (CNPS I) [“fee\nprogram does not insulate the project from CEQA review”].) But unlike in CNPS I, the\ncity here prepared an EIR. That EIR evaluated the project and its impacts, and did not\nrequire the so-called mitigation programs outlined in the CIP. Plaintiffs quote off-hand\nstatements in the CIP about “impacts,” but do not show these impacts are legally\nsignificant or that the city’s EIR failed to properly address them. (See San Franciscans\nfor Reasonable Growth v. City and County of San Francisco (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d\n1502, 1517 [the EIRs “do not identify impacts on open space as a significant\nenvironmental effect. CEQA thus did not require measures to alleviate threats to open\nspace as such.”]; Long Beach, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at p. 915 [non-significant impacts\nneed not be analyzed].) They have put the cart before the horse, assuming the CIP must\nbe targeted at significant, CEQA-level impacts simply because it aims to facilitate\nimplementation of the underlying project.\n       Thus, for example, plaintiffs fault the CIP for not going far enough to mitigate\ntransit impacts—the CIP fails to call for new buses—but fail to show how the EIR’s\nconclusion on transit impacts is wrong. In fact, as we have discussed, the EIR transit\nimpact analysis is adequate.\n       Moreover, plaintiffs fault the CIP for suggesting new projects, not considered in\nthe EIR, that they claim will “remove parking” and cause other impacts, but plaintiffs do\nnot confront the fact that, as noted in the CIP, “these projects are placeholders that\nrequire further community vetting, engineering, and environmental review. Projects\ndescribed here that have not completed environmental review are placeholders used to\nestimate project costs. Additionally, projects may be substituted based on community,\n\n                                             41\n\fcity agency, and board recommendation.” And as already stated, the city ordinance\napproving the CIP reiterated the “Board of Supervisors is not committing to the\nimplementation of any particular project.”\n       We shall not doom the city’s area plan simply because it or others have made\ninformal, unapproved, un-reviewed, hypothetical suggestions for new development and\nprojects within the plan area. If we did otherwise, we would not respect the tiering\nprocess the city has properly chosen for environmental review. (See In re Bay-Delta,\nsupra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1175 [“Under CEQA’s tiering principles, it is proper for a\nlead agency to use its discretion to focus a first-tier EIR on only the general plan or\nprogram, leaving project-level details to subsequent EIR’s.”].)\n              Traffic Mitigation\n       According to plaintiffs, the EIR offers no proposed mitigation for four admittedly\nimpacted intersections except changes to traffic signal timing, changes which the EIR\nsays may not be feasible. In fact, the EIR states, for these trouble intersections,\n“[i]mplementation of signal timing changes would be dependent upon an assessment of\ntransit and traffic coordination . . . to ensure that the changes would not substantially\naffect Muni bus operations, signal progressions, pedestrian minimum green time\nrequirements, and programming limitations of signals. [¶] As the feasibility of the signal\ntiming changes has not been fully assessed, the potential for a significant and unavoidable\nimpact [from adopting the plan] would still exist.” The city ultimately committed itself,\nin its CEQA findings, to implementing the signal changes if possible. To be\nconservative, however, the city assumed the changes would not be possible, and\nconcluded, regardless, to move forward, as set forth in its statement of overriding\nconsiderations.\n       While ideally the city would have determined the feasibility of signal changes, that\nis not what CEQA requires in this case. CEQA need not “prevent project approval in\nsituations in which the formulation of precise means of mitigating impacts is truly\n\n                                              42\n\finfeasible or impractical at the time of project approval. In such cases, the approving\nagency should commit itself to eventually working out such measures as can be feasibly\ndevised, but should treat the impacts in question as being significant at the time of project\napproval.” (Sacramento Old City Assn. v. City Council (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011,\n1028, italics added.) At the end of the day, “[i]f the EIR finds that there are significant\nimpacts for which no mitigation measures are feasible, [the approving agency] must\nadopt a statement of overriding considerations before approving the project. (§ 21081,\nsubd. (b); Guidelines, § 15093.)” (Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. City of\nFresno (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 724.) The city did not ignore the traffic impacts at\nthese intersections. Rather, it informed the public of unavoidable impacts, committed\nitself to a plan of mitigation, and made it clear, in its statement of overriding\nconsideration, that it would move forward with the project even if the mitigation, when\nattempted, were a failure. CEQA’s core informational purpose was satisfied. (Cf. In re\nBay-Delta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1162 [“The purpose of an EIR is to give the public and\ngovernment agencies the information needed to make informed decisions . . . .”].) The\ncity should not be faulted for requiring an attempt at mitigation instead of simply giving\napproval without the requirement, a course of action that would leave the project’s known\nimpacts unaddressed.\n              Wind and Shadow\n       The EIR does not, as plaintiffs contend, improperly defer mitigation of wind\nimpacts by stating, on page 4-135, “[a] determination of wind impacts would be made at\na project level . . . as specific development proposals are made.” Tiering (see In re Bay-\nDelta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1176) is especially appropriate in this instance,\nwhere, as stated on page 4-134 of the EIR, “wind impacts from new construction are site-\nand design-specific, i.e., ground level impacts of construction of a building of a certain\nsize is more dependent on design factors such as exposure, massing and orientation than\nsquare footage.” (Italics omitted.) Plaintiffs do not challenge this conclusion.\n\n                                              43\n\f       In any case, the EIR proposes mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of new\nconstruction so ground winds speeds would not ordinarily exceed the “comfort level” of\n11 miles per hour. Exceptions could be made in some circumstances, but in no event\ncould ground wind speeds “reach or exceed the hazard level of 26 mph for a single hour\nof the year.” This 26 miles per hour threshold is also what the EIR determines, on page\n4-133, is the point at which wind would produce a significant environmental impact\nrequiring mitigation.17\n       Finally, plaintiffs fault the EIR for not proposing mitigation for acknowledged\nshadow impacts potentially resulting from new residential high rises. Yet the EIR\ncontains a multi-faceted approach to mitigating shadow impacts. First, it relies on San\nFrancisco Planning Code section 295 of the city’s planning code, which prohibits\nshadows on any open space controlled by the Recreation and Park Commission if the\nshadows would cause significant, adverse impact on use of the space. (S.F. Planning\nCode, § 295.) Second, for open spaces not under section 295’s protection, it requires\nproposed buildings over 50 feet tall to be shaped to minimize shadows. Yet the EIR\nacknowledges these measures may not be enough, and, as with traffic measures, the city\nadopted its findings and statement of overriding considerations knowing the full impact\nof its plans.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n          Though more of an “impact” argument than a “mitigation” argument, plaintiffs\ncomplain the 26 miles per hour threshold is not correct and cite provisions of the city’s\nplanning code, including section 148, which purportedly set forth the more restrictive 11\nmiles per hour comfort level as the threshold of significant impact. The planning code, to\nbe sure, adopts the 11 miles per hour comfort level, but also permits exceptions, as would\nthe EIR, for some buildings to create up to 26 miles per hour winds. (S.F. Planning\nCode, § 148.) Nowhere does the code pick either the comfort level or the hazard level as\nan environmentally significant threshold. Nowhere do plaintiffs articulate why a 26\nmiles per hour threshold, permitted by the city already under section 148, is deficient.\n\n\n                                            44\n\f        6.     Alternatives\n        “An EIR shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the\nlocation of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the\nproject but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the\nproject, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives. . . .” (Guidelines,\n§ 15126.6, subd. (a).)\n        Plaintiffs assert the EIR’s analysis of alternative options is inadequate because it\ndoes not evaluate an alternative that reduces the project’s wind, shadow, and traffic\nimpacts. The EIR, however, not only analyzes a no project alternative, it also analyzes a\n“Reduced Height/Reduced Density” alternative, at page 7-9, specifically aimed at\nproviding an option with, among other things, reduced shadow, wind, and traffic impacts.\nThe EIR discusses these reduced impacts at page 7-11 (shadows and wind) and page 7-12\n(traffic).\n        “An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project.”\n(Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a); Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology Center v. County of\nSiskiyou (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 184, 196.) Rather, it is sufficient to consider a “range of\nreasonable alternatives” to a proposed project to “foster informed decisionmaking and\npublic participation.” (Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs conclusorily asset the\nEIR should have analyzed other alternatives but do not suggest a single alternative plan\nthe city might have considered that would have lessened significant environmental\nimpacts associated with the project. An agency’s selection of alternatives to consider\n“ ‘will be upheld, unless the challenger demonstrates “that the alternatives are manifestly\nunreasonable and that they do not contribute to a reasonable range of alternatives.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2012)\n208 Cal.App.4th 362, 414.) Plaintiffs have not met their burden.\n        Plaintiffs nonetheless assert the city gave short-shrift to the alternatives analysis\nbecause the planning department was the project “author, sponsor, and environmental\n\n                                               45\n\freview agency” and because the city’s Board of Supervisors did not make their own\nindependent findings about alternatives. There was nothing problematic, however, with\nthe Board of Supervisors adopting the planning department’s recommendations.\n(Vedanta Society of So. California v. California Quartet, Ltd. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 517,\n528 [“We do not disagree with the idea that an elected body can adopt the findings and\nexplanations of the lower body.”].)\n       7.     CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations\n       “No public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an EIR has been\ncertified which identifies one or more significant environmental effects of the project\nunless the public agency makes one or more written findings for each of those significant\neffects, accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for each finding. The\npossible findings are: [¶] (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or\nincorporated into, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant\nenvironmental effect as identified in the final EIR. [¶] (2) Such changes or alterations are\nwithin the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency\nmaking the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can and\nshould be adopted by such other agency. [¶] (3) Specific economic, legal, social,\ntechnological, or other considerations, including provision of employment opportunities\nfor highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or project\nalternatives identified in the final EIR.” (Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (a).) CEQA\nfindings “shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record.” (Guidelines, § 15091,\nsubd. (b).)\n       CEQA additionally requires “the decision-making agency to balance, as\napplicable, the economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including region-\nwide or statewide environmental benefits, of a proposed project against its unavoidable\nenvironmental risks when determining whether to approve the project. If the specific\neconomic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including region-wide or\n\n                                             46\n\fstatewide environmental benefits, of a proposed project outweigh the unavoidable\nadverse environmental effects, the adverse environmental effects may be considered\n‘acceptable.’ ” (Guidelines, § 15093, subd. (a).) When this occurs, “the agency shall\nstate in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on the final EIR and/or\nother information in the record. The statement of overriding considerations shall be\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.” (Guidelines, § 15093, subd. (b).)\n       Plaintiffs contend the city’s findings and statement of overriding considerations\nare not based on substantial evidence. In particular, they claim the city has not pointed to\nsubstantial evidence supporting the conclusion that “economic, legal, social,\ntechnological, or other considerations . . . make infeasible the mitigation measures or\nproject alternatives identified in the final EIR,” such as keeping Hayes Street as one-way.\n(Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (a)(3); Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a)(3).)\n       Yet the city provided a host of reasons in its CEQA findings to reject the Hayes\nStreet “one-way” traffic mitigation proposal, discussed in detail at pages 5-14 to 5-17 of\nthe draft EIR: the one-way street would “constrain[] pedestrian crossing at key\nintersections including Hayes and Gough, and Gough and Fell, creat[e] conditions for\nhigh-speed automobile travel through key neighborhood intersections; creat[e] an\nunfriendly pedestrian environment due to noise and pollution; and reduc[e] the tendency\nfor residents to walk for their daily needs.” The city concluded a one-way Hayes street\nwould be infeasible: economically, because it would thwart development of the desired\ncommercial district in that area; and socially, because it would reduce safety and quality\nof life for pedestrians. These conclusions are supported in part by public comments from\nstakeholders.\n       The city’s decision to reject the Hayes Street traffic mitigation measure as\ninfeasible, and, in fact, its myriad of other decisions—reflected in it 42-page findings and\nstatement of overriding considerations—to proceed with the Market and Octavia plan\ndespite known impacts, reflects not a failure to comply with CEQA but a rational\n\n                                             47\n\fbalancing of interests, albeit in a way plaintiffs dislike. (See California Native Plant Soc.\nv. City of Santa Cruz (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 957, 1001–1002 (CNPS II).) CNPS II\nholds that an alternative or a mitigation measure may be infeasible because it is\nimpractical or undesirable from a policy standpoint, “ ‘to the extent that desirability is\nbased on a reasonable balancing of the relevant economic, environmental, social, and\ntechnological factors.’ ” (Id. at p. 1001.) The appellate court approved a city’s\ninfeasibility findings “based on policy considerations, particularly the City’s interest in\npromoting transportation alternatives as well as access to its open space for persons with\ndisabilities.” (Ibid.)\n       As in CNPS II, the “appellants’ assertion represents nothing more than a ‘policy\ndisagreement with the City.’ ” (CNPS II, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 1001.) “At\nbottom, appellants’ disagreement is ‘with the nature of the balance struck between . . .\ninterests.’ [Citation.] This is not a case involving straightforward questions of legal or\neconomic infeasibility. (See, e.g., Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of Woodside (2007)\n147 Cal.App.4th 587, 601 . . . [no economic infeasibility]; id. at p. 602 [no legal\ninfeasibility].) Arguably, such cases may present brighter lines for judicial review.\nWhether or not that is so, this much is clear: it is wholly improper for us to ‘arrogate to\nourselves a policy decision which is properly the mandate of the City.’ [Citation.] In this\ncase, the City’s determination was consistent with permissible statutory factors. ([Pub.\nResources Code,] § 21081, subd. (a)(3) [‘social . . . or other considerations’].) And it was\njustified under relevant case law . . . .” (Id. at pp. 1001–1002; see also Rialto, supra,\n208 Cal.App.4th 899, 949 [“a lead agency may reject an alternative as infeasible because\nit cannot meet project objectives”].)\n       Furthermore, petitioner’s contention that the statement of overriding\nconsiderations needed to be a separate, stand-alone document is meritless. (Towards\nResponsibility In Planning v. City Council (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 671, 683 [“City’s\nstatement of overriding considerations referred to the conclusions contained in the final\n\n                                             48\n\freport of the economic development task force . . . . It is entirely proper for an agency to\nrely upon studies and reports prepared for a previous step in the approval process.”].)18\n       8.     Supplementation of the Record\n       The final issue on appeal is the trial court’s May 12, 2009 order granting the city’s\nmotion to supplement the CEQA administrative record.\n       Plaintiffs claim the trial court granted the city leave to file 4,000 additional pages\nof administrative record without reviewing the then-current record and the city’s\nproposed supplement, and without making specific findings that the supplement was\nrelevant and truly part of the record, and without allowing plaintiffs to add further\ndocuments to the record if necessary. Believing the trial court wrongly granted the\nmotion to supplement, plaintiffs fear they may ultimately be unfairly required to pay the\ncost of preparing copies of the supplement (as requested in a bill of costs the city has\nfiled). The city’s bill of costs, though referenced in the register of actions, is not the\nappellate record, nor is any order that may obligate plaintiffs to pay these costs.\n       On this record, we cannot resolve plaintiffs’ challenge. First, without an order to\npay costs before us, our review is irreparably hindered. (See Hernandez v. California\nHospital Medical Center (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 498, 502 [review denied when appellant\nfailed to provide, among other things, a copy of the ordered challenged].) Additionally,\nplaintiffs have not demonstrated an injury ripe for review. (See Lazan v. County of\nRiverside (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 453, 464 [the superior court gave “permission to apply\n\n\n\n\n       18\n           Plaintiffs raised other arguments about the timing of the findings and statement\nin their petitioner for rehearing. To the extent these issues were not properly raised\nbeforehand, they have been forfeited. (Fairbank v. City of Mill Valley (1999)\n75 Cal.App.4th 1243, 1257, fn. 12.) Otherwise, they are rejected. We have been cited no\nauthority prohibiting the city from adopting findings and a statement of overriding\nconsiderations contemporaneously with an EIR.\n\n\n                                              49\n\ffor attorney’s fees” but the party “has yet to file a request” so the issue “is not ripe for\nappeal”].)19\n       Moreover, although plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s procedures, plaintiffs\nhave not directed us to a single irrelevant or otherwise improper document in the city’s\nsupplement. An appellant must not only show how the trial court erred, but how its error\nwas prejudicial. (Century Surety Co. v. Polisso (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 922, 963.)\n“[W]e cannot presume prejudice and will not reverse the judgment in the absence of an\naffirmative showing there was a miscarriage of justice. (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 13;\nPaterno v. State of California (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 68, 106 . . . ; Taylor v. Varga,\nsupra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 759.) Just because this case involves CEQA, in which\nreversal of agency action may be appropriate if an “agency has not proceeded in a\nmanner required by law” (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 426), does not relieve\nplaintiffs of their obligation to show prejudice from court orders. (See Madera Oversight\nCoalition, Inc. v. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 71 [“When a party seeks\nreview of a trial court’s determinations regarding the scope of the administrative record,\nthat party bears the burden of demonstrating that the trial court committed error.”].)\n\n\n\n\n       19\n          In fact, plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing discloses the trial court eventually\ngranted plaintiffs’ motion to strike costs related to the supplemental record, and that the\ncity has an appeal on file (case No. A135512) challenging that order.\n\n\n                                              50\n\f                                III.

No. CPF-08-508038)\nFRANCISCO,\n         Defendant and Respondent.\n\n\n         After preparing an environmental impact report, respondent City and County of\nSan Francisco (city) approved a project to rezone land along the Market Street corridor\nnear Octavia Boulevard and to redevelop 22 vacant parcels created by the removal of the\nelevated Central Freeway. The city amended its general plan to include a new Market\nand Octavia Area Plan and conformed its planning code and zoning maps. Plaintiffs\nCoalition for Adequate Review and Alliance for Comprehensive Planning filed a writ\npetition in the trial court challenging the city’s amended general plan and environmental\nreview of the project. The trial court denied relief and we affirm.\n                         I.        FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n         Over 10 years ago, in December 2002, the city published Market and Octavia\nNeighborhood Plan—Draft for Public Review, an area plan proposing modified land use\ncontrols for an area loosely centered around the Market Street corridor near Octavia\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fBoulevard. On January 23, 2004, the city gave notice it would, in compliance with the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), prepare an environmental impact report\n(EIR) evaluating the impacts of the area plan and redevelopment of 22 vacant parcels\nwithin the plan area created by the removal of the elevated Central Freeway.\n       On June 25, 2005, the city released its draft EIR. The report states it “covers\nadoption of the [Area] Plan, amendments to the San Francisco Planning Code and\nZoning Maps, amendment to the San Francisco General Plan, and adoption of urban\ndesign guidelines.” Aside from addressing redevelopment of the 22 Central Freeway\nparcels, the report does not review the impact of specific development projects that might\noccur within the area plan’s boundaries. Instead, “[i]ndividual projects that could occur\nin the future under the [area] Plan would undergo project level evaluation to determine if\nthey would result in further impacts specific to the development proposal, the site, and\nthe time of development and additional environmental review would be required.” The\nreport identified potentially significant and unavoidable impacts, including shadows from\npossible new construction and increased traffic delays at several intersections.\n       The city solicited public comments on the draft EIR between June 25, 2005 and\nAugust 23, 2005. On September 26, 2006, the city released a Comments and Responses\ndocument, which, together with the draft EIR made up the final EIR.\n       On April 5, 2007, the city planning commission certified the EIR, issued CEQA\nfindings and a statement of overriding considerations, and recommended the city adopt\nthe area plan and redevelopment project, despite their likely impacts, by enacting\nlegislation to amend the city’s general plan to include the area plan and amend the city’s\nplanning code and zoning map. Plaintiffs appealed the EIR certification to the Board of\nSupervisors, which denied the appeal on June 19, 2007, by a vote of eight to one, with\ntwo abstaining.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       On October 23, 2007, the Board of Supervisors approved the general plan\namendment by ordinance No. 246-07. Later, on April 15 and 22, 2008, the Board\napproved the planning code and zoning map amendments.\n       Meanwhile, on January 22, 2008, plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate in\nSan Francisco Superior Court. Their first amended petition, filed May 30, 2008—after\napproval of the planning code and zoning map amendments, is the operative pleading.\nPlaintiffs alleged the city’s general plan, after amendment by ordinance No. 246-07 to\nincorporate the Market and Octavia Area Plan, was unlawful because it lacked elements\nrequired by Government Code section 65302. They further alleged the Market and\nOctavia Area Plan created inconsistencies with the General Plan, in violation of\nGovernment Code section 65300.51 and San Francisco’s Planning Code sections 101 and\n101.1 (also known as Proposition M). Finally, they alleged the city’s EIR for the Market\nand Octavia Area Plan was inadequate under CEQA. Plaintiffs prayed for a court order\nexcising the Market and Octavia Area Plan from the general plan, voiding related\nchanges to city codes and ordinances, and requiring the city to prepare a new general plan\nand new EIR before making any attempts to implement aspects of the Market and\nOctavia Area Plan.\n       Although challenges to a general plan should proceed expeditiously, and with\npreference, to trial within 90 days, this case took over two years to reach trial. (See\n§§ 65752 [preference]; 65753, subd. (a) [speedy trial].) Plaintiffs filed their opening\nmemorandum in support of their petition on August 20, 2010. The city filed opposition\non October 21, 2010, and plaintiffs filed a reply on November 19, 2010. After a day-long\nhearing on December 8, 2010, the trial court issued a brief written ruling, on\nDecember 15, 2010, denying the petition and requiring the city to submit a proposed\n\n\n       1\n         All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nindicated.\n\n\n                                              3\n\forder. The city subsequently submitted a 34-page, memorandum-format proposed order.\nOver petitioner’s objections, the trial court signed the proposed order on January 7,\n2011—more than eight years after the city first published the draft area plan and about\nfour and a half years since the final EIR was completed. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal\non March 7, 2011.\n       While the events giving rise to this litigation were unfolding, another case made its\nway through the courts, a case that challenged the adequacy of the 2004 housing element\nof the city’s general plan—a replacement for the 1990 housing element. The city had\nfound the 2004 housing element would have no significant adverse environmental\nimpacts and so issued a negative declaration and approved the element without preparing\nan EIR. A court of this district, however, concluded “substantial evidence . . .\nsupport[ed] a fair argument that the amendments to the Housing Element may have a\nsignificant impact on the environment.” (San Franciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v.\nCity and County of San Francisco (Cal. Ct.

The appellate court reversed and ordered the trial court “to issue a\nwrit of mandate directing the City to set aside its adoption of the negative declaration and\nto order the preparation of an EIR.” (Id. at p. *14.)\n       On April 6, 2009, following this reversal, the trial court issued a preemptive writ\nof mandate. It enjoined the city from implementing some aspects of the 2004 housing\nelement, but allowed it to operate under the element’s remaining provisions—many of\nwhich derived from the previous 1990 housing element—until the city complied with\nCEQA’s mandates. An April 29, 2009, letter from the state’s Department of Housing and\nCommunity Development assured the city its gutted 2004 housing element still complied,\nin the department’s opinion, with the state’s planning laws.2\n\n       2\n        “If the Department finds the housing element substantially complies with\nhousing element law, the housing element has a rebuttable presumption of validity.\n(§ 65589.3.)” (Haro v.

Land Use Element\n       Section 65302 requires a general plan to include a “land use element that\ndesignates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of\nthe land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural\nresources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and\ngrounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and\nprivate uses of land.” (§ 65302, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          In their petition for rehearing, plaintiffs clarified and emphasized one of their\narguments concerning the city’s general plan—that the plan’s land use element,\ncirculation element, and housing element were all inadequate before amendment.\nPlaintiffs, however, did not timely challenge, in this case, the adequacy of the pre-\namendment general plan. In response to California’s “crisis”-level housing shortage and\nto “provide certainty for property owners and local government” (§ 65009, subds. (a)(1),\n(a)(3)), the Legislature has required challenges to the adequacy (as opposed to the\nexistence) of general plan elements to be made within 90 days, (id., subds. (c)(1)(A)). A\nplaintiff cannot use the occurrence of a general plan amendment to challenge the\nadequacy of any long-standing portions of that plan. Such challenges are time barred.\n(Napa Citizens for Honest Government v.

A contrary\nrule would chaotically upend the very certainty and confidence the statute explicitly seeks\nto promote. We may still, however, address plaintiffs’ contentions that certain general\nplan elements were entirely absent, or that the 2007 general plan amendments were\ninadequate.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f       Plaintiffs contend the city’s general plan, after amendment with the Market and\nOctavia area plan, has no land use element at all. While the general plan does lack a\nsingle land use element, it contains a “Land Use Index” which refers the reader to other\nparts of the plan containing information that, if located in one place, would make up the\nland use element. The Market and Octavia Area Plan, as well as other area plans, also\ncontains land use information. Such a distributed approach to the land use element is\nacceptable. A “general plan may be adopted in any format deemed appropriate or\nconvenient by the legislative body, including the combining of elements.” (§ 65301,\nsubd. (a).) In addition, a “general plan may be adopted as a single document or as a\ngroup of documents relating to subjects or geographic segments of the planning area.”4\n(§ 65301, subd. (b).)\n       Plaintiffs next contend the land use element, as amended, fails to “include a\nstatement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for\nthe various districts and other territory covered by the plan.” (§ 65302, subd. (a).)\n       Yet the Land Use Index has a section labeled “Population Density and Building\nIntensity Standards.” The section points to density and intensity standards in the\ncommerce and industry and housing elements, and the various area plans. It also has a\nseries of maps. They depict citywide guidelines for building height and building bulk,\nand depict a citywide commercial and industrial density plan, which expresses densities\nin terms of a FAR (Floor Area Ratio), the ratio between gross floor area to lot area.\n       In addition, the Market and Octavia Area Plan states there should be no limit on\npopulation density within that already-established urban area, because the goal is to\nmaximize housing and limits would “unnecessarily constrain the housing potential.” The\n\n\n       4\n          Plaintiffs’ rehearing petition suggests, for the first time, that the Land Use Index\nmay not be part of the city’s general plan. They present no evidence of this.\nFurthermore, plaintiffs made no such argument in their appellate briefing, even though\nthe city relied heavily on its Land Use Index in its respondent’s brief.\n\n\n                                              7\n\fplan states it would be preferable to regulate building height, bulk, and other design\ncharacteristics to promote building design goals, not density per se.\n       To that end, the area plan divides the Market and Octavia neighborhood into use\ndistricts. A map, labeled map 1, shows the districts’ locations and a table, labeled figure\n3, establishes permitted uses for each district. For example, the Van Ness and Market\nDowntown Residential Special Use District (VNMDR-SUD), occupying the area by the\nintersection of those two streets, “will still have the area’s most intensive commercial\nuses, including offices, but balances those with a new residential presence.” Mixed\noffice, retail, and housing are allowed in an 85- or 120-foot building base, with\nresidential towers permitted above the base at heights ranging from 160 to 400 feet.\nAlthough there would be, explicitly, no limit on residential density, there is a minimum\n2:1 residential to non-residential use ratio. Certain retail, office, and cultural uses are\npermitted up to the fourth floor. No minimum residential or non-residential parking is\nrequired, but residential off-street parking is allowed at .25 spaces per unit (up to .75\nspaces per unit and 1 space per two-bedroom unit by conditional use permit) and non-\nresidential parking is allowed at approximately 1 space per 4,500 gross square feet.\n       On the other end of the spectrum is the Residential Transit Oriented (RTO)\ndistrict, which comprises less-dense pockets of the planned area. The RTO district “will\nencourage moderate-density, multi-family, residential infill, in scale with existing\ndevelopment” near robust transit infrastructure, with allowance for limited small-scale\nretail. Non-retail offices are not allowed, but retail on corner lots, up to 1,200 square\nfeet, is. Residential density is limited at one unit per 600 square feet lot area, with\nconditional use permits available for a higher density. Forty percent of units must be\ntwo-bedroom units unless an exception is made.

(a).)\n       While one “reasonable interpretation of the term ‘population density’ as used in\nGovernment Code section 65302 is one which refers to numbers of people in a given\narea” (Twain Harte Homeowners Assn. v.

Unlimited density is\nno less a standard than limited density, and it is a choice the city reached quite\ndeliberately. Its policy 2.2.1 on page 15 of the area plan calls for elimination of density\nmaximums, which “unnecessarily constrain the housing potential . . . in relatively dense,\nestablished urban neighborhoods like the Market and Octavia area.” Plaintiffs may\ndebate the policy of having unlimited density constrained by other limits on development,\nbut our task is not to evaluate the wisdom of the general plan, only its compliance with\nthe law. (Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1195 [we do not “inquire into the\nwisdom of a legislative act or review the merits of a local government’s policy\ndecisions”].)\n       As to standards for building intensity, the area plan document gives standards for\nbuilding heights and permitted uses for each zoning district in the area, precisely the sorts\nof standards called for in Twain, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120539\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120539/twain-harte-homeowners-assn-v-cty-of-tuolumne/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We need not resolve this\ndispute in light of the conclusions we reach below.\n\n\n                                              9\n\finclude “restrictions such as height or size limitations, restrictions on types of buildings\nor uses to be permitted within a designated area”].)\n       2.     Circulation Element\n       A general plan must also contain a “circulation element consisting of the general\nlocation and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,\nterminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all\ncorrelated with the land use element of the plan.” (§ 65302, subd. (b)(1).) Correlation\nmeans “the circulation element of a general plan must provide meaningful proposals to\naddress changes reflected in the land use element, and the land use element must provide\nmeaningful proposals to reflect changes reflected in the circulation element.”\n(Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1196.)\n       Plaintiffs believe correlation is lacking because the Market and Octavia land use\nplan calls for increased density while the circulation plan calls for relatively fewer\nparking spaces (compared to other parts of the city) and a balanced use of city roadways.\nThe area plan, however, addresses this supposed conundrum. It recognizes “[a] common\nfear is that reducing the capacity available for cars will result in major increases in\ncongestion.” Yet notes “[m]uch research rejects this logic and shows that people’s\ntransportation choices are dynamic and respond to capacity, relative cost, time,\nconvenience, and other factors” and “[c]rucially . . . movement of people is more than\njust movement of cars.”\n       Plaintiffs may dislike this correlation, but there is undoubtedly correlation. Only\ntime will tell if the city’s “if we build it” approach to parking and transportation choices\nwill benefit the Market and Octavia area. Meanwhile, the conclusion reached in\nFederation is apt here: “Contrary to [Plaintiffs’] argument, the internal consistency and\ncorrelation requirements do not require a city or county to limit population growth or\nprovide traffic management measures to ensure that its transportation infrastructure can\naccommodate future population growth. The Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code,\n\n                                               10\n\f§ 65000 et seq.) does not require a city or county to avoid adverse impacts on\ntransportation. Rather, the city has broad discretion to weigh and balance competing\ninterests in formulating development policies, and a court cannot review the wisdom of\nthose decisions under the guise of reviewing a general plan’s internal consistency and\ncorrelation.” (Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1196.) Accordingly, we shall not\ndisturb the circulation element.6\n       3.     Housing Element\n       Plaintiffs claim, because of the June 2007 decision of this court in San\nFranciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v.

Plaintiffs\nalso contend the trial court’s eventual writ in that case, issued April 6, 2009, specifically\nenjoined the city from enforcing, relying upon, or approving any “ ‘no residential parking\nrequirement’ ” or “ ‘no density requirement[] for residential projects’ ” until those\npolicies received environmental review.\n       The 2007 Court of Appeal decision did not invalidate the city’s then-existing\nhousing element. That decision merely commanded the trial court to issue a writ “to\norder the preparation of an EIR” for the 2004 revisions to the previously-approved, and\nEIR-vetted, 1990 residency element. (San Franciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v.\nCity and County of San Francisco, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1793881</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at pp. *1, *14.) When the\ntrial court eventually issued a writ in 2009, it explicitly allowed the city to rely on the\n1990 residency element and certain valid portions of the 2004 housing element until the\ncity could conduct environmental review for, and approve, a new housing element.

Thus, when the city amended the general plan in October 2007, it\noperated with a housing element in place.\n       Even if the 2009 writ forbade the city from adopting certain parking and density\npolicies in its housing element absent further environmental review, it did not,\nretroactively, forbid the city from adopting, in October 2007, an area plan with similar\nhousing policies for one area of the city, Market and Octavia, following the exact sort of\nextensive CEQA-compliant environmental review (discussed below) the writ demanded.\nPlaintiffs do not offer a cogent argument for why the city could not make this incremental\nchange to its housing element if it proceeded according to CEQA’s dictates.\n       Further, it appears the city has since completed review of and approved the 2004\nhousing element, and a subsequent 2009 housing element.7 Thus any arguable\nconsistency issues between the area plan and the 1990 residence element have been\n\n\n       7\n          We previously denied the city’s request for judicial notice of the ordinance\nadopting the revised housing element.

Thus, in Dusek, when a project description (redevelopment of a\nparcel) was broader than, but inclusive of, the project approved (demolition of a structure\non the parcel), the public was fully informed and had an opportunity to voice opposition.\n(Id. at pp. 1035, 1041.)\n\n                                              16\n\f       The city’s choice, here, to reduce the size of the plan area makes this case like\nDusek.9 The city’s EIR addressed a plan broader, and with greater impacts, than the plan\napproved. Plaintiffs dispute this, stating the city’s plan would still increase housing and\nresidency, but now distribute that growth more intensely over a smaller area. Not so.\nWhile the plan states fixed population growth targets, these targets are mere aspirations,\nnot mandatory. The plan quite plainly seeks population growth through zoning change.\nThus, the city’s rezoning of fewer parcels would in fact reduce the plan’s impacts.10\n              Description of VNSUD\n       Plaintiffs further claim the EIR omits a description of the VNMDR-SUD (standing\nfor Van Ness and Market Downtown Residential Special Use District), and that this\ndistrict was only added to plans after EIR certification.\n       Though the draft EIR did not use the VNMDR-SUD acronym, it does describe the\nproject as creating a “Downtown Residential” (DTR) district “around the Market Street\nand Van Ness Avenue intersection.” This district “would permit . . . moderate- and large-\nsized commercial activities” up to the fourth floor. “[A]utomobile-oriented uses would\nnot be allowed.” Height limits—from 160 feet up to 400-foot towers would be\nallowed—and bulk limits would determine housing density. Thus, the EIR foreshadowed\nand accounted for the “huge towers already in the Planning process” plaintiffs oppose.\nThe draft EIR also provides a table, labeled 3-1, of characteristics of the DTR district and\n\n\n       9\n          Plaintiffs argue Dusek is inapposite, because it concerned a project-level\nsupplemental EIR, not a “defective EIR.” This argument, which plaintiffs flesh out no\nfurther, lacks discernable logic.\n       10\n           Other, later “changes” to the Market and Octavia area plan are inconsequential\nand have no bearing on CEQA compliance. There appears to have been a clerical error,\nby which the city approved a version of the plan with even fewer zoning changes than\ncalled for in the final EIR, and then later fixed this error in a later ordinance. There is no\ndispute the EIR addressed the full range of potential zoning changes and that the city\neventually implemented all of them, excluding the 12 blocks mentioned above. Plaintiffs\nhave not shown how there was any cognizable defect under CEQA.\n\n\n                                             17\n\fother proposed districts—a table that mirrors the table in the draft Market and Octavia\nArea Plan, labeled figure 3 and discussed above. It restates, for the DTR district, the\ncommercial activity and height restrictions, and states there will be no minimum parking\nrequired, but that there could be up to 1 commercial spot per 4,500 square feet and from\n.25 spaces (up to .5 spaces with conditional use permit) per residential unit. The draft\nEIR discusses impacts related to the DTR’s creation in section 4.2.2.\n       Comparing the draft EIR’s DTR district to the VNMDR-SUD found in the\napproved Area Plan, there is almost no difference. It appears city planners changed the\nname of district that would cover the Van Ness and Market intersection, but little else.\nThere are some differences. For example, the VNMDR-SUD allows somewhat more\nresidential parking (.75 spaces by conditional use permit rather than .5). But these\nchanges are noted and addressed in the response to comments. As for the additional\nparking that would be allowed under the revised project, the city’s response states the\nEIR evaluated a range of allowed parking—from zero to one space per unit—and\ntherefore no further analysis of the change was needed.\n       The public was on notice about the DTR and the VNMDR-SUD, and plaintiffs\ncannot complain about, in essence, a name change and minor tweaks arising from the\npublic comment process.\n       2.     EIR Tiering\n       Plaintiffs next raise a concern about the EIR’s limited scope—that is, the city’s\nchoice to segregate and postpone review of various endeavors, which plaintiffs argue\nshould have been reviewed in the EIR under consideration.\n       The city’s EIR delineated three types of proposed endeavors and handled each\ntype differently. It analyzed the Market and Octavia Area Plan’s proposed land use\nchanges at a “Program Level,” without addressing specific possible future developments\nthat might come to be on rezoned parcels. It analyzed near-term projects referenced in\nthe Area Plan—redevelopment of the 22 Central Freeway parcels and conversion of\n\n                                            18\n\fHayes and Fell to two-way streets—at a “project level.” The EIR also mentioned long-\nterm transportation initiatives mentioned in the Area Plan, but did not analyze these\nbecause, as it concluded, the city was not seeking approval for these initiatives, which\nwould be subject to additional environmental review when proposed.\n       Plaintiffs fault the EIR for treating land use changes at a “program level” and for\nnot addressing the long-term transportation initiatives.\n       A program-level EIR “is an EIR which may be prepared on a series of actions that\ncan be characterized as one large project and are related” by geography, by being “logical\nparts” in a chain of contemplated action, by “issuance of rules, regulations, plans, or other\ngeneral criteria to govern the conduct of a continuing program,” or by being “under the\nsame authorizing statutory or regulatory authority and having generally similar\nenvironmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways.” (Guidelines, § 15168,\nsubd. (a).)\n       Program EIRs play a key role in “tiered” CEQA analysis. (Guidelines, § 15152,\nsubd. (h).) “ ‘Tiering’ refers to using the analysis of general matters contained in a\nbroader EIR (such as one prepared for a general plan or policy statement) with later EIRs\nand negative declarations on narrower projects; incorporating by reference the general\ndiscussions from the broader EIR; and concentrating the later EIR or negative declaration\nsolely on the issues specific to the later project.” (Guidelines, § 15152, subd. (a).) The\nLegislature has declared “environmental impact reports shall be tiered whenever\nfeasible.” (Pub. Resources Code, § 21093, subd. (b); Al Larson Boat Shop, Inc. v. Board\nof Harbor Commissioners (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740.) Tiering “will promote\nconstruction of needed housing and other development projects by (1) streamlining\nregulatory procedures, (2) avoiding repetitive discussions of the same issues in successive\nenvironmental impact reports, and (3) ensuring that environmental impact reports\nprepared for later projects which are consistent with a previously approved policy, plan,\nprogram, or ordinance concentrate upon environmental effects which may be mitigated or\n\n                                             19\n\favoided in connection with the decision on each later project.” (Pub. Resources Code,\n§ 21093, subd. (a).)\n       The CEQA Guidelines specifically endorse tiering “in connection with an EIR for\na large-scale planning approval, such as a general plan or component thereof (e.g., an\narea plan or community plan),” noting in these cases, “development of detailed, site-\nspecific information may not be feasible but can be deferred, in many instances, until\nsuch time as the lead agency prepares a future environmental document in connection\nwith a project of a more limited geographical scale.” (Guidelines, § 15152, subd.

In criticizing\nan EIR for a 25-year, phased project for a golf resort community, the Court of Appeal\nwas concerned the report disclosed a water plan sufficient to cover only the first five\nyears of the project, and deferred consideration of impacts related to future water needs\nuntil the project was well underway—and in need of water. (Id. at pp. 188, 195.) This\nwas not a case where the county “simply adopt[ed] or amend[ed] a general plan so as to\npermit the building of homes and golf courses. The County adopted a specific plan\ncalling for the construction of those facilities and of other particularly described facets of\nthe Diablo Grande Specific Plan.” (Id. at p. 203, italics added; see also Vineyard, supra,\n40 Cal.4th at p. 431 [agreeing with result in Stanislaus].)\n       Laurel Heights, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161804\"><a href=\"/opinion/1161804/laurel-heights-improv-v-regents-of-univ-of-calif/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is also distinguishable. That case involved\nUCSF acquiring a building which it planned to eventually use all of, but which it would\nuse only a portion of until current tenants’ leases expired. UCSF could not avoid an EIR\nthat addressed use of the whole building, since UCSF conceded it would in fact make that\nfull use. (Id. at pp. 388, 393, 397.) The project in Laurel Heights did not implicate the\nplanning and implementation dichotomy we have here (id. at p. 396 [“This is not the type\nof situation where it is unclear as to whether a parcel of land will be developed or as to\nwhether activity will commence.”]), but concerned, like Stanislaus, inevitable future\n“phases” of projects to be carried out by the same proponents of the initial projects.\n       Thus, no authority required the city to analyze, in connection with an area plan\nEIR, the specific development projects that might or might not occur on every parcel\nwithin the area, including private development projects by untold numbers of third-party\n\n                                              21\n\fdevelopers. Analysis of such development may be left to the future and may piggbyback\non the programmatic area plan EIR.\n       Following from this, the city also did not need to study “in-the-pipeline” projects\n(already subject to their own CEQA and EIR process) located within the confines of, and\nconsistent with, the area plan, such as the planned development of 500 residential units at\na former UC Berkeley site at 55 Laguna (the LHBHSUD district) or the construction of a\ngrocery store at 555 Fulton (the Fulton SUD). The city in fact conducted environmental\nreview of the 55 Laguna redevelopment project, and in 2010 a Court of Appeal\nconcluded that review was adequate.11 (Save Laguna Street Campus v.

This\nenvironmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which\na lead agency determines whether an impact is significant.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 320,\nitalics omitted.)\n              Historic Resources Baseline\n       Plaintiffs criticize the EIR’s treatment of historic resources, claiming it omits a\ndiscussion of certain historic buildings and thereby impedes the public’s understanding of\nimpacts to them.\n       Section 4.6.3 of the EIR summarizes architectural resources within the Market and\nOctavia neighborhood. It draws on eight surveys from between 1968 and 2004, plus the\ncity planning department’s Parcel Information Database. It notes hundreds of structures\n“contribute” to historical districts, such as the Hayes Valley Historic District, or have\nunique architectural or historical features, such as Mission Dolores and a U.S. Mint\n\n                                             23\n\fbuilding. The EIR notes infill development promoted by the area plan could differ in\ndesign and scale from historical resources, thus altering the context in which those\nresources exist. On the other hand, a goal of the area plan is preservation of historic\nbuildings and the plan’s urban design guidelines “would ensure that new development\nenhances the area’s physical fabric.” “Individual projects proposed within the\n[neighborhood] would be subject to existing city land use controls including design\nreview during the permitting stage to ensure compatibility with adjacent historical\nresources [and] to avoid demolition of historic resources.” These controls and reviews\nwould, claims the EIR, prevent significant impacts at the program level, but “[s]ite\nspecific impacts would need to be evaluated for individual projects before they are\napproved.”\n       Thus, despite plaintiffs’ claim of EIR omissions, the EIR does mention “omitted”\nbuildings by name (such as the U.S. Mint) or acknowledge them by reference to a group\nto which they belong (the Tudor on Waller street is one of the 200 structures\n“contributing” to the Hayes Valley Historic District). Having laid out in broad strokes\nthe historical resources in the Market and Octavia area, the EIR alerts the public that the\narea contains historic structures and promises further environmental review should any\nactual development plans threaten those structures.\n       This level of detail is sufficient for the program-level EIR at issue. Separate,\nproject-level review of specific developments will inform the public of impending\nchanges to historic resource, and the impacts of those changes, including those impacts\nthat would be cumulative with other projects. To hold otherwise would defeat the tiering\nprocess authorized by the CEQA Guidelines. (See In re Bay-Delta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\npp. 1174–1176.) As each historic resource is unique, to insist on further review now, at\nthe program level, would not be cost-effective and could bind the city to a course of\naction that it later found to be infeasible.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f        Moreover, the promise of later, second-tier review is not an empty one, but rather\na promise courts accept, and will enforce, in the context of an appropriately tiered EIR.\n(See In re Bay-Delta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1176; Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc. v.

First, as the EIR discusses, the area around City Hall already has three\nhigh-rise towers and a maximum permitted height of 320 feet, which minimizes the\nimpact of the feared changes to city views. (Cf. Citizens for East Shore Parks v. State\nLands Com. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

First, plaintiffs fault the city for not including in the traffic\nbaseline the latest data about the new, six-lane Octavia Boulevard freeway access road,\neven though the road opened in September 2005, after the public comment period but\nbefore the area plan’s EIR was finalized. They cite a March 2, 2006 city study, not cited\nin the EIR, showing use of Octavia was then already close to capacity and resulting in\ncongestion on nearby feeder streets.\n        But the city’s draft EIR had accounted for increased use of Octavia as a freeway\nfeeder, noting “a wide variation in terms of percent contribution at several of the study\nintersections . . . as future traffic volumes would be affected by implementation of the\nCentral Freeway Project.” While “future traffic volume” at some intersections “would be\nreduced due to the reassignment of vehicles . . . [to] new on- and off-ramps,” the city\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\fmore than doubled the estimated use of the Market/Octavia/McCoppin intersection, the\nnew ramp location, even without the plan.\n       Then, when plaintiffs complained in late 2005 during the comment process about\nthe lack of an evaluation of current Octavia Boulevard conditions, the city responded\nwith information and action. In its September 2006 response, it told plaintiffs that the\nOctavia/Market freeway “touchdown” had been approved after environmental review in\n2000. The city also collected new traffic data in “November 2005 to determine actual\nshifts in traffic patterns related to” the freeway access changes, data it included with its\ncomment responses. The city also took stock data collected in October and December\n2005, and concluded “the volume estimates [from the draft EIR] are consistent with\nactual traffic volumes after the ramps and boulevard were opened.”\n       The city can only analyze the environmental baseline existing at the time of its\nreview. (Communities, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 321.) The city here used the data\navailable to it and supplemented its analysis after collecting new data in response to\ncomments. Plaintiffs have faulted the city for not incorporating still more-recent data on\ntraffic, available only months after the public comment period had closed, and making\nyet another review of traffic impacts. At some point, however, review must end.\n“ ‘ “ ‘CEQA requires an EIR to reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure; it does not\nmandate perfection, nor does it require an analysis to be exhaustive.’ ” ’ ” (City of\nMaywood v.

Those intersections within the plan expected to receive unsatisfactory\ntraffic grades in 2025 because of “direct impacts” or “cumulative impacts” of the plan,\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\fwere highlighted and singled out for further analysis.13 At pages 4-220 to 4-221, the EIR\nprovides two numbers for each at-risk intersection: the percent of estimated total traffic\nin 2025 generated by the plan (contribution to total); and the percent of estimated traffic\ngrowth, from current conditions to those expected in 2025, generated by the plan\n(contribution to growth). The “contribution to growth” figure explicitly measures the\nplan’s impact against existing conditions. Thus, the EIR was able to identify\nintersections that would be negatively impacted by the plan most directly and those\nimpacted by a combination of the plan and other forces. It concluded the plan would\nhave a significant impact on seven intersections, but not on the five remaining\nintersections, based on “examination of the traffic volumes for the traffic movements\nwhich determine overall . . . performance at the[] intersections.” The five intersections\nwith insignificant cumulative impacts had the same performance grade in 2025\nprojections, with or without the plan.\n              Parking Baseline\n       Despite plaintiffs’ contrary assertion, the EIR adequately describes the existing\nstate of both on-street and off-street parking within the project area at pages 4-197 to 4-\n200. For instance, the EIR found on-street parking on weekdays at midday to be near\ncapacity. It also found, referencing a 2002 report parking study, on-street and many off-\nstreet parking options were full during performances at Civic Center14 venues. The EIR\ngoes on to measure parking shortfalls against current conditions, estimating the project\ncould create parking demand as high a 4,510 spaces during the weekday midday period\nand 5,640 spaces during the weekday evening period. (Taking into account, however,\n\n       13\n           The EIR considered the impacts to 32 intersections and further analyzed the\ncumulative impacts of the plan on those 12 intersection expected to fail in 2025 if the\nplan went forward. The EIR did not, as plaintiffs claim, use a baseline of only those\nintersections “already” failing.\n       14\n           There is no indication the EIR’s consideration of the Civic Center Garage, just\none block outside of the project area (a location the EIR notes), was erroneous.\n\n\n                                             29\n\flower vehicle ownership rates within the area—rates likely to persist under the plan due\nto the public transit available within the area—the EIR forecasts the plan would generate\ndemand for 2,430 spaces during the weekday midday period and 3,050 spaces during the\nweekday evening period.)\n       This baseline is not hypothetical, in contravention of Communities, supra,\n48 Cal.4th at pages 320–321, but based on observation of existing conditions. It is not\nbased on “potential new off-street parking.” Instead projections of future demand, to\nmeasure likely impacts, derive from this baseline data.\n              Land Use Baseline\n       Plaintiffs also claims the EIR improperly measures the effects of the plan’s land\nuse changes against current zoning, not existing conditions. Plaintiffs’ have, again,\nrefused to acknowledge portions of the EIR that undermine their position. The EIR,\nstarting at page 4-31, in fact summarizes actual, existing land use in addition to current\nzoning. It also reports on expected impacts to existing land use. For example, it projects\n4,400 new net housing units and 1.8 million square feet of new non-residential\ndevelopment. The EIR then discusses land use impacts sub-area by sub-area. For\ninstance, for the Market Street/Van Ness Avenue sub-area, the EIR states “[t]he most\nnoticeable change would be the introduction of residential towers . . . of up to 400 feet.”\nIt notes “[a]lthough current height limits allow buildings up to 320 feet . . . the existing\nscale of buildings at this intersection is mostly 8 to 12 stories (up to about 150 feet)” with\ntwo taller outliers. The EIR therefore does not conceal the fact that the plan will permit\nresidential towers where lower structures currently exist.\n       Not only does the EIR measure permitted changes in land use against present use,\nit would not be inappropriate, as plaintiffs assert it would be, to compare proposed zoning\nto current zoning, which, as noted, the EIR also does. After all, changes to zoning, not\nthe construction of a particular development, is the core of the Market and Octavia area\nplan. Thus, in this sort of case, current zoning is not a hypothetical measure of existing\n\n                                              30\n\fconditions at a project site; current zoning is the existing condition and therefore a proper\nbaseline.

Plaintiffs’ purport to cite to\npages of their trial court briefing in which they raise these claim, but the cited pages only\nraise an issue with the transit baseline, not the others.\n       As for the public transit baseline, the EIR in fact lays out the then existing, 2004\nstate of transit starting at page 4-185. From this data, the EIR, starting at page 4-223,\nextrapolates transit data for the year 2025 with and without the plan as a means of finding\nthe changes to existing conditions as a result of the plan, just as with the traffic analysis.\nThus, the EIR discloses such metrics as demand, capacity, and utilization for 2004\nconditions and those expected in 2025. As with the traffic baseline, this is a situation\nwhere an intelligent understanding of impacts requires an analysis of likely future\nconditions in the context of current ones, just as the EIR does here. It would be absurd to\n\n                                              31\n\fask the city to hypothesize the impacts of a long-term zoning plan taking hold\nimmediately. When an area plan takes a long view of city planning, the analysis of the\nplan’s impacts should do so as well. (Pfeiffer, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1572–1574.)\n       Implicitly conceding the transit baseline does address existing conditions,\nplaintiffs also take issue with the transit baseline’s assessment that, in 2004, the\nMarket/Octavia area was “well-served.” Whatever this amorphous conclusion may\nmean, plaintiffs say it is unwarranted because the city’s own data showed transit delays\nand overcrowding on buses as a result. The data the city cites, however, comes from an\nold August 2001 report and pre-dates the EIR. Plaintiffs then cite a chart in the EIR that\nsupposedly shows Muni lacks capacity to serve existing, 2004 needs. Yet the chart\nplaintiffs cite, showing loads on North/South Muni lines, belies their claim, showing all\nMuni lines operating at 58 percent to 100 percent of capacity (two lines were considered\nat capacity, not over it).

They claim a contradiction between, on the one hand, San\nFrancisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) figures estimating 60.8 percent of\nall trips (both those internal to the city and those passing through) will be by car and, on\nthe other hand, the EIR’s claim that the project will generate approximately 35,970 daily\n“person trips” but only 10,955 “vehicles trips.” Plaintiffs divide 10,955 into 35,970 and\nget 30.45 percent trips by car. But plaintiffs are comparing apples and oranges. As noted\non page 4-208 of the EIR, one vehicle trip can amount to more than one person trip.\nMoreover, the SFCTA’s numbers are citywide and do not relate to goals and expectations\nfor the Market/Octavia plan area. As the Market/Octavia area is to have reduced parking\nand proximity to public transit, the EIR contemplates fewer vehicle trips in that area than\nin other parts of the city.\n       Plaintiffs also fault the EIR for not finding a significant traffic impact at the Van\nNess/Market intersection despite stating there would be “a 63% increase in traffic.”\nPlaintiffs mischaracterize the EIR. It actually shows traffic at the intersection would,\nwith the plan, undergo an overall increase of only 355 vehicles during peak weekday\nafternoon hours, or a 6 percent increase over the 5,610 vehicles at present. The 63\npercent figure refers not to the overall increase, but only to the portion of that increase,\n225 vehicles our of 355, due to the plan. Put another way, the plan would contribute only\n\n                                              33\n\f4 percent of the total expected traffic volume at the intersection in 2025. Furthermore,\nthe EIR notes that the Van/Ness Market intersection would operate at the same poor “E”\nLevel of Service (delay per vehicle) whether with or without the plan. Plaintiffs have not\nchallenged the Level of Service delay-per-vehicle grading rubric as a reasonable measure\nof impact, nor the underlying Wilbur Smith traffic study’s assertion that “operational\nimpacts on signalized intersections are considered significant if project-related traffic\ncauses the level of service to deteriorate from LOS D or better to LOS E or F, or from\nLOS E to LOS F.”\n       Plaintiffs cannot base a substantial evidence attack on the whole of the city’s\ncommissioned traffic analysis with such slender and unfounded complaints.\n       Nor can plaintiffs fault the city for using computerized SFCTA travel demand\nforecasting model, which incorporates data from 766 city-wide Transportation Analysis\nZones, to predict cumulative impacts to future traffic. Rialto, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ratified a similar approach and forecloses plaintiffs’ complaint that the city should\nhave based its impacts analysis on different data, such as a separate list of all projected\nfuture projects.\n              Transit Impacts\n       Plaintiffs also challenge the EIR’s conclusion of no “significant adverse impact on\nMuni service.” Plaintiffs again point to purported contradictions in the EIR to suggest\nthe EIR’s conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.\n       Plaintiffs first highlight the EIR’s claim of just 205 additional Muni riders under\nthe plan, despite the plan’s likely addition of thousands of new area residents. Plaintiffs\nimply this figure is per day, juxtaposing it with projected daily person trips, but fail to\nnote this 205 figure is actually per hour and represents only an increase in ridership at\nselected outbound rides at “screenlines.” Thus, the screenline analysis, just one of the\nanalyses related to Muni impacts, explicitly excludes “many transit trips that would travel\nto/from the Project Area [and] . . . not cross any of the screenlines.” There is nothing\n\n                                              34\n\firrational about the 205 figure or the EIR’s screenline analysis, especially given the EIR\nincludes a “corridor” analysis: “a secondary analysis” undertaken precisely because the\nscreenline analysis was not capturing project-generated trips sufficiently.\n       Plaintiffs further fault the city for ignoring SFCTA’s projection that, across all San\nFrancisco, the percentage of trips on public transit would increase from 17.2 percent in\n2000 to 19.6 percent in 2025. The EIR, however, actually operates on the assumption\nthat an even higher percentage of area trips, 21 percent, would be by transit during peak\nhours. This is because the EIR starts with the SFCTA report, but applies its general\nprincipals to the planned Market and Octavia area.\n       Plaintiffs’ citation to San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County\nof San Francisco, supra, 151 Cal.App.3d at page 78, though it notes “cattle car” status on\nMuni is an impact to address, has no bearing on the adequacy of the EIR’s transit analysis\nin this case. In that case, the city turned a blind eye to contemporaneous development\nprojects that would, in combination with the high rise under consideration, likely create a\nsignificant impacts on Muni, impacts the city’s EIR did not address. Here, the EIR, at\npages 4-224 to 4-228 justifies its conclusion of no significant impact, explaining the\nprojected increase of riders at screenlines and corridors (with the plan in 2025, as\ncompared to without the plan in 2025) would not result in Muni exceeding its capacity\nutilization standard.\n              Parking Impacts\n       There is no dispute the plan would, in all likelihood, create a parking shortfall. As\nalready mentioned, the EIR estimates parking shortfalls as high a 4,510 spaces during the\nweekday midday period and 5,640 spaces during the weekday evening period, or 2,430\nspaces during the weekday midday period and 3,050 spaces during the weekday evening\nperiod if lower vehicle ownership rates persist. It weighs these shortfall numbers (both\nwithout and with reduced vehicle ownership) against three projected supply scenarios\nunder the plan: no new parking spaces (0 new spaces), creation of the maximum allowed\n\n                                             35\n\fspaces according to zoning without conditional use permits (2,080 new spaces), and\ncreation of the maximum spaces with conditional use permits (3,160 spaces). Under\nthese three scenarios, there would be a shortfall of 1,350 to 4,510 spaces on weekdays at\nmidday and 2,480 to 5,640 spaces on weekdays at evenings. If reduced vehicle demand\noccurs, the shortfall reduces to -730 (a surplus) to 2,430 spaces at midday and -110 (a\nsurplus) to 3050 spaces at evening. The EIR also makes clear there would be a parking\nshortfall even if the city applied its general requirement of one parking space per\nresidential unit.\n       The EIR acknowledges the potential shortfall, but states while “[p]arking deficits\nmay be an inconvenience to drivers,” they “are not considered significant physical\nimpacts on the environment.” Indeed, the Court of Appeal for this district has held,\nstanding alone, “[t]he social inconvenience of having to hunt for scarce parking spaces is\nnot an environmental impact.” (San Franciscans Upholding the Downtown Plan v.

Public\nResources Code section 21060.5, which plaintiffs cite, does not say otherwise. It merely\ndefines the term “environment” to mean “the physical conditions which exist within the\narea which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals,\nflora, fauna, noise, objects of historic or aesthetic significance.” (Pub.

That case “disagree[d]” with the “broad statement” in\nDowntown Plan “that a parking shortage is merely a social inconvenience and can never\nconstitute a primary physical impact on the environment.” (Taxpayers, at p. 1051.) Yet\n\n                                            36\n\f       To be sure, however, an EIR must address secondary physical impacts triggered\nby a social impact, which, in the case of parking, might mean physical impacts on traffic\nand air quality. (Downtown Plan, supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at p. 697; Long Beach, supra,\n176 Cal.App.4th at p. 917.) The EIR, however, does weigh increased traffic and\nreduction in air quality due to some circling cars against the likelihood that many would\ntake note of the constrained parking situation and take public transit or other modes of\ntransport. The EIR concludes, quoting from the Wilbur Smith transportation study, “any\nsecondary environmental impacts which may result from a shortfall in parking . . . would\nbe minor, and the traffic assignments used in the transportation analysis, as well as in the\nassociated air quality, noise and pedestrian safety analyses, reasonably addresses\npotential secondary effects.” Plaintiffs ignore this conclusion of the city’s experts\n(Guidelines, § 15384 [allowing reliance on expert opinion]; Downtown Plan, supra,\n102 Cal.App.4th at p. 681) and offer no viable challenge to it, and no evidence to dispute\nit. Thus, there is no evidence on which to base a fair argument that anticipated parking\n\n\n\nthe court also explained Downtown Plan as dealing with the precise “special\ncircumstances” in San Francisco (the setting for this case) where there is: “a strong\npublic policy, reflected in a city ordinance, against providing private off-street parking to\nencourage the use of public transit.” (Taxpayers, at p. 1051; ibid. & fn.24 [“the Project in\nthis case is not located in a downtown area, and there is no City ordinance absolving a\nproject from providing off-street parking.

Code\nRegs. tit. 14, § 15064, subd (b) [“an activity which may not be significant in an urban\narea may be significant in a rural area”].) We see no reason to depart from Downtown\nPlan in this case.\n       Furthermore, in Taxpayers, the school district, crucially, did not obtain a useful\nmeasure of parking supply and likely increased parking demand in the project area, and\nso could not hope to meaningfully articulate impacts, direct or indirect, of a parking\nshortfall. (Taxpayers, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054 [“because District did not have\nsufficient information relating to the Project’s impact on parking and therefore could not\nadequately consider the potential significance of the Project’s impact on parking, District\nabused its discretion”].)

The CIP seeks to raise $261 million for improvement\nwithin the plan area—such as open spaces; pedestrian, vehicle, transit, and bicycle\namenities; and childcare and recreational facilities—by charging development fees of $10\nper square foot for residential development and $4 per square foot for non-residential.\nThe city’s ordinance adopting the CIP’s fundraising mechanism, however, carefully\nnoted the city was “not committing to the implementation of any particular project” as\nthere would likely be the need for proposed projects to undergo further design and\nenvironmental review. The CIP itself acknowledges the need for further environmental\nreview, acknowledging the city will have to handle the “soft costs” for that review.\n       The CIP, according to plaintiffs, concedes the plan has impacts, impacts the EIR\nignores and fails to mitigate. The CIP, in justifying its fundraising, states, for example,\nthe transition of Western SOMA into a mixed-used neighborhood with some potentially\nhigh-density parcels “will create an exponentially greater demand on city infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n. . . or make only a perfunctory or ‘skeleton’ showing in the hearing and thereafter obtain\nan unlimited trial de novo, on expanded issues, in the reviewing court.” ’ ”].)\n\n\n                                             40\n\fsystems.

Plaintiffs quote off-hand\nstatements in the CIP about “impacts,” but do not show these impacts are legally\nsignificant or that the city’s EIR failed to properly address them.

CEQA thus did not require measures to alleviate threats to open\nspace as such.”]; Long Beach, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at p. 915 [non-significant impacts\nneed not be analyzed].) They have put the cart before the horse, assuming the CIP must\nbe targeted at significant, CEQA-level impacts simply because it aims to facilitate\nimplementation of the underlying project.\n       Thus, for example, plaintiffs fault the CIP for not going far enough to mitigate\ntransit impacts—the CIP fails to call for new buses—but fail to show how the EIR’s\nconclusion on transit impacts is wrong. In fact, as we have discussed, the EIR transit\nimpact analysis is adequate.\n       Moreover, plaintiffs fault the CIP for suggesting new projects, not considered in\nthe EIR, that they claim will “remove parking” and cause other impacts, but plaintiffs do\nnot confront the fact that, as noted in the CIP, “these projects are placeholders that\nrequire further community vetting, engineering, and environmental review. Projects\ndescribed here that have not completed environmental review are placeholders used to\nestimate project costs.

If we did otherwise, we would not respect the tiering\nprocess the city has properly chosen for environmental review. (See In re Bay-Delta,\nsupra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1175 [“Under CEQA’s tiering principles, it is proper for a\nlead agency to use its discretion to focus a first-tier EIR on only the general plan or\nprogram, leaving project-level details to subsequent EIR’s.”].)\n              Traffic Mitigation\n       According to plaintiffs, the EIR offers no proposed mitigation for four admittedly\nimpacted intersections except changes to traffic signal timing, changes which the EIR\nsays may not be feasible. In fact, the EIR states, for these trouble intersections,\n“[i]mplementation of signal timing changes would be dependent upon an assessment of\ntransit and traffic coordination . . . to ensure that the changes would not substantially\naffect Muni bus operations, signal progressions, pedestrian minimum green time\nrequirements, and programming limitations of signals. [¶] As the feasibility of the signal\ntiming changes has not been fully assessed, the potential for a significant and unavoidable\nimpact [from adopting the plan] would still exist.” The city ultimately committed itself,\nin its CEQA findings, to implementing the signal changes if possible. To be\nconservative, however, the city assumed the changes would not be possible, and\nconcluded, regardless, to move forward, as set forth in its statement of overriding\nconsiderations.\n       While ideally the city would have determined the feasibility of signal changes, that\nis not what CEQA requires in this case. CEQA need not “prevent project approval in\nsituations in which the formulation of precise means of mitigating impacts is truly\n\n                                              42\n\finfeasible or impractical at the time of project approval. In such cases, the approving\nagency should commit itself to eventually working out such measures as can be feasibly\ndevised, but should treat the impacts in question as being significant at the time of project\napproval.” (Sacramento Old City Assn. v.

Rather, it informed the public of unavoidable impacts, committed\nitself to a plan of mitigation, and made it clear, in its statement of overriding\nconsideration, that it would move forward with the project even if the mitigation, when\nattempted, were a failure. CEQA’s core informational purpose was satisfied. (Cf. In re\nBay-Delta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 1162 [“The purpose of an EIR is to give the public and\ngovernment agencies the information needed to make informed decisions . . . .”].) The\ncity should not be faulted for requiring an attempt at mitigation instead of simply giving\napproval without the requirement, a course of action that would leave the project’s known\nimpacts unaddressed.\n              Wind and Shadow\n       The EIR does not, as plaintiffs contend, improperly defer mitigation of wind\nimpacts by stating, on page 4-135, “[a] determination of wind impacts would be made at\na project level . . . as specific development proposals are made.” Tiering (see In re Bay-\nDelta, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 1174–1176) is especially appropriate in this instance,\nwhere, as stated on page 4-134 of the EIR, “wind impacts from new construction are site-\nand design-specific, i.e., ground level impacts of construction of a building of a certain\nsize is more dependent on design factors such as exposure, massing and orientation than\nsquare footage.” (Italics omitted.) Plaintiffs do not challenge this conclusion.\n\n                                              43\n\f       In any case, the EIR proposes mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of new\nconstruction so ground winds speeds would not ordinarily exceed the “comfort level” of\n11 miles per hour. Exceptions could be made in some circumstances, but in no event\ncould ground wind speeds “reach or exceed the hazard level of 26 mph for a single hour\nof the year.” This 26 miles per hour threshold is also what the EIR determines, on page\n4-133, is the point at which wind would produce a significant environmental impact\nrequiring mitigation.17\n       Finally, plaintiffs fault the EIR for not proposing mitigation for acknowledged\nshadow impacts potentially resulting from new residential high rises. Yet the EIR\ncontains a multi-faceted approach to mitigating shadow impacts. First, it relies on San\nFrancisco Planning Code section 295 of the city’s planning code, which prohibits\nshadows on any open space controlled by the Recreation and Park Commission if the\nshadows would cause significant, adverse impact on use of the space. (S.F. Planning\nCode, § 295.) Second, for open spaces not under section 295’s protection, it requires\nproposed buildings over 50 feet tall to be shaped to minimize shadows. Yet the EIR\nacknowledges these measures may not be enough, and, as with traffic measures, the city\nadopted its findings and statement of overriding considerations knowing the full impact\nof its plans.\n\n\n\n\n       17\n          Though more of an “impact” argument than a “mitigation” argument, plaintiffs\ncomplain the 26 miles per hour threshold is not correct and cite provisions of the city’s\nplanning code, including section 148, which purportedly set forth the more restrictive 11\nmiles per hour comfort level as the threshold of significant impact. The planning code, to\nbe sure, adopts the 11 miles per hour comfort level, but also permits exceptions, as would\nthe EIR, for some buildings to create up to 26 miles per hour winds. (S.F. Planning\nCode, § 148.) Nowhere does the code pick either the comfort level or the hazard level as\nan environmentally significant threshold. Nowhere do plaintiffs articulate why a 26\nmiles per hour threshold, permitted by the city already under section 148, is deficient.\n\n\n                                            44\n\f        6.     Alternatives\n        “An EIR shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the\nlocation of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the\nproject but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the\nproject, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives. . . .” (Guidelines,\n§ 15126.6, subd. (a).)\n        Plaintiffs assert the EIR’s analysis of alternative options is inadequate because it\ndoes not evaluate an alternative that reduces the project’s wind, shadow, and traffic\nimpacts. The EIR, however, not only analyzes a no project alternative, it also analyzes a\n“Reduced Height/Reduced Density” alternative, at page 7-9, specifically aimed at\nproviding an option with, among other things, reduced shadow, wind, and traffic impacts.\nThe EIR discusses these reduced impacts at page 7-11 (shadows and wind) and page 7-12\n(traffic).\n        “An EIR need not consider every conceivable alternative to a project.”\n(Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd.

Rather, it is sufficient to consider a “range of\nreasonable alternatives” to a proposed project to “foster informed decisionmaking and\npublic participation.” (Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs conclusorily asset the\nEIR should have analyzed other alternatives but do not suggest a single alternative plan\nthe city might have considered that would have lessened significant environmental\nimpacts associated with the project. An agency’s selection of alternatives to consider\n“ ‘will be upheld, unless the challenger demonstrates “that the alternatives are manifestly\nunreasonable and that they do not contribute to a reasonable range of alternatives.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (City of Maywood v.

CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations\n       “No public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an EIR has been\ncertified which identifies one or more significant environmental effects of the project\nunless the public agency makes one or more written findings for each of those significant\neffects, accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for each finding. The\npossible findings are: [¶] (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or\nincorporated into, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant\nenvironmental effect as identified in the final EIR. [¶] (2) Such changes or alterations are\nwithin the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and not the agency\nmaking the finding. Such changes have been adopted by such other agency or can and\nshould be adopted by such other agency. [¶] (3) Specific economic, legal, social,\ntechnological, or other considerations, including provision of employment opportunities\nfor highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or project\nalternatives identified in the final EIR.” (Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (a).) CEQA\nfindings “shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record.” (Guidelines, § 15091,\nsubd. (b).)\n       CEQA additionally requires “the decision-making agency to balance, as\napplicable, the economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including region-\nwide or statewide environmental benefits, of a proposed project against its unavoidable\nenvironmental risks when determining whether to approve the project. If the specific\neconomic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including region-wide or\n\n                                             46\n\fstatewide environmental benefits, of a proposed project outweigh the unavoidable\nadverse environmental effects, the adverse environmental effects may be considered\n‘acceptable.’ ” (Guidelines, § 15093, subd. (a).) When this occurs, “the agency shall\nstate in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on the final EIR and/or\nother information in the record. The statement of overriding considerations shall be\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record.” (Guidelines, § 15093, subd. (b).)\n       Plaintiffs contend the city’s findings and statement of overriding considerations\nare not based on substantial evidence. In particular, they claim the city has not pointed to\nsubstantial evidence supporting the conclusion that “economic, legal, social,\ntechnological, or other considerations . . . make infeasible the mitigation measures or\nproject alternatives identified in the final EIR,” such as keeping Hayes Street as one-way.\n(Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (a)(3); Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a)(3).)\n       Yet the city provided a host of reasons in its CEQA findings to reject the Hayes\nStreet “one-way” traffic mitigation proposal, discussed in detail at pages 5-14 to 5-17 of\nthe draft EIR: the one-way street would “constrain[] pedestrian crossing at key\nintersections including Hayes and Gough, and Gough and Fell, creat[e] conditions for\nhigh-speed automobile travel through key neighborhood intersections; creat[e] an\nunfriendly pedestrian environment due to noise and pollution; and reduc[e] the tendency\nfor residents to walk for their daily needs.” The city concluded a one-way Hayes street\nwould be infeasible: economically, because it would thwart development of the desired\ncommercial district in that area; and socially, because it would reduce safety and quality\nof life for pedestrians. These conclusions are supported in part by public comments from\nstakeholders.\n       The city’s decision to reject the Hayes Street traffic mitigation measure as\ninfeasible, and, in fact, its myriad of other decisions—reflected in it 42-page findings and\nstatement of overriding considerations—to proceed with the Market and Octavia plan\ndespite known impacts, reflects not a failure to comply with CEQA but a rational\n\n                                             47\n\fbalancing of interests, albeit in a way plaintiffs dislike.

CNPS II\nholds that an alternative or a mitigation measure may be infeasible because it is\nimpractical or undesirable from a policy standpoint, “ ‘to the extent that desirability is\nbased on a reasonable balancing of the relevant economic, environmental, social, and\ntechnological factors.’ ” (Id. at p. 1001.) The appellate court approved a city’s\ninfeasibility findings “based on policy considerations, particularly the City’s interest in\npromoting transportation alternatives as well as access to its open space for persons with\ndisabilities.” (Ibid.)\n       As in CNPS II, the “appellants’ assertion represents nothing more than a ‘policy\ndisagreement with the City.’ ” (CNPS II, supra, 177 Cal.App.4th at p. 1001.) “At\nbottom, appellants’ disagreement is ‘with the nature of the balance struck between . . .\ninterests.’ [Citation.] This is not a case involving straightforward questions of legal or\neconomic infeasibility.

Supplementation of the Record\n       The final issue on appeal is the trial court’s May 12, 2009 order granting the city’s\nmotion to supplement the CEQA administrative record.\n       Plaintiffs claim the trial court granted the city leave to file 4,000 additional pages\nof administrative record without reviewing the then-current record and the city’s\nproposed supplement, and without making specific findings that the supplement was\nrelevant and truly part of the record, and without allowing plaintiffs to add further\ndocuments to the record if necessary. Believing the trial court wrongly granted the\nmotion to supplement, plaintiffs fear they may ultimately be unfairly required to pay the\ncost of preparing copies of the supplement (as requested in a bill of costs the city has\nfiled). The city’s bill of costs, though referenced in the register of actions, is not the\nappellate record, nor is any order that may obligate plaintiffs to pay these costs.\n       On this record, we cannot resolve plaintiffs’ challenge. First, without an order to\npay costs before us, our review is irreparably hindered. (See Hernandez v.
