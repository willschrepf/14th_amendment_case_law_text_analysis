Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit\nJudge NEWMAN.\n\nMICHEL, Chief Judge.\n\n      Wesleyan Company, Inc. (“Wesleyan”) appeals the decision of the Armed\n\nServices Board of Contract Appeals (“Board”) dismissing for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction its breach of contract claim against the United States.     Wesleyan Co.,\n\nASBCA No. 53896, 05-1 BCA P32,950 (April 22, 2005). Because the Board erred in\n\nconcluding that the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, § 3(a), 41 U.S.C. § 602(a) (“CDA”),\n\ndoes not confer subject matter jurisdiction over a portion of Wesleyan’s claim, we\n\nreverse and remand.\n\f                                                I\n\n          In the early 1980s, Wesleyan communicated to the United States Army its\n\nconcepts for its “FIST/FLEX” drinking system, which allows a soldier to consume liquid\n\nfrom a canteen without removing his protective mask, and its “FIST Fountain” system,\n\ndesigned to enable soldiers to fill empty canteens in a contaminated environment\n\n(collectively, “Wesleyan system”). Beginning in early 1983, and acting upon the Army’s\n\nadvice, Wesleyan sent the first of three unsolicited proposals for the Wesleyan system\n\nto multiple Army components.          The U.S. Army’s Soldier and Biological Chemical\n\nCommand, U.S. Army Soldier System Center in Natick, Massachusetts (“Natick Labs”)\n\nassumed responsibility for the analysis of the Wesleyan system. Natick Labs rejected\n\nWesleyan’s proposal in April 1983 because it did not contain a Defense Acquisition\n\nRegulation (“DAR”) legend discussing government use of the unsolicited information.\n\n          After discussions with Natick Labs, Wesleyan resubmitted the unsolicited\n\nproposal with DAR 3-507.1(a) included and executed a Memorandum of Understanding\n\n(“MoU\"), both of which prohibited the government from disclosing information in the\n\nproposal to third parties and from using the information for any purpose other than\n\nevaluating the proposal.1\n\n          1\n                DAR 3-507.1(a) reads in relevant part:\n\n          This data . . . shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not\n          be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other\n          than to evaluate the proposal. . . . This restriction does not limit the\n          Government’s right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained\n          from another source without restriction. . . .\n\n(cont.)\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                        2\n\f      After determining that the Wesleyan system was technically feasible, Natick Labs\n\nrequested in November 1983 that Wesleyan lend a prototype system to ILC Dover, a\n\nmanufacturer of protective suits and masks, for incorporation into a prototype protective\n\nsuit. The bailment agreement, executed on December 1, 1983, was silent as to the\n\nsafeguarding or use of proprietary data in the Wesleyan system, but did state that the\n\nbailment was being made “for the limited purpose” of determining “its use in\n\ndemonstrating and testing its ability to perform the intended services”. The bailment\n\nagreement expressly stated that the Wesleyan system remained Wesleyan’s property.\n\n      Beginning on May 10, 1984, the Army initiated purchases of the Wesleyan\n\nsystems, which were used in field tests at Natick Labs and other Army units, including\n\nthe Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Chemical School at Fort Leonard\n\nWood, Missouri. The Army purchased nine systems during 1984.\n\n      On January 15, 1985, the Army required Wesleyan to sign a Policy Statement for\n\ncontinued evaluation of the Wesleyan system. The Policy Statement contained the\n\nfollowing clause:\n\n             4. The voluntary submissions will be handled in accordance with\n      established Government procedures for safeguarding such articles or\n      information against unauthorized disclosure. In addition, the data forming\n      a part of or constituting the submission will not be disclosed outside the\n\n\nThe MoU reads in relevant part:\n\n      It is understood that the Department of the Army has accepted the above\n      proposal for the purpose of evaluating it and advising of any possible\n      Army interest. It is further understood that such acceptance does not\n      imply or create: . . . any relationship, contractual or otherwise, such as\n      would render the Government liable to pay for or to give up any legal right\n      or assume any obligation for disclosure or use of any information in the\n      proposal to which the Government would otherwise lawfully be entitled.\n\nTwo other unsolicited proposals were submitted at later dates.\n\n\n05-1522                                    3\n\f       Government or be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part by the\n       Government, except for record purposes or to evaluate the proposal.\n\nFollowing execution of this Policy Statement, the Army purchased an additional twenty\n\nWesleyan systems during 1985.        In January 1986, the Army required Wesleyan to\n\nexecute a second, similar Policy Statement. Following execution of this second Policy\n\nStatement, the Army purchased thirty-three systems in 1988, and sixty-eight systems in\n\n1989, for a total of 130 systems.\n\n       The Army purchases were governed by six purchase orders, all of which were\n\nsilent as to the safeguarding or use of proprietary data.       However, four of the six\n\npurchase orders stated that the purchases were being made for evaluative or\n\ndemonstrative purposes.2     In 1992, the Army completed its testing and terminated\n\nconsideration of the Wesleyan system.\n\n       Beginning in 1996, Natick Labs initiated development of the Land Warrior /\n\nModular Lightweight Load Carry Equipment system (“MOLLE”), which included a\n\nhydration system, and awarded a primary contract for MOLLE in May 1997 to Specialty\n\nPlastic Products of PA, Inc. (“Specialty”). The commercial hydration system then used\n\nin MOLLE was received poorly by users, and the Marine Corps noted that a large\n\nnumber of Marines instead were purchasing a commercially available hydration system\n\nproduced by CamelBak Products, Inc. (“CamelBak”). Specialty replaced the hydration\n\nsystem in MOLLE with CamelBak’s hydration system in 1998.\n\n\n\n       2\n               One purchase order stated that the “[i]tems are needed at the Infantry\nSchool for a limited user evaluation”, another indicated that “[t]his item is being procured\nas NDI prototypes, for initial evaluation to determine its acceptability with respect to the\nMask Drinking System SN-CIE”, a third noted that “[t]he items are urgently required for\nthe upcoming p2 NBC2 Demo in April 1985”, and the fourth specified that “[t]hese items\nare required for the upcoming Natick/HEL 1985 New Thrust Demo in August 1985.”\n\n\n05-1522                                      4\n\f      On April 15, 2002, Wesleyan submitted a claim for nearly $21 million to Natick\n\nLabs, alleging that the Army improperly disclosed Wesleyan’s proprietary data to non-\n\ngovernmental third parties, and that its proprietary information was subsequently\n\nincorporated into the CamelBak system. The Army Contracting Officer (“CO”) issued a\n\nfinal decision denying Wesleyan’s claim for lack of jurisdiction under the CDA on July\n\n19, 2002, and Wesleyan appealed to the Board.\n\n      On May 7, 2004, the Board granted the Army’s motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, holding that, to the extent any proprietary data was disclosed publicly in\n\nWesleyan’s patents,3 the Army was entitled to disseminate that information. In other\n\nwords, the Board held that all information disclosed to the Army and not taught by the\n\npatents was to be protected from third parties.\n\n      The Board also determined that the Army’s acceptance of Wesleyan’s unsolicited\n\nproposals created a contract permitting the government to use the proposal data “in\n\naccordance with the DAR legend and memoranda of understanding.” The Board then\n\nheld that the resulting confidentiality agreement applied only to the unsolicited\n\nproposals, not to the subsequent bailment agreement or purchases, and sua sponte\n\nrequested the parties to brief whether the Board possessed subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the dispute. Following the submission of briefs, the Army moved to dismiss for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the Board granted that motion on April 22, 2005.\n\n      Wesleyan appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(10).\n\n\n\n\n      3\n           Mr. Wesley Schneider, the president of Wesleyan, obtained patents on the\nFIST/FLEX and FIST Fountain systems in 1985 and 1987, respectively.\n\n\n05-1522                                     5\n\f                                             II\n\n       The sole issue on appeal is whether the pleaded contracts are covered by the\n\nCDA. Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo. Minn. Power\n\nand Light Co. v. United States, 782 F.2d 167, 169 (Fed. Cir. 1986).\n\n       We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Institut Pasteur v. United\n\nStates, 814 F.2d 624, 627 (Fed. Cir. 1987).        Pursuant to the CDA, the Board has\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over “any express or implied contract . . . entered into by an\n\nexecutive agency for—(1) the procurement of property, other than real property in\n\nbeing.” 41 U.S.C. § 602(a). “Procurement” is “the acquisition by purchase, lease or\n\nbarter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.”\n\nNew Era Constr. v. United States, 890 F.2d 1152, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n       Here, three types of agreements are at issue: the unsolicited proposals; the\n\nbailment agreement; and the purchase orders. Although the bailment agreement does\n\ninvolve, and the unsolicited proposals arguably involve, the transfer of “property”,\n\nneither involve “acquisition . . . by such means as . . . renting [or] leasing”, as Wesleyan\n\ndid not receive any value in exchange. As such, the unsolicited proposals and bailment\n\nagreement were donative in nature.\n\n       The purchase orders, in contrast, involve the exchange of property for money,\n\nand thus involve “procurement”. The Board erred by ignoring this critical exchange.\n\nAccordingly, the Board erred by categorizing Wesleyan as a “bidder”, and thus in relying\n\non our decision in Coastal Corp. v. United States, 713 F.2d 728 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In\n\nCoastal Corp., the Army had not engaged in any “procurement” activities, and had\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                      6\n\finstead cancelled a bid solicitation prior to awarding a contract. Id. at 729. We held that\n\nthe CDA “deals with contractors, not with disappointed bidders.” Id. at 730. Wesleyan,\n\nhowever, is more than a disappointed bidder. Although here, the Army had not yet\n\nawarded Wesleyan a final contract to provide the FIST/FLEX system to soldiers, the\n\nArmy had purchased FIST/FLEX prototypes for testing. This purchasing activity was\n\nsufficient to transform the Army’s relationship with Wesleyan from that of evaluator and\n\nbidder to that of buyer and seller. Accordingly, Coastal Corp. is distinguishable.\n\n       We turn now to the question of whether the information contained in the\n\npurchase orders was sufficient to constitute a procurement “contract”. The purchase\n\norders specify the parties involved, delivery instructions, price, payment terms, and\n\ntransportation instructions. No essential term is missing.4 Although Wesleyan did not\n\nsign the purchase orders, it performed, which clearly signals acceptance.            Taken\n\ntogether, the purchase orders and Wesleyan’s performance contain all essential\n\ncontract terms and demonstrate mutual assent to a procurement contract.\n\n       Thus, pursuant to the CDA, the Board possesses limited subject matter\n\njurisdiction over this suit insofar as Wesleyan’s claim involves a breach of the purchase\n\norders, which constitute procurement contracts. Because Wesleyan alleges a breach of\n\nthe confidentiality agreement, however, Wesleyan has stated a claim upon which relief\n\nmay be granted only if the confidentiality agreement was incorporated into the\n\nprocurement contracts. On remand, the Board should first determine whether language\n\non four of the six purchase orders indicating that the Wesleyan systems are being\n\n       4\n             The complete exchange between the parties is no doubt even more robust\nthan the information contained in the record. For example, oral discussions are\nreferenced on the purchase orders, and the record does not include the content of those\ndiscussions.\n\n\n05-1522                                     7\n\fpurchased for evaluative or demonstrative purposes is sufficient to incorporate by\n\nreference previously executed documents relating to the evaluative process, namely the\n\nconfidentiality provisions of the DAR legend, MoU, and Policy Statements. If the Board\n\nanswers this question affirmatively, then it may entertain only those portions of\n\nWesleyan’s complaint alleging a breach of the confidentiality agreement as incorporated\n\ninto the procurement contracts.      Accordingly, we turn next to Wesleyan’s specific\n\nallegations of breach.\n\n       Wesleyan alleges four specific instances of breach in its complaint.           First,\n\nWesleyan alleges that conceptual information disclosed to the Army’s Chemical\n\nSystems Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland (“Aberdeen Proving\n\nGrounds”) prior to the submission of its first unsolicited proposal was divulged to a direct\n\ncompetitor.   Specifically, Wesleyan alleges that “the head of the [Army] Chemical\n\nSystems Laboratory’s Mask Management Office was consulted regarding the viability of\n\nWesleyan’s hydration systems concepts” and that “[u]pon information and belief, this\n\nindividual later was employed by . . . ILC Dover, Inc.” (Compl. ¶ 11-13.) Because, as\n\nexplained above, a CDA contract would not have arisen until the Army procured\n\nprototypes, the Board does not have jurisdiction over this portion of Wesleyan’s claim.\n\n       We address Wesleyan’s second, third, and fourth allegations together.\n\nWesleyan’s second allegation is that prior to June 1985, the Army improperly disclosed\n\nand conveyed concepts from the Wesleyan system to the Battelle Memorial Institute, a\n\ncontractor at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.           Wesleyan alleges that Battelle used\n\nWesleyan’s concepts in its June 1985 report “regarding the need to improve the Army’s\n\nmask drinking system”, and further alleges that “Battelle in turn revealed Wesleyan’s\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                      8\n\fproprietary concepts to other contractors responsible for mask deployment and soldier\n\nhydration.” (Compl. ¶ 25-27.) Third, Wesleyan alleges that “in 1986 employees of the\n\nArmy’s Chemical Research and Development Center (“CRDC”) [a precedessor to the\n\nArmy’s Chemical Systems Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Grounds] released\n\nWesleyan’s proprietary information directly to employees of ILC Dover without\n\npermission from Wesleyan.” (Compl. ¶ 38.) Wesleyan explains that ILC Dover “was\n\nworking with CRDC to develop a competing concept with the FIST/FLEX device.”\n\n(Compl. ¶ 39.) Fourth, Wesleyan asserts that because Army files from the early 1990s\n\ncontained Camelbak’s brochure for its drinking system, which disclosed certain features\n\nof the FIST/FLEX design, the Army improperly disclosed to Camelbak “concepts and\n\nintellectual property contained in Wesleyan’s unsolicited proposals and in the prototypes\n\nsubmitted for testing purposes under the above-discussed bailment agreement and\n\npurchase orders.” (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\n       Because the Army purchased some of the prototype Wesleyan systems prior to\n\nthese alleged disclosures, the Board possesses jurisdiction to decide Wesleyan’s\n\nremaining allegations. As explained above, the unsolicited proposals and prototype\n\nsubmitted pursuant to the bailment agreement do not fall within the Board’s jurisdiction.\n\nTo succeed, then, Wesleyan must prove that the Army obtained the confidential\n\ninformation that it later disclosed improperly not from the unsolicited proposals, nor from\n\nthe bailment, but solely from the prototypes purchased and evaluated. In other words,\n\nto the extent Wesleyan alleges that the information disclosed improperly by the Army\n\nwas gleaned solely from the prototypes purchased by the Army, the Board may\n\nentertain Wesleyan’s claim.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                     9\n\f                                            III\n\n       Wesleyan made a strategic decision to pursue its claim before the Board, and\n\nthis forum choice has significantly limited the scope of its potential relief. Had Wesleyan\n\ndesired to pursue all allegations contained in its complaint, it could have brought suit in\n\nthe United States Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1491(b)(1), which grants jurisdiction over disputes involving “any express or implied\n\ncontract with the United States”. Indeed, because, unlike the CDA, the Tucker Act does\n\nnot require that the contract with the United States relate to procurement, the Court of\n\nFederal Claims would have possessed subject matter jurisdiction here even if the Army\n\nhad not purchased any Wesleyan systems, and had breached the confidentiality\n\nagreement solely by disclosing information contained in the unsolicited proposals and/or\n\nbailment. By opting to pursue its claim before the Board, Wesleyan limited the scope of\n\nits dispute to the CDA, and thus to the prototypes obtained through the purchase\n\norders.   Nonetheless, Wesleyan is entitled to a full and fair determination of the\n\nprocurement-related portion of its claim before the Board.\n\n                                            IV\n\n       In sum, the Board possesses subject matter jurisdiction over a subset of\n\nWesleyan’s claim. Because the unsolicited proposal and bailment agreement do not\n\ninvolve procurement, those agreements are not subject to the CDA. Accordingly, the\n\nBoard does not have jurisdiction to hear allegations of breach arising from disclosure of\n\ninformation acquired from the unsolicited proposals or the prototype loaned pursuant to\n\nthe bailment agreement.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                     10\n\f       However, the Army also purchased prototypes from Wesleyan pursuant to\n\npurchase orders containing all essential contract terms. Accordingly, that portion of the\n\ndispute arises under a procurement contract, which the Board has jurisdiction over\n\npursuant to the CDA.      Because Wesleyan asserts a breach of the confidentiality\n\nprovisions, it has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted only if the\n\nprocurement contracts at issue here—the purchase orders—incorporate by reference\n\nthe previously executed confidentiality provisions. To succeed on the merits, Wesleyan\n\nmust prove that the Army obtained confidential information later disclosed improperly\n\nnot from the unsolicited proposals, and not from the bailment, but solely from the\n\nprototypes purchased.\n\n       We thus reverse the decision of the Board dismissing Wesleyan’s claim for lack\n\nof jurisdiction, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                             REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                     11\n\fUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n\n\n                                         05-1522\n\n\n\n                             WESLEYAN COMPANY, INC.,\n\n                                                        Appellant,\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                  Francis J.

The Board of Contract Appeals has jurisdiction and authority\n\nto decide all of the asserted breaches of the confidentiality provisions related to the\n\ncontracts between Wesleyan and the Army with respect to this drinking mask. The court's\n\ndecision, separating the various steps in this relatively simple procurement, can have large\n\nconsequences for dispute resolution.\n\n       The Contract Disputes Act does not withhold from the boards of contract appeals the\n\nauthority to consider the entirety of the claim. There is no basis in the Contract Disputes\n\nAct for segregating the contract-based confidentiality obligations that were incurred at the\n\nbeginning and at the end of this procurement, from that in the middle. Many procurements\n\nstart with an offer and then a prototype and then a larger-scale evaluation, all accompanied\n\fby standard written confidentiality provisions. My concern with the panel majority's ruling is\n\nthat it parses the various stages at which the offeror provided confidential information,\n\nwhen all of these stages are part of one overall supply proposition, and are part of one\n\noverall claim.\n\n       The government required a confidentiality agreement when Wesleyan submitted the\n\nprototypes, and Wesleyan then resubmitted the prototypes with the appropriate\n\nconfidentiality notices in the form of Defense Acquisition Regulation legend 3-507.1(a) and\n\na Memorandum of Understanding. We need not decide the effect of these confidentiality\n\nagreements in isolation, for the evaluation of Wesleyan's drinking system resulted in a\n\nprocurement contract. The steps of the evaluation of Wesleyan's technology were part of\n\nthe normal negotiation process, which in this case resulted in a contract for sale; each of\n\nthe stages of the procurement were part of one overall contracting process.\n\n       The purpose of the Contract Disputes Act is to facilitate the fair and efficient\n\nresolution of contract disputes. As explained in testimony during consideration of the Act:\n\n       It is in the Government's selfish interest to be fair in its dealings with its\n       contractor citizens. Unfair procedures drive the most essential and efficient\n       contractors out of competition for Government contracts, and cause those\n       who remain, to submit consistently higher prices which neither the taxpayer\n       nor the Nation can any longer afford. The cost of diminished competition is\n       not readily measurable, but it is unquestionably huge.\n\nTestimony of Judge L. Spector, Contract Disputes: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on\n\nAdministrative Law and Governmental Relations of the Committee on the Judiciary 95th\n\nCong.

Fairness requires not\n\nonly protection of the proprietary information of contractors, but also the right to litigate the\n\nissues of proprietary information if the ensuing contract is litigated.

From the\n\ncourt's failure to recognize and authorize the Board to resolve all of the disputes associated\n\nwith the contract I must, respectfully, dissent.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                       3\n\f",

Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit\nJudge NEWMAN.\n\nMICHEL, Chief Judge.\n\n      Wesleyan Company, Inc. (“Wesleyan”) appeals the decision of the Armed\n\nServices Board of Contract Appeals (“Board”) dismissing for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction its breach of contract claim against the United States.     Wesleyan Co.,\n\nASBCA No. 53896, 05-1 BCA P32,950 (April 22, 2005). Because the Board erred in\n\nconcluding that the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, § 3(a), 41 U.S.C. § 602(a) (“CDA”),\n\ndoes not confer subject matter jurisdiction over a portion of Wesleyan’s claim, we\n\nreverse and remand.\n\f                                                I\n\n          In the early 1980s, Wesleyan communicated to the United States Army its\n\nconcepts for its “FIST/FLEX” drinking system, which allows a soldier to consume liquid\n\nfrom a canteen without removing his protective mask, and its “FIST Fountain” system,\n\ndesigned to enable soldiers to fill empty canteens in a contaminated environment\n\n(collectively, “Wesleyan system”). Beginning in early 1983, and acting upon the Army’s\n\nadvice, Wesleyan sent the first of three unsolicited proposals for the Wesleyan system\n\nto multiple Army components.          The U.S. Army’s Soldier and Biological Chemical\n\nCommand, U.S. Army Soldier System Center in Natick, Massachusetts (“Natick Labs”)\n\nassumed responsibility for the analysis of the Wesleyan system. Natick Labs rejected\n\nWesleyan’s proposal in April 1983 because it did not contain a Defense Acquisition\n\nRegulation (“DAR”) legend discussing government use of the unsolicited information.\n\n          After discussions with Natick Labs, Wesleyan resubmitted the unsolicited\n\nproposal with DAR 3-507.1(a) included and executed a Memorandum of Understanding\n\n(“MoU\"), both of which prohibited the government from disclosing information in the\n\nproposal to third parties and from using the information for any purpose other than\n\nevaluating the proposal.1\n\n          1\n                DAR 3-507.1(a) reads in relevant part:\n\n          This data . . . shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not\n          be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other\n          than to evaluate the proposal. . . . This restriction does not limit the\n          Government’s right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained\n          from another source without restriction. . . .\n\n(cont.)\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                        2\n\f      After determining that the Wesleyan system was technically feasible, Natick Labs\n\nrequested in November 1983 that Wesleyan lend a prototype system to ILC Dover, a\n\nmanufacturer of protective suits and masks, for incorporation into a prototype protective\n\nsuit. The bailment agreement, executed on December 1, 1983, was silent as to the\n\nsafeguarding or use of proprietary data in the Wesleyan system, but did state that the\n\nbailment was being made “for the limited purpose” of determining “its use in\n\ndemonstrating and testing its ability to perform the intended services”. The bailment\n\nagreement expressly stated that the Wesleyan system remained Wesleyan’s property.\n\n      Beginning on May 10, 1984, the Army initiated purchases of the Wesleyan\n\nsystems, which were used in field tests at Natick Labs and other Army units, including\n\nthe Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the Chemical School at Fort Leonard\n\nWood, Missouri. The Army purchased nine systems during 1984.\n\n      On January 15, 1985, the Army required Wesleyan to sign a Policy Statement for\n\ncontinued evaluation of the Wesleyan system. The Policy Statement contained the\n\nfollowing clause:\n\n             4. The voluntary submissions will be handled in accordance with\n      established Government procedures for safeguarding such articles or\n      information against unauthorized disclosure. In addition, the data forming\n      a part of or constituting the submission will not be disclosed outside the\n\n\nThe MoU reads in relevant part:\n\n      It is understood that the Department of the Army has accepted the above\n      proposal for the purpose of evaluating it and advising of any possible\n      Army interest. It is further understood that such acceptance does not\n      imply or create: . . . any relationship, contractual or otherwise, such as\n      would render the Government liable to pay for or to give up any legal right\n      or assume any obligation for disclosure or use of any information in the\n      proposal to which the Government would otherwise lawfully be entitled.\n\nTwo other unsolicited proposals were submitted at later dates.\n\n\n05-1522                                    3\n\f       Government or be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part by the\n       Government, except for record purposes or to evaluate the proposal.\n\nFollowing execution of this Policy Statement, the Army purchased an additional twenty\n\nWesleyan systems during 1985.        In January 1986, the Army required Wesleyan to\n\nexecute a second, similar Policy Statement. Following execution of this second Policy\n\nStatement, the Army purchased thirty-three systems in 1988, and sixty-eight systems in\n\n1989, for a total of 130 systems.\n\n       The Army purchases were governed by six purchase orders, all of which were\n\nsilent as to the safeguarding or use of proprietary data.       However, four of the six\n\npurchase orders stated that the purchases were being made for evaluative or\n\ndemonstrative purposes.2     In 1992, the Army completed its testing and terminated\n\nconsideration of the Wesleyan system.\n\n       Beginning in 1996, Natick Labs initiated development of the Land Warrior /\n\nModular Lightweight Load Carry Equipment system (“MOLLE”), which included a\n\nhydration system, and awarded a primary contract for MOLLE in May 1997 to Specialty\n\nPlastic Products of PA, Inc. (“Specialty”). The commercial hydration system then used\n\nin MOLLE was received poorly by users, and the Marine Corps noted that a large\n\nnumber of Marines instead were purchasing a commercially available hydration system\n\nproduced by CamelBak Products, Inc. (“CamelBak”). Specialty replaced the hydration\n\nsystem in MOLLE with CamelBak’s hydration system in 1998.\n\n\n\n       2\n               One purchase order stated that the “[i]tems are needed at the Infantry\nSchool for a limited user evaluation”, another indicated that “[t]his item is being procured\nas NDI prototypes, for initial evaluation to determine its acceptability with respect to the\nMask Drinking System SN-CIE”, a third noted that “[t]he items are urgently required for\nthe upcoming p2 NBC2 Demo in April 1985”, and the fourth specified that “[t]hese items\nare required for the upcoming Natick/HEL 1985 New Thrust Demo in August 1985.”\n\n\n05-1522                                      4\n\f      On April 15, 2002, Wesleyan submitted a claim for nearly $21 million to Natick\n\nLabs, alleging that the Army improperly disclosed Wesleyan’s proprietary data to non-\n\ngovernmental third parties, and that its proprietary information was subsequently\n\nincorporated into the CamelBak system. The Army Contracting Officer (“CO”) issued a\n\nfinal decision denying Wesleyan’s claim for lack of jurisdiction under the CDA on July\n\n19, 2002, and Wesleyan appealed to the Board.\n\n      On May 7, 2004, the Board granted the Army’s motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, holding that, to the extent any proprietary data was disclosed publicly in\n\nWesleyan’s patents,3 the Army was entitled to disseminate that information. In other\n\nwords, the Board held that all information disclosed to the Army and not taught by the\n\npatents was to be protected from third parties.\n\n      The Board also determined that the Army’s acceptance of Wesleyan’s unsolicited\n\nproposals created a contract permitting the government to use the proposal data “in\n\naccordance with the DAR legend and memoranda of understanding.” The Board then\n\nheld that the resulting confidentiality agreement applied only to the unsolicited\n\nproposals, not to the subsequent bailment agreement or purchases, and sua sponte\n\nrequested the parties to brief whether the Board possessed subject matter jurisdiction\n\nover the dispute. Following the submission of briefs, the Army moved to dismiss for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the Board granted that motion on April 22, 2005.\n\n      Wesleyan appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(10).\n\n\n\n\n      3\n           Mr. Wesley Schneider, the president of Wesleyan, obtained patents on the\nFIST/FLEX and FIST Fountain systems in 1985 and 1987, respectively.\n\n\n05-1522                                     5\n\f                                             II\n\n       The sole issue on appeal is whether the pleaded contracts are covered by the\n\nCDA.

Cir. 1987).        Pursuant to the CDA, the Board has\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over “any express or implied contract . . . entered into by an\n\nexecutive agency for—(1) the procurement of property, other than real property in\n\nbeing.” 41 U.S.C. § 602(a). “Procurement” is “the acquisition by purchase, lease or\n\nbarter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.”\n\nNew Era Constr. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n       Here, three types of agreements are at issue: the unsolicited proposals; the\n\nbailment agreement; and the purchase orders. Although the bailment agreement does\n\ninvolve, and the unsolicited proposals arguably involve, the transfer of “property”,\n\nneither involve “acquisition . . . by such means as . . . renting [or] leasing”, as Wesleyan\n\ndid not receive any value in exchange. As such, the unsolicited proposals and bailment\n\nagreement were donative in nature.\n\n       The purchase orders, in contrast, involve the exchange of property for money,\n\nand thus involve “procurement”. The Board erred by ignoring this critical exchange.\n\nAccordingly, the Board erred by categorizing Wesleyan as a “bidder”, and thus in relying\n\non our decision in Coastal Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422181\"><a href=\"/opinion/422181/coastal-corporation-moss-bluff-storage-venture-and-new-jersey-strategic/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed. Cir. 1983). In\n\nCoastal Corp., the Army had not engaged in any “procurement” activities, and had\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                      6\n\finstead cancelled a bid solicitation prior to awarding a contract. Id. at 729. We held that\n\nthe CDA “deals with contractors, not with disappointed bidders.” Id. at 730. Wesleyan,\n\nhowever, is more than a disappointed bidder. Although here, the Army had not yet\n\nawarded Wesleyan a final contract to provide the FIST/FLEX system to soldiers, the\n\nArmy had purchased FIST/FLEX prototypes for testing. This purchasing activity was\n\nsufficient to transform the Army’s relationship with Wesleyan from that of evaluator and\n\nbidder to that of buyer and seller. Accordingly, Coastal Corp. is distinguishable.\n\n       We turn now to the question of whether the information contained in the\n\npurchase orders was sufficient to constitute a procurement “contract”. The purchase\n\norders specify the parties involved, delivery instructions, price, payment terms, and\n\ntransportation instructions. No essential term is missing.4 Although Wesleyan did not\n\nsign the purchase orders, it performed, which clearly signals acceptance.            Taken\n\ntogether, the purchase orders and Wesleyan’s performance contain all essential\n\ncontract terms and demonstrate mutual assent to a procurement contract.\n\n       Thus, pursuant to the CDA, the Board possesses limited subject matter\n\njurisdiction over this suit insofar as Wesleyan’s claim involves a breach of the purchase\n\norders, which constitute procurement contracts. Because Wesleyan alleges a breach of\n\nthe confidentiality agreement, however, Wesleyan has stated a claim upon which relief\n\nmay be granted only if the confidentiality agreement was incorporated into the\n\nprocurement contracts. On remand, the Board should first determine whether language\n\non four of the six purchase orders indicating that the Wesleyan systems are being\n\n       4\n             The complete exchange between the parties is no doubt even more robust\nthan the information contained in the record. For example, oral discussions are\nreferenced on the purchase orders, and the record does not include the content of those\ndiscussions.\n\n\n05-1522                                     7\n\fpurchased for evaluative or demonstrative purposes is sufficient to incorporate by\n\nreference previously executed documents relating to the evaluative process, namely the\n\nconfidentiality provisions of the DAR legend, MoU, and Policy Statements. If the Board\n\nanswers this question affirmatively, then it may entertain only those portions of\n\nWesleyan’s complaint alleging a breach of the confidentiality agreement as incorporated\n\ninto the procurement contracts.      Accordingly, we turn next to Wesleyan’s specific\n\nallegations of breach.\n\n       Wesleyan alleges four specific instances of breach in its complaint.           First,\n\nWesleyan alleges that conceptual information disclosed to the Army’s Chemical\n\nSystems Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland (“Aberdeen Proving\n\nGrounds”) prior to the submission of its first unsolicited proposal was divulged to a direct\n\ncompetitor.   Specifically, Wesleyan alleges that “the head of the [Army] Chemical\n\nSystems Laboratory’s Mask Management Office was consulted regarding the viability of\n\nWesleyan’s hydration systems concepts” and that “[u]pon information and belief, this\n\nindividual later was employed by . . . ILC Dover, Inc.” (Compl. ¶ 11-13.) Because, as\n\nexplained above, a CDA contract would not have arisen until the Army procured\n\nprototypes, the Board does not have jurisdiction over this portion of Wesleyan’s claim.\n\n       We address Wesleyan’s second, third, and fourth allegations together.\n\nWesleyan’s second allegation is that prior to June 1985, the Army improperly disclosed\n\nand conveyed concepts from the Wesleyan system to the Battelle Memorial Institute, a\n\ncontractor at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.           Wesleyan alleges that Battelle used\n\nWesleyan’s concepts in its June 1985 report “regarding the need to improve the Army’s\n\nmask drinking system”, and further alleges that “Battelle in turn revealed Wesleyan’s\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                      8\n\fproprietary concepts to other contractors responsible for mask deployment and soldier\n\nhydration.” (Compl. ¶ 25-27.) Third, Wesleyan alleges that “in 1986 employees of the\n\nArmy’s Chemical Research and Development Center (“CRDC”) [a precedessor to the\n\nArmy’s Chemical Systems Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Grounds] released\n\nWesleyan’s proprietary information directly to employees of ILC Dover without\n\npermission from Wesleyan.” (Compl. ¶ 38.) Wesleyan explains that ILC Dover “was\n\nworking with CRDC to develop a competing concept with the FIST/FLEX device.”\n\n(Compl. ¶ 39.) Fourth, Wesleyan asserts that because Army files from the early 1990s\n\ncontained Camelbak’s brochure for its drinking system, which disclosed certain features\n\nof the FIST/FLEX design, the Army improperly disclosed to Camelbak “concepts and\n\nintellectual property contained in Wesleyan’s unsolicited proposals and in the prototypes\n\nsubmitted for testing purposes under the above-discussed bailment agreement and\n\npurchase orders.” (Compl. ¶ 60.)\n\n       Because the Army purchased some of the prototype Wesleyan systems prior to\n\nthese alleged disclosures, the Board possesses jurisdiction to decide Wesleyan’s\n\nremaining allegations. As explained above, the unsolicited proposals and prototype\n\nsubmitted pursuant to the bailment agreement do not fall within the Board’s jurisdiction.\n\nTo succeed, then, Wesleyan must prove that the Army obtained the confidential\n\ninformation that it later disclosed improperly not from the unsolicited proposals, nor from\n\nthe bailment, but solely from the prototypes purchased and evaluated. In other words,\n\nto the extent Wesleyan alleges that the information disclosed improperly by the Army\n\nwas gleaned solely from the prototypes purchased by the Army, the Board may\n\nentertain Wesleyan’s claim.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                     9\n\f                                            III\n\n       Wesleyan made a strategic decision to pursue its claim before the Board, and\n\nthis forum choice has significantly limited the scope of its potential relief. Had Wesleyan\n\ndesired to pursue all allegations contained in its complaint, it could have brought suit in\n\nthe United States Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1491(b)(1), which grants jurisdiction over disputes involving “any express or implied\n\ncontract with the United States”. Indeed, because, unlike the CDA, the Tucker Act does\n\nnot require that the contract with the United States relate to procurement, the Court of\n\nFederal Claims would have possessed subject matter jurisdiction here even if the Army\n\nhad not purchased any Wesleyan systems, and had breached the confidentiality\n\nagreement solely by disclosing information contained in the unsolicited proposals and/or\n\nbailment. By opting to pursue its claim before the Board, Wesleyan limited the scope of\n\nits dispute to the CDA, and thus to the prototypes obtained through the purchase\n\norders.   Nonetheless, Wesleyan is entitled to a full and fair determination of the\n\nprocurement-related portion of its claim before the Board.\n\n                                            IV\n\n       In sum, the Board possesses subject matter jurisdiction over a subset of\n\nWesleyan’s claim. Because the unsolicited proposal and bailment agreement do not\n\ninvolve procurement, those agreements are not subject to the CDA. Accordingly, the\n\nBoard does not have jurisdiction to hear allegations of breach arising from disclosure of\n\ninformation acquired from the unsolicited proposals or the prototype loaned pursuant to\n\nthe bailment agreement.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                     10\n\f       However, the Army also purchased prototypes from Wesleyan pursuant to\n\npurchase orders containing all essential contract terms. Accordingly, that portion of the\n\ndispute arises under a procurement contract, which the Board has jurisdiction over\n\npursuant to the CDA.      Because Wesleyan asserts a breach of the confidentiality\n\nprovisions, it has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted only if the\n\nprocurement contracts at issue here—the purchase orders—incorporate by reference\n\nthe previously executed confidentiality provisions. To succeed on the merits, Wesleyan\n\nmust prove that the Army obtained confidential information later disclosed improperly\n\nnot from the unsolicited proposals, and not from the bailment, but solely from the\n\nprototypes purchased.\n\n       We thus reverse the decision of the Board dismissing Wesleyan’s claim for lack\n\nof jurisdiction, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                             REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                     11\n\fUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n\n\n                                         05-1522\n\n\n\n                             WESLEYAN COMPANY, INC.,\n\n                                                        Appellant,\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                  Francis J. Harvey,\n                              SECRETARY OF THE ARMY,\n\n                                                        Appellee.\n\n\n\n\nNEWMAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n\n\n\n       I respectfully dissent. The Board of Contract Appeals has jurisdiction and authority\n\nto decide all of the asserted breaches of the confidentiality provisions related to the\n\ncontracts between Wesleyan and the Army with respect to this drinking mask. The court's\n\ndecision, separating the various steps in this relatively simple procurement, can have large\n\nconsequences for dispute resolution.\n\n       The Contract Disputes Act does not withhold from the boards of contract appeals the\n\nauthority to consider the entirety of the claim. There is no basis in the Contract Disputes\n\nAct for segregating the contract-based confidentiality obligations that were incurred at the\n\nbeginning and at the end of this procurement, from that in the middle. Many procurements\n\nstart with an offer and then a prototype and then a larger-scale evaluation, all accompanied\n\fby standard written confidentiality provisions. My concern with the panel majority's ruling is\n\nthat it parses the various stages at which the offeror provided confidential information,\n\nwhen all of these stages are part of one overall supply proposition, and are part of one\n\noverall claim.\n\n       The government required a confidentiality agreement when Wesleyan submitted the\n\nprototypes, and Wesleyan then resubmitted the prototypes with the appropriate\n\nconfidentiality notices in the form of Defense Acquisition Regulation legend 3-507.1(a) and\n\na Memorandum of Understanding. We need not decide the effect of these confidentiality\n\nagreements in isolation, for the evaluation of Wesleyan's drinking system resulted in a\n\nprocurement contract. The steps of the evaluation of Wesleyan's technology were part of\n\nthe normal negotiation process, which in this case resulted in a contract for sale; each of\n\nthe stages of the procurement were part of one overall contracting process.\n\n       The purpose of the Contract Disputes Act is to facilitate the fair and efficient\n\nresolution of contract disputes. As explained in testimony during consideration of the Act:\n\n       It is in the Government's selfish interest to be fair in its dealings with its\n       contractor citizens. Unfair procedures drive the most essential and efficient\n       contractors out of competition for Government contracts, and cause those\n       who remain, to submit consistently higher prices which neither the taxpayer\n       nor the Nation can any longer afford. The cost of diminished competition is\n       not readily measurable, but it is unquestionably huge.\n\nTestimony of Judge L. Spector, Contract Disputes: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on\n\nAdministrative Law and Governmental Relations of the Committee on the Judiciary 95th\n\nCong. First Session on H.R. 664 and Related Bills at 107 (1978). Fairness requires not\n\nonly protection of the proprietary information of contractors, but also the right to litigate the\n\nissues of proprietary information if the ensuing contract is litigated.

From the\n\ncourt's failure to recognize and authorize the Board to resolve all of the disputes associated\n\nwith the contract I must, respectfully, dissent.\n\n\n\n\n05-1522                                       3\n\f</pre>",
