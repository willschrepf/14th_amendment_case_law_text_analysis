The\nDistrict Court reversed a decision by a Pennsylvania Due\nProcess Hearing Officer that Ridley School District violated\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20\nU.S.C. 1400, et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 701, et seq. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm\nthe order of the District Court.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n       E.R., who is now ten years old, attended kindergarten\n(2006-2007) and first grade (2007-2008) at Grace Park\nElementary School (“Grace Park”) in the Ridley School\nDistrict (“Ridley”). E.R. has been identified as a child with\nnumerous learning disabilities, as well as several health-\nrelated problems, including severe food and contact allergies.\nDuring the summer between E.R.’s first and second grade\nyears, M.R. and J.R. (collectively, “Parents”) determined that\nthe programs being offered by Ridley were inadequate to\naddress E.R.’s unique needs, and thus decided to remove her\nfrom Ridley and enroll her at the Benchmark School, a\nprivate school that specializes in instructing students with\nlearning disabilities. Parents subsequently filed a complaint\nwith the Pennsylvania Department of Education, seeking\ncompensatory education for violations of the IDEA and § 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act, and tuition reimbursement,\nincluding transportation expenses, for E.R.’s enrollment in\nthe Benchmark School. A Due Process Hearing Officer\n\n                              3\n\fawarded Parents compensatory education for the 2007-2008\nschool year, as well as reimbursement of tuition for the 2008-\n2009 school year, and reimbursement for transportation to\nand from the Benchmark School. The District Court\nreversed, finding that Parents were entitled to neither\ncompensatory education nor reimbursement for tuition or\ntransportation expenses.\n\n      A.     Factual Background\n\n        Before E.R. began kindergarten, Parents were\nconcerned about her ability to grasp pre-academic skills, such\nas letters and numbers, and took her to be evaluated at the\nChester County Intermediate Unit (“CCIU”). Although the\ntesting noted some academic difficulties, the evaluators\nconcluded that E.R. did not qualify as a child with special\nneeds. However, in September 2006, shortly after E.R. began\nkindergarten, she was identified as needing extra academic\nsupport, and was placed in extended-day kindergarten\n(“EDK”). Parents were notified of this placement, and were\nadvised that it was intended to improve E.R.’s math skills and\nreinforce her kindergarten skills generally.\n\n       In November 2006, due to E.R.’s academic struggles\nand attention problems, Parents requested that Ridley perform\nan educational evaluation. Ridley agreed, and an Initial\nEvaluation Report was completed on January 31, 2007.\nAlthough the report indicated that math was difficult for E.R.,\nconsistent with CCIU’s earlier determination, Ridley\nconcluded that she did not qualify for special education\nservices because her cognitive ability and academic\nachievement levels were both in the average range. Ridley\n\n                              4\n\falso conducted an occupational therapy (“OT”) evaluation,\nwhich was completed on January 24, 2007. The OT findings,\nwhich were based largely on the input of teachers, identified\nthe following areas of concern: below grade level ability in\nmath; lack of concentration; inconsistency in remembering\nnumbers one through ten; problems with peer interaction;\npoor problem-solving skills and desk posture; and difficulty\nkeeping her place when reading.\n\n       On February 7, 2007, Ridley convened a meeting to\nreview the Initial Evaluation Report. In response to concerns\nraised by Parents at the meeting, Ridley agreed to conduct\nadditional testing using The Children’s Memory Scale, Test\nof Auditory Processing Skills, and The Behavior Rating\nInventory of Executive Functioning. The additional testing\nresulted in two addendums to the Initial Evaluation Report,\nwhich stated that E.R.’s academic skills were generally in the\naverage range, but that she demonstrated a relative weakness\nin retaining and manipulating numbers. Based on this\ninformation, the school psychologist concluded that E.R. did\nnot have a specific learning disability. Also in February\n2007, a § 504 Service Agreement (“the § 504 Agreement”)\nwas issued to provide OT services to E.R., and to address her\nsevere allergies. 1 Under the § 504 Agreement, E.R. was to\nreceive OT services once a week for thirty minutes and\nconsultative services to the home and classroom on a regular\n\n       1\n         “§ 504” refers to § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\nwhich prohibits discrimination in federally-funded programs,\nincluding public schools, on the basis of disability. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794.\n\n                              5\n\fbasis. Despite her allergies, E.R. was to be included in as\nmany activities as possible, and Parents were to be contacted\nbefore activities involving food so that appropriate\nalternatives could be provided for E.R.\n\n       Pursuant to a recommendation made by E.R.’s\nkindergarten teacher, Mary Moffatt (“Moffatt”), E.R. was\nenrolled in the Summer Steps program in the Summer of\n2007 to reinforce her academic skills. The Summer Steps\nteacher reported that E.R. made some academic progress, but\nthat she needed improvement in several areas and had\ndifficulty recognizing numbers and counting.\n\n       The first six weeks of first grade were spent reviewing\nkindergarten materials. During this time, E.R. struggled\nacademically and posted several failing grades. In late\nSeptember 2007, J.R., E.R.’s mother, wrote to E.R.’s first\ngrade teacher, Janet Cenname (“Cenname”), and requested a\nmeeting to discuss E.R.’s poor grades. Cenname declined the\nrequest to meet at that time, telling J.R. that it would be\npremature to meet so early in the year, and that it would be\nmore appropriate to give E.R. time to develop her skills.\nCenname explained that she would be “happy to meet” a few\nweeks later, in early October, if Parents still had concerns.\nParents did not re-contact Cenname, and instead requested a\nmeeting with the school’s principal. During that meeting,\nwhich was held on November 1, 2007, Parents were informed\nthat E.R. had been placed on a “reading watch list” in mid-\nOctober. Following the meeting, E.R. was placed in a\nreading support group, but according to Parents, she had\ndifficulty catching up with the other students because the\nprogram had started two months earlier.\n\n                              6\n\f       On November 16, 2007, Parents requested a\ncomprehensive reevaluation of E.R.          Ridley issued a\nPermission to Evaluate on November 27, 2007, and the\nreevaluation was completed on February 26, 2008. The\nReevaluation Report found that E.R. had learning disabilities\nin the areas of reading decoding and comprehension, math\ncomputation, reasoning skills, and written language. E.R.\nwas also found to have fine motor delays and a language\ndisability. As part of the Reevaluation Report, Ridley’s\nschool psychologist prepared recommendations to be\nconsidered by the Individual Education Planning Team (“IEP\nTeam”). Based on those recommendations, Ridley offered\ntwo alternative placements for E.R.: (1) the learning support\nroom at her current school, Grace Park, or (2) a self-contained\nclassroom at a different elementary school. Parents observed\nboth programs and determined that neither was appropriate\nfor E.R.\n\n       An IEP Team meeting was convened on March 28,\n2008 to review a draft Individualized Education Program\n(“IEP”) that had been developed to address E.R.’s educational\nneeds. At Parents’ request, Ridley agreed to make revisions\nto the IEP and submit the revisions to Parents for approval.\nAt the meeting, Ridley’s Special Education Director, Kim\nWoods (“Woods”), suggested a program called Project Read\nas a possible reading aid for E.R. Woods told Parents that she\nwould do some research on the program and follow up with\nParents and the IEP Team in a few days. Woods also\nprovided Parents with a printout from Project Read’s website,\nand a review of the program conducted by the Florida Center\nfor Reading Research.\n\n\n                              7\n\f       A Notice of Recommended Educational Placement\n(“NOREP”) was issued on April 2, 2008, but Parents refused\nto sign it until all of the agreed-upon revisions had been\nmade. Another IEP Team meeting was held on April 30 to\naddress Parents’ continuing concerns regarding the IEP. On\nMay 9, a revised NOREP was issued, and Parents signed it in\nagreement on May 12.           However, Parents remained\nconcerned about Ridley’s proposed reading program, and\nrequested that Ridley hire someone to provide instruction\nusing The Wilson Reading System. Ridley did not do so.\n\n       On May 13, 2008, in accordance with the revised\nNOREP and addendums to the IEP, E.R. began going to\nGrace Park’s “resource room” every day for one hour of\nreading assistance in the morning and one hour of math\nassistance in the afternoon. The resource room reading\ncurriculum consisted of the following instructional programs:\nRead Naturally, Reading Workshop, Writing Workshop, and\nPatricia Cunningham’s Systematic Phonics. The resource\nroom employed a program called Everyday Math for math\ninstruction. There were five other students in the resource\nroom, none of whom were first graders. Aimee Hodges\n(“Hodges”), the resource room teacher, explained that\nalthough the students were all provided with the same reading\nprograms, different parts of the programs were used for\ndifferent students, such that assistance was geared toward\neach student’s individual needs. Hodges also testified that\neverything done in the resource room was “multi-sensory,”\nwhich meant that the lessons included visual, oral, and hands-\non components. E.R.’s grades in the resource room improved\ndramatically in a short period of time, but Parents attributed\n\n\n                              8\n\fthe improvement to improper resource room assistance, and\nclaimed that E.R. was not displaying similar progress at\nhome. By the time E.R.’s first grade year ended, she had\nreceived eighteen days of resource room assistance.\n\n       On June 9, 2008, the IEP Team met to update the IEP\nfor the 2008-2009 academic year (second grade). The\nNOREP from the June IEP Team meeting recommended that\nE.R. continue to receive one hour per day of math instruction\nand one hour per day of reading instruction in the resource\nroom. The NOREP indicated that the reading instruction\nwould include a direct reading program, as well as a direct\nphonemic-based program to address E.R.’s needs in decoding\nvocabulary, fluency, and comprehension skills. The NOREP\nprovided that Ridley would train its learning support staff on\nProject Read during the summer, and that the program would\nbe “up and running” before the end of September 2008.\nRidley also agreed to pay for a summer learning program at\nthe Benchmark School, as well as summer math tutoring three\ntimes per week.\n\n       Parents researched Project Read and determined that it\nwas not appropriate for a student with E.R.’s needs. On\nAugust 14, 2008, Parents informed Ridley that E.R. would be\nenrolling at the Benchmark School for the 2008-2009 school\nyear because it provided the “intensive multi-sensory\napproach to reading” that they determined E.R. required.\n\n      B.     Procedural History\n\n      On December 4, 2008, Parents filed a due process\ncomplaint with the Pennsylvania Department of Education,\n\n                              9\n\falleging that Ridley violated the IDEA and § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act. Parents claimed that Ridley failed to\ntimely identify E.R. as a child in need of special education\nservices, failed to develop an appropriate IEP, and subjected\nE.R. to discrimination by failing to comply with the § 504\nAgreement.\n\n        Hearings were held before a Due Process Hearing\nOfficer on January 29, 2009, February 10, 2009, and\nMarch 10, 2009. At the hearings, the Hearing Officer\nreviewed documentary evidence provided by the parties and\nheard testimony from E.R.’s mother, Linda Heller, Parents’\nspecial education advocate, as well as several teachers and\nschool officials. On April 21, 2009, the Hearing Officer\nissued a written report, finding that: (1) Ridley had not\ncommitted any violations during E.R.’s kindergarten year;\n(2) Ridley violated the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act in\nE.R.’s first grade year; and (3) the IEPs proposed for E.R.’s\nfirst and second grade years were inadequate and therefore\ndenied E.R. a “free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”)\nbecause they “lacked appropriate specially designed\ninstruction in the form of a research based, peer reviewed\nreading program.” The Hearing Officer awarded Parents\ncompensatory education for the 2007-2008 year (first grade),\nreimbursement of tuition at the Benchmark School for the\n2008-2009 year (second grade), and reimbursement of\ntransportation expenses to and from the Benchmark School.\n\n      Ridley filed a petition for review in the Pennsylvania\nCommonwealth Court, and the case was subsequently\nremoved to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania. Parents treated the petition as a complaint and\n\n                             10\n\ffiled an answer and counterclaims, in which they challenged\nthe Hearing Officer’s conclusion that no violation occurred\nduring E.R.’s kindergarten year, and asserted additional\nclaims against Ridley and Cenname, whom Parents added as\na third party defendant. On October 9, 2009, Ridley filed a\nmotion for judgment on the administrative record. On\nFebruary 14, 2011, the District Court affirmed the Hearing\nOfficer’s finding as to E.R.’s kindergarten year, reversed the\nHearing Officer’s findings as to E.R.’s first and second grade\nyears, and granted Ridley’s motion for judgment on the\nadministrative record as to all claims. Ridley Sch. Dist. v.\nM.R., No. 09-2503, 2011 WL 499966, at *18 (E.D. Pa. Feb.\n14, 2011). Parents filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n       On appeal, Parents raise four arguments. First, they\ncontend that the District Court improperly placed the burden\nof persuasion on them to demonstrate that Ridley violated the\nIDEA. Second, they argue that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s finding that Ridley denied\nE.R. a FAPE during first grade by failing to timely identify\nher as a student in need of special education services. Third,\nthey maintain that the District Court misinterpreted a\nprovision of the IDEA, and improperly reversed the Hearing\nOfficer’s finding that E.R.’s IEP was deficient in that it\nlacked research-based, peer-reviewed specially designed\nreading instruction. Finally, Parents argue that the District\nCourt erred in concluding that Ridley did not violate § 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act.\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\f         II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction to review the\ndecision of the state educational agency under 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2), and we have appellate jurisdiction over the order\nof the District Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. When\nconsidering a petition for review challenging a state\nadministrative decision under the IDEA, a district court\napplies “a nontraditional standard of review, sometimes\nreferred to as ‘modified de novo’ review.” D.S. v. Bayonne\nBd. of Educ., 602 F.3d 553, 564 (3d Cir. 2010) (citations\nomitted). Under this standard, a district court must give “due\nweight” to the findings of the state hearing officer. Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982). “Factual findings\nfrom the administrative proceedings are to be considered\nprima facie correct. ‘If a reviewing court fails to adhere to\nthem, it is obliged to explain why. The court is not, however,\nto substitute its own notions of sound educational policy for\nthose of local school authorities.’” S.H. v. State-Operated\nSch. Dist. of Newark, 336 F.3d 260, 270 (3d Cir. 2003)\n(quoting MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville Cnty., 303 F.3d 523,\n531 (4th Cir. 2002)). “Within the confines of these standards,\na district court is authorized to make findings based on the\npreponderance of the evidence and grant the relief it deems\nappropriate.” D.S., 602 F.3d at 564 (citations omitted); see\nalso Shore Reg’l High Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. P.S., 381 F.3d 194,\n199 (3d Cir. 2004) (describing a district court’s burden as\n“unusual” in that it must make its own findings by a\npreponderance of the evidence, but nevertheless afford “due\nweight” to the administrative officer’s determinations).\n\n\n\n                              12\n\f       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s\nconclusions of law, D.S., 602 F.3d at 564, and “with respect\nto the question [of] whether the District Court applied the\ncorrect legal standards under the IDEA,” Shore Reg’l, 381\nF.3d at 199 (citation omitted). We review the District Court’s\nfindings of fact, including a determination as to the\nappropriateness of an IEP, under a clearly erroneous standard.\nD.S., 602 F.3d at 564.\n\n                       III. Discussion\n\n      A.     Statutory Framework\n\n      The IDEA requires states receiving federal education\nfunding to provide every disabled child with a “free\nappropriate public education.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1). 2 A\n\n\n      2\n         “The term ‘free appropriate public education’ means\nspecial education and related services that--\n\n            (A) have been provided at public expense,\n      under public supervision and direction, and without\n      charge;\n\n            (B) meet the standards of the State educational\n      agency;\n\n             (C) include an appropriate preschool,\n      elementary school, or secondary school education in\n      the State involved; and\n\n\n                             13\n\fFAPE “consists of educational instruction specially designed\nto meet the unique needs of the handicapped child, supported\nby such services as are necessary to permit the child ‘to\nbenefit’ from the instruction.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 188-89.\nAlthough a state is not required to maximize the potential of\nevery handicapped child, it must supply an education that\nprovides “significant learning” and “meaningful benefit” to\nthe child. D.S., 602 F.3d at 556 (citing Ridgewood Bd. of\nEduc. v. N.E., 172 F.3d 238, 247 (3d Cir. 1999)). “[T]he\nprovision of merely more than a trivial educational benefit” is\ninsufficient. L.E. v. Ramsey Bd. of Educ., 435 F.3d 384, 390\n(3d Cir. 2006) (internal marks and citations omitted). When a\nstate is unable to provide a FAPE, the state must reimburse\nthe child’s parents for the costs of attendance at a private\nschool that is able to provide a FAPE. D.S., 602 F.3d at 557.\n\n        The core of the IDEA is the collaborative process that\nit establishes between parents and schools. Schaffer v. Weast,\n546 U.S. 49, 53 (2005). The IEP is the “central vehicle” for\nthis collaboration, id., and the “primary mechanism” for\ndelivering a FAPE, W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 492 (3d Cir.\n1995), abrogated on other grounds by A.W. v. Jersey City\nPub. Sch., 486 F.3d 791 (3d Cir. 2007) (en banc). Under the\nIDEA, school districts must work with parents to design an\nIEP, which is a program of individualized instruction for each\n\n\n             (D) are provided in conformity with the\n      individualized education program required under [20\n      U.S.C. § 1414(d)].”\n\n      20 U.S.C. § 1401(9).\n\n                              14\n\fspecial education student. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1414(d).\n“Each IEP must include an assessment of the child’s current\neducational performance, must articulate measurable\neducational goals, and must specify the nature of the special\nservices that the school will provide.” Schaffer, 546 U.S. at\n53 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)). Although the IEP\nmust provide the student with a “basic floor of opportunity,”\nit does not have to provide “the optimal level of services,” or\nincorporate every program requested by the child’s parents.\nD.S., 602 F.3d at 557 (citations omitted); Tucker v. Bay Shore\nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 873 F.2d 563, 567 (2d Cir. 1989)\n(explaining that the IDEA guarantees to a disabled child “an\neducation that is appropriate, not one that provides everything\nthat might be thought desirable by loving parents” (internal\nmarks and citations omitted)). “[A]t a minimum, the IEP\nmust be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\nmeaningful educational benefits in light of the student’s\nintellectual potential,” Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. Bd. of\nEduc., 587 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted),\nand “individual abilities,” Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d\nat 248. See Bd. of Educ. v.

Schaffer, 546 U.S. at 53. Although state\nauthorities have limited discretion in determining who\nconducts the hearings and establishing hearing procedures,\nCongress has legislated the “central components” of the\nadministrative hearings by providing minimal pleading\nstandards, and affording all parties the right to counsel, the\nright to present evidence, and the right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. Id. at 54. “Any party aggrieved by the findings\nand decision” made in the administrative proceeding “shall\nhave the right to bring a civil action” in state or federal court.\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n        A threshold issue we are asked to consider in this case\nis which party bears the burden of persuasion before the\ndistrict court. The IDEA does not specify which party bears\nthe burden of persuasion at the district court level or at the\nadministrative hearing level. Before 2005, we had always\nplaced the burden of demonstrating compliance with the\nIDEA at the administrative hearing on the school district.\nL.E., 435 F.3d at 391 (citing T.R. v. Kingwood Twp. Bd. of\nEduc., 205 F.3d 572, 579 (3d Cir. 2000); Oberti v. Bd. of\nEduc., 995 F.2d 1204, 1219 (3d Cir. 1993)). However, in\n2005, in Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. at 62, the Supreme Court\nheld that the burden of persuasion in an administrative\nhearing under the IDEA lies with the party seeking relief.\nThe Court explained that it saw no reason to depart from “the\nordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to\nprove their claims.” Id. at 56 (citing 2 J. Strong, McCormick\non Evidence § 337, at 412 (5th ed. 1999)); see L.E., 435 F.3d\nat 391 (discussing the significance of Schaffer).\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f       However, Schaffer did not address which party should\nbear the burden of persuasion when a party aggrieved by the\ndecision of the administrative hearing officer challenges that\ndecision in district court. Nor have we explicitly decided this\nissue in articulating the district court’s standard of review.\nWe now join our sister circuits in holding that the party\nchallenging the administrative decision bears the burden of\npersuasion before the district court as to each claim\nchallenged. 3 See J.W. v. Fresno Unified Sch. Dist., 626 F.3d\n431, 438 (9th Cir. 2010); Marshall Joint Sch. Dist. No. 2 v.\nC.D., 616 F.3d 632, 636 (7th Cir. 2010); District of Columbia\nv. Doe, 611 F.3d 888, 897 (D.C. Cir. 2010). As the Supreme\nCourt noted in Schaffer, “[t]he burdens of pleading and proof\nwith regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to\n\n       3\n         Our conclusion today that the burden lies with the\nparty challenging the administrative decision is entirely\nconsistent with our previous cases, in which we held that the\nburden was properly placed on the parents before the district\ncourt. In those cases, the parents were the losing party before\nthe hearing officer and challenged the hearing officer’s\ndecision in district court. See Andrew M. v. Del. Cnty. Office\nof Mental Health & Mental Retardation, 490 F.3d 337, 345\n(3d Cir. 2007); L.E. v. Ramsey Bd. of Educ., 435 F.3d 384,\n392 (3d Cir. 2006). We did not specify, however, whether the\nparents bore the burden because they initially challenged the\nIEP (and the burden carried to the district court) or because\nthey lost at the administrative hearing level. As our decision\ntoday makes clear, the relevant consideration is the outcome\nof the administrative proceeding, not which party requests an\nadministrative hearing.\n\n                              17\n\fthe [party] who . . . seeks to change the present state of\naffairs.” 546 U.S. at 56 (quoting McCormick on Evidence\n§ 337, at 412). Under the IDEA, it is the party “aggrieved by\nthe findings and decision” of the hearing officer that seeks to\nchange the present state of affairs.         See 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2)(A).   “Absent some reason to believe that\nCongress intended otherwise,” we conclude that the burden of\npersuasion falls where it usually does, on the party seeking\nrelief. See Schaffer, 546 U.S. at 57-58; see also S.H., 336\nF.3d at 270 (explaining that factual findings from the\nadministrative proceeding are to be considered prima facie\ncorrect).\n\n        In this case, Parents argue that the District Court\ncommitted reversible error by placing the burden of\npersuasion on them as to all claims. We disagree. Although\nthe District Court did, in fact, err by placing the burden on\nParents with respect to the findings of the Hearing Officer\nthat were challenged by Ridley, the error was harmless. 4 We\nwill deem an error to be harmless if it is “highly probable”\nthat it did not affect the outcome of the case. Forrest v. Beloit\nCorp., 424 F.3d 344, 349 (3d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). In\na non-criminal case, an error regarding the placement of the\nburden of persuasion will frequently be harmless. Schaffer,\n\n       4\n         We note that Parents filed counterclaims, in which\nthey challenged the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that Ridley\ndid not violate the IDEA or the Rehabilitation Act during\nE.R.’s kindergarten year. Parents appropriately bore the\nburden of persuasion as to those claims because they were the\nparty aggrieved by the Hearing Officer’s decision.\n\n                               18\n\f546 U.S. at 56, 58. As the Supreme Court has explained, in a\nnon-criminal case, the burden of persuasion only comes into\nplay where the evidence is “closely balanced,” id. at 56, i.e.,\nin cases “in evidentiary equipoise,” id. at 58. In this case, as\nwe explain below, no factual issues are so “closely balanced”\nthat the burden of persuasion would have affected the\noutcome of the case. See id. at 56. Although some of the\ndisputed issues involve questions of fact, the Hearing\nOfficer’s errors stemmed largely from mistakes or omissions\nregarding the application of law to those facts. Questions of\nlaw, of course, are unaffected by the burden of persuasion. El\nv. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth. (SEPTA), 479 F.3d 232, 238 (3d Cir.\n2007) (stating that the burden of persuasion is the burden “to\npersuade the factfinder that one’s propositions of fact are\nindeed true” (citing Black’s Law Dictionary 190 (7th ed.\n1999))). Thus, we hold that it is “highly probable” that the\nDistrict Court’s error regarding the placement of the burden\nof persuasion did not affect the outcome. Forrest, 424 F.3d at\n349.\n\n       B.     “Child Find” Requirement\n\n        Parents contend that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s determination that Ridley’s\nfailure to identify E.R. as a child in need of special education\nservices in the beginning of first grade denied her a FAPE.\nWe disagree. “School districts have a continuing obligation\nunder the IDEA . . . to identify and evaluate all students who\nare reasonably suspected of having a disability.” P.P. v. West\nChester Area Sch. Dist., 585 F.3d 727, 738 (3d Cir. 2009)\n(citation omitted); see 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3) (explaining that\nstates must “identif[y], locate[], and evaluate[]” all children\n\n                              19\n\fwith disabilities who are in need of special education, and\nmust develop “a practical method . . . to determine which\nchildren with disabilities are currently receiving needed\nspecial education and related services”). This is referred to as\nthe IDEA’s “child find” requirement. Matula, 67 F.3d at 492.\nEach state must establish procedures to fulfill this statutory\ndirective. 34 C.F.R. § 300.111. Pennsylvania’s “child find”\nprocedures are set forth in 22 Pa. Code. §§ 14.121 through\n14.125.\n\n       Neither the IDEA, its implementing regulations, nor\nthe applicable Pennsylvania regulations establish a deadline\nby which children who are suspected of having a qualifying\ndisability must be identified and evaluated. Accordingly, we\nhave previously “infer[red] a requirement that this be done\nwithin a reasonable time after school officials are on notice of\nbehavior that is likely to indicate a disability.” Matula, 67\nF.3d at 501. 5 In adopting the “reasonable time” standard, we\nnoted the budgetary constraints and staffing pressures facing\nschool officials, and emphasized that we were not\n\n       5\n         In W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484 (3d Cir. 1995), we\nwere dealing with a challenge to a school district’s\ncompliance with child find obligations under the IDEA and\nNew Jersey law.        However, because nothing in the\nPennsylvania regulations establishes a specified timeline for\nidentifying and evaluating students, we will apply the\n“reasonable time” standard to school districts in Pennsylvania\nas well. See id. at 501 (inferring the “reasonable time”\nrequirement because neither the IDEA nor the applicable\nNew Jersey regulations established such a deadline).\n\n                              20\n\festablishing any “bright-line rule” as to what constitutes a\nreasonable time. Id. Rather, we employ a case-by-case\napproach and assess whether the school district’s response\nwas reasonable “in light of the information and resources\npossessed” by the district at a given point in time. Id.\n\n        Here, in finding that Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE by\nfailing to identify her as a student in need of special education\nservices at the outset of first grade, the Hearing Officer never\nacknowledged that Ridley must be given a reasonable time to\nidentify students as disabled. Rather, the Hearing Officer\nsimply stated that Ridley had provided a number of\nintervention programs to E.R. during kindergarten, and\nbecause E.R. continued to struggle academically in first\ngrade, Ridley should have known that further evaluation was\nrequired at the very start of the next school year. The Hearing\nOfficer was particularly critical of E.R.’s first grade teacher,\nJanet Cenname, explaining that Cenname was “extremely\nnervous and uptight” when testifying, she had to refer to\nnotes, and she frequently tried to explain her actions in a\n“non-sensical way.” The Hearing Officer concluded that,\nbased on E.R.’s struggles during the first month of first grade,\nmuch of which was spent reviewing kindergarten materials,\nCenname should have identified E.R. as a student in need of\nspecial education services at the very beginning of the year,\nand thus should have recommended to Ridley that it conduct\nanother evaluation.        Accordingly, the Hearing Officer\ndetermined that Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE “from the\nbeginning of first grade to the time that the evaluation was\ncompleted” in February 2008.\n\n\n\n                               21\n\f       As the District Court observed, the Hearing Officer’s\nfinding that Ridley violated the IDEA by failing to identify\nE.R. as a child in need of special education services at the\noutset of first grade is difficult to reconcile with the Hearing\nOfficer’s finding that Ridley complied with the IDEA during\nE.R.’s kindergarten year.         E.R. was evaluated during\nkindergarten, and although areas of weakness were found,\nE.R.’s academic skills were generally considered to be in the\naverage range. The Hearing Officer concluded that the\nkindergarten evaluation was “substantively appropriate,” and\nnoted that “just because a child has an area of weakness, it\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that [she has] a disability.” The\nHearing Officer also noted that Ridley “appeared to be\ninvested in addressing [E.R.’s] needs and providing\nappropriate instruction and interventions before rushing to\nspecial education identification.” As a result, the Hearing\nOfficer properly determined that Parents’ claim that Ridley\nviolated the IDEA’s “child find” requirements during E.R.’s\nkindergarten year “lack[ed] any basis in the testimony or\ndocuments.” 6\n\n      In light of the fact that E.R.’s kindergarten evaluations\nwere appropriate, and she did not qualify as a student in need\nof special education services in June 2007 (the end of\nkindergarten), we cannot agree with the Hearing Officer that\nRidley violated the IDEA and denied E.R. a FAPE by failing\nto immediately reevaluate her in September 2007. When a\n\n       6\n         Parents do not appeal the District Court’s decision\naffirming the Hearing Officer’s finding regarding E.R.’s\nkindergarten year.\n\n                              22\n\fschool district has conducted a comprehensive evaluation and\nconcluded that a student does not qualify as disabled under\nthe IDEA, the school district must be afforded a reasonable\ntime to monitor the student’s progress before exploring\nwhether further evaluation is required. See Matula, 67 F.3d at\n501. We assess whether a school district identified and\nevaluated a student suspected of having a qualifying disability\nwithin a reasonable time “in light of the information and\nresources possessed” by the district. Id. Here, although E.R.\nstruggled during the beginning of first grade, all prior\nevaluations showed that she did not require special education\nservices. Moreover, as Cenname testified, first grade was the\n“first time that the children ever ha[d] a chance to be in a test\ntaking situation” and “[t]here were other children that also\nhad difficulty . . . taking a test.” It was reasonable for\nCenname to assess E.R.’s progress throughout the first\nmarking period of first grade before recommending that E.R.\nagain be evaluated to determine if she had a learning\ndisability. The IDEA does not require a reevaluation every\ntime a student posts a poor grade. Accordingly, we hold that\nRidley complied with its “child find” obligations, and E.R.\nwas not denied a FAPE at the beginning of first grade. 7\n\n\n       7\n         Parents contend that the District Court did not accord\nthe proper deference to the Hearing Officer’s factual findings,\nparticularly her finding that Cenname was not a credible\nwitness. Where a hearing officer “has heard live testimony\nand determined that one witness is more credible than another\nwitness, [the hearing officer’s] determination is due special\nweight.” D.S. v. Bayonne Bd. of Educ., 602 F.3d 553, 564 (3d\n\n                               23\n\fCir. 2010) (citation omitted). A district court must accept the\nhearing officer’s credibility determinations “unless the non-\ntestimonial extrinsic evidence in the record would justify a\ncontrary conclusion.” Id. (citations omitted). Here, central to\nthe Hearing Officer’s conclusion that E.R. was denied a\nFAPE during the beginning of first grade was that Cenname\n“put off” meeting with E.R.’s mother when E.R.’s mother\nexpressed concern that her daughter had failed a math test.\nHowever, Cenname responded to E.R.’s mother’s request for\na meeting by sending back the following note:\n\n             Dear Mrs. [R],\n\n              I appreciate your concern about [E.R.’s] test,\n      but it is very early in the year. We need to give her\n      some time. Continue to work with her at home and\n      reinforce what we are doing in class. I will probably\n      be out from Oct. 2 – Oct. 15. If you still have\n      concerns at that time, I will be happy to meet.\n\n\n                              24\n\f      C.     E.R.’s IEP\n\n        Parents next contend that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s finding that E.R.’s IEP was\ninadequate. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.\nFirst, to the extent Ridley violated the IDEA’s procedural\nrequirements by failing to include the requisite statement of\nspecially designed instruction in the IEP, the violation was\nnot actionable because it did not have any impact on the\nsubstantive rights of E.R. or Parents. Second, contrary to the\nHearing Officer’s findings, E.R.’s educational plan included a\npeer-reviewed reading program, which, in conjunction with\nthe other services that E.R. was scheduled to receive, was\nsufficient to provide a FAPE. We will discuss these points in\nturn.\n\n                              1.\n\n       An IEP must consist of a detailed written statement\narrived at by a multi-disciplinary team specifying the\n\n        Thus, contrary to Parents’ suggestions, Cenname did\nnot refuse to meet or indicate that a meeting was unnecessary.\nShe expressed a clear willingness to meet, and simply told\nParents that E.R. should be given some time to get her\nbearings. Parents never responded to this note and never met\nwith Cenname to discuss E.R.’s academic struggles.\nTherefore, as the District Court found, non-testimonial\nevidence in the record demonstrates that Cenname’s response\nto Parents’ request for a meeting was entirely reasonable, and\nthat it in no way resulted in the denial of a FAPE. See D.S.,\n602 F.3d at 564.\n\n                             25\n\fservices, including specially designed instruction, that the\nchild will receive. Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate\nUnit 16, 853 F.2d 171, 173 (3d Cir. 1988). Parents contend\nthat they are entitled to compensatory education because the\nIEP developed by Ridley failed to set forth in sufficient detail\nthe specially designed instruction that would be provided to\nE.R. Parents acknowledge that subsequent NOREPs issued\nby Ridley included the required specially designed\ninstruction, but they nevertheless argue that the IDEA\nrequires that such information be included in the body of the\ninitial IEP. 8\n\n        Parents’ argument presents a challenge to Ridley’s\ncompliance with the IDEA’s procedural requirements.\nAlthough we have held that “[t]he content of an IEP . . . does\nnot implicate the IDEA’s procedural requirements for content\nis concerned with the IEP’s substance,” D.S., 602 F.3d at 565,\nParents’ argument here does not relate to the substance of the\nIEP. Rather, Parents’ argument is essentially that Ridley\nviolated the IDEA by including a description of specially\ndesigned instruction in the wrong document. We have made\nclear that although it is important that a school district comply\nwith the IDEA’s procedural requirements, compliance is not a\ngoal in itself; rather, compliance with such procedural\nrequirements is important because of the “requirements’\nimpact on students’ and parents’ substantive rights.” Id.\n\n       8\n        Although the District Court did not address this issue,\nParents raised it in their brief before the District Court, and\nthus preserved it for review. See Chambers v. Sch. Dist. of\nPhila. Bd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176, 183-84 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n                               26\n\fAccordingly, “[a] procedural violation is actionable under the\nIDEA only if it results in a loss of educational opportunity for\nthe student, seriously deprives parents of their participation\nrights, or causes a deprivation of educational benefits.” Id.\n(citing Winkelman v. Parma City Sch. Dist., 550 U.S. 516,\n525-26 (2007)) (second citation omitted).\n\n       Here, to the extent that the absence of specially\ndesigned instruction in the IEP constituted a procedural\nviolation, it did not affect the substantive rights of E.R. or\nParents, and thus does not entitle Parents to an award of\ncompensatory education. See id. Although Parents correctly\nnote that the initial IEP did not specify all of the special\neducation services that E.R. would receive, subsequent\nNOREPs contained that information. A NOREP issued on\nMay 9, 2008, provided that the educational placement\nrecommended for E.R. was “[r]esource room learning support\nfor math and reading in which a direct reading program will\nbe done as well as a direct phonemic based program to\naddress [E.R.’s] needs in decoding vocabulary, fluency and\ncomprehension skills.” The May NOREP further stated that\nE.R. would receive “at least 60 minutes per day instruction\nfor reading and at least 60 minutes per day math at Grace\nPark Elementary School until June 2008.” The NOREP\nindicated that an IEP Team meeting would be convened in\nJune to review E.R.’s progress and discuss the\nimplementation of Project Read for the 2008-2009 school\nyear. Parents signed and approved the May NOREP. On\nJune 9, 2008, Ridley issued a second NOREP, which\nexplained that Ridley would provide training to its staff on\nProject Read during the summer and the program would be\n\n\n                              27\n\fup and running before the end of September 2008. Until\nProject Read could be implemented, Ridley would continue\nto use the other resource room reading programs. The June\nNOREP was never signed by Parents due to their objection to\nProject Read.\n\n       Because detailed specially designed instruction was set\nforth in the NOREPs, it is properly considered part of E.R.’s\noverall educational plan. Ridley’s admitted “mistake” in\nfailing to include such information in the IEP itself did not\ndeny E.R. any educational opportunity, nor did it deprive her\nof any educational benefits. See D.S., 602 F.3d at 565.\nMoreover, Parents were intimately involved in the process of\ncrafting E.R.’s IEP and do not contend that they were\nunaware of the services E.R. was scheduled to receive. Thus,\nthey were not denied their participation rights. See id.\nAccordingly, any deficiency in Ridley’s compliance with the\nprocedural requirements of the IDEA is not a basis for\ngranting relief to Parents. Whether the specially designed\ninstruction set forth in the IEP and the NOREPs was adequate\nto provide a FAPE is a separate question, which we will\naddress next.\n\n                              2.\n\n       Parents’ next argument presents an issue of first\nimpression in this circuit. The Hearing Officer found that\nE.R.’s IEP was inadequate, both for the end of the 2007-2008\nschool year (first grade), and all of the 2008-2009 school year\n(second grade) primarily because it “fail[ed] to provide a\nscientifically research-based, peer reviewed reading program,\nwhich [E.R.] needed in order to make meaningful progress.”\n\n                              28\n\fThe Hearing Officer stated that although Project Read, the\nreading program chosen for E.R., “was designed to be\nresearch based,” there were “flaws in the research supporting\nit.” These statements were made in conclusory fashion,\nwithout elaboration, in a footnote of the Hearing Officer’s 20-\npage opinion. They were not well-explained or well-\nsupported.\n\n       The District Court reversed the Hearing Officer’s\ndecision that the IEP was inappropriate, reasoning that the\nlack of a peer-reviewed instructional program was not\nautomatically fatal to an IEP, and even if it was, Project Read\nwas research-based and peer-reviewed. On appeal, we need\nnot decide whether the lack of a peer-reviewed reading\nprogram alone may result in the denial of a FAPE because we\nagree with the District Court that Project Read was based on\npeer-reviewed research. We will, however, consider Parents’\ncontentions that Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE because the\navailable research regarding Project Read was flawed and did\nnot adequately demonstrate that Project Read would be\neffective for a student with E.R.’s learning disabilities. As we\nexplain below, Parents’ arguments are unavailing; the peer-\nreviewed specially designed reading instruction in E.R.’s IEP\nwas “reasonably calculated to enable [her] to receive\nmeaningful educational benefits in light of [her] intellectual\npotential.” Chambers, 587 F.3d at 182 (citation omitted).\nRidley was not required to choose the reading program based\non the optimal level of peer-reviewed research, or to\nimplement the specific program requested by Parents.\n\n       We begin our analysis by reviewing the statutory\nprovision at issue. In 2004, Congress added the following\n\n                              29\n\fprovision to the IDEA: “[t]he term ‘individualized education\nprogram’ or ‘IEP’ means a written statement for each child\nwith a disability . . . that includes . . . a statement of the\nspecial education and related services and supplementary aids\nand services, based on peer-reviewed research to the extent\npracticable, to be provided to the child.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) (emphasis added). This provision was\nincorporated into the revised IDEA regulations in 2006,\nwhich state that an IEP “must include . . . [a] statement of the\nspecial education and related services and supplementary aids\nand services, based on peer-reviewed research to the extent\npracticable, to be provided to the child.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.320(a)(4). Congress amended the IDEA in 1997 and\n2004, in part, to respond to concerns that the statute “ha[d]\nbeen impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus\non applying replicable research on proven methods of\nteaching and learning for children with disabilities.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1400(c)(4). The IDEA’s statement of congressional\nfindings explains that “[a]lmost 30 years of research and\nexperience has demonstrated that the education of children\nwith disabilities can be made more effective by” training\nteachers on “the use of scientifically based instructional\npractices, to the maximum extent possible,” and providing\nincentives for “scientifically based early reading programs.”\nId. § 1400(c)(5)(E) and (F).\n\n       Unfortunately, neither the text of the IDEA nor the\nIDEA regulations provide much guidance as to the effect of\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)’s peer-reviewed research provision in\nthis case. Therefore, we will look to other instructive\nregulatory materials. See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 462\n\n\n                              30\n\f(1997) (explaining that when interpreting a statute and its\nimplementing regulations, we may look to the agency’s\ninterpretation of its own regulations); United States v.\nOccidental Chem. Corp., 200 F.3d 143, 151-52 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(stating that we must defer not only to interpretations\nsupported by notice-and-comment rulemaking, but also\n“informal interpretations”); Cleary v. Waldman, 167 F.3d\n801, 808 (3d Cir. 1999) (“[I]f an agency has been granted\nadministrative authority by Congress for a statute, its\ninterpretation—despite arising in an informal context—will\nbe given deference as long as it is consistent with other\nagency pronouncements and furthers the purposes of the\nAct.”). In conjunction with its promulgation of the 2006\nIDEA regulations, the U.S. Department of Education\n(“DOE”) issued an Analysis of Comments and Changes to the\n2006 IDEA Regulations (“Analysis of IDEA Regulations”),\n71 Fed. Reg. 46,540 (2006). In response to a comment\nrequesting “clear guidance on the responsibilities of States,\nschool districts, and school personnel to provide special\neducation and related services . . . that are based on peer-\nreviewed research,” the DOE stated that “States, school\ndistricts, and school personnel must . . . select and use\nmethods that research has shown to be effective, to the extent\nthat methods based on peer-reviewed research are available.”\n71 Fed. Reg. at 46,665. The agency made clear, however,\nthat a student’s IEP team retains flexibility in devising an\nappropriate program. The Analysis of IDEA Regulations\nexplained that the changes implemented by the 2004 IDEA\namendments and the 2006 updated regulations\n\n\n\n\n                             31\n\f       “do[] not mean that the service with the greatest\n       body of research is the service necessarily\n       required for a child to receive FAPE. Likewise,\n       there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the\n       failure of a public agency to provide services\n       based on peer-reviewed research would\n       automatically result in a denial of FAPE. The\n       final decision about the special education and\n       related services . . . that are to be provided to a\n       child must be made by the child’s IEP Team\n       based on the child’s individual needs.”\n\nId.\n\n       In response to a comment requesting that the DOE\nrequire programs provided to a disabled child to be research-\nbased with demonstrated effectiveness in addressing the\nparticular needs of a child, the Analysis of IDEA Regulations\nstated, “[w]hile the Act clearly places an emphasis on\npractices that are based on scientific research, there is nothing\nin the Act that requires all programs provided to children with\ndisabilities to be research-based with demonstrated\neffectiveness in addressing the particular needs of a child\nwhere not practicable.” Id. The DOE declined to adopt the\nrecommended change because “ultimately, it is the child’s\nIEP Team that determines the special education and related\nservices that are needed by the child in order for the child to\nreceive FAPE.” Id. The DOE also rejected as “overly\nburdensome” a requirement that all IEP team meetings\ninclude a focused discussion of research-based methods and a\nproposed regulation that would force schools to provide\n\n\n                               32\n\fwritten notice when an IEP team does not provide\ndocumentation of research-based methods. Id. 9\n\n        We can discern two key principles from these\nadministrative materials and our prior decisions interpreting\nthe IDEA. First, although schools should strive to base a\nstudent’s specially designed instruction on peer-reviewed\nresearch to the maximum extent possible, the student’s IEP\nteam retains flexibility to devise an appropriate program, in\nlight of the available research. See D.S., 602 F.3d at 557; 71\nFed. Reg. at 46,665. Second, under the IDEA, courts must\naccord significant deference to the choices made by school\nofficials as to what constitutes an appropriate program for\neach student. See D.S., 602 F.3d at 556-57; Ridgewood Bd. of\nEduc., 172 F.3d at 247; 71 Fed. Reg. at 46,664-65.\n\n       With these principles in mind, we will consider the\ntwo objections that Parents raise to the portion of E.R.’s IEP\nthat addresses her reading and language disabilities. First,\nechoing the findings of the Hearing Officer, Parents argue\nthat “there were flaws in the research [regarding the\n      9\n         Commenters also requested a more explicit definition\nof “peer-reviewed research.” The DOE stated that “‘[p]eer\nreviewed research’ generally refers to research that is\nreviewed by qualified and independent reviewers to ensure\nthat the quality of the information meets the standards of the\nfield before the research is published.” 71 Fed. Reg. 46,540,\n46,664 (2006). However, the agency made clear that there\nwas no single definition of “peer-reviewed research” and it\ndeclined to include a specific definition for purposes of the\nIDEA. Id.\n\n                             33\n\feffectiveness of Project Read] which made it impossible to\nattribute the reading growth the students experienced [in the\nstudies] to Project Read alone.” Second, they contend that\nnone of the studies regarding Project Read demonstrated that\nthe program was effective for students with E.R.’s specific\ndisabilities. Both arguments miss the mark. Given that the\nIDEA does not require an IEP to provide the “optimal level of\nservices,” D.S., 602 F.3d at 557 (citations omitted), we\nlikewise hold that the IDEA does not require a school district\nto choose the program supported by the optimal level of peer-\nreviewed research. Rather, the peer-reviewed specially\ndesigned instruction in an IEP must be “reasonably calculated\nto enable the child to receive meaningful educational benefits\nin light of the student’s intellectual potential.” Chambers,\n587 F.3d at 182 (citation omitted).\n\n       According to a 2007 review of Project Read published\nby the Florida Center for Reading Research (“FCRR”):\n\n      “Project Read is a comprehensive language arts\n      program designed to provide explicit instruction\n      in a structured reading curriculum. The goal of\n      the program is to help all students become\n      thoughtful, purposeful, and independent\n      readers. Project Read Curriculum may be\n      implemented in the regular classroom, special\n      education classes, and Title I classes. It may\n      also be used as an intervention reading program\n      for first through sixth graders or with\n      adolescents and adults who struggle with\n      reading or language learning. Whole or small\n      group instruction is delivered by a classroom\n\n                             34\n\f      teacher, a special education teacher, or a\n      reading teacher. Lessons are intended to occur\n      daily within an extended block of time devoted\n      to reading instruction. Emphasis is placed on\n      systematic, direct instruction of concepts and\n      skills supported and enhanced by a teaching\n      approach that includes visual, kinesthetic,\n      auditory and tactile strategies (VAKT), and the\n      use of body language.”\n\nAfter discussing several studies on the effectiveness of\nProject Read, and citing relevant articles, at least one of\nwhich was published in a peer-reviewed journal, the FCRR\nreview concluded that the research “[was] promising and the\ninstructional strategies of Project Read [we]re aligned with\ncurrent research. Future studies with sound experimental\ndesigns including control groups and random assignment may\ncontribute more definitive information about the efficacy of\nProject Read.” The FCRR review then listed numerous\nstrengths of the Project Read program, and found no\nweaknesses in Project Read’s curriculum.\n\n       We understand Parents’ concern that the available\nstudies did not test Project Read’s effectiveness for students\nwith E.R.’s unique combination of disabilities. However, the\nresearch discussed in the FCRR review involved children of\nE.R.’s age who struggled with reading, and indicated that\nProject Read was helpful in improving the reading skills of\nsuch students. Additionally, Hodges, Grace Park’s resource\nroom teacher, and Woods, Ridley’s director of special\neducation, both of whom have expertise in the field of special\neducation, testified that Project Read was an appropriate\n\n                             35\n\freading program for E.R. 10 Woods explained that, “Project\nRead is a multi-sensory program that is based on Orton\nGillingham’s principles that support learning disabled\nstudents. The research from Florida was very promising in\nterms of these students doing quite well.” Woods further\ntestified that “[t]he program . . . had a lot of components that\nlearning disabled students learn by [including] what we called\nVAKT program, visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and touch. And\nmost learning disabled students do very well when you bring\nall of the senses into the learning process.” Hodges also\ntestified that Project Read was a research-based program and\nsimilar to other reading programs, such as The Wilson\nReading System.\n\n       Parents argue that, in contrast to Project Read, the\nprogram they requested, The Wilson Reading System, has\nbeen shown to be effective for teaching students with learning\ndisabilities similar to those of E.R. However, Ridley did not\nhave to choose the specific program requested by Parents.\nSee D.S., 602 F.3d at 557. Nor did it have to choose the\nprogram supported by the optimal level of peer-reviewed\nresearch. See id.; 71 Fed. Reg. at 46,665 (explaining that a\nschool does not have to choose the program supported by the\n“greatest body of research”). “The IDEA accords educators\ndiscretion to select from various methods for meeting the\nindividualized needs of a student, provided those practices are\nreasonably calculated to provide h[er] with educational\nbenefit.” R.P. v. Prescott Unified Sch. Dist., 631 F.3d 1117,\n\n       10\n         The Hearing Officer did not discuss the assessments\nof Project Read provided by Hodges and Woods.\n\n                              36\n\f1122 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted); see Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 207 (explaining that school districts have “[t]he primary\nresponsibility for formulating the education to be accorded a\nhandicapped child, and for choosing the educational method\nmost suitable to the child’s needs”). In selecting special\neducation programs, a school district must be able to take into\naccount not only the needs of the disabled student, but also\nthe financial and administrative resources that different\nprograms will require, and the needs of the school’s other\nnon-disabled students. See J.D. v. Pawlet Sch. Dist., 224 F.3d\n60, 70 (2d Cir. 2000) (explaining that, in the context of the\nRehabilitation Act, courts must be aware of the “need to\nstrike a balance” between the rights of the disabled student\nand fiscal and administrative concerns); 71 Fed. Reg. at\n46,665 (rejecting a proposed requirement on an IEP team as\n“overly burdensome”).\n\n       We will not set forth any bright-line rule as to what\nconstitutes an adequately peer-reviewed special education\nprogram; hearing officers and reviewing courts must continue\nto assess the appropriateness of an IEP on a case-by-case\nbasis, taking into account the available research. We\nrecognize that there may be cases in which the specially\ndesigned instruction proposed by a school district is so at\nodds with current research that it constitutes a denial of a\nFAPE. See, e.g., Waukee Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. D.L., No. 07-\n00278, 51 IDELR 15 (LRP) (S.D. Iowa Aug. 7, 2008)\n(explaining that a student was denied a FAPE, in part,\nbecause the school district frequently employed strategies\nwhich contradicted the relevant research and were even\ninconsistent with the school’s own assessment of the\n\n\n                              37\n\fappropriate program for the student). 11 Additionally, if it is\npracticable for a school district to implement a program based\nupon peer-reviewed research, and the school fails to do so,\nthat will weigh heavily against a finding that the school\nprovided a FAPE. However, that is not the case here. Ridley\nrelied on available peer-reviewed research in crafting the IEP\nfor E.R., and proposed a program with specially designed\ninstruction that was “reasonably calculated” to enable her to\nachieve meaningful educational benefits in light of her\nintellectual potential and individual abilities. See Rowley,\n458 U.S. at 207. Thus, we conclude that the District Court\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          The IDEA’s peer-reviewed research requirement is\nnot set forth in isolation; it is part of a broader section\ndiscussing the content of the IEP, which requires “a statement\nof the special education and related services . . . that will be\nprovided for the child” to meet certain specified objectives,\nnamely “to advance appropriately toward attaining the\nannual goals[,]” “to be involved in and make progress in the\ngeneral education curriculum . . . and to participate in\nextracurricular and other nonacademic activities[,]” and “to\nbe educated and participate with other children with\ndisabilities and nondisabled children in” educational\nactivities. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV).\n\n\n                              38\n\fproperly reversed the Hearing Officer’s finding that the IEP\nwas inadequate to provide a FAPE. 12\n\n\n      12\n            The Hearing Officer also awarded Parents\ncompensatory education for the end of the 2007-2008 school\nyear, despite the fact that Project Read was not yet\nimplemented, and Ridley was continuing to use its existing\n“resource room” reading program. The Hearing Officer did\nnot explain this conclusion, and based on the record, we\ncannot agree. Pursuant to E.R.’s IEP and the May NOREP,\nboth of which Parents agreed to, for the last eighteen days of\nfirst grade, E.R. received one hour of reading instruction in\nthe resource room. The resource room reading curriculum\nconsisted of Reading Naturally, Reading Workshop, Writing\nWorkshop, and Patricia Cunningham’s Systematic Phonics.\nHodges testified that although the same programs were used\nfor all students in the resource room, she tailored the\nprograms to each student’s individual needs. Moreover,\nE.R.’s evaluations all indicated that she would benefit from\nmulti-sensory learning, and Hodges explained that all\nactivities done in the resource room were multi-sensory. She\nalso explained that “all of the research points to a balanced\nliteracy program which is hammering away at phonemic\nawareness, phonics, comprehension, fluency, and vocabulary.\nAnd with the repertoire that we were using throughout the\nweek, I think we hit all those schools.” We can find no\nevidence in the record that rebuts this testimony. In light of\nthe fact that reviewing courts must be mindful not to\nsubstitute their views of what constitute preferable\neducational methods for those of school officials, who have\n\n                             39\n\f       D.     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n        Parents next contend that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s determination that Ridley\nviolated § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act during E.R.’s first\ngrade year. We disagree. The Rehabilitation Act provides\nthat “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . .\nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded\nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination” under any program that receives\nfederal funds. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). This prohibition was\nextended to public school systems through § 504. Id.\n§ 794(b)(2)(B). To establish a violation of § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, Parents were required to prove that\n(1) E.R. was disabled; (2) she was “otherwise qualified” to\nparticipate in school activities; (3) Ridley received federal\nfinancial assistance; and (4) E.R. was excluded from\nparticipation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to\n\n\nexpertise in the area, D.S., 602 F.3d at 564, we agree with the\nDistrict Court that the Hearing Officer erred in determining\nthat Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE during the end of first grade.\n\n       Because we hold that the resource room instruction\nprovided during the end of the 2007-2008 school year was\nsufficient to provide a FAPE, we likewise hold that the\nHearing Officer erred in finding that the IEP was inadequate\nfor September 2008 (the first month of second grade). The\nsame programs that were used during the end of first grade\nwere scheduled to be used in September, until Project Read\nwas ready to be implemented.\n\n                               40\n\fdiscrimination at Ridley. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d\nat 253. Here, the parties dispute only the fourth element.\n\n       As we have explained, § 504’s “negative prohibition”\nis similar to the IDEA’s “affirmative duty” and also requires\nschools that receive federal financial assistance to “provide a\nfree appropriate public education to each qualified\nhandicapped person who is in the recipient’s jurisdiction.”\nMatula, 67 F.3d at 492-93 (quoting 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a)).\nTo offer an “appropriate” education under the Rehabilitation\nAct, a school district must reasonably accommodate the needs\nof the handicapped child so as to ensure meaningful\nparticipation in educational activities and meaningful access\nto educational benefits. See J.D., 224 F.3d at 70 (citing\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300 n.20 (1985)); D.S.,\n602 F.3d at 556 (explaining that under the IDEA, a state must\nsupply an education that provides “significant learning” and\n“meaningful benefit”) (citation omitted); Ridgewood Bd. of\nEduc., 172 F.3d at 253. 13 However, § 504 does not mandate\n“substantial” changes to the school’s programs, Se. Cmty.\nColl. v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 405 (1979), and courts “should\nbe mindful of the need to strike a balance between the rights\nof the student and h[er] parents and the legitimate financial\n\n       13\n            The regulations implementing § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act state: “the provision of an appropriate\neducation is the provision of regular or special education and\nrelated aids and services that (i) are designed to meet\nindividual educational needs of handicapped persons as\nadequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met.\n. . .” 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(b)(1).\n\n                              41\n\fand administrative concerns of the [s]chool [d]istrict,” J.D.,\n224 F.3d at 70-71 (internal marks and citation omitted). But\n“[t]he fact that it is more convenient, either administratively\nor fiscally, to provide services in a segregated manner, does\nnot constitute a valid justification for separate or different\nservices.” Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 338 (3d Cir.\n1995) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 485, reprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 473).\n\n        In June 2006, prior to E.R.’s kindergarten year, Ridley\nprepared an Allergy Treatment Plan, which alerted school\nstaff to E.R.’s allergies and the signs of an allergic reaction,\nand explained how school officials should react if E.R. were\nto have an allergic reaction. In February 2007, a § 504\nService Agreement was implemented to further address\nE.R.’s health issues. The Service Agreement reflected\nParents’ request that E.R. be included in as many activities as\npossible, and provided that because E.R. was “only to eat\nfoods provided by parents,” Parents were to be contacted\nbefore activities involving shared food so that appropriate\nalternatives could be provided. The Service Agreement also\nrequired all students in the classroom to wash their hands\nbefore and after meals, required E.R. to wash her hands after\ntouching physical education or OT equipment, mandated that\nE.R. wear gloves provided by Parents when handling glue,\nand provided that E.R. would only use supplies and utensils\nprovided by Parents.\n\n       Parents allege that Cenname “stubbornly and\npersistently” refused to implement the Service Agreement,\nwhich led to E.R. being “singled out, isolated and denied full\nparticipation with her classroom peers.” The Hearing Officer\n\n                              42\n\fcited the following incidents as evidence of Ridley’s\ndiscrimination against E.R. First, as part of a “Clifford the\nDog” celebration, E.R.’s classmates were given brownies\nwith red icing and red juice, but because E.R.’s allergies\nprevented her from eating that food, she was given a cupcake\nfrom the nurse’s freezer that had been provided by her\nmother. Second, a program on nutrition was offered, along\nwith a specific snack. Although Parents were notified of the\nprogram in advance, they were not told what the snack would\nbe, and therefore, E.R. ended up having to eat a snack from\nhome. Third, according to E.R.’s mother, Cenname cancelled\nan Earth Day project rather than design an alternative snack\nfor E.R. E.R.’s mother testified that Cenname commented\nthat she did not understand why the other students in class\nshould have to accommodate one child when E.R.’s parents\ncould provide separate food. Fourth, due to her allergies,\nE.R. was required to wear loose cotton clothes. E.R.’s mother\ntestified that she often had difficulty locating reasonably\npriced clothing that complied with Ridley’s dress code: green\nshirts, khaki pants, and a white sweater. Despite this\ndifficulty, on two occasions, Cenname remarked to E.R. that\nher clothes were not in compliance with the dress code, which\naccording to Parents, caused E.R. to “feel[] humiliated.”\nFifth, students in E.R.’s first grade class participated in an\nactivity in which they worked with partners to sift sand,\npebbles, and gravel, and compare the various shapes and\nsizes. Due to her severe allergies, E.R. was not permitted to\ntouch dirt without using gloves. Cenname testified that she\nhad forgotten about the sand activity when preparing her\nupdate to E.R.’s mother, and thus, was unsure whether E.R.\ncould touch any of the materials. “To be safe,” Cenname\n\n\n                             43\n\finstructed E.R. to let her partner handle the materials, but\nE.R. was allowed to participate in the project in every other\nway. Finally, E.R. was given several poor grades on\npenmanship tests. Parents blame this on Cenname’s failure to\nnotice that E.R.’s chair did not allow her to brace herself for\nwriting tasks.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that although each of\nthese incidents “may illustrate how E.R.’s daily school\nroutine necessarily had to be different than her classmates,”\nthey do not constitute § 504 violations. Ridley, 2011 WL\n499966, at *17. There is no evidence in the record that E.R.\nwas excluded from participation in educational activities,\ndenied educational benefits, or otherwise subjected to\ndiscrimination. See Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d at 253.\nE.R. was not denied meaningful participation in the food-\nrelated activities; she simply had to eat something slightly\ndifferent than the food eaten by her classmates. Parents argue\nthat Cenname could have complied with the Rehabilitation\nAct by allowing E.R.’s mother to prepare snacks for the entire\nclass that were suitable to E.R.’s dietary needs. The statute\nsimply does not require that. See Davis, 442 U.S. at 410\n(explaining that the Rehabilitation Act distinguishes “between\nthe evenhanded treatment of qualified handicapped persons\nand affirmative efforts to overcome the disabilities caused by\nhandicaps”). Similarly, E.R. was not denied the educational\nbenefit of the sand, pebbles, and gravel lesson, even though\nshe was not allowed to touch the materials. Contrary to\nParents’ suggestions, this case does not involve a situation in\nwhich a school district attempted to provide separate-but-\nequal services to a disabled student. See Helen L., 46 F.3d at\n\n\n                              44\n\f338. Ridley took reasonable steps to accommodate E.R.’s\ndisabilities and include her in all class activities; it was not\nrequired to grant the specific accommodations requested by\nParents or otherwise make substantial modifications to the\nprograms that were used for all other students. J.D., 224 F.3d\nat 70. Additionally, although Cenname may have exercised\npoor judgment in commenting on E.R.’s clothes, in the\nabsence of evidence that E.R. was excluded from\nparticipation in educational activities or denied educational\nbenefits, two isolated comments do not rise to the level of a §\n504 violation. See Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d at 253.\nNor does Cenname’s alleged failure to identify the position of\nE.R.’s chair as the source of her struggles on penmanship\ntests.\n\n       E.     Other Claims\n\n        Finally, Parents argue that the District Court erred in\ndismissing their claim for damages under the Rehabilitation\nAct, their claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and a state law claim\nagainst Cenname for “outrageous conduct causing severe\nemotional distress.” Parents contend that these claims were\nnot the subject of Ridley’s motion for judgment on the\nadministrative record, and thus were not before the District\nCourt. Accordingly, Parents ask us to remand to the District\nCourt to consider their remaining claims. We decline to do\nso; although the District Court did not address the claims, we\ncan affirm based on any grounds supported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                              45\n\fChambers, 587 F.3d at 183-84. 14 First, because Parents’\nRehabilitation Act claim fails, they are not entitled to\ndamages. Second, the substantive standards for determining\nliability under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA are the\nsame, McDonald v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92,\n94-95 (3d Cir. 1995), and thus the District Court did not err in\ndisposing of Parents’ claim under the ADA. Finally, because\nno federal claims remained, dismissal of Parents’ state law\nclaim was proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n                       IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of\nthe District Court.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n          Although the principle that an appellate court may\naffirm on any grounds supported by the record has previously\nbeen articulated in the summary judgment context, it is based\non considerations of judicial efficiency, and we see no reason\nnot to apply the same principle to a district court’s grant of\njudgment on the administrative record.\n\n                              46\n\f",

The\nDistrict Court reversed a decision by a Pennsylvania Due\nProcess Hearing Officer that Ridley School District violated\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20\nU.S.C. 1400, et seq., and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 701, et seq. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm\nthe order of the District Court.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n       E.R., who is now ten years old, attended kindergarten\n(2006-2007) and first grade (2007-2008) at Grace Park\nElementary School (“Grace Park”) in the Ridley School\nDistrict (“Ridley”). E.R. has been identified as a child with\nnumerous learning disabilities, as well as several health-\nrelated problems, including severe food and contact allergies.\nDuring the summer between E.R.’s first and second grade\nyears, M.R. and J.R. (collectively, “Parents”) determined that\nthe programs being offered by Ridley were inadequate to\naddress E.R.’s unique needs, and thus decided to remove her\nfrom Ridley and enroll her at the Benchmark School, a\nprivate school that specializes in instructing students with\nlearning disabilities. Parents subsequently filed a complaint\nwith the Pennsylvania Department of Education, seeking\ncompensatory education for violations of the IDEA and § 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act, and tuition reimbursement,\nincluding transportation expenses, for E.R.’s enrollment in\nthe Benchmark School. A Due Process Hearing Officer\n\n                              3\n\fawarded Parents compensatory education for the 2007-2008\nschool year, as well as reimbursement of tuition for the 2008-\n2009 school year, and reimbursement for transportation to\nand from the Benchmark School. The District Court\nreversed, finding that Parents were entitled to neither\ncompensatory education nor reimbursement for tuition or\ntransportation expenses.\n\n      A.     Factual Background\n\n        Before E.R. began kindergarten, Parents were\nconcerned about her ability to grasp pre-academic skills, such\nas letters and numbers, and took her to be evaluated at the\nChester County Intermediate Unit (“CCIU”). Although the\ntesting noted some academic difficulties, the evaluators\nconcluded that E.R. did not qualify as a child with special\nneeds. However, in September 2006, shortly after E.R. began\nkindergarten, she was identified as needing extra academic\nsupport, and was placed in extended-day kindergarten\n(“EDK”). Parents were notified of this placement, and were\nadvised that it was intended to improve E.R.’s math skills and\nreinforce her kindergarten skills generally.\n\n       In November 2006, due to E.R.’s academic struggles\nand attention problems, Parents requested that Ridley perform\nan educational evaluation. Ridley agreed, and an Initial\nEvaluation Report was completed on January 31, 2007.\nAlthough the report indicated that math was difficult for E.R.,\nconsistent with CCIU’s earlier determination, Ridley\nconcluded that she did not qualify for special education\nservices because her cognitive ability and academic\nachievement levels were both in the average range. Ridley\n\n                              4\n\falso conducted an occupational therapy (“OT”) evaluation,\nwhich was completed on January 24, 2007. The OT findings,\nwhich were based largely on the input of teachers, identified\nthe following areas of concern: below grade level ability in\nmath; lack of concentration; inconsistency in remembering\nnumbers one through ten; problems with peer interaction;\npoor problem-solving skills and desk posture; and difficulty\nkeeping her place when reading.\n\n       On February 7, 2007, Ridley convened a meeting to\nreview the Initial Evaluation Report. In response to concerns\nraised by Parents at the meeting, Ridley agreed to conduct\nadditional testing using The Children’s Memory Scale, Test\nof Auditory Processing Skills, and The Behavior Rating\nInventory of Executive Functioning. The additional testing\nresulted in two addendums to the Initial Evaluation Report,\nwhich stated that E.R.’s academic skills were generally in the\naverage range, but that she demonstrated a relative weakness\nin retaining and manipulating numbers. Based on this\ninformation, the school psychologist concluded that E.R. did\nnot have a specific learning disability. Also in February\n2007, a § 504 Service Agreement (“the § 504 Agreement”)\nwas issued to provide OT services to E.R., and to address her\nsevere allergies. 1 Under the § 504 Agreement, E.R. was to\nreceive OT services once a week for thirty minutes and\nconsultative services to the home and classroom on a regular\n\n       1\n         “§ 504” refers to § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\nwhich prohibits discrimination in federally-funded programs,\nincluding public schools, on the basis of disability. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794.\n\n                              5\n\fbasis. Despite her allergies, E.R. was to be included in as\nmany activities as possible, and Parents were to be contacted\nbefore activities involving food so that appropriate\nalternatives could be provided for E.R.\n\n       Pursuant to a recommendation made by E.R.’s\nkindergarten teacher, Mary Moffatt (“Moffatt”), E.R. was\nenrolled in the Summer Steps program in the Summer of\n2007 to reinforce her academic skills. The Summer Steps\nteacher reported that E.R. made some academic progress, but\nthat she needed improvement in several areas and had\ndifficulty recognizing numbers and counting.\n\n       The first six weeks of first grade were spent reviewing\nkindergarten materials. During this time, E.R. struggled\nacademically and posted several failing grades. In late\nSeptember 2007, J.R., E.R.’s mother, wrote to E.R.’s first\ngrade teacher, Janet Cenname (“Cenname”), and requested a\nmeeting to discuss E.R.’s poor grades. Cenname declined the\nrequest to meet at that time, telling J.R. that it would be\npremature to meet so early in the year, and that it would be\nmore appropriate to give E.R. time to develop her skills.\nCenname explained that she would be “happy to meet” a few\nweeks later, in early October, if Parents still had concerns.\nParents did not re-contact Cenname, and instead requested a\nmeeting with the school’s principal. During that meeting,\nwhich was held on November 1, 2007, Parents were informed\nthat E.R. had been placed on a “reading watch list” in mid-\nOctober. Following the meeting, E.R. was placed in a\nreading support group, but according to Parents, she had\ndifficulty catching up with the other students because the\nprogram had started two months earlier.\n\n                              6\n\f       On November 16, 2007, Parents requested a\ncomprehensive reevaluation of E.R.          Ridley issued a\nPermission to Evaluate on November 27, 2007, and the\nreevaluation was completed on February 26, 2008. The\nReevaluation Report found that E.R. had learning disabilities\nin the areas of reading decoding and comprehension, math\ncomputation, reasoning skills, and written language. E.R.\nwas also found to have fine motor delays and a language\ndisability. As part of the Reevaluation Report, Ridley’s\nschool psychologist prepared recommendations to be\nconsidered by the Individual Education Planning Team (“IEP\nTeam”). Based on those recommendations, Ridley offered\ntwo alternative placements for E.R.: (1) the learning support\nroom at her current school, Grace Park, or (2) a self-contained\nclassroom at a different elementary school. Parents observed\nboth programs and determined that neither was appropriate\nfor E.R.\n\n       An IEP Team meeting was convened on March 28,\n2008 to review a draft Individualized Education Program\n(“IEP”) that had been developed to address E.R.’s educational\nneeds. At Parents’ request, Ridley agreed to make revisions\nto the IEP and submit the revisions to Parents for approval.\nAt the meeting, Ridley’s Special Education Director, Kim\nWoods (“Woods”), suggested a program called Project Read\nas a possible reading aid for E.R. Woods told Parents that she\nwould do some research on the program and follow up with\nParents and the IEP Team in a few days. Woods also\nprovided Parents with a printout from Project Read’s website,\nand a review of the program conducted by the Florida Center\nfor Reading Research.\n\n\n                              7\n\f       A Notice of Recommended Educational Placement\n(“NOREP”) was issued on April 2, 2008, but Parents refused\nto sign it until all of the agreed-upon revisions had been\nmade. Another IEP Team meeting was held on April 30 to\naddress Parents’ continuing concerns regarding the IEP. On\nMay 9, a revised NOREP was issued, and Parents signed it in\nagreement on May 12.           However, Parents remained\nconcerned about Ridley’s proposed reading program, and\nrequested that Ridley hire someone to provide instruction\nusing The Wilson Reading System. Ridley did not do so.\n\n       On May 13, 2008, in accordance with the revised\nNOREP and addendums to the IEP, E.R. began going to\nGrace Park’s “resource room” every day for one hour of\nreading assistance in the morning and one hour of math\nassistance in the afternoon. The resource room reading\ncurriculum consisted of the following instructional programs:\nRead Naturally, Reading Workshop, Writing Workshop, and\nPatricia Cunningham’s Systematic Phonics. The resource\nroom employed a program called Everyday Math for math\ninstruction. There were five other students in the resource\nroom, none of whom were first graders. Aimee Hodges\n(“Hodges”), the resource room teacher, explained that\nalthough the students were all provided with the same reading\nprograms, different parts of the programs were used for\ndifferent students, such that assistance was geared toward\neach student’s individual needs. Hodges also testified that\neverything done in the resource room was “multi-sensory,”\nwhich meant that the lessons included visual, oral, and hands-\non components. E.R.’s grades in the resource room improved\ndramatically in a short period of time, but Parents attributed\n\n\n                              8\n\fthe improvement to improper resource room assistance, and\nclaimed that E.R. was not displaying similar progress at\nhome. By the time E.R.’s first grade year ended, she had\nreceived eighteen days of resource room assistance.\n\n       On June 9, 2008, the IEP Team met to update the IEP\nfor the 2008-2009 academic year (second grade). The\nNOREP from the June IEP Team meeting recommended that\nE.R. continue to receive one hour per day of math instruction\nand one hour per day of reading instruction in the resource\nroom. The NOREP indicated that the reading instruction\nwould include a direct reading program, as well as a direct\nphonemic-based program to address E.R.’s needs in decoding\nvocabulary, fluency, and comprehension skills. The NOREP\nprovided that Ridley would train its learning support staff on\nProject Read during the summer, and that the program would\nbe “up and running” before the end of September 2008.\nRidley also agreed to pay for a summer learning program at\nthe Benchmark School, as well as summer math tutoring three\ntimes per week.\n\n       Parents researched Project Read and determined that it\nwas not appropriate for a student with E.R.’s needs. On\nAugust 14, 2008, Parents informed Ridley that E.R. would be\nenrolling at the Benchmark School for the 2008-2009 school\nyear because it provided the “intensive multi-sensory\napproach to reading” that they determined E.R. required.\n\n      B.     Procedural History\n\n      On December 4, 2008, Parents filed a due process\ncomplaint with the Pennsylvania Department of Education,\n\n                              9\n\falleging that Ridley violated the IDEA and § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act. Parents claimed that Ridley failed to\ntimely identify E.R. as a child in need of special education\nservices, failed to develop an appropriate IEP, and subjected\nE.R. to discrimination by failing to comply with the § 504\nAgreement.\n\n        Hearings were held before a Due Process Hearing\nOfficer on January 29, 2009, February 10, 2009, and\nMarch 10, 2009. At the hearings, the Hearing Officer\nreviewed documentary evidence provided by the parties and\nheard testimony from E.R.’s mother, Linda Heller, Parents’\nspecial education advocate, as well as several teachers and\nschool officials. On April 21, 2009, the Hearing Officer\nissued a written report, finding that: (1) Ridley had not\ncommitted any violations during E.R.’s kindergarten year;\n(2) Ridley violated the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act in\nE.R.’s first grade year; and (3) the IEPs proposed for E.R.’s\nfirst and second grade years were inadequate and therefore\ndenied E.R. a “free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”)\nbecause they “lacked appropriate specially designed\ninstruction in the form of a research based, peer reviewed\nreading program.” The Hearing Officer awarded Parents\ncompensatory education for the 2007-2008 year (first grade),\nreimbursement of tuition at the Benchmark School for the\n2008-2009 year (second grade), and reimbursement of\ntransportation expenses to and from the Benchmark School.\n\n      Ridley filed a petition for review in the Pennsylvania\nCommonwealth Court, and the case was subsequently\nremoved to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania. Parents treated the petition as a complaint and\n\n                             10\n\ffiled an answer and counterclaims, in which they challenged\nthe Hearing Officer’s conclusion that no violation occurred\nduring E.R.’s kindergarten year, and asserted additional\nclaims against Ridley and Cenname, whom Parents added as\na third party defendant. On October 9, 2009, Ridley filed a\nmotion for judgment on the administrative record. On\nFebruary 14, 2011, the District Court affirmed the Hearing\nOfficer’s finding as to E.R.’s kindergarten year, reversed the\nHearing Officer’s findings as to E.R.’s first and second grade\nyears, and granted Ridley’s motion for judgment on the\nadministrative record as to all claims.

Pa. Feb.\n14, 2011). Parents filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n       On appeal, Parents raise four arguments. First, they\ncontend that the District Court improperly placed the burden\nof persuasion on them to demonstrate that Ridley violated the\nIDEA. Second, they argue that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s finding that Ridley denied\nE.R. a FAPE during first grade by failing to timely identify\nher as a student in need of special education services. Third,\nthey maintain that the District Court misinterpreted a\nprovision of the IDEA, and improperly reversed the Hearing\nOfficer’s finding that E.R.’s IEP was deficient in that it\nlacked research-based, peer-reviewed specially designed\nreading instruction. Finally, Parents argue that the District\nCourt erred in concluding that Ridley did not violate § 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act.\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\f         II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction to review the\ndecision of the state educational agency under 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(i)(2), and we have appellate jurisdiction over the order\nof the District Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

We did not specify, however, whether the\nparents bore the burden because they initially challenged the\nIEP (and the burden carried to the district court) or because\nthey lost at the administrative hearing level.

However, because nothing in the\nPennsylvania regulations establishes a specified timeline for\nidentifying and evaluating students, we will apply the\n“reasonable time” standard to school districts in Pennsylvania\nas well. See id. at 501 (inferring the “reasonable time”\nrequirement because neither the IDEA nor the applicable\nNew Jersey regulations established such a deadline).\n\n                              20\n\festablishing any “bright-line rule” as to what constitutes a\nreasonable time.

Id.\n\n        Here, in finding that Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE by\nfailing to identify her as a student in need of special education\nservices at the outset of first grade, the Hearing Officer never\nacknowledged that Ridley must be given a reasonable time to\nidentify students as disabled. Rather, the Hearing Officer\nsimply stated that Ridley had provided a number of\nintervention programs to E.R. during kindergarten, and\nbecause E.R. continued to struggle academically in first\ngrade, Ridley should have known that further evaluation was\nrequired at the very start of the next school year. The Hearing\nOfficer was particularly critical of E.R.’s first grade teacher,\nJanet Cenname, explaining that Cenname was “extremely\nnervous and uptight” when testifying, she had to refer to\nnotes, and she frequently tried to explain her actions in a\n“non-sensical way.” The Hearing Officer concluded that,\nbased on E.R.’s struggles during the first month of first grade,\nmuch of which was spent reviewing kindergarten materials,\nCenname should have identified E.R. as a student in need of\nspecial education services at the very beginning of the year,\nand thus should have recommended to Ridley that it conduct\nanother evaluation.        Accordingly, the Hearing Officer\ndetermined that Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE “from the\nbeginning of first grade to the time that the evaluation was\ncompleted” in February 2008.\n\n\n\n                               21\n\f       As the District Court observed, the Hearing Officer’s\nfinding that Ridley violated the IDEA by failing to identify\nE.R. as a child in need of special education services at the\noutset of first grade is difficult to reconcile with the Hearing\nOfficer’s finding that Ridley complied with the IDEA during\nE.R.’s kindergarten year.         E.R. was evaluated during\nkindergarten, and although areas of weakness were found,\nE.R.’s academic skills were generally considered to be in the\naverage range. The Hearing Officer concluded that the\nkindergarten evaluation was “substantively appropriate,” and\nnoted that “just because a child has an area of weakness, it\ndoesn’t necessarily mean that [she has] a disability.” The\nHearing Officer also noted that Ridley “appeared to be\ninvested in addressing [E.R.’s] needs and providing\nappropriate instruction and interventions before rushing to\nspecial education identification.” As a result, the Hearing\nOfficer properly determined that Parents’ claim that Ridley\nviolated the IDEA’s “child find” requirements during E.R.’s\nkindergarten year “lack[ed] any basis in the testimony or\ndocuments.” 6\n\n      In light of the fact that E.R.’s kindergarten evaluations\nwere appropriate, and she did not qualify as a student in need\nof special education services in June 2007 (the end of\nkindergarten), we cannot agree with the Hearing Officer that\nRidley violated the IDEA and denied E.R. a FAPE by failing\nto immediately reevaluate her in September 2007. When a\n\n       6\n         Parents do not appeal the District Court’s decision\naffirming the Hearing Officer’s finding regarding E.R.’s\nkindergarten year.\n\n                              22\n\fschool district has conducted a comprehensive evaluation and\nconcluded that a student does not qualify as disabled under\nthe IDEA, the school district must be afforded a reasonable\ntime to monitor the student’s progress before exploring\nwhether further evaluation is required. See Matula, 67 F.3d at\n501. We assess whether a school district identified and\nevaluated a student suspected of having a qualifying disability\nwithin a reasonable time “in light of the information and\nresources possessed” by the district. Id. Here, although E.R.\nstruggled during the beginning of first grade, all prior\nevaluations showed that she did not require special education\nservices. Moreover, as Cenname testified, first grade was the\n“first time that the children ever ha[d] a chance to be in a test\ntaking situation” and “[t]here were other children that also\nhad difficulty . . . taking a test.” It was reasonable for\nCenname to assess E.R.’s progress throughout the first\nmarking period of first grade before recommending that E.R.\nagain be evaluated to determine if she had a learning\ndisability. The IDEA does not require a reevaluation every\ntime a student posts a poor grade. Accordingly, we hold that\nRidley complied with its “child find” obligations, and E.R.\nwas not denied a FAPE at the beginning of first grade. 7\n\n\n       7\n         Parents contend that the District Court did not accord\nthe proper deference to the Hearing Officer’s factual findings,\nparticularly her finding that Cenname was not a credible\nwitness. Where a hearing officer “has heard live testimony\nand determined that one witness is more credible than another\nwitness, [the hearing officer’s] determination is due special\nweight.” D.S. v.

(citations omitted). Here, central to\nthe Hearing Officer’s conclusion that E.R. was denied a\nFAPE during the beginning of first grade was that Cenname\n“put off” meeting with E.R.’s mother when E.R.’s mother\nexpressed concern that her daughter had failed a math test.\nHowever, Cenname responded to E.R.’s mother’s request for\na meeting by sending back the following note:\n\n             Dear Mrs. [R],\n\n              I appreciate your concern about [E.R.’s] test,\n      but it is very early in the year.

E.R.’s IEP\n\n        Parents next contend that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s finding that E.R.’s IEP was\ninadequate. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.\nFirst, to the extent Ridley violated the IDEA’s procedural\nrequirements by failing to include the requisite statement of\nspecially designed instruction in the IEP, the violation was\nnot actionable because it did not have any impact on the\nsubstantive rights of E.R. or Parents. Second, contrary to the\nHearing Officer’s findings, E.R.’s educational plan included a\npeer-reviewed reading program, which, in conjunction with\nthe other services that E.R. was scheduled to receive, was\nsufficient to provide a FAPE. We will discuss these points in\nturn.\n\n                              1.\n\n       An IEP must consist of a detailed written statement\narrived at by a multi-disciplinary team specifying the\n\n        Thus, contrary to Parents’ suggestions, Cenname did\nnot refuse to meet or indicate that a meeting was unnecessary.\nShe expressed a clear willingness to meet, and simply told\nParents that E.R. should be given some time to get her\nbearings. Parents never responded to this note and never met\nwith Cenname to discuss E.R.’s academic struggles.\nTherefore, as the District Court found, non-testimonial\nevidence in the record demonstrates that Cenname’s response\nto Parents’ request for a meeting was entirely reasonable, and\nthat it in no way resulted in the denial of a FAPE. See D.S.,\n602 F.3d at 564.\n\n                             25\n\fservices, including specially designed instruction, that the\nchild will receive. Polk v. Cent.

Parents contend\nthat they are entitled to compensatory education because the\nIEP developed by Ridley failed to set forth in sufficient detail\nthe specially designed instruction that would be provided to\nE.R. Parents acknowledge that subsequent NOREPs issued\nby Ridley included the required specially designed\ninstruction, but they nevertheless argue that the IDEA\nrequires that such information be included in the body of the\ninitial IEP. 8\n\n        Parents’ argument presents a challenge to Ridley’s\ncompliance with the IDEA’s procedural requirements.\nAlthough we have held that “[t]he content of an IEP . . . does\nnot implicate the IDEA’s procedural requirements for content\nis concerned with the IEP’s substance,” D.S., 602 F.3d at 565,\nParents’ argument here does not relate to the substance of the\nIEP. Rather, Parents’ argument is essentially that Ridley\nviolated the IDEA by including a description of specially\ndesigned instruction in the wrong document. We have made\nclear that although it is important that a school district comply\nwith the IDEA’s procedural requirements, compliance is not a\ngoal in itself; rather, compliance with such procedural\nrequirements is important because of the “requirements’\nimpact on students’ and parents’ substantive rights.” Id.\n\n       8\n        Although the District Court did not address this issue,\nParents raised it in their brief before the District Court, and\nthus preserved it for review.

On\nJune 9, 2008, Ridley issued a second NOREP, which\nexplained that Ridley would provide training to its staff on\nProject Read during the summer and the program would be\n\n\n                              27\n\fup and running before the end of September 2008. Until\nProject Read could be implemented, Ridley would continue\nto use the other resource room reading programs. The June\nNOREP was never signed by Parents due to their objection to\nProject Read.\n\n       Because detailed specially designed instruction was set\nforth in the NOREPs, it is properly considered part of E.R.’s\noverall educational plan. Ridley’s admitted “mistake” in\nfailing to include such information in the IEP itself did not\ndeny E.R. any educational opportunity, nor did it deprive her\nof any educational benefits. See D.S., 602 F.3d at 565.\nMoreover, Parents were intimately involved in the process of\ncrafting E.R.’s IEP and do not contend that they were\nunaware of the services E.R. was scheduled to receive. Thus,\nthey were not denied their participation rights. See id.\nAccordingly, any deficiency in Ridley’s compliance with the\nprocedural requirements of the IDEA is not a basis for\ngranting relief to Parents. Whether the specially designed\ninstruction set forth in the IEP and the NOREPs was adequate\nto provide a FAPE is a separate question, which we will\naddress next.\n\n                              2.\n\n       Parents’ next argument presents an issue of first\nimpression in this circuit. The Hearing Officer found that\nE.R.’s IEP was inadequate, both for the end of the 2007-2008\nschool year (first grade), and all of the 2008-2009 school year\n(second grade) primarily because it “fail[ed] to provide a\nscientifically research-based, peer reviewed reading program,\nwhich [E.R.] needed in order to make meaningful progress.”\n\n                              28\n\fThe Hearing Officer stated that although Project Read, the\nreading program chosen for E.R., “was designed to be\nresearch based,” there were “flaws in the research supporting\nit.” These statements were made in conclusory fashion,\nwithout elaboration, in a footnote of the Hearing Officer’s 20-\npage opinion. They were not well-explained or well-\nsupported.\n\n       The District Court reversed the Hearing Officer’s\ndecision that the IEP was inappropriate, reasoning that the\nlack of a peer-reviewed instructional program was not\nautomatically fatal to an IEP, and even if it was, Project Read\nwas research-based and peer-reviewed. On appeal, we need\nnot decide whether the lack of a peer-reviewed reading\nprogram alone may result in the denial of a FAPE because we\nagree with the District Court that Project Read was based on\npeer-reviewed research. We will, however, consider Parents’\ncontentions that Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE because the\navailable research regarding Project Read was flawed and did\nnot adequately demonstrate that Project Read would be\neffective for a student with E.R.’s learning disabilities. As we\nexplain below, Parents’ arguments are unavailing; the peer-\nreviewed specially designed reading instruction in E.R.’s IEP\nwas “reasonably calculated to enable [her] to receive\nmeaningful educational benefits in light of [her] intellectual\npotential.” Chambers, 587 F.3d at 182 (citation omitted).\nRidley was not required to choose the reading program based\non the optimal level of peer-reviewed research, or to\nimplement the specific program requested by Parents.\n\n       We begin our analysis by reviewing the statutory\nprovision at issue. In 2004, Congress added the following\n\n                              29\n\fprovision to the IDEA: “[t]he term ‘individualized education\nprogram’ or ‘IEP’ means a written statement for each child\nwith a disability . . . that includes . . . a statement of the\nspecial education and related services and supplementary aids\nand services, based on peer-reviewed research to the extent\npracticable, to be provided to the child.” 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV) (emphasis added). This provision was\nincorporated into the revised IDEA regulations in 2006,\nwhich state that an IEP “must include . . . [a] statement of the\nspecial education and related services and supplementary aids\nand services, based on peer-reviewed research to the extent\npracticable, to be provided to the child.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.320(a)(4). Congress amended the IDEA in 1997 and\n2004, in part, to respond to concerns that the statute “ha[d]\nbeen impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus\non applying replicable research on proven methods of\nteaching and learning for children with disabilities.” 20\nU.S.C. § 1400(c)(4). The IDEA’s statement of congressional\nfindings explains that “[a]lmost 30 years of research and\nexperience has demonstrated that the education of children\nwith disabilities can be made more effective by” training\nteachers on “the use of scientifically based instructional\npractices, to the maximum extent possible,” and providing\nincentives for “scientifically based early reading programs.”\nId. § 1400(c)(5)(E) and (F).\n\n       Unfortunately, neither the text of the IDEA nor the\nIDEA regulations provide much guidance as to the effect of\n§ 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)’s peer-reviewed research provision in\nthis case. Therefore, we will look to other instructive\nregulatory materials. See Auer v.

In conjunction with its promulgation of the 2006\nIDEA regulations, the U.S. Department of Education\n(“DOE”) issued an Analysis of Comments and Changes to the\n2006 IDEA Regulations (“Analysis of IDEA Regulations”),\n71 Fed. Reg. 46,540 (2006). In response to a comment\nrequesting “clear guidance on the responsibilities of States,\nschool districts, and school personnel to provide special\neducation and related services . . . that are based on peer-\nreviewed research,” the DOE stated that “States, school\ndistricts, and school personnel must . . . select and use\nmethods that research has shown to be effective, to the extent\nthat methods based on peer-reviewed research are available.”\n71 Fed. Reg. at 46,665. The agency made clear, however,\nthat a student’s IEP team retains flexibility in devising an\nappropriate program. The Analysis of IDEA Regulations\nexplained that the changes implemented by the 2004 IDEA\namendments and the 2006 updated regulations\n\n\n\n\n                             31\n\f       “do[] not mean that the service with the greatest\n       body of research is the service necessarily\n       required for a child to receive FAPE. Likewise,\n       there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the\n       failure of a public agency to provide services\n       based on peer-reviewed research would\n       automatically result in a denial of FAPE. The\n       final decision about the special education and\n       related services . . . that are to be provided to a\n       child must be made by the child’s IEP Team\n       based on the child’s individual needs.”\n\nId.\n\n       In response to a comment requesting that the DOE\nrequire programs provided to a disabled child to be research-\nbased with demonstrated effectiveness in addressing the\nparticular needs of a child, the Analysis of IDEA Regulations\nstated, “[w]hile the Act clearly places an emphasis on\npractices that are based on scientific research, there is nothing\nin the Act that requires all programs provided to children with\ndisabilities to be research-based with demonstrated\neffectiveness in addressing the particular needs of a child\nwhere not practicable.” Id. The DOE declined to adopt the\nrecommended change because “ultimately, it is the child’s\nIEP Team that determines the special education and related\nservices that are needed by the child in order for the child to\nreceive FAPE.” Id. The DOE also rejected as “overly\nburdensome” a requirement that all IEP team meetings\ninclude a focused discussion of research-based methods and a\nproposed regulation that would force schools to provide\n\n\n                               32\n\fwritten notice when an IEP team does not provide\ndocumentation of research-based methods. Id. 9\n\n        We can discern two key principles from these\nadministrative materials and our prior decisions interpreting\nthe IDEA. First, although schools should strive to base a\nstudent’s specially designed instruction on peer-reviewed\nresearch to the maximum extent possible, the student’s IEP\nteam retains flexibility to devise an appropriate program, in\nlight of the available research. See D.S., 602 F.3d at 557; 71\nFed. Reg. at 46,665. Second, under the IDEA, courts must\naccord significant deference to the choices made by school\nofficials as to what constitutes an appropriate program for\neach student. See D.S., 602 F.3d at 556-57; Ridgewood Bd. of\nEduc., 172 F.3d at 247; 71 Fed. Reg. at 46,664-65.\n\n       With these principles in mind, we will consider the\ntwo objections that Parents raise to the portion of E.R.’s IEP\nthat addresses her reading and language disabilities. First,\nechoing the findings of the Hearing Officer, Parents argue\nthat “there were flaws in the research [regarding the\n      9\n         Commenters also requested a more explicit definition\nof “peer-reviewed research.” The DOE stated that “‘[p]eer\nreviewed research’ generally refers to research that is\nreviewed by qualified and independent reviewers to ensure\nthat the quality of the information meets the standards of the\nfield before the research is published.” 71 Fed. Reg. 46,540,\n46,664 (2006). However, the agency made clear that there\nwas no single definition of “peer-reviewed research” and it\ndeclined to include a specific definition for purposes of the\nIDEA. Id.\n\n                             33\n\feffectiveness of Project Read] which made it impossible to\nattribute the reading growth the students experienced [in the\nstudies] to Project Read alone.” Second, they contend that\nnone of the studies regarding Project Read demonstrated that\nthe program was effective for students with E.R.’s specific\ndisabilities. Both arguments miss the mark. Given that the\nIDEA does not require an IEP to provide the “optimal level of\nservices,” D.S., 602 F.3d at 557 (citations omitted), we\nlikewise hold that the IDEA does not require a school district\nto choose the program supported by the optimal level of peer-\nreviewed research. Rather, the peer-reviewed specially\ndesigned instruction in an IEP must be “reasonably calculated\nto enable the child to receive meaningful educational benefits\nin light of the student’s intellectual potential.” Chambers,\n587 F.3d at 182 (citation omitted).\n\n       According to a 2007 review of Project Read published\nby the Florida Center for Reading Research (“FCRR”):\n\n      “Project Read is a comprehensive language arts\n      program designed to provide explicit instruction\n      in a structured reading curriculum. The goal of\n      the program is to help all students become\n      thoughtful, purposeful, and independent\n      readers. Project Read Curriculum may be\n      implemented in the regular classroom, special\n      education classes, and Title I classes. It may\n      also be used as an intervention reading program\n      for first through sixth graders or with\n      adolescents and adults who struggle with\n      reading or language learning. Whole or small\n      group instruction is delivered by a classroom\n\n                             34\n\f      teacher, a special education teacher, or a\n      reading teacher. Lessons are intended to occur\n      daily within an extended block of time devoted\n      to reading instruction. Emphasis is placed on\n      systematic, direct instruction of concepts and\n      skills supported and enhanced by a teaching\n      approach that includes visual, kinesthetic,\n      auditory and tactile strategies (VAKT), and the\n      use of body language.”\n\nAfter discussing several studies on the effectiveness of\nProject Read, and citing relevant articles, at least one of\nwhich was published in a peer-reviewed journal, the FCRR\nreview concluded that the research “[was] promising and the\ninstructional strategies of Project Read [we]re aligned with\ncurrent research. Future studies with sound experimental\ndesigns including control groups and random assignment may\ncontribute more definitive information about the efficacy of\nProject Read.” The FCRR review then listed numerous\nstrengths of the Project Read program, and found no\nweaknesses in Project Read’s curriculum.\n\n       We understand Parents’ concern that the available\nstudies did not test Project Read’s effectiveness for students\nwith E.R.’s unique combination of disabilities. However, the\nresearch discussed in the FCRR review involved children of\nE.R.’s age who struggled with reading, and indicated that\nProject Read was helpful in improving the reading skills of\nsuch students. Additionally, Hodges, Grace Park’s resource\nroom teacher, and Woods, Ridley’s director of special\neducation, both of whom have expertise in the field of special\neducation, testified that Project Read was an appropriate\n\n                             35\n\freading program for E.R. 10 Woods explained that, “Project\nRead is a multi-sensory program that is based on Orton\nGillingham’s principles that support learning disabled\nstudents. The research from Florida was very promising in\nterms of these students doing quite well.” Woods further\ntestified that “[t]he program . . . had a lot of components that\nlearning disabled students learn by [including] what we called\nVAKT program, visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and touch. And\nmost learning disabled students do very well when you bring\nall of the senses into the learning process.” Hodges also\ntestified that Project Read was a research-based program and\nsimilar to other reading programs, such as The Wilson\nReading System.\n\n       Parents argue that, in contrast to Project Read, the\nprogram they requested, The Wilson Reading System, has\nbeen shown to be effective for teaching students with learning\ndisabilities similar to those of E.R. However, Ridley did not\nhave to choose the specific program requested by Parents.\nSee D.S., 602 F.3d at 557. Nor did it have to choose the\nprogram supported by the optimal level of peer-reviewed\nresearch. See id.; 71 Fed. Reg. at 46,665 (explaining that a\nschool does not have to choose the program supported by the\n“greatest body of research”). “The IDEA accords educators\ndiscretion to select from various methods for meeting the\nindividualized needs of a student, provided those practices are\nreasonably calculated to provide h[er] with educational\nbenefit.” R.P. v.

In selecting special\neducation programs, a school district must be able to take into\naccount not only the needs of the disabled student, but also\nthe financial and administrative resources that different\nprograms will require, and the needs of the school’s other\nnon-disabled students. See J.D. v. Pawlet Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770100\"><a href=\"/opinion/770100/jd-by-his-parent-jd-v-pawlet-school-district-bennington-rutland/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70 (2d Cir. 2000) (explaining that, in the context of the\nRehabilitation Act, courts must be aware of the “need to\nstrike a balance” between the rights of the disabled student\nand fiscal and administrative concerns); 71 Fed. Reg. at\n46,665 (rejecting a proposed requirement on an IEP team as\n“overly burdensome”).\n\n       We will not set forth any bright-line rule as to what\nconstitutes an adequately peer-reviewed special education\nprogram; hearing officers and reviewing courts must continue\nto assess the appropriateness of an IEP on a case-by-case\nbasis, taking into account the available research. We\nrecognize that there may be cases in which the specially\ndesigned instruction proposed by a school district is so at\nodds with current research that it constitutes a denial of a\nFAPE. See, e.g., Waukee Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. D.L., No. 07-\n00278, 51 IDELR 15 (LRP) (S.D. Iowa Aug. 7, 2008)\n(explaining that a student was denied a FAPE, in part,\nbecause the school district frequently employed strategies\nwhich contradicted the relevant research and were even\ninconsistent with the school’s own assessment of the\n\n\n                              37\n\fappropriate program for the student). 11 Additionally, if it is\npracticable for a school district to implement a program based\nupon peer-reviewed research, and the school fails to do so,\nthat will weigh heavily against a finding that the school\nprovided a FAPE. However, that is not the case here. Ridley\nrelied on available peer-reviewed research in crafting the IEP\nfor E.R., and proposed a program with specially designed\ninstruction that was “reasonably calculated” to enable her to\nachieve meaningful educational benefits in light of her\nintellectual potential and individual abilities. See Rowley,\n458 U.S. at 207. Thus, we conclude that the District Court\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          The IDEA’s peer-reviewed research requirement is\nnot set forth in isolation; it is part of a broader section\ndiscussing the content of the IEP, which requires “a statement\nof the special education and related services . . . that will be\nprovided for the child” to meet certain specified objectives,\nnamely “to advance appropriately toward attaining the\nannual goals[,]” “to be involved in and make progress in the\ngeneral education curriculum . . . and to participate in\nextracurricular and other nonacademic activities[,]” and “to\nbe educated and participate with other children with\ndisabilities and nondisabled children in” educational\nactivities. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV).\n\n\n                              38\n\fproperly reversed the Hearing Officer’s finding that the IEP\nwas inadequate to provide a FAPE. 12\n\n\n      12\n            The Hearing Officer also awarded Parents\ncompensatory education for the end of the 2007-2008 school\nyear, despite the fact that Project Read was not yet\nimplemented, and Ridley was continuing to use its existing\n“resource room” reading program. The Hearing Officer did\nnot explain this conclusion, and based on the record, we\ncannot agree. Pursuant to E.R.’s IEP and the May NOREP,\nboth of which Parents agreed to, for the last eighteen days of\nfirst grade, E.R. received one hour of reading instruction in\nthe resource room. The resource room reading curriculum\nconsisted of Reading Naturally, Reading Workshop, Writing\nWorkshop, and Patricia Cunningham’s Systematic Phonics.\nHodges testified that although the same programs were used\nfor all students in the resource room, she tailored the\nprograms to each student’s individual needs. Moreover,\nE.R.’s evaluations all indicated that she would benefit from\nmulti-sensory learning, and Hodges explained that all\nactivities done in the resource room were multi-sensory. She\nalso explained that “all of the research points to a balanced\nliteracy program which is hammering away at phonemic\nawareness, phonics, comprehension, fluency, and vocabulary.\nAnd with the repertoire that we were using throughout the\nweek, I think we hit all those schools.” We can find no\nevidence in the record that rebuts this testimony. In light of\nthe fact that reviewing courts must be mindful not to\nsubstitute their views of what constitute preferable\neducational methods for those of school officials, who have\n\n                             39\n\f       D.     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n        Parents next contend that the District Court erred in\nreversing the Hearing Officer’s determination that Ridley\nviolated § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act during E.R.’s first\ngrade year. We disagree. The Rehabilitation Act provides\nthat “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . .\nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded\nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination” under any program that receives\nfederal funds. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). This prohibition was\nextended to public school systems through § 504. Id.\n§ 794(b)(2)(B). To establish a violation of § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act, Parents were required to prove that\n(1) E.R. was disabled; (2) she was “otherwise qualified” to\nparticipate in school activities; (3) Ridley received federal\nfinancial assistance; and (4) E.R. was excluded from\nparticipation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to\n\n\nexpertise in the area, D.S., 602 F.3d at 564, we agree with the\nDistrict Court that the Hearing Officer erred in determining\nthat Ridley denied E.R. a FAPE during the end of first grade.\n\n       Because we hold that the resource room instruction\nprovided during the end of the 2007-2008 school year was\nsufficient to provide a FAPE, we likewise hold that the\nHearing Officer erred in finding that the IEP was inadequate\nfor September 2008 (the first month of second grade). The\nsame programs that were used during the end of first grade\nwere scheduled to be used in September, until Project Read\nwas ready to be implemented.\n\n                               40\n\fdiscrimination at Ridley. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d\nat 253. Here, the parties dispute only the fourth element.\n\n       As we have explained, § 504’s “negative prohibition”\nis similar to the IDEA’s “affirmative duty” and also requires\nschools that receive federal financial assistance to “provide a\nfree appropriate public education to each qualified\nhandicapped person who is in the recipient’s jurisdiction.”\nMatula, 67 F.3d at 492-93 (quoting 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a)).\nTo offer an “appropriate” education under the Rehabilitation\nAct, a school district must reasonably accommodate the needs\nof the handicapped child so as to ensure meaningful\nparticipation in educational activities and meaningful access\nto educational benefits.

No. 485, reprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 473).\n\n        In June 2006, prior to E.R.’s kindergarten year, Ridley\nprepared an Allergy Treatment Plan, which alerted school\nstaff to E.R.’s allergies and the signs of an allergic reaction,\nand explained how school officials should react if E.R. were\nto have an allergic reaction. In February 2007, a § 504\nService Agreement was implemented to further address\nE.R.’s health issues. The Service Agreement reflected\nParents’ request that E.R. be included in as many activities as\npossible, and provided that because E.R. was “only to eat\nfoods provided by parents,” Parents were to be contacted\nbefore activities involving shared food so that appropriate\nalternatives could be provided. The Service Agreement also\nrequired all students in the classroom to wash their hands\nbefore and after meals, required E.R. to wash her hands after\ntouching physical education or OT equipment, mandated that\nE.R. wear gloves provided by Parents when handling glue,\nand provided that E.R. would only use supplies and utensils\nprovided by Parents.\n\n       Parents allege that Cenname “stubbornly and\npersistently” refused to implement the Service Agreement,\nwhich led to E.R. being “singled out, isolated and denied full\nparticipation with her classroom peers.” The Hearing Officer\n\n                              42\n\fcited the following incidents as evidence of Ridley’s\ndiscrimination against E.R. First, as part of a “Clifford the\nDog” celebration, E.R.’s classmates were given brownies\nwith red icing and red juice, but because E.R.’s allergies\nprevented her from eating that food, she was given a cupcake\nfrom the nurse’s freezer that had been provided by her\nmother. Second, a program on nutrition was offered, along\nwith a specific snack. Although Parents were notified of the\nprogram in advance, they were not told what the snack would\nbe, and therefore, E.R. ended up having to eat a snack from\nhome. Third, according to E.R.’s mother, Cenname cancelled\nan Earth Day project rather than design an alternative snack\nfor E.R. E.R.’s mother testified that Cenname commented\nthat she did not understand why the other students in class\nshould have to accommodate one child when E.R.’s parents\ncould provide separate food. Fourth, due to her allergies,\nE.R. was required to wear loose cotton clothes. E.R.’s mother\ntestified that she often had difficulty locating reasonably\npriced clothing that complied with Ridley’s dress code: green\nshirts, khaki pants, and a white sweater. Despite this\ndifficulty, on two occasions, Cenname remarked to E.R. that\nher clothes were not in compliance with the dress code, which\naccording to Parents, caused E.R. to “feel[] humiliated.”\nFifth, students in E.R.’s first grade class participated in an\nactivity in which they worked with partners to sift sand,\npebbles, and gravel, and compare the various shapes and\nsizes. Due to her severe allergies, E.R. was not permitted to\ntouch dirt without using gloves. Cenname testified that she\nhad forgotten about the sand activity when preparing her\nupdate to E.R.’s mother, and thus, was unsure whether E.R.\ncould touch any of the materials. “To be safe,” Cenname\n\n\n                             43\n\finstructed E.R. to let her partner handle the materials, but\nE.R. was allowed to participate in the project in every other\nway. Finally, E.R. was given several poor grades on\npenmanship tests. Parents blame this on Cenname’s failure to\nnotice that E.R.’s chair did not allow her to brace herself for\nwriting tasks.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that although each of\nthese incidents “may illustrate how E.R.’s daily school\nroutine necessarily had to be different than her classmates,”\nthey do not constitute § 504 violations. Ridley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">499966</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17. There is no evidence in the record that E.R.\nwas excluded from participation in educational activities,\ndenied educational benefits, or otherwise subjected to\ndiscrimination. See Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d at 253.\nE.R. was not denied meaningful participation in the food-\nrelated activities; she simply had to eat something slightly\ndifferent than the food eaten by her classmates. Parents argue\nthat Cenname could have complied with the Rehabilitation\nAct by allowing E.R.’s mother to prepare snacks for the entire\nclass that were suitable to E.R.’s dietary needs. The statute\nsimply does not require that. See Davis, 442 U.S. at 410\n(explaining that the Rehabilitation Act distinguishes “between\nthe evenhanded treatment of qualified handicapped persons\nand affirmative efforts to overcome the disabilities caused by\nhandicaps”). Similarly, E.R. was not denied the educational\nbenefit of the sand, pebbles, and gravel lesson, even though\nshe was not allowed to touch the materials. Contrary to\nParents’ suggestions, this case does not involve a situation in\nwhich a school district attempted to provide separate-but-\nequal services to a disabled student. See Helen L., 46 F.3d at\n\n\n                              44\n\f338. Ridley took reasonable steps to accommodate E.R.’s\ndisabilities and include her in all class activities; it was not\nrequired to grant the specific accommodations requested by\nParents or otherwise make substantial modifications to the\nprograms that were used for all other students. J.D., 224 F.3d\nat 70. Additionally, although Cenname may have exercised\npoor judgment in commenting on E.R.’s clothes, in the\nabsence of evidence that E.R. was excluded from\nparticipation in educational activities or denied educational\nbenefits, two isolated comments do not rise to the level of a §\n504 violation. See Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 172 F.3d at 253.\nNor does Cenname’s alleged failure to identify the position of\nE.R.’s chair as the source of her struggles on penmanship\ntests.\n\n       E.     Other Claims\n\n        Finally, Parents argue that the District Court erred in\ndismissing their claim for damages under the Rehabilitation\nAct, their claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and a state law claim\nagainst Cenname for “outrageous conduct causing severe\nemotional distress.” Parents contend that these claims were\nnot the subject of Ridley’s motion for judgment on the\nadministrative record, and thus were not before the District\nCourt. Accordingly, Parents ask us to remand to the District\nCourt to consider their remaining claims. We decline to do\nso; although the District Court did not address the claims, we\ncan affirm based on any grounds supported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                              45\n\fChambers, 587 F.3d at 183-84. 14 First, because Parents’\nRehabilitation Act claim fails, they are not entitled to\ndamages. Second, the substantive standards for determining\nliability under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA are the\nsame, McDonald v. Pa. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701318\"><a href=\"/opinion/701318/bonita-mcdonald-v-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-department-of-public/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n94-95 (3d Cir. 1995), and thus the District Court did not err in\ndisposing of Parents’ claim under the ADA. Finally, because\nno federal claims remained, dismissal of Parents’ state law\nclaim was proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n                       IV. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of\nthe District Court.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n          Although the principle that an appellate court may\naffirm on any grounds supported by the record has previously\nbeen articulated in the summary judgment context, it is based\non considerations of judicial efficiency, and we see no reason\nnot to apply the same principle to a district court’s grant of\njudgment on the administrative record.\n\n                              46\n\f</pre>",
