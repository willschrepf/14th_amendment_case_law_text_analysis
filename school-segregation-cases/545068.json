The statute is not enforced directly;  \ninstead, the Bureau has promulgated regulations defining the \nterms of the proscription and significantly narrowing its \nscope.  The district court, analyzing the statute, ruled that it \nwas facially invalid as a violation of the First Amendment and \nenjoined its enforcement.  Finding that scrutiny should be \ndirected to the substance of the regulations instead, and \ndisagreeing with the district court's evaluation, we reverse \nand remand.\n\n \n                                    * * *\n\n\n     Before 1996, federal regulations authorized prison wardens \nto reject a publication \"only if it [was] determined detrimental \nto the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if \nit might facilitate criminal activity.\"  28 CFR s 540.71(b).  \nSexually explicit material fell into this category if it \"by its \nnature or content pose[d] a threat to the security, good order, \nor discipline of the institution, or facilitate[d] criminal activi-\nty.\"  28 CFR s 540.71(b)(7).  Under this standard, explicit \nheterosexual material was ordinarily admitted.  See Thorn-\nburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 405 n.6 (1989).\n\n\n     In 1996 Congress passed the Ensign Amendment, which \nbars the use of Bureau of Prisons funds to pay for the \ndistribution of commercial material that \"is sexually explicit \nor features nudity.\" 1  See Omnibus Consolidated Appropria-\ntions Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208 s 614.2  Regulations \nlater adopted by the Bureau assign rather narrow meanings \nto these terms:  \"nudity\" means \"a pictorial depiction where \ngenitalia or female breasts are exposed\";  \"features\" means \nthat \"the publication contains depictions of nudity or sexually \nexplicit conduct on a routine or regular basis or promotes \nitself based upon such depictions in the case of individual one-\ntime issues.\"  Even material that otherwise would be said to \n\"feature nudity\" is excepted if it contains \"nudity illustrative \nof medical, educational, or anthropological content.\"  \"Sexual-\nly explicit\" means \"a pictorial depiction of actual or simulated \nsexual acts including sexual intercourse, oral sex, or mastur-\nbation.\"  28 CFR s 540.72(b).  Under these regulations, then, \nthere is no restriction whatever on non-pictorial sexually \nexplicit material.\n\n     In 1997, three inmates, each denied receipt of either Play-\nboy or Penthouse, filed separate suits alleging that the En-\nsign Amendment violated the First Amendment.  Their suits \nwere consolidated, along with similar suits filed by the pub-\nlishers of those magazines and a publishing trade organiza-\ntion;  the consolidated plaintiffs moved for injunctive relief.  \nThe district court, purporting to apply the test set out in \nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), found the Ensign \nAmendment facially invalid--implicitly granting plaintiffs' \n\n__________\n     1 By its terms, the statute therefore does not prohibit prisoners \nfrom obtaining such material at their own expense.  Neither party \nhas suggested that this is a realistic possibility, or discussed the \nrules governing gifts by visitors.  Accordingly, our analysis will \ntreat the spending restriction as a ban on distribution.  Where the \ngovernment absolutely monopolizes the means of speech or controls \na bottleneck, as we are assuming vis-a-vis the prison distribution \nsystem, a refusal to fund functions the same as an outright ban.\n\n     2 Identical language appears in s 614 of Pub. L. No. 105-119, \ngoverning the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, so no issue of \nmootness is currently posed.\n\n\n\nmotion for summary judgment (which, in fact, they never \nmade)--and permanently enjoined its enforcement.\n\n \n\n                                    * * *\n\n     Both sides agree that Safley sets out the appropriate \nframework for reviewing government regulation of prisons.3  \nBut before beginning that analysis, we must note that our \nfirst difference with the district court is as to the proper \nobject of judicial scrutiny.\n\n     Plaintiffs ask for relief against both the Ensign Amend-\nment and its implementing regulations.  The district court \nseemed to assume that the statute itself has been and will be \napplied to these plaintiffs;  accordingly, it directed its analysis \nprimarily towards the statute.  But there is no suggestion \nthat any warden does or will apply the statute directly;  so far \nas appears, all enforcement is mediated through the regula-\ntions.\n\n     Insofar as plaintiffs attack the proscriptions of the statute \nnot embodied in the regulations, they effectively pursue a \npre-enforcement challenge.  Even in the First Amendment \ncontext, such a challenge presents a justiciable controversy \nonly if the probability of enforcement is \"real and substan-\ntial.\"  Salvation Army v. Dep't of Comm. Affairs, 919 F.2d \n183, 192 (3d Cir. 1990);  see also Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. \n452, 460 (1974).  In the statutory borderland beyond the \nimplementing regulations (i.e., the statute's apparent ban on \nsome non-pictorial material, its vaguer language, and its lack \nof any exception for medical or educational material), the \nprospect of enforcement appears completely insubstantial.  It \nis as if the government had waived certain provisions of the \nlaw.  And with such a waiver, as Salvation Army explicitly \nholds, there is no standing to challenge the waived provisions.  \nSee 919 F.2d at 192-93 (\"[T]he district court should decline to \n\n__________\n     3 The claims of the publisher plaintiffs might seem to call for a \ndifferent analysis, as they of course are not prisoners.  Thornburgh \nmakes clear, however, that Safley's reasonableness standard gov-\nerns \"regulations that affect[ ] rights of prisoners and outsiders.\"  \n490 U.S. at 410 n.9.\n\nprovide an advisory opinion regarding the constitutionality of \nthese provisions.\").  See also Forsyth County, Georgia v. \nNationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 131 (1992) (evaluation of \nfacial challenge to statute must take into account construction \nby enforcing body).  We therefore limit our focus to the \nsubstantive prohibitions of the regulations.4\n\n \n\n                                    * * *\n\n     Cases analyzing constitutional claims by those within gov-\nernmental institutions such as prisons, public schools, the \nmilitary, or the government workplace often open with the \naxiom that the boundaries of those institutions do not sepa-\nrate inhabitants from their constitutional rights.  See, e.g., \nSafley, 482 U.S. at 84 (\"Prison walls do not form a barrier \nseparating prison inmates from the protections of the Consti-\ntution.\");  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983) (\"[I]t \nhas been settled that a State cannot condition public employ-\nment on a basis that infringes the employee's constitutionally \nprotected interest in freedom of expression.\");  Tinker v. Des \nMoines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, \n506 (1969) (\"It can hardly be argued that either students or \nteachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech \nor expression at the schoolhouse gate.\");  General Media \nCommunications, Inc. v. Cohen, (\"GMC \") 131 F.3d 273, 276 \n(2d Cir. 1997) (\"The Constitution does not, of course, stop at \nthe gates of a military base.\").  This observation is invariably \nfollowed by the complementary principle that by their nature \nsuch environments must allow regulation more intrusive than \nwhat may lawfully apply to the general public.  See Safley, \n482 U.S. at 84-85;  Connick, 461 U.S. at 143;  Tinker, 393 U.S. \nat 507;  GMC, 131 F.3d at 276.  In these environments, the \ngovernment is permitted to balance constitutional rights \n\n__________\n     4 Our dissenting colleague relies on two recent decisions invalidat-\ning provisions that are more similar to the statute than to the \nregulatory intepretation established in this case.  Mauro v. Arpaio, \n1998 WL 550190 (9th Cir. Sept. 1, 1998);  Waterman v. Verniero, \n1998 WL 354932 (D.N.J. June 29, 1998).  See Dissent at 1-2 n.1.  \nBecause we see the only ripe case before us as confined to the \nregulations, our case is plainly distinguishable.\n\n\nagainst institutional efficiency in ways it may not ordinarily \ndo.5  See, e.g., Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 675 (1994) \n(describing governmental power to restrict speech in the \nname of efficiency);  Safley, 482 U.S. at 88 (noting balancing \nbetween First Amendment rights and governmental inter-\nests).\n\n     For the prison context, Safley directs courts to uphold a \nregulation, even one circumscribing constitutionally protected \ninterests, so long as it \"is reasonably related to legitimate \npenological interests.\"  482 U.S. at 89.  We are to assess the \noverall reasonableness of such restrictions with attention to \nfour factors:  first, whether the restriction bears a \"valid, \nrational connection\" to the \"legitimate governmental interest \nput forward to justify it,\" such that the \"asserted goal is [not] \nso remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational,\" id. \nat 89-90;  second, whether inmates retain alternative means \nof exercising the circumscribed right, id. at 90;  third, the \ncosts that accommodating the right imposes on other inmates, \nguards, and prison resources generally, id.;  and fourth, \nwhether there are alternatives to the regulation that \"fully \naccommodate[ ] the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to \nvalid penological interests,\" id. at 90-91.  Although the fac-\ntors are intended as guides to a single reasonableness stan-\ndard, see id. at 89;  see also Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 414 \n(\"The Court in [Safley] identified several factors that are \nrelevant to, and that serve to channel, the reasonableness \ninquiry.\"), the first factor looms especially large.  Its rational-\nity inquiry tends to encompass the remaining factors, and \nsome of its criteria are apparently necessary conditions.  \nNothing can save a regulation that promotes an illegitimate \nor non-neutral goal.  See Safley, 482 U.S. at 90.\n\n__________\n     5 This distinction is often phrased in terms of differential stan-\ndards of review applicable to the government when it acts in roles \nother than sovereign.  See, e.g., Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, \n671 (1994).  But it may be more apt to conceive of it as a distinction \nbetween government regulation of public discourse generally, and \ngovernment regulation of speech within governmental institutions.  \nSee generally Robert Post, Constitutional Domains 199-268 (1995).\n\n\n\f\n     In this case, both proponents in congressional debate, and \nthe government in its briefs here, assert as the goal an \ninterest in the rehabilitation of prisoners.  See, e.g., 142 \nCong. Rec. H8261 (daily ed.  July 24, 1996) (\"Congress \nshould not be fueling the sexual appetites of offenders, espe-\ncially those who have been convicted of despicable sex of-\nfenses against women and children.  Magazines that portray \nand exploit sex acts have no place in the rehabilitative envi-\nronment of prisons, nor should we pay Bureau of Prison[s] \nstaff to distribute them.\") (statement of Rep. Ensign);  id. at \nH8262 (\"The infamous serial killer Ted Bundy ... stated \nbefore his death his belief that pornographic materials direct-\nly contributed to his violent crimes.  While a number of \nfactors determine whether a prisoner will become a law-\nabiding citizen upon release from prison, cutting prisoners off \nfrom their sexually explicit magazines will certainly do no \nharm.\") (statement of Rep. Ensign).  The next question is \nwhether rehabilitation is a legitimate and \"neutral\" govern-\nment interest within the meaning of Safley.\n\n     The legitimacy of the rehabilitative purpose appears indis-\nputable.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has often characterized \nrehabilitation as one of the primary goals of penal institu-\ntions.  See, e.g., O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, \n348 (1987) (describing rehabilitation as \"valid penological \nobjective[ ]\");  Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 413 (1974) \n(identifying \"substantial government interests of security, \norder, and rehabilitation\").  At least since the mid-19th cen-\ntury, it is hard to imagine a prison system that did not seek \nto reduce the likelihood that prisoners would again transgress \nsociety's norms.  The inventors of the prison in New York \nand Pennsylvania framed its goals in these terms:\n\n          The penitentiary, free of corruptions and dedicated to \n     the proper training of the inmate, would inculcate the \n     discipline that negligent parents, evil companions, tav-\n     erns, houses of prostitution, theaters, and gambling halls \n     had destroyed.  Just as the criminal's environment had \n     led him into crime, the institutional environment would \n     lead him out of it.\n\nDavid J. Rothman, The Invention of the Asylum:  Social \nOrder and Disorder in the New Republic 82-83 (rev. ed. \n1990).\n\n     In turning to \"neutrality,\" the district court looked at the \nstatute itself, not the goal, and found it non-neutral.  \"[T]he \nEnsign Amendment is a content-based statute with a sole \nfocus on the sexual nature of the publications it seeks to \nprohibit.\"  The conclusion is correct--the Ensign Amendment \nis formulated in terms of content.  But we do not understand \nthat characteristic to run afoul of Safley's neutrality require-\nment.  Despite the apparent similarity in terms, \"neutrality\" \nin the Safley sense is quite different from the familiar First \nAmendment notion of \"content-neutrality.\"  The Court most \nrecently explained in Thornburgh that \"neutral\" here means \nno more than that \"the regulation or practice in question \nmust further an important or substantial governmental inter-\nest unrelated to the suppression of expression.\"  490 U.S. at \n415 (quoting Martinez).  There the Court found neutrality \nsimply because in application of the regulations the prison \nadministrators were to \"draw distinctions between publica-\ntions solely on the basis of their potential implications for \nprison security.\"  Id.  It pointed out that the regulations \nstruck down in Martinez, in contrast, barred writings that \n\"unduly complain[ed]\" or \"magnif[ied] grievances,\" or ex-\npressed \"inflammatory\" views, thus inviting the prison au-\nthorities \" 'to apply their own personal prejudices and opin-\nions as standards for prisoner mail censorship.' \"  490 U.S. at \n416 n.14 (quoting Martinez);  see also Martinez, 416 U.S. at \n415 (striking down regulations because no legitimate interest \nat all was offered as justification).  Thus the Martinez regula-\ntions were \"decidedly not 'neutral' in the relevant sense.\"  \nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 416 n.14.\n\n     The rehabilitative interest offered by the government here \nmeets this rather thin neutrality requirement.  The Court \ncannot have meant to insist upon neutrality in its classic First \nAmendment sense, as embodied, for example, in the dictum of \nGertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339 (1974), that \n\"[u]nder the First Amendment, there is no such thing as a \nfalse idea.\"  In its role as an operator of prisons, the govern-\nment surely does not lapse from the required neutrality if it \nbans \"how-to\" manuals on fraud and embezzlement (\"Fraud \nfor Dummies\").  The idea that committing such crimes is not \n\n\n\f\nproper may not be \"false\" in the Gertz sense, but in the \nprison context the government may oppose it rather absolute-\nly.  This authority cannot be explained away on the theory \nthat such a ban could withstand even the strictest scrutiny \nand that its validity therefore tells us nothing of the \"neutrali-\nty\" requirement;  as voiced by the Court, the \"neutrality\" \nrequirement is an absolute prerequisite.  Accordingly, we \nthink the Court's actual application of the requirement, with \nits focus on the existence of some legitimate goal and on \nassuring that rules are in fact not framed so as to advance \nillegitimate or unvetted goals, must control our understanding \nof its meaning.\n\n     That government power to inculcate values conflicts with \nthe libertarian premises of the First Amendment is clear, but \nsuch power is well established.  Even outside special govern-\nmental institutions, the state has some authority to become a \nplayer in the marketplace of ideas.  It may commission \nadvertising urging children to stay in school or off drugs;  it \ncan sponsor anti-violence campaigns.  See Regan v. Taxation \nwith Representation, 461 U.S. 540, 548-59 (1983);  see gener-\nally Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991) (\"The Govern-\nment can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund \na program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in \nthe public interest, without at the same time funding an \nalternate program which seeks to deal with the problem in \nanother way.\").\n\n     And within its own institutions, government's power to \npursue its legitimate goals is elevated:  within reasonable \nlimits, it may attach sanctions to or exclude speech that \nthreatens its goals--even if those goals include promotion of \nparticular values.  That is the general lesson of cases such as \nWaters, 511 U.S. 661 (upholding dismissal of employee for \nspeech that might have caused disruption);  Bethel School \nDist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 685 (1986) (upholding \nsuspension of student who used indecent language in assem-\nbly speech);  and Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976) (uphold-\ning exclusion from military base of civilians who wished to \ndistribute political literature).\n\n\n\f\n     Of course this does not mean by a long shot that every \ngovernment institution can pursue any value.  Our century \nhas seen more than enough of governments trying to act as \nengineers of human souls.  But inculcation of values cannot \nbe characterized as a suppression of expression in every \ncontext.  The Supreme Court has in fact taken the position \nthat democratic society depends on inculcation of democratic \nvalues.  See, e.g., Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 76-77 \n(1979) (stating that public schools are important \"in the \npreparation of individuals for participation as citizens, and in \nthe preservation of the values on which our society rests\");  \nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493, (1954) \n(\"[Public education] is a principal instrument in awakening \nthe child to cultural values, in preparing him for later profes-\nsional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his \nenvironment.\").  The generality of Safley's reasonableness \ntest, and common sense as well, suggest that the flexibility \nopen to the political branches must be at its apogee in \ninstitutions for the care and custody of those who have \nalready transgressed society's norms.  If \"promoting respect \nfor authority and traditional values\" among schoolchildren is \na legitimate interest of government and not inherently a form \nof speech suppression, see Board of Education, Island Trees \nUnion Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 864 \n(1982) (plurality opinion), surely the same is true of promot-\ning such a goal among criminals.\n\n     Prisoners of course differ from the other examples of \nindividuals entangled with the government in that they have \nno recourse to a private sphere.  For them, there is no \noutside.  Judges plainly must bear in mind the total occupa-\ntion of prisoners' lives by the state.  But prisoners find \nthemselves in the maw of the state not because they have \nbeen drawn there by the promise of government wages, nor \nbecause a statute imposes a universal requirement of edu-\ncation, but because they have broken the law.  Moreover, \neven government workers have suffered a similar eclipse of \nthe private sphere;  the government's ability to fire them for \nspeech that threatens workplace disruption is not limited to \nspeech within the workplace.  See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of \n\n\n\f\nEducation, 391 U.S. 563 (1968) (analyzing letter to the edi-\ntor).  See generally Note, The Costs of Agencies:  Waters v. \nChurchill and the First Amendment in the Administrative \nState, 106 Yale L.J. 1233, 1239-40 (1997) (discussing scope of \ngovernmental authority).  Accordingly, we conclude that re-\nhabilitation, and such character-moulding as may be implicit \ntherein, constitute legitimate and neutral goals as those are \nunderstood in Safley.\n\n \n\n                                    * * *\n\n\n     We thus turn to whether there is a \"valid rational connec-\ntion\" between the interest and the regulations.  Prison juris-\nprudence is not well enough developed to indicate precisely \nhow demanding the requirement of rational means-end con-\nnection is.  But the similarity between Safley's phrasing and \nthe language of rational basis review suggests to us that, as \nfar as the means-end fit is concerned, Safley's standard is, if \nnot identical, something very similar.  Compare, e.g., Nord-\nlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11 (1992) (\"[T]he relationship of \nthe classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render \nthe distinction arbitrary or irrational.\") with Safley, 482 U.S. \nat 89-90 (\"[T]he logical connection between the regulation \nand the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy \narbitrary or irrational.\").\n\n     The legislative judgment is that pornography adversely \naffects rehabilitation.  It does not matter whether we agree \nwith the legislature, only whether we find its judgment \nrational.  The question for us is not whether the regulation in \nfact advances the government interest, only whether the \nlegislature might reasonably have thought that it would.  See, \ne.g., Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 11.\n\n     We think that the government could rationally have seen a \nconnection between pornography and rehabilitative values.  \nCongress might well perceive pornography as tending gener-\nally to thwart the character growth of its consumers.  One \ncurrent exposition of this view sees pornography as treating \nwomen purely as objects of male sexual gratification.  See, \ne.g., Catharine A. MacKinnon, Only Words 108-10;  Mac-\n\nKinnon, \"Francis Biddle's Sister:  Pornography, Civil Rights, \nand Speech,\" in Feminism Unmodified 163, 174 (1987);  Mar-\ntha C. Nussbaum, \"Objectification,\" 25 Phil. & Pub. Affairs \n249, 283-86 (1995);  Cass Sunstein, The Partial Constitution \n257-90 (1993).  But this viewpoint shares at least a core with \nideas that have a lineage of a few centuries, perhaps millen-\nnia, stressing the desirability of deferring gratification, of \nsublimation of sexual impulses, of channeling sexual expres-\nsion into long-term relationships of caring and affection, of \njoining eros to agape.  The supposition that exclusion of \npornography from prisons will have much of an impact in this \ndirection may be optimistic, but it is not irrational.\n\n     There is, of course, no \"record evidence,\" and certainly no \nsophisticated multiple regression analyses or other social \nscience data, to support this belief--a fact our dissenting \ncolleague finds fatal.  See Dissent at 8-11.  We do not think, \nhowever, that common sense must be the mere handmaiden \nof social science data or expert testimonials in evaluating \ncongressional judgments.  Quite the opposite:  scientific stud-\nies can have a corrective effect by establishing an apparently \nimplausible connection or refuting an apparently obvious one, \nbut, subject to such corrections, conformity to commonsensi-\ncal intuitive judgments is a standard element of both reason-\nableness and rationality.  Compare D.N. McCloskey, The \nRhetoric of Economics 44 (1985) (\"Not all regression analyses \nare more persuasive than all moral arguments;  not all con-\ntrolled experiments are more persuasive than all introspec-\ntions.  People should not discriminate against propositions on \nthe basis of epistemological origin.  There are some subjec-\ntive, soft, vague propositions that are more persuasive than \nsome objective, hard, precise propositions.\")  Nor do we think \nSafley requires more.  In that case, the Court scoured the \nrecord for evidence of a rational link between the asserted \nsecurity interests and the marriage ban because common \nsense does not suggest any.  See Safley, 482 U.S. at 97-100.  \nHere, the regulations restrict prison consumption of publica-\ntions that implicitly elevate the value of the viewer's immedi-\nate sexual gratification over the values of respect and consid-\neration for others.  Common sense tells us that prisoners are \n\n\n\f\nmore likely to develop the now-missing self-control and re-\nspect for others if prevented from poring over pictures that \nare themselves degrading and disrespectful.\n\n     Nor can we find irrationality in a congressional fear that \npornography may set back rehabilitation in the narrower \nsense, more directly related to recidivist activity.  The briefs, \nparticularly that of the amicus curiae, call our attention to \nstudies purporting either to document or to demolish the \ncausal link between pornography and sex crimes.6  Without \nattempting a comprehensive summary, we note a few.  One \nconcludes that exposing \"already angered men\" (probably not \nespecially rare in prison) to nonviolent pornography can lead \nto short-term increases in their aggressiveness.  Edward \nDonnerstein, et al., The Question of Pornography 40-48 \n(1987).  Another finds that \"pornography provides ideational \nsupport for rape....\"  Larry Baron & Murray A. Straus, \nFour Theories of Rape in American Society 185 (1989).  \nBaron & Straus's primary evidence for this claim is an \nobserved correlation between the circulation rates of sex \nmagazines and reported rape rates.  While they are hesitant \nto defend a \"cause-effect\" link between pornography and \nrape, they do see the correlation as explained by \"the pres-\nence of a hypermasculine or macho culture pattern.\"  Id. at \n186.  This cultural pattern, Baron and Straus hypothesize, \ncauses both higher incidence of rape and higher consumption \nof pornography.  Of course, it seems quite likely that a \nculture and its manifestations have a mutually reinforcing \nrelationship, so that a prohibition of pornography is a reason-\nable element of a struggle against machismo and its ill effects.\n\n     Finally, there is a significant body of research showing \nthat long-term exposure to pornography, particularly pornog-\n\n__________\n     6 Congress did not cite these materials, an omission of no impor-\ntance.  See Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 365 n.13 (1983).  \nOur concern is not why Congress believed that pornography affect-\ned rehabilitation, but whether it would have been rational so to \nbelieve.  Cf. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 117 S. Ct. \n1174, 1197 (1997) (\"Congress is not obligated, when enacting its \nstatutes, to make a record of the type that an administrative agency \nor court does to accommodate judicial review.\").\n\n\nraphy containing scenes of \"aggressive sexuality,\" can make \nits (male) audience more aggressive, more tolerant of violence \nagainst women, and more susceptible to myths about rape, \nsuch as the notion that women can enjoy being raped.  See \nNeil Malamuth, \"Aggression against Women:  Cultural and \nIndividual Causes,\" in Malamuth & Donnerstein, 19, 32-39;  \nsee also Mike Allen et al., \"Exposure to Pornography and \nAcceptance of Rape Myths,\" 45 J. Communication 5 (1995) \n(\"Although the experimental studies demonstrate that violent \npornography has more effect [inducing rape myth acceptance] \nthan nonviolent pornography, nonviolent pornography still \ndemonstrates an effect.\")  See also Richard A. Posner, Sex \nand Reason, 366-71 (1992) (noting inconclusiveness of social \nscience findings on net effects of pornography on incidence of \nrape;  pornography may tend to increase rape by its ideologi-\ncal and aphrodisiac effects, but may tend to decrease it by \nenhancing a substitute (masturbation), the balance of these \neffects being unknown).\n\n     The point of this is not to suggest that a causal link has \nbeen shown.  The array of academic authority on the other \nside is at least as substantial, and quite possibly more so.  \nBut even undertaking to weigh the competing scholarship \nwould misconceive the judicial role.  Dealing with legislative \njudgments about rehabilitation, the Supreme Court has said \nthat \"[w]hen Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught \nwith medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options \nmust be especially broad and courts should be cautious not to \nrewrite legislation, even assuming, arguendo, that judges with \nmore direct exposure to the problem might make wiser \nchoices.\"  Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974) \n(emphasis in original);  see also Kansas v. Hendricks, 117 S. \nCt. 2072, 2081 n.3 (1997).  And in upholding a statute barring \nprovision of sexually explicit material to minors, the Court \nnoted that \"while these studies all agree that a causal link \n[between exposure to explicit material and impaired ethical \nand moral development] has not been demonstrated, they are \nequally agreed that a causal link has not been disproved \neither.\"  Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 642 (1968) \n(internal quotation omitted);  see also American Booksellers \n\n\n\f\nAss'n v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 329 n.3 (7th Cir. 1985).  The \nsame uncertainty prevails here, and suffices to place the \nlegislative judgment within the realm of reason under the \nstandards applicable to the political branches' management of \nprisons.\n\n     The evidence is simply not conclusive on the efficacy of a \nban on pornography in promoting prisoners' rehabilitation.  \nFor judges seeking only a reasonable connection between \nlegislative goals and actions, scientific indeterminacy is deter-\nminative.\n \n\n                                    * * *\n\n     The remaining Safley factors further substantiate the over-\nall reasonableness of the regulations.  The second involves \nthe prisoners' alternative means of exercising the right at \nstake.  Of course if the \"right\" at stake is defined in terms of \nthe materials excluded by the ban, any regulation will come \nup short.  The Court accordingly observed in Thornburgh \nthat the relevant right \"must be viewed sensibly and expan-\nsively,\" 490 U.S. at 417, though it stated no method for \nactually carrying out the definitional process.  In Thorn-\nburgh, where the regulation barred all \"sexually explicit \nmaterial which by its nature or content poses a threat to the \nsecurity, good order, or discipline of the institution, or facili-\ntates criminal activity,\" id. at 405 n.5, the Court found the \nsecond factor \"clearly satisfied\" because \"the regulations \n[there at issue] permit a broad range of publications to be \nsent, received, and read,\" id. at 418.  In so doing, it made no \ninquiry into the scope of sexually explicit material not covered \nby the ban.  Thus, unless there is some minimum entitlement \nto smut in prison, the origins of which must be obscure, this \nfactor can hardly be fatal.7\n\n     The third Safley factor concerns the adverse impact \"on \nguards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison \n\n__________\n     7 Even if there were such a bizarre entitlement, the regulations \nwould still satisfy this factor, as they leave the inmate free to enjoy \nall written forms of smut not barred by the regulations upheld in \nThornburgh.\n\nresources\" of accommodating the right claimed.  482 U.S. at \n90.  It thus seems in part a restatement of the deferential \nbalancing called for under the first factor:  if Congress may \nreasonably conclude that pornography increases the risk of \nprison rape, then the adverse impact is substantial.  Accom-\nmodating the right poses a threat to the safety of guards and \nother inmates.  The issue of the allocation of prison resources \nwe take up below;  we think the third and fourth factors are \nstrongly interrelated.\n\n     The fourth Safley factor poses the question whether there \nare alternatives that can accommodate that right \"at de \nminimis costs to valid penological interests.\"  Safley, 482 \nU.S. at 91.  This is not, the Court emphasized, a \" 'least \nrestrictive alternative' test.\"  Id. at 90.  The most obvious \nalternative is a detailed prisoner-by-prisoner (and presumably \npublication-by-publication) sifting to determine whether a \nparticular publication will harm the rehabilitation of a particu-\nlar prisoner.  The costs of this approach seem far from de \nminimis.  Apart from the purely administrative burden of \nsuch a process, the exercise of such broad discretion seems \nhighly conducive to just the sort of conflicting decisions that \ngive bite to vagueness concerns.  And the reality is that \nprisoners are likely to pass pornographic materials about, so \nthat prisoner-by-prisoner determinations may run aground on \nthe \"ripple effect\" that the Court mentioned in Safley, 482 \nU.S. at 90.  Even if pornography could be directed only to \nthose not likely to be adversely affected, it could find its way \nto others, interfering with their rehabilitation and increasing \nthreats to safety.\n\n     Of course the flip side of avoiding the costs and hazards of \na grant of broad discretion to wardens is the possibility of \npreventing delivery of materials that, either generally or for a \nspecific set of (effectively segregated) prisoners, pose little or \nno threat of the harm Congress sought to diminish.  Outside \nprison walls this concern is addressed by the overbreadth \ndoctrine.  Here it seems to us captured in part by the \ndemand for a rational relation between the regulation and the \ngoal, and by consideration of alternatives under the fourth \n\"factor.\"  Thus, the objections to a more flexible standard--\n\n\n\f\nsuch as one that would vest discretion in wardens to prevent \ndelivery of materials in any case where in his judgment it \nwould impair a specific prisoner's rehabilitation--go a long \nway to rebut the claim.\n\n     The dissent, nonetheless, seems to regard only such a case-\nby-case approach as constitutional, and makes much of vari-\nous hypothetical situations in which the categorical ban could \nunneccessarily exclude certain publications.  See Dissent at \n15-21.  To the extent that these hypotheticals assume direct \nenforcement of the Ensign Amendment, the likelihood of such \nenforcement is, as we have noted, quite remote and not \nbefore us in this case.  Further, the actions of the Bureau of \nPrisons also suggest that the likelihood of this sort of exclu-\nsion under the actual regulatory scheme is remote.  The \nBureau's Program Statement, for example, listing examples \nof permissible publications, cites National Geographic;  Our \nBod[ies], Our Selves;  Sports Illustrated (Swimsuit Edition);  \nand the Victoria's Secret Catalog.  P.S. 5266.07, at 7. We find \nit all but impossible to believe that the Swimsuit Edition and \nVictoria's Secret pass muster while Michelangelo's David or \nconcentration camp pictures fail;  nor has there been any \nsuggestion that any prison official has attempted to imple-\nment such a bizarre interpretation.  As there is no allegation \nthat women in segregated women's prisons are demanding \nPlayboy, neither the possibility of such demand nor the \nBureau's possible response assists plaintiffs in their over-\nbreadth claim.8\n\n     Leaving aside these possible fringe applications of the \nregulation, we again note that the regulation by its terms only \nrestricts pictures;  a prisoner may read anything he pleases.  \n\n__________\n     8 To the extent that the Dissent's insistence on individualized \ndeterminations turns on a view that general rules with any impact \non First Amendment values must correspond to the underlying \nreason in every application, see, e.g., Dissent at 1 (suggesting that \ngovernment must show that \"any pictorial display of nudity or \nsexual activity will be harmful to the rehabilitation of all prisoners\") \n(emphasis in original), it asserts a burden that few general rules \ncould satisfy.\n\n\n\nThe dissent's appeal to the value of ideas, pointing by way of \nexample to the vistas opened for Malcolm X by his prison \nreading, see Dissent at 15-16, thus makes little sense here.  \nCongress could, we think, reasonably be skeptical of the \nproposition that study of the pictures in Penthouse would \nhelp a prisoner become \"an intelligent customer in the mar-\nketplace of ideas.\"  If anything, the ban could strengthen the \nimpact of literature by removing the distraction of pictures \nthat in almost every case would be pornographic.\n\n     In any event, even under conventional overbreadth doc-\ntrine outside of prison, overbreadth claims by those on the \nmargins of pornography have fared poorly.  See, e.g., Young \nv. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 61 (1976) \n(\"Since there is surely a less vital interest in the uninhibited \nexhibition of material that is on the borderline between \npornography and artistic expression than in the free dissemi-\nnation of ideas of social and political significance ... we think \nthis is an inappropriate case in which to adjudicate the \nhypothetical claims of persons not before the Court.\")  And \nregardless of the type of speech at issue, narrow or improba-\nble excesses of a statute are not a ground for invalidation \nbefore application shows their reality:\n\n     [W]here a statute regulates expressive conduct, the scope \n     of the statute does not render it unconstitutional unless \n     its overbreadth is not only \"real, but substantial as well, \n     judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate \n     sweep.\"  Even where a statute at its margins infringes \n     on protected expression, \"facial invalidation is inappropri-\n     ate if the 'remainder of the statute ... covers a whole \n     range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscriba-\n     ble ... conduct....' \"\n\nOsborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 112 (1990) (citations omitted) \n(ellipses in original).  Accordingly, such problems of applica-\ntion can be left to the time when, if ever, they arise.\n\n     We find that the statute and regulation satisfy Safley's \ndemand for reasonableness, scoring adequately on all four \nfactors.\n\n\n\f\n                                    * * *\n\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that if we are unpersuaded by the district \ncourt's analysis we should remand the case to allow them to \nintroduce evidence supporting their position.  But that sug-\ngestion misconceives the legal issue under Safley.  The ques-\ntion is not whether curtailment of pictorial smut will advance \nthe prisons' rehabilitative project, but whether Congress \ncould reasonably have believed that it would do so.  The \nstudies cited above, coupled with Congress's implicit appeal to \nethical norms against the undue stimulation of carnal appe-\ntites, indicate the reasonableness of such a belief.  If the \nBureau of Prisons applies the regulations in a manner that \nwould violate the Safley priciples, of course, that would be \nanother case.  Accordingly, the district court should have \ngranted the defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' com-\nplaint insofar as that complaint rested upon Safley.\n\n \n                                    * * *\n\n     Besides the overbreadth issue, which we have already \naddressed in the Safley context, plaintiffs have raised two \nadditional theories--excessive vagueness and a claim that the \nregulations' distinction between pictorial and verbal works is \ncontent-based.  In fact, the distinction between pictorial and \nverbal works seems more directed to form than to content, \nand in any event we have seen that Safley's neutrality \nrequirement both displaces conventional First Amendment \nstrictures on content-based limits and is satisfied by these \nregulations.  Although Safley may well function as an all-\nencompassing free speech test for the circulation of reading \nmaterials in prison, supplanting otherwise applicable First \nAmendment doctrine, it may be that plaintiffs' vagueness \nclaim has independent force.  If it did, of course, the role of \nthe Bureau of Prisons, as manager rather than as law enforc-\ner, might well play an important role in resolution of the \nclaim.  Accordingly, as the district court has not addressed \nthese vagueness issues, we remand the case for it to do so.  \nIn the meantime, we lift the permanent injunction that it has \nimposed on enforcement of the regulations.\n\n                                                                                  So ordered.\n\n      Wald, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  The prohibition to all \nfederal prisoners of publications \"featuring nudity\" or depict-\ning \"sexually explicit\" activities indisputably raises First \nAmendment concerns.  See, e.g., Reno v. American Civil \nLiberties Union, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 2346 (1997) (\"In evaluating \nthe free speech rights of adults, we have made it perfectly \nclear that sexual expression which is indecent but not obscene \nis protected by the First Amendment.\") (internal quotation \nomitted);  Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 143 (1943) \n(noting that the right of freedom of speech \"necessarily \nprotects the right to receive [publications]\").  Indeed, if the \nFirst Amendment, at its core, is designed to promote the free \nexchange of ideas, the debate in this case goes to the very \nheart of its protections.  The government argues that the \nreason all publications featuring nudity or sexually explicit \nmaterial, whether or not they are pornographic or obscene, \nshould be withheld from all federal prisoners is that any \npictorial display of nudity or sexual activity communicates \nmessages that are harmful to the rehabilitation of all prison-\ners.  Relying on what it claims to be the inherent reasonable-\nness of a legislative judgment that such materials are always \ninimical to rehabilitation, the government throughout this \ncase has steadfastly resisted creating any kind of record to \nsupport such a wide-reaching incursion on the constitutional \nrights of incarcerated individuals.  Today, the majority un-\nquestioningly endorses the government's approach.  Because \nI believe this result sets an unwise and arbitrary precedent \nthat runs contrary to prior case law, I respectfully dissent.1\n\n__________\n     1 I find it very significant that two of our sister courts have \nrecently reached results opposite from that set forth by the majori-\nty today.  In Mauro v. Arpaio, 1998 WL 550190 (9th Cir. Sept. 1, \n1998), the Ninth Circuit invalidated a county prison system's ban on \nthe possession of all materials containing \"any graphic representa-\ntion of frontal nudity.\"  Although the county claimed that its \ninterests in safety, the rehabilitation of inmates, and the reduction \nof sexual harassment of guards supported such a ban, the court held \nthat the county had not \"carried its burden to show that such a far \nreaching prohibition is 'reasonably related' to legitimate penological \ninterests\";  in particular, it had \"offer[ed] no proof or reasoned \n\n\n\f\n     It appears to need restating once again that prisoners do \nnot lose all their constitutional rights when the prison door \nclangs behind them.  While the prison gate may serve to \nisolate those inside from the outside world, it does not, as the \nSupreme Court has taken pains to emphasize, \"form a barrier \nseparating prison inmates from the protections of the Consti-\ntution.\"  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987).  Although \nthe majority pays lip service to this canon, it ignores an \nimportant corollary:  Whatever sentiments we might hold \nregarding prisoners for the crimes they have committed, \nthese sentiments must not infect our determination of the \nprisoners' constitutional rights.  Indeed, the Supreme Court \nhas recently reaffirmed, albeit in a different context, that \" 'a \nbare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot \nconstitute a legitimate governmental interest.' \"  Romer v. \nEvans, 517 U.S. 620, 634 (1996) (quoting Department of \nAgriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973)) (invalidating \nstate constitutional amendment prohibiting official action de-\nsigned to protect homosexual persons from discrimination).  \nSo long as prisoners retain constitutional rights, including \nFirst Amendment rights, see O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 \nU.S. 342, 348 (1987) (\"Inmates clearly retain protections \n\n__________\nexplanation\" for the ban.  Id. at *7. And in Waterman v. Verniero, \n1998 WL 416585 (D.N.J. July 22, 1998), a district court invalidated a \nstate statute prohibiting inmates in a specialized facility for sex \noffenders from possessing or obtaining \"sexually oriented materi-\nals\" (defined as any description or depiction of \"sexual activity or \nassociated anatomical area\";  see Waterman v. Verniero, 1998 WL \n354932, at *4 (D.N.J. June 29, 1998) (preliminary injunction)).  \nDespite the state's claim that such materials would disrupt the \nrehabilitation of sex offenders at the institution, the court held that \nthe state legislature that enacted the ban was motivated by public \noutrage over pedophiliac crimes rather than rehabilitative interests.  \nWaterman, 1998 WL 416585, at *3.  Moreover, the court noted, the \nliterature on the effects of such publications was too unsettled to \nsupport a finding that a rational relationship existed between the \nban and rehabilitative interests.  Id.  In both cases, the courts \nfound the broad scope of the ban, in particular its application to \npublications featuring nudity, to be unjustifiable in light of any \nevidence advanced by the government to support it.\n\n\n\nafforded by the First Amendment ....\"), our duty is to \nensure that these rights are not impermissibly curtailed.2\n\n     It is equally true, however, that the unique and difficult \ntask of running a prison will often necessitate some incursion \non inmates' constitutional rights.  A prisoner's desire to leave \nthe prison once a week to attend religious services, for \nexample, or his desire to correspond with other inmates may \nconflict with the prison's need to maintain institutional securi-\nty.  In these instances, courts must give a large measure of \ndeference to the prison administrators who are actively in-\nvolved in the daily operations of the institution.  Courts are \nnot in the best position to judge when or in what manner \ncertain institutional interests may require some action on the \npart of prison officials to respond to the \"complex and intract-\nable\" problems of prison administration.  Procunier v. Mar-\ntinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974), overruled in part by Thorn-\nburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401 (1989).  Most of these problems, \nas the Supreme Court reminds us, \"require expertise, com-\nprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of \nwhich are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and \nexecutive branches of government.\"  Id.\n\n     As the majority has duly noted, the Court's standard in \nSafley recognizes the need to forge a balance between the \ncompeting interests of prison administration and prisoners' \nconstitutional rights.  As I read this standard, it embraces \ntwo principles.  First, fundamental rights of prisoners must \ngive way to governmental concerns more readily than the \n\n__________\n     2 As our Chief Judge has previously noted,\n\n     the special place of prisoners in our society makes them more \n     dependent on judicial protection than perhaps any other group.  \n     Few minorities are so \"discrete and insular,\" so little able to \n     defend their interests through participation in the political \n     process, so vulnerable to oppression by an unsympathetic ma-\n     jority.  Federal courts have a special responsibility to ensure \n     that the members of such defenseless groups are not deprived \n     of their constitutional rights.\n\nDoe v. District of Columbia, 701 F.2d 948, 960 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1983) \n(separate statement of Edwards, J.).\n\n\nfundamental rights of nonprisoners.  In adopting a test \"less \nrestrictive than that ordinarily applied to alleged infringe-\nments of fundamental constitutional rights,\" O'Lone, 482 U.S. \nat 349, the Court intended to ensure that \"courts afford \nappropriate deference to prison officials,\" id.  To require that \nprison regulations infringing upon fundamental rights under-\ngo strict scrutiny, as they would outside the prison context, \nwould place an inordinately high obstacle in the way of prison \nadministrators' attempts to run their institution safely and \nefficiently.  Second, and significantly, the Court did not in-\ntend Safley 's lesser standard of review to negate prisoners' \nconstitutional rights altogether, as the majority seems to \nsuggest.  The Court did not say, for example, that prison \nregulations are valid if there is any conceivable basis for their \nexistence, as rational basis review is typically formulated.  \nSee, e.g., United States R.R. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. \n166, 179 (1980) (noting that where, under rational basis \nreview, \"there are plausible reasons for Congress' action, our \ninquiry is at an end\").  Rather, the task for courts is to \ndetermine, while giving appropriate deference to the judg-\nment of prison officials, whether a challenged regulation is, in \nfact, reasonable or whether it is an \"exaggerated response\" to \nthe \"legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify \nit.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 89-90 (emphasis added);  see also \nLaurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1445 n.21 \n(2d ed.  1988) (\"Any limit placed on the Court's imagination \nvis-a-vis legislative purpose must be recognized as a tightened \nform of scrutiny.\").  A governmental institution is permitted \n\"regulation more intrusive than what may lawfully apply to \nthe general public,\" Majority Opinion (\"Maj.Op.\") at 5, not \nsimply because of its status but rather because of the identifi-\nable, and unique, needs of that institution.  And although the \nneed for flexibility is perhaps at its highest in the prison \nenvironment, the need for limits on that flexibility is also \nparamount:  Unlike government employees, students, or other \nparticipants in governmental institutions, prisoners have no \nchoice about whether to be subject to the power of the state.\n\n     To read Safley--as the majority appears to--as permitting \nunblinking deference to any \"plausible\" legislative judgment \n\n\n\f\nabout the \"rehabilitative\" benefits of denying a prisoner's \nmost fundamental constitutional right, i.e., her freedom to \nread, renders any and all prisoners' constitutional rights a \nnullity.  I had thought it went without saying that courts do \nnot rely on the mere assertion of a regulation's drafters that \nthe regulation is reasonable;  to do so would amount to an \nabdication of our judicial role.  See, e.g., Salaam v. Lockhart, \n905 F.2d 1168, 1171 (8th Cir. 1990) (\"We would misconstrue \n[Thornburgh, O'Lone, and Safley ] if we deferred not only to \nthe choices between reasonable policies made by prison offi-\ncials but to their justifications for the policies as well.\");  \nCampbell v. Miller, 787 F.2d 217, 227 n.17 (7th Cir. 1986) \n(\"[D]eference to the administrative expertise and discretion-\nary authority of correctional officials must be schooled, not \nabsolute.\").  Nor can the judicial role be diminished to the \ndisappearing point solely because the original decisionmaking \nbody in this case is Congress itself rather than the Bureau of \nPrisons (\"BOP\").  Cf. Sable Communications of California, \nInc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 129 (1989) (\"To the extent that the \nfederal parties suggest that we should defer to Congress' \nconclusion about an issue of constitutional law, our answer is \nthat while we do not ignore it, it is our task in the end to \ndecide whether Congress has violated the Constitution.  This \nis particularly true where the Legislature has concluded that \nits product does not violate the First Amendment.\").3  The \nSafley standard reconciles prisoners' constitutional rights \nwith institutional needs and defers to prison administrators as \nthe most appropriate articulators of those needs;  so long as \nCongress acts with those same needs in mind, it is entitled to \nthe same deference.  But were we simply to defer to Con-\ngress's assertion that the Ensign Amendment (\"the Amend-\nment\") was reasonably related to the interest asserted, there \nwould be no need for judicial review at all, for no statute \n\n__________\n     3 Of course, because the majority concludes that the BOP's regu-\nlations, and not the Ensign Amendment, are controlling in this case, \nthe majority's focus on Congress's conclusions may be misguided.  \nSee, e.g., Maj. Op. at 11 (\"It does not matter whether we agree with \nthe legislature, only whether we find its judgment rational.\").  But \nsee note 4, infra.\n\n\n\f\ninfringing on inmates' constitutional rights would fail to satis-\nfy this test.  The Court has reminded us that the Safley \nstandard \"is not toothless,\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 414 \n(internal quotation omitted);  more precisely, it is not a license \nfor lawmakers, any more than prison wardens, to shortchange \nthe constitutional rights that the Supreme Court has insisted \nprisoners continue to possess.  Only if our assessment is not \na cursory one can we give adequate weight to both concerns \nthat underlie the Safley standard.  See, e.g., Salaam, 905 \nF.2d at 1171 n.6 (\"Reasonableness in this context refers not \nonly to the relation between the goals of a regulation and its \nmeans, but also to the balance struck between the needs of \nthe prison administrators and the constitutional rights of \nprisoners.\").\n\n     It is crucial, therefore, to ensure that although the strict-\nness of our review is lessened, it is not eliminated altogether.  \nOur task, ultimately, is to assess the fit between the interest \nproffered and the remedy adopted--whether the regulation \nunder consideration is a reasonable means of addressing the \nlegitimate penological interest put forward by the govern-\nment.  In Safley itself, for example, although the prison's \nasserted interests in security and rehabilitation were suffi-\ncient to justify some restriction on the right to marry, the \nCourt held that the particular restriction adopted was too \nbroad to be upheld.  See Safley, 482 U.S. at 97-98 (\"No doubt \nlegitimate security concerns may require placing reasonable \nrestrictions upon an inmate's right to marry, and may justify \nrequiring approval of the superintendent.  The Missouri reg-\nulation, however, represents an exaggerated response to such \nsecurity objectives.\");  id. at 98 (\"[I]n requiring refusal of \npermission absent a finding of a compelling reason to allow \nthe marriage, the rule sweeps much more broadly than can be \nexplained by petitioners' penological objectives.\").  In Thorn-\nburgh, by contrast, the pre-Amendment version of the restric-\ntions under consideration here were found to represent a \nreasonable response to institutional concerns because the \n\"individualized nature\" of the determinations ensured that the \npolicy would not result in \"needless exclusions.\"  Thornburgh, \n490 U.S. at 416-17;  see also id. (noting that even a publica-\n\n\n\f\ntion that met one of the criteria for exclusion would be \nrejected \"only if it is determined to meet that standard under \nthe conditions prevailing at the institution at the time\").  \nThese cases illustrate that the standard of review established \nby Safley sets some limits on the means the government may \nuse to further penological interests.  Although these limits \nare flexible, they are by no means as vaporous as the majori-\nty rules them to be.\n\n     I agree that rehabilitation is, conceptually, a legitimate \ngovernmental interest, even if no one is sure how to achieve it \nand the Federal Sentencing Guidelines have abandoned it as \nan attainable goal.  Compare Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, \n823 (1974) (\"[S]ince most offenders will eventually return to \nsociety, another paramount objective of the corrections sys-\ntem is the rehabilitation of those committed to its custody.\") \nand Dawson v. Scurr, 986 F.2d 257, 260 (8th Cir. 1993) \n(noting that rehabilitation is a \"legitimate objective\") with \nKerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321, 324 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"Congress \nabandoned 'rehabilitation' as a justification of imprisonment \nwhen it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.\") and S. \nRep. No. 98-225 (1983), at 38, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n3182, 3221 (\"[A]lmost everyone involved in the criminal justice \nsystem now doubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably \nin a prison setting, and it is now quite certain that no one can \nreally detect whether or when a prisoner is rehabilitated.\").  \nWhere the majority and I part company is on the ultimate \nquestion:  Has any \"valid, rational connection\" between the \nextremely broad ban on publications featuring nudity or \nexplicit sexual activity and rehabilitation been shown in this \ncase?  And while I certainly do not discount the possibility \nthat a ban more narrowly targeted on certain kinds of violent \npornography or even on certain types of prisoners might \nsatisfy this requirement, I cannot conclude, on the present \nrecord, that these regulations implementing the Amendment \npass muster.4\n\n__________\n     4 The majority characterizes Amatel's attack on the Amendment \nitself as a \"pre-enforcement challenge\" that is invalid because, in \npromulgating implementing regulations, the government has \n\n\n\f\n     I believe that the determination of whether a regulation (or \nstatute) is reasonably related to a legitimate penological \ninterest must depend, in all but the most obvious cases, on \nthe evidentiary support for that nexus in the record before \nthe court.  Of course I recognize too that the question of \nwhat or how much evidence is necessary may depend on what \nlogic or everyday experience show us to be the connection \nbetween the disputed means and the rehabilitative end.  If \nthe Amendment prohibited the distribution of publications \ncontaining escape plans, the connection between the ban and \nthe penological interest in institutional security would be \nobvious, and we could uphold such a prohibition based on \nlittle or no demonstrated evidence.  Where, as here, however, \nthe connection (between nudity and rehabilitation) is far \nmurkier, courts (and I would include legislators as well) far \nremoved from the day-to-day operations of a prison are much \n\n__________\n\"waived certain provisions of the law.\"  Maj. Op. at 4, citing \nSalvation Army v. Department of Community Affairs, 919 F.2d \n183, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).  In contrast to Salvation Army, however, \nwe have no \"express assurance\" that the BOP will not enforce the \nbreadth of the Amendment, cf.  Salvation Army, 919 F.2d at 192;  \nindeed, the regulations state simply that \"publications containing \nnudity illustrative of medical, educational, or anthropological con-\ntent may be excluded\" from the definition of \"features,\" see 28 \nC.F.R. s 540.72(b)(3) (1997) (emphasis added).  Moreover, at oral \nargument, counsel for the BOP acknowledged that under the cur-\nrent regulations, wardens retain considerable discretion as to \nwhether a publication \"features\" nudity.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. at 6. \nThe government's \"waiver\" of certain portions of the Amendment \nthus cannot be so blithely assumed and may in fact be an impermis-\nsible narrowing of the Amendment's mandate.  See, e.g., Public \nCitizen v. FTC, 869 F.2d 1541, 1557 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (\"While \nagencies may safely be assumed to have discretion to create excep-\ntions at the margins of a regulatory field, they are not thereby \nempowered to weigh the costs and benefits of regulation at every \nturn;  agencies surely do not have inherent authority to second-\nguess Congress' calculations.\");  Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 \nF.2d 323, 358 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (\"Categorical exemptions from the \nclear commands of a regulatory statute, though sometimes permit-\nted, are not favored.\").\n\n\n\nless able to answer the question accurately on their own;  \nindeed, the very reason that Safley prescribes a great mea-\nsure of deference to prison administrators is that they are in \nthe best position to provide answers involving means and \nends in prison administration.  See, e.g., Kennedy v. Los \nAngeles Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 702, 713 (9th Cir. 1989) (\"The \nprinciple that courts must provide wide latitude to prison \npolicies needed to maintain institutional order and security \nnecessarily presupposes that the administrators have crafted \nthose policies with careful deliberation.\") (citation omitted).  \nWe would normally be expected to give a healthy dose of \ndeference to the judgment of prison officials as to their \nexperience and apprehensions in support of a regulation, but \nwhere, as in these regulations, these same officials were, so \nfar as we can tell, never consulted on the Amendment's \nmerits and under its terms are not allowed to exercise any \njudgment about what kinds of nudity or sexually explicit \nmaterial are allowed inside the prison walls, I do not believe \nSafley permits us simply to assume the existence of evidence \nshowing a connection between the regulation and a rehabilita-\ntive goal, as we might under rational-basis review and as the \nmajority has in fact done here.\n\n     Safley itself provides a useful example of how too Spartan a \nrecord can doom a regulation.  The Court's rejection of the \nmarriage restriction at issue in that case clearly turned on the \nquality of the evidence before the Court;  four times the \nCourt concluded that the regulation was not reasonably relat-\ned to penological interests based \"on this record.\"  See Saf-\nley, 482 U.S. at 97 (\"We conclude that on this record, the \nMissouri prison regulation, as written, is not reasonably \nrelated to these penological interests.\");  id. at 98 (\"Nor, on \nthis record, is the marriage restriction reasonably related to \nthe articulated rehabilitation goal.\");  id. at 99 (\"Moreover, \nalthough not necessary to the disposition of this case, we note \nthat on this record the rehabilitative objective asserted to \nsupport the regulation itself is suspect.\");  id.  (\"On this \nrecord, however, the almost complete ban on the decision to \nmarry is not reasonably related to legitimate penological \nobjectives.\") (emphases added).  This repeated qualification \n\n\n\f\nof the Court's negative conclusion about the validity of the \nregulation starkly suggests that while a reasonable relation-\nship might possibly have been demonstrated between the \nmarriage restriction and the interests asserted, the prison \nhad failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that \nrelationship.\n\n     The majority's apparent conclusion that the government \nbears no responsibility for compiling evidence to support the \nbreadth of its ban--in other words, that the courts may \nsimply hypothesize a rational connection--runs counter to the \nwisdom of several other circuit courts.  See, e.g., Shimer v. \nWashington, 100 F.3d 506, 509 (7th Cir. 1996) (prison admin-\nistration \"must proffer some evidence to support its restric-\ntion of ... constitutional rights\" under Safley standard);  \nMann v. Reynolds, 46 F.3d 1055, 1061 (10th Cir. 1995) \n(invalidating restrictions on contact visits with attorneys, \nnoting that \"defendants were unable to provide any evidence \nthe restrictions on contact were reasonably related to prison \nsecurity\");  Muhammad v. Pitcher, 35 F.3d 1081, 1085 (6th \nCir. 1994) (invalidating prison mail regulation because \"there \nis no evidence in the record supporting Defendants' factual \nclaim\" that policy was reasonably related to interest in con-\nserving resources);  Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 386 (9th \nCir. 1990) (\"Prison authorities cannot rely on general or \nconclusory assertions to support their policies.  Rather, they \nmust first identify the specific penological interests involved \nand then demonstrate both that those specific interests are \nthe actual bases for their policies and that the policies are \nreasonably related to the furtherance of the identified inter-\nests.  An evidentiary showing is required as to each point.\");  \nWaterman, 1998 WL 354932, at *10 (\"To establish that a \nlegitimate penological interest supports a statute, a state \nmust provide evidence that the interest it proffered is the \nactual basis for the statute.\");  Powell v. Riveland, 991 F. \nSupp. 1249, 1254 (W.D. Wash. 1997) (upholding restriction on \nsexually explicit incoming mail where \"[p]rior to implement-\ning the policy, research was done on the effects of sexually \nexplicit material and the policy/regulation was written to \ntarget those harmful materials\").  In sum, it is clear, as \n\n\n\f\nJudge Posner has suggested, that the Safley analysis cannot \nbe met simply on the basis of \"pure conjecture.\"  Reed v. \nFaulkner, 842 F.2d 960, 963 (7th Cir. 1988);  see also id.  \n(\"[T]o suppose that the wearing of dreadlocks [as an expres-\nsion of religious belief] would lead to racial violence is, on this \nrecord, the piling of conjecture upon conjecture.  The poten-\ntial infringement of the free-speech clause of the First \nAmendment is too plain to warrant comment.\").  Safley cer-\ntainly does not stand for the proposition that Congress or \nprison officials may \"set constitutional standards by fiat.\"  \nWhitney v. Brown, 882 F.2d 1068, 1074 (6th Cir. 1989).\n\n     I might, therefore, have been able to go along--as the \nmajority does here--with deferring to Congress had the \ngovernment seen fit to proffer evidence that links a ban on \nthe prohibited publications to rehabilitation or if the connec-\ntion between that ban and rehabilitation was so self-evident \nthat no further evidence was necessary to demonstrate its \nreasonableness.  But neither event has occurred, and the \nmajority's once-over-lightly of the scientific literature that \ndoes exist certainly does not accomplish the task, as the \nmajority itself admits.  See Maj. Op. at 14 (\"The point of this \nis not to suggest that a causal link has been shown.  The \narray of academic authority on the other side is at least as \nsubstantial, and quite possibly more so.\").  At best, it can be \nsaid that a few studies have shown a causative relationship \nbetween violent pornography and short-term increases in \naggression--perhaps a helpful finding with regard to the \nsecurity interests of prison authorities but next to useless in \ndetermining the effect on any long-term interest in rehabilita-\ntion.5  In all other respects, the relationship between pornog-\n\n__________\n     5 Of course, the evidence to support a prison regulation need not \nbe in the form of scholarly studies;  affidavits from prison officials \ncould also suffice as the basis for analysis.  See, e.g., Safley, 482 \nU.S. at 98 (testimony of prison officials that they had experienced \nno problems with the marriages of male inmates relied on as \nevidence that ban was overbroad);  Harper v. Wallingford, 877 F.2d \n728, 733 (9th Cir. 1989) (finding prison regulation banning receipt of \nmaterial espousing consensual sexual relationships between male \n\n\n\f\nraphy and criminal activity is merely correlative,6 and there is \nno evidence that simply viewing nonpornographic nudity or \ndepictions of sexual activities (as opposed to pornography) \nhas any effect at all.7  See, e.g., Edward Donnerstein, Daniel \nLinz & Steven Penrod, The Question of Pornography 177 \n(1987) (stating conclusion of Attorney General's Commission \non Pornography that \"in general, the scientific evidence \nshows no causal relationship between exposure to [nonviolent \nand nondegrading sexual] depictions and acts of sexual vio-\nlence\" and noting that the authors' \"view of the scientific \nliterature ... is in agreement with this conclusion\");  id. at \n40-48 (citing studies finding that exposing already angered \nmen to nonviolent pornography can cause a short-term in-\ncrease in their aggressive tendencies);  Ernest D. Giglio, \nPornography in Denmark:  A Public Policy Model for the \nUnited States? in 8 Comparative Social Research 281, 285 \n(Richard F. Tomasson ed., 1985) (\"[A] positive causal relation-\nship between pornography and sex crimes has not been \ndocumented by criminologists and psychologists.\");  Berl \nKutchinsky, Obscenity and Pornography:  Behavioral As-\npects, in Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 1077, 1083 \n(Sanford Kadish ed., 1983) (noting that the authoritative \nstudies on the link between pornography and crime have \nconcluded that there is apparently no causative relationship \nbetween nonviolent pornography and sex crimes).  Indeed, it \n\n__________\nadults and juvenile males to be reasonably related to rehabilitation \nbased on affidavit from prison psychiatrist).\n\n     6 Correlation cannot be sufficient to satisfy Safley 's requirement \nof a \"valid, rational connection.\"  Even if it could be shown, for \nexample, that the majority of those who commit violent crimes are \nalso avid Bible readers, this finding would not constitute a basis for \nprohibiting all prisoners from reading the Bible.\n\n     7 By pornography, I mean \"a depiction (as in writing or painting) \nof licentiousness or lewdness:  a portrayal of erotic behavior de-\nsigned to cause sexual excitement.\"  Webster's Third New Interna-\ntional Dictionary 1767 (1976).  There is, of course, much material \nthat features nudity or depicts sexual activity that would not qualify \nas pornography under any definition, including many highly regard-\ned works of art.\n\n\nis unclear even in the studies finding a positive connection \nbetween violent pornography and aggressive behavior wheth-\ner the aggression is due to the violent content of the material \nor its sexual content.  See, e.g., Larry Baron & Murray A. \nStraus, Four Theories of Rape in American Society 8 (1989) \n(\"It seems reasonable to conclude ... that it is the violent \ncontent rather than the sexual content that facilitates aggres-\nsion.\");  Richard A. Posner, Sex and Reason 368 (1992) (\"[T]he \neffects [of violent pornography] may be due to the violence \nper se rather than to the erotic component.\").  Thus, while it \nis entirely possible that a narrower publication ban than that \naccomplished by the Amendment could be supported by the \navailable literature, cf., e.g., Dawson, 986 F.2d at 262 (uphold-\ning regulation limiting time, place, and conditions under \nwhich certain inmates could view materials), neither the \ngovernment nor the majority has laid the barest foundation \nfor the far-reaching ban promulgated.  The majority's level of \ncomfort in relying on any statement of any legislator as to \nwhat he thinks will encourage rehabilitation as the sole basis \nfor taking away a First Amendment right is very surprising \nto me, especially since its holding today goes far beyond what \nany court has previously condoned in depriving prisoners of \nconstitutional rights on the mere assertion of a legislator that \nhe supposes rehabilitation to be so advanced.\n\n     In this respect, I believe that it needs to be stressed that \nthe assertion of \"rehabilitation\" as the reason for impinging \non prisoners' First Amendment rights is particularly discon-\ncerting in its potential for abuse.  Unlike its interest in \ninstitutional security, the contours of the government's inter-\nest in rehabilitation are quite amorphous and ill-defined.  At \nthe most basic level, the goal of rehabilitation might be stated \nas returning the prisoner to society in a state so that he will \nhenceforth behave in a law-abiding manner, but no one, not \neven Congress, is so immodest as to claim secure knowledge \nof how this goal is to be achieved in individual cases, let alone \nin the aggregate;  most often, rehabilitation efforts involve \ntherapy, drug and alcohol counseling, basic education, or job \ntraining, but even in these positive attempts, the results are \nfar from reassuring.  Against that backdrop, it is extremely \n\n\n\f\ndifficult, if not impossible, to ascertain precisely if or how a \nparticular publication may work to frustrate the rehabilitative \ngoals of prisoners.  To start with, there is no consensus on \nwhether in order to transform a law violator into a good \ncitizen, he must be \"remolded\" attitudinally and instilled with \ndesirable values or whether it is sufficient that he be con-\nvinced that further criminal activity would be counterproduc-\ntive in his own case, whatever his vision of society or the \nworld.  Rehabilitation may also be viewed--in the majority's \nparlance--as an effort to direct the \"character growth\" of \nprisoners by limiting the reading materials to which he has \naccess.  See Maj. Op. at 11.  But, whatever the rehabilitative \nvision, it should not be possible to proceed on some vague \nassertion of an interest in \"rehabilitation\" without the need to \ndefine the term or to show a connection between the pro-\nscribed activity and the chosen definition;  to do so runs an \noverwhelming risk of overregulation and invasion of the in-\nnermost recesses of the human mind and spirit.  Indeed, \nundertaking the Herculean task of \"character-molding\" is \ninherently problematic in its First Amendment implications, \nfor it presumably involves casting emerging prisoners in \nsociety's own image.  This, of course, is the antithesis of First \nAmendment freedoms;  indeed, \"[t]otalitarian ideologies we \nprofess to hate have styled as 'rehabilitation' the process of \nmolding the unorthodox mind to the shape of prevailing \ndogma.\"   Sobell v. Reed, 327 F. Supp. 1294, 1305 (S.D.N.Y.\n1971);  cf., e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.  Community \nSch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511 (1969) (noting \"this Nation's \nrepudiation of the principle that a State might so conduct its \nschools as to foster a homogeneous people\") (internal quota-\ntion omitted).  Under this theory, lawmakers who believe that \nbooks on Russian history may lead to disrespect for the \nUnited States may ban those books for prisoners;  lawmakers \nwho hold pro-life views may prevent prisoners from reading \npublications describing Roe v. Wade;  and lawmakers who \nhold an antiquated view of the role women should play in \nsociety may ban the distribution in prisons of publications \nwith feminist themes.  Each of these actions could logically \nbe taken in the name of rehabilitation, broadly defined, and \n\n\n\f\neach, without doubt, would contribute to a continual eviscer-\nation of the First Amendment rights of prisoners.  Cf., e.g., \nStanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 565-66 (1969) (\"Our whole \nconstitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving govern-\nment the power to control men's minds....  [I]t cannot \nconstitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of con-\ntrolling a person's private thoughts.\");  McCabe v. Arave, 827 \nF.2d 634, 638 (9th Cir. 1987) (\"Given the strength of First \nAmendment protection for freedom of belief, prison authori-\nties have no legitimate penological interest in excluding reli-\ngious books from the prison library merely because they \ncontain racist views.\") (citation omitted);  American Booksel-\nlers Ass'n, Inc. v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 330 (7th Cir. 1985), \naff'd mem., 475 U.S. 1001 (1986) (\"If the fact that speech \nplays a role in a process of conditioning were enough to \npermit governmental regulation, that would be the end of \nfreedom of speech.\").  These examples may sound extreme--\nthey are--but the majority's rationale easily encompasses \nthem in its umbrella-like authorization for restricting prison-\ners' reading material on the basis of a minimum plausibility \ntest for tying the censorship to some vague rehabilitation \nconcept.\n\n     Even if the goal of rehabilitation is a more modest one--to \nconvince the prisoner his own best interest lies in avoiding \nfuture crime--it is hard to see how that goal is furthered by \nreturning him unequipped to be an intelligent customer in the \nmarketplace of ideas.  And while serious questions may well \nbe raised about the value of some of the publications banned \nunder the Amendment, there is much that falls under this \nbroad ban that speaks intelligently to mankind, including \nprisoners:  Michelangelo's David, for example, or grim photo-\ngraphs of naked bodies piled in the pits of Germany's concen-\ntration camps.8  There is even a potential for such depictions \n\n__________\n     8 The majority suggests that the application of the regulations to \nprohibit artistic depictions of nudity or to documentary photographs \nof wartime atrocities would be \"bizarre.\"  See Maj. Op. at 17.  But, \nin fact, even the regulations do not provide for any exceptions to the \nnudity ban based on a publication's artistic or political content.  See \n28 C.F.R. s 540.72(b)(3) (providing possible exception only for \n\n\n\nof nudity to strike a life-changing chord with some prisoners, \na change that should not be prevented from coming to \nfruition.  Malcolm X wrote of his prison experience:\n\n     I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading \n     opened to me.  I knew right there in prison that reading \n     had changed forever the course of my life.  As I see it \n     today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long \n     dormant craving to be mentally alive....  My home-\n     made education gave me, with every book that I read, a \n     little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, and \n     blindness that was afflicting the black race in America.\n\nAlex Haley & Malcolm X, The Autobiography of Malcolm X \n180 (1965).9\n\n     If rehabilitation is to be deemed a legitimate penological \ninterest, the term must be given some shape, at least when it \ncollides with fundamental liberties.  Of course, as the majori-\nty notes, the Constitution has nothing to say about what \nmessages the government may choose to communicate as a \nspeaker.  See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193 (1991) \n(\"The Government can, without violating the Constitution, \nselectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it \nbelieves to be in the public interest, without at the same time \nfunding an alternate program which seeks to deal with the \nproblem in another way.\").  Congress or the BOP may make \n\n__________\nnudity \"illustrative of medical, educational, or anthropological con-\ntent\").  And although the Victoria's Secret catalog and the Sports \nIllustrated Swimsuit Edition are listed by the BOP as permissible \npublications, the basis for their exclusion from the ban is left to \nconjecture.  Cf. id. s 540.72(b)(2) (defining \"nudity\" as \"a pictorial \ndepiction where ... female breasts are exposed\").  As for the \nnotion that explicit descriptions of sexual activities and nudity are \nstill permitted (an illustrated version of Henry Miller's Tropic of \nCancer is banned but a nonillustrated version is not), this only \nunderscores the arbitrariness of the rehabilitative nexus.\n\n     9 Of course, lawmakers who believe that Malcolm X inspires \nseparatism and racial consciousness may, under the \"remolding\" \ntheory of rehabilitation, prohibit prisoners from reading his writings \nas well.\n\n\nwhatever recreational reading it wishes available in the prison \nlibraries without offending the Constitution;  they may even \nprovide each prisoner with a tract on the harms of pornogra-\nphy in the hope that some readers will take its lessons to \nheart.  But it is quite a different matter for prisons to deny \nall access to certain publications in the name of rehabilitation, \nparticularly in such a broad and overreaching manner as this \none.  If prisoners are to retain any First Amendment rights, \nthe mere assertion of \"rehabilitation\" as the interest to be \nserved by a particular regulation cannot serve to extinguish \nthose rights altogether.\n\n     Because the Amendment and the regulations eliminate the \ndiscretion of prison wardens to make individual determina-\ntions about how particular publications will affect particular \nprisoners in particular prison settings, even rehabilitatively, I \nbelieve it was incumbent upon the government to point to \nsome evidence demonstrating a connection between all publi-\ncations that are sexually explicit or that feature nudity and a \ntendency to engage in criminal or disruptive behavior, keep-\ning in mind that our task is to determine whether such a \nconnection is reasonably likely to exist, not whether one \nmight be conceivable.  Cf., e.g., Mauro, 1998 WL 550190, at \n*7 (considering whether all materials depicting nudity are \n\"reasonably likely\" to cause violence or to be used to harass \nguards).  Neither the government nor the majority has point-\ned to any such evidence.\n\n     Indeed, the proposition that all material that is sexually \nexplicit or that features nudity will have a detrimental effect \non rehabilitation is belied by the prior actions of the prison \nofficials under the pre-Amendment policy.  At that time, \nprison officials were authorized to prohibit sexually explicit \nmaterials that they believed would negatively affect the disci-\npline or \"good order\" of the institution.  Significantly, the \nprison officials--to whose expertise the Supreme Court has \nrepeated deferred on matters such as this--did not choose to \nprohibit all material that is sexually explicit or that features \nnudity.  Rather, they evaluated the publications individually \nto determine which ones, in their expert opinions, posed a \npotential threat and which did not;  indeed, as the majority \n\n\n\fnotes, \"explicit heterosexual material\" was ordinarily admit-\nted.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 405 n.6 (quoting Program \nStatement 5266.5(b)(2)).  It was this \"individualized nature\" \nof the determinations that led the Thornburgh Court to \nconclude that the regulations at issue in that case were \nrationally related to security interests, the nature of which, \nlike rehabilitation, can change over time.10  See Thornburgh, \n490 U.S. at 417 (\"We agree that it is rational for the Bureau \nto exclude materials that ... are determined by the warden \nto create an intolerable risk of disorder under the conditions \nof a particular prison at a particular time.\").\n\n     Because I believe that, on this record, there is no basis for \nconcluding that there is a rational connection between the \ninterest asserted by the government--rehabilitation--and the \nrestriction chosen to further that interest--a ban on the \ndelivery to all federal prisoners of all publications that are \n\n__________\n     10 It should be noted in this respect that a seemingly innocuous \npublication may be quite detrimental to a prisoner's rehabilitation, \ndepending on the circumstances.  See, e.g., Waterman, 1998 WL \n354932, at *3, *4 (citing concerns of prison officials that pictures of \nchildren from the Sears catalog should not be seen by pedophile \nprisoners).\n\n     The need for individualistic determinations when behavior modifi-\ncation is at stake was also a concern in Washington v. Harper, 494 \nU.S. 210 (1990), in which the Court upheld a prison policy that \npermitted the involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs to \ninmates, given that the policy was not unnecessarily broad and \nsupported by a wealth of evidence:\n\n     Its exclusive application is to inmates who are mentally ill and \n     who, as a result of their illness, are gravely disabled or \n     represent a significant danger to themselves or others.  The \n     drugs may be administered for no purpose other than treat-\n     ment, and only under the direction of a licensed psychiatrist.  \n     There is considerable debate over the potential side effects of \n     antipsychotic medications, but there is little dispute in the \n     psychiatric profession that proper use of the drugs is one of the \n     most effective means of treating and controlling a mental \n     illness likely to cause violent behavior.\n\nId. at 226.\n\nsexually explicit or that feature nudity, I would affirm the \ndecision of the district court.  As the majority considers the \nremaining Safley factors, however, I will also offer a few \nthoughts.\n\n     The second Safley factor considers whether there are \"al-\nternative means of exercising the right that remain open to \nprison inmates.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 90.  Although this right \nmust be viewed \"sensibly and expansively,\" Thornburgh, 490 \nU.S. at 417, it cannot be viewed so broadly as to eliminate any \nreason for analysis (or as unhelpfully as the majority's sar-\ndonic reference to an \"entitlement to smut\").  The Thorn-\nburgh Court, for example, noted that although the regulation \nunder consideration in that case permitted the warden to \nmake individualized determinations as to each publication, an \nexercise of discretion that might appear to produce inconsis-\ntent results, \"greater consistency might be attainable only at \nthe cost of a more broadly restrictive rule against admission \nof incoming publications,\" which \"might itself run afoul of the \nsecond [Safley ] factor.\"  Id. at 417 n.15.  Because the \nAmendment eliminates a wide variety of publications that \nfeature nudity for artistic or other reasons, prisoners do not \nhave sufficient means of exercising their right to receive \nmany constitutionally protected materials.  Cf., e.g., Mauro, \n1998 WL 550190, at *8 (\"[I]n direct contradiction of the \nSupreme Court's cautionary language in Thornburgh, Marico-\npa County has enacted a regulation that sweeps too broadly, \nindiscriminately eliminating large categories of materials \nwithout individualized consideration.\").\n\n     The third factor considers \"the impact accommodation of \nthe asserted constitutional right will have on guards and \nother inmates.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 90.  Where the institu-\ntional interest asserted for a publication ban is security, \naccommodation of the inmate's First Amendment rights may \nindeed cause the \"ripple effect\" of which the Safley Court \nwarned, see id.;  a breach of security with respect to one \nprisoner is likely to result in other breaches in the prison.  In \nthis case, however, there is no evidence by which to judge \nwhether permitting certain inmates to view publications that \nare sexually explicit or that feature nudity will have an \n\n\n\fadverse effect on the rehabilitation of other inmates.  Reha-\nbilitation is a gradual process, and it is entirely possible that \nany momentary lapses caused by the inadvertent receipt of an \ninappropriate publication may be reversed with additional \nrehabilitative efforts.  This is not true of security breaches:  \nOnce an inmate has received information on how to escape \nfrom the prison, he cannot be made to forget it.  It thus \ncannot be concluded, on this record, that accommodation of \nAmatel's First Amendment right will have a significant effect \non the rehabilitation of other inmates.\n\n     Finally, the fourth factor considers whether there are \n\"obvious, easy alternatives\" that \"fully accommodate[ ] the \nprisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological \ninterests\";  if so, this may be evidence that the regulation is \nan \"exaggerated response\" to prison concerns.  Id. at 90-91.  \nOne such alternative comes immediately to mind:  the pre-\nAmendment policy, under which wardens had discretion to \nexamine each incoming publication and determine whether \ninstitutional interests favored its prohibition.  The Court's \napproval of this policy in Thornburgh eliminates any concerns \nthe majority might have that such a policy would be deemed \narbitrary or particularly burdensome;  indeed, since prison \nofficials under the current policy must examine each publica-\ntion to determine whether it is sexually explicit or features \nnudity, the prior policy arguably represents no additional \nadministrative burden.\n\n     Moreover, other aspects of the Amendment suggest that it \nis indeed an \"exaggerated response\" to rehabilitative con-\ncerns.  The Amendment does not allow the warden to take \ninto account whether a prisoner is in a high- or low-security \ninstitution, whether a prisoner is male or female, what kinds \nof crimes the prisoner has committed,11 the nature of the \n\n__________\n     11 For example, the government has provided no evidence on why \na ban on nudity is necessary to rehabilitate those convicted of \nnonsexual and/or nonviolent crimes.  I can think of no reason why \nan embezzler, a tax evader, or a person held in contempt for \nrefusing to testify will be rehabilitated if prevented from looking at \npublications that \"feature\" nudity.  (The statements of the only two \n\n\n\f\nprisoner's sentence,12 how long the prisoner has been incar-\ncerated and how long he or she has left to serve, whether the \nprisoner is receiving rehabilitative treatment,13 or even \nwhether a prisoner is in a prison environment that provides \nan opportunity to share the material with anyone else (partic-\nularly with other prisoners convicted of sex crimes).  In these \nrespects, the Amendment \"sweeps much more broadly than \ncan be explained by [the government's] penological objec-\ntives.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 98 (invalidating ban on all prisoner \nmarriages by noting that prison officials had experienced no \nproblems with marriages by male inmates or with inmate-\ncivilian marriages;  the prison's rehabilitative concern \"ap-\npear[ed] from the record to have been centered almost exclu-\nsively on female inmates marrying other inmates or ex-\n\n__________\nmembers of Congress who offered floor comments on the Amend-\nment suggest that their concern was with sex offenders.  See 142 \nCong. Rec. H8262 (daily ed.  July 24, 1996) (\"[I]f we do not adopt \nmy amendment, we are sending the message that it is OK to \nprovide sexually explicit magazines and books to the very prisoners \nwho have committed violent acts against women.\") (statement of \nRep. Ensign);  id.  (\"Far too often, those individuals convicted of \ncrimes have the opportunity, while in prison, to use materials that \nglamorize the very acts for which they were convicted.\") (statement \nof Rep. Christensen).)\n\n     Moreover, the Amendment's ban may also extend to those in-\nmates who have not yet been convicted but rather are imprisoned \nwhile awaiting trial.  The government has not suggested any reason \nfor it to take a rehabilitative interest in these individuals, nor do I \nthink it can legitimately do so.  See, e.g., McGinnis v. Royster, 410 \nU.S. 263, 273 (1973) (\"[I]t would hardly be appropriate for the State \nto undertake in the pretrial detention period programs to rehabili-\ntate a man still clothed with a presumption of innocence.\").\n\n     12 The government would seem to have less rehabilitative interest \nin, for example, prisoners who have been sentenced to life in prison \nwithout parole or to death.\n\n     13 In some prisons, material featuring adult nudity is an effective \npart of a rehabilitative program.  See, e.g, Waterman, 1998 WL \n354932, at *7 (citing evidence that adult pornography may be \nhelpful in turning pedophiles away from child pornography).\n\nfelons,\" id. at 99, and thus did not account for the ban on \nother inmate marriages).\n\n     The majority's decision to remand this case for further \nconsideration of Amatel's vagueness challenge leaves a scintil-\nla of hope that this ill-conceived statute will ultimately fail.  \nBecause I cannot agree with the majority's Safley analysis, \nhowever, or with its decision to lift the district court's injunc-\ntion in the interim, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n\n     Justice Holmes once remarked that hard cases make bad \nlaw.  See Northern Sec. Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, \n400 (1904) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  Claims of prisoners to \nread magazines like Playboy or Penthouse may not be the \nideal vehicles for the articulation of First Amendment rights.  \nBut, as Dostoyevsky observed, \"the degree of civilization in a \nsociety is revealed by entering its prisons.\"  F. Dostoyevsky, \nThe House of the Dead 76 (C. Garnett trans., 1957).  Today's \nruling that prisoners may be stripped of rights to view \npublications of their choice on the mere assertion of legisla-\ntors or regulators--far removed from the prison scene and \nwithout supporting evidence of any kind--that those publica-\ntions will hinder their \"rehabilitation\" goes well beyond prior \nprecedent and the case law in other circuits.  It is a most \ntroubling precedent.\n\n       \n",

The statute is not enforced directly;  \ninstead, the Bureau has promulgated regulations defining the \nterms of the proscription and significantly narrowing its \nscope.  The district court, analyzing the statute, ruled that it \nwas facially invalid as a violation of the First Amendment and \nenjoined its enforcement.

L. No. 104-208 s 614.2  Regulations \nlater adopted by the Bureau assign rather narrow meanings \nto these terms:  \"nudity\" means \"a pictorial depiction where \ngenitalia or female breasts are exposed\";  \"features\" means \nthat \"the publication contains depictions of nudity or sexually \nexplicit conduct on a routine or regular basis or promotes \nitself based upon such depictions in the case of individual one-\ntime issues.\"  Even material that otherwise would be said to \n\"feature nudity\" is excepted if it contains \"nudity illustrative \nof medical, educational, or anthropological content.\"  \"Sexual-\nly explicit\" means \"a pictorial depiction of actual or simulated \nsexual acts including sexual intercourse, oral sex, or mastur-\nbation.\"  28 CFR s 540.72(b).  Under these regulations, then, \nthere is no restriction whatever on non-pictorial sexually \nexplicit material.\n\n     In 1997, three inmates, each denied receipt of either Play-\nboy or Penthouse, filed separate suits alleging that the En-\nsign Amendment violated the First Amendment.

Accordingly, our analysis will \ntreat the spending restriction as a ban on distribution.  Where the \ngovernment absolutely monopolizes the means of speech or controls \na bottleneck, as we are assuming vis-a-vis the prison distribution \nsystem, a refusal to fund functions the same as an outright ban.\n\n     2 Identical language appears in s 614 of Pub.

The district court \nseemed to assume that the statute itself has been and will be \napplied to these plaintiffs;  accordingly, it directed its analysis \nprimarily towards the statute.  But there is no suggestion \nthat any warden does or will apply the statute directly;  so far \nas appears, all enforcement is mediated through the regula-\ntions.\n\n     Insofar as plaintiffs attack the proscriptions of the statute \nnot embodied in the regulations, they effectively pursue a \npre-enforcement challenge.  Even in the First Amendment \ncontext, such a challenge presents a justiciable controversy \nonly if the probability of enforcement is \"real and substan-\ntial.\"  Salvation Army v. Dep't of Comm.

The next question is \nwhether rehabilitation is a legitimate and \"neutral\" govern-\nment interest within the meaning of Safley.\n\n     The legitimacy of the rehabilitative purpose appears indis-\nputable.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has often characterized \nrehabilitation as one of the primary goals of penal institu-\ntions.  See, e.g., O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111913\"><a href=\"/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \n348 (1987) (describing rehabilitation as \"valid penological \nobjective[ ]\");  Procunier v.

At least since the mid-19th cen-\ntury, it is hard to imagine a prison system that did not seek \nto reduce the likelihood that prisoners would again transgress \nsociety's norms.  The inventors of the prison in New York \nand Pennsylvania framed its goals in these terms:\n\n          The penitentiary, free of corruptions and dedicated to \n     the proper training of the inmate, would inculcate the \n     discipline that negligent parents, evil companions, tav-\n     erns, houses of prostitution, theaters, and gambling halls \n     had destroyed.  Just as the criminal's environment had \n     led him into crime, the institutional environment would \n     lead him out of it.\n\nDavid J. Rothman, The Invention of the Asylum:  Social \nOrder and Disorder in the New Republic 82-83 (rev. ed. \n1990).\n\n     In turning to \"neutrality,\" the district court looked at the \nstatute itself, not the goal, and found it non-neutral.  \"[T]he \nEnsign Amendment is a content-based statute with a sole \nfocus on the sexual nature of the publications it seeks to \nprohibit.\"  The conclusion is correct--the Ensign Amendment \nis formulated in terms of content.  But we do not understand \nthat characteristic to run afoul of Safley's neutrality require-\nment.  Despite the apparent similarity in terms, \"neutrality\" \nin the Safley sense is quite different from the familiar First \nAmendment notion of \"content-neutrality.\"  The Court most \nrecently explained in Thornburgh that \"neutral\" here means \nno more than that \"the regulation or practice in question \nmust further an important or substantial governmental inter-\nest unrelated to the suppression of expression.\"  490 U.S. at \n415 (quoting Martinez).  There the Court found neutrality \nsimply because in application of the regulations the prison \nadministrators were to \"draw distinctions between publica-\ntions solely on the basis of their potential implications for \nprison security.\"  Id.  It pointed out that the regulations \nstruck down in Martinez, in contrast, barred writings that \n\"unduly complain[ed]\" or \"magnif[ied] grievances,\" or ex-\npressed \"inflammatory\" views, thus inviting the prison au-\nthorities \" 'to apply their own personal prejudices and opin-\nions as standards for prisoner mail censorship.' \"  490 U.S. at \n416 n.14 (quoting Martinez);  see also Martinez, 416 U.S. at \n415 (striking down regulations because no legitimate interest \nat all was offered as justification).  Thus the Martinez regula-\ntions were \"decidedly not 'neutral' in the relevant sense.\"  \nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 416 n.14.\n\n     The rehabilitative interest offered by the government here \nmeets this rather thin neutrality requirement.  The Court \ncannot have meant to insist upon neutrality in its classic First \nAmendment sense, as embodied, for example, in the dictum of \nGertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109091\"><a href=\"/opinion/109091/gertz-v-robert-welch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (1974), that \n\"[u]nder the First Amendment, there is no such thing as a \nfalse idea.\"  In its role as an operator of prisons, the govern-\nment surely does not lapse from the required neutrality if it \nbans \"how-to\" manuals on fraud and embezzlement (\"Fraud \nfor Dummies\").  The idea that committing such crimes is not \n\n\n\f\nproper may not be \"false\" in the Gertz sense, but in the \nprison context the government may oppose it rather absolute-\nly.  This authority cannot be explained away on the theory \nthat such a ban could withstand even the strictest scrutiny \nand that its validity therefore tells us nothing of the \"neutrali-\nty\" requirement;  as voiced by the Court, the \"neutrality\" \nrequirement is an absolute prerequisite.  Accordingly, we \nthink the Court's actual application of the requirement, with \nits focus on the existence of some legitimate goal and on \nassuring that rules are in fact not framed so as to advance \nillegitimate or unvetted goals, must control our understanding \nof its meaning.\n\n     That government power to inculcate values conflicts with \nthe libertarian premises of the First Amendment is clear, but \nsuch power is well established.  Even outside special govern-\nmental institutions, the state has some authority to become a \nplayer in the marketplace of ideas.  It may commission \nadvertising urging children to stay in school or off drugs;  it \ncan sponsor anti-violence campaigns.  See Regan v.

For them, there is no \noutside.  Judges plainly must bear in mind the total occupa-\ntion of prisoners' lives by the state.  But prisoners find \nthemselves in the maw of the state not because they have \nbeen drawn there by the promise of government wages, nor \nbecause a statute imposes a universal requirement of edu-\ncation, but because they have broken the law.  Moreover, \neven government workers have suffered a similar eclipse of \nthe private sphere;  the government's ability to fire them for \nspeech that threatens workplace disruption is not limited to \nspeech within the workplace.  See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of \n\n\n\f\nEducation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968) (analyzing letter to the edi-\ntor).

Accordingly, we conclude that re-\nhabilitation, and such character-moulding as may be implicit \ntherein, constitute legitimate and neutral goals as those are \nunderstood in Safley.\n\n \n\n                                    * * *\n\n\n     We thus turn to whether there is a \"valid rational connec-\ntion\" between the interest and the regulations.  Prison juris-\nprudence is not well enough developed to indicate precisely \nhow demanding the requirement of rational means-end con-\nnection is.  But the similarity between Safley's phrasing and \nthe language of rational basis review suggests to us that, as \nfar as the means-end fit is concerned, Safley's standard is, if \nnot identical, something very similar.  Compare, e.g., Nord-\nlinger v. Hahn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112763\"><a href=\"/opinion/112763/nordlinger-v-hahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1992) (\"[T]he relationship of \nthe classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render \nthe distinction arbitrary or irrational.\") with Safley, 482 U.S. \nat 89-90 (\"[T]he logical connection between the regulation \nand the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy \narbitrary or irrational.\").\n\n     The legislative judgment is that pornography adversely \naffects rehabilitation.  It does not matter whether we agree \nwith the legislature, only whether we find its judgment \nrational.  The question for us is not whether the regulation in \nfact advances the government interest, only whether the \nlegislature might reasonably have thought that it would.  See, \ne.g., Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 11.\n\n     We think that the government could rationally have seen a \nconnection between pornography and rehabilitative values.  \nCongress might well perceive pornography as tending gener-\nally to thwart the character growth of its consumers.  One \ncurrent exposition of this view sees pornography as treating \nwomen purely as objects of male sexual gratification.  See, \ne.g., Catharine A. MacKinnon, Only Words 108-10;  Mac-\n\nKinnon, \"Francis Biddle's Sister:  Pornography, Civil Rights, \nand Speech,\" in Feminism Unmodified 163, 174 (1987);  Mar-\ntha C. Nussbaum, \"Objectification,\" 25 Phil. & Pub. Affairs \n249, 283-86 (1995);  Cass Sunstein, The Partial Constitution \n257-90 (1993).  But this viewpoint shares at least a core with \nideas that have a lineage of a few centuries, perhaps millen-\nnia, stressing the desirability of deferring gratification, of \nsublimation of sexual impulses, of channeling sexual expres-\nsion into long-term relationships of caring and affection, of \njoining eros to agape.  The supposition that exclusion of \npornography from prisons will have much of an impact in this \ndirection may be optimistic, but it is not irrational.\n\n     There is, of course, no \"record evidence,\" and certainly no \nsophisticated multiple regression analyses or other social \nscience data, to support this belief--a fact our dissenting \ncolleague finds fatal.  See Dissent at 8-11.  We do not think, \nhowever, that common sense must be the mere handmaiden \nof social science data or expert testimonials in evaluating \ncongressional judgments.  Quite the opposite:  scientific stud-\nies can have a corrective effect by establishing an apparently \nimplausible connection or refuting an apparently obvious one, \nbut, subject to such corrections, conformity to commonsensi-\ncal intuitive judgments is a standard element of both reason-\nableness and rationality.  Compare D.N. McCloskey, The \nRhetoric of Economics 44 (1985) (\"Not all regression analyses \nare more persuasive than all moral arguments;  not all con-\ntrolled experiments are more persuasive than all introspec-\ntions.  People should not discriminate against propositions on \nthe basis of epistemological origin.  There are some subjec-\ntive, soft, vague propositions that are more persuasive than \nsome objective, hard, precise propositions.\")  Nor do we think \nSafley requires more.  In that case, the Court scoured the \nrecord for evidence of a rational link between the asserted \nsecurity interests and the marriage ban because common \nsense does not suggest any.  See Safley, 482 U.S. at 97-100.  \nHere, the regulations restrict prison consumption of publica-\ntions that implicitly elevate the value of the viewer's immedi-\nate sexual gratification over the values of respect and consid-\neration for others.  Common sense tells us that prisoners are \n\n\n\f\nmore likely to develop the now-missing self-control and re-\nspect for others if prevented from poring over pictures that \nare themselves degrading and disrespectful.\n\n     Nor can we find irrationality in a congressional fear that \npornography may set back rehabilitation in the narrower \nsense, more directly related to recidivist activity.  The briefs, \nparticularly that of the amicus curiae, call our attention to \nstudies purporting either to document or to demolish the \ncausal link between pornography and sex crimes.6  Without \nattempting a comprehensive summary, we note a few.  One \nconcludes that exposing \"already angered men\" (probably not \nespecially rare in prison) to nonviolent pornography can lead \nto short-term increases in their aggressiveness.  Edward \nDonnerstein, et al., The Question of Pornography 40-48 \n(1987).  Another finds that \"pornography provides ideational \nsupport for rape....\"  Larry Baron & Murray A. Straus, \nFour Theories of Rape in American Society 185 (1989).  \nBaron & Straus's primary evidence for this claim is an \nobserved correlation between the circulation rates of sex \nmagazines and reported rape rates.  While they are hesitant \nto defend a \"cause-effect\" link between pornography and \nrape, they do see the correlation as explained by \"the pres-\nence of a hypermasculine or macho culture pattern.\"  Id. at \n186.  This cultural pattern, Baron and Straus hypothesize, \ncauses both higher incidence of rape and higher consumption \nof pornography.  Of course, it seems quite likely that a \nculture and its manifestations have a mutually reinforcing \nrelationship, so that a prohibition of pornography is a reason-\nable element of a struggle against machismo and its ill effects.\n\n     Finally, there is a significant body of research showing \nthat long-term exposure to pornography, particularly pornog-\n\n__________\n     6 Congress did not cite these materials, an omission of no impor-\ntance.

See \nNeil Malamuth, \"Aggression against Women:  Cultural and \nIndividual Causes,\" in Malamuth & Donnerstein, 19, 32-39;  \nsee also Mike Allen et al., \"Exposure to Pornography and \nAcceptance of Rape Myths,\" 45 J.

The array of academic authority on the other \nside is at least as substantial, and quite possibly more so.  \nBut even undertaking to weigh the competing scholarship \nwould misconceive the judicial role.  Dealing with legislative \njudgments about rehabilitation, the Supreme Court has said \nthat \"[w]hen Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught \nwith medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options \nmust be especially broad and courts should be cautious not to \nrewrite legislation, even assuming, arguendo, that judges with \nmore direct exposure to the problem might make wiser \nchoices.\"  Marshall v.

The \nsame uncertainty prevails here, and suffices to place the \nlegislative judgment within the realm of reason under the \nstandards applicable to the political branches' management of \nprisons.\n\n     The evidence is simply not conclusive on the efficacy of a \nban on pornography in promoting prisoners' rehabilitation.  \nFor judges seeking only a reasonable connection between \nlegislative goals and actions, scientific indeterminacy is deter-\nminative.\n \n\n                                    * * *\n\n     The remaining Safley factors further substantiate the over-\nall reasonableness of the regulations.  The second involves \nthe prisoners' alternative means of exercising the right at \nstake.  Of course if the \"right\" at stake is defined in terms of \nthe materials excluded by the ban, any regulation will come \nup short.  The Court accordingly observed in Thornburgh \nthat the relevant right \"must be viewed sensibly and expan-\nsively,\" 490 U.S. at 417, though it stated no method for \nactually carrying out the definitional process.  In Thorn-\nburgh, where the regulation barred all \"sexually explicit \nmaterial which by its nature or content poses a threat to the \nsecurity, good order, or discipline of the institution, or facili-\ntates criminal activity,\" id. at 405 n.5, the Court found the \nsecond factor \"clearly satisfied\" because \"the regulations \n[there at issue] permit a broad range of publications to be \nsent, received, and read,\" id. at 418.  In so doing, it made no \ninquiry into the scope of sexually explicit material not covered \nby the ban.  Thus, unless there is some minimum entitlement \nto smut in prison, the origins of which must be obscure, this \nfactor can hardly be fatal.7\n\n     The third Safley factor concerns the adverse impact \"on \nguards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison \n\n__________\n     7 Even if there were such a bizarre entitlement, the regulations \nwould still satisfy this factor, as they leave the inmate free to enjoy \nall written forms of smut not barred by the regulations upheld in \nThornburgh.\n\nresources\" of accommodating the right claimed.  482 U.S. at \n90.  It thus seems in part a restatement of the deferential \nbalancing called for under the first factor:  if Congress may \nreasonably conclude that pornography increases the risk of \nprison rape, then the adverse impact is substantial.  Accom-\nmodating the right poses a threat to the safety of guards and \nother inmates.  The issue of the allocation of prison resources \nwe take up below;  we think the third and fourth factors are \nstrongly interrelated.\n\n     The fourth Safley factor poses the question whether there \nare alternatives that can accommodate that right \"at de \nminimis costs to valid penological interests.\"  Safley, 482 \nU.S. at 91.  This is not, the Court emphasized, a \" 'least \nrestrictive alternative' test.\"  Id. at 90.  The most obvious \nalternative is a detailed prisoner-by-prisoner (and presumably \npublication-by-publication) sifting to determine whether a \nparticular publication will harm the rehabilitation of a particu-\nlar prisoner.  The costs of this approach seem far from de \nminimis.  Apart from the purely administrative burden of \nsuch a process, the exercise of such broad discretion seems \nhighly conducive to just the sort of conflicting decisions that \ngive bite to vagueness concerns.  And the reality is that \nprisoners are likely to pass pornographic materials about, so \nthat prisoner-by-prisoner determinations may run aground on \nthe \"ripple effect\" that the Court mentioned in Safley, 482 \nU.S. at 90.  Even if pornography could be directed only to \nthose not likely to be adversely affected, it could find its way \nto others, interfering with their rehabilitation and increasing \nthreats to safety.\n\n     Of course the flip side of avoiding the costs and hazards of \na grant of broad discretion to wardens is the possibility of \npreventing delivery of materials that, either generally or for a \nspecific set of (effectively segregated) prisoners, pose little or \nno threat of the harm Congress sought to diminish.  Outside \nprison walls this concern is addressed by the overbreadth \ndoctrine.  Here it seems to us captured in part by the \ndemand for a rational relation between the regulation and the \ngoal, and by consideration of alternatives under the fourth \n\"factor.\"  Thus, the objections to a more flexible standard--\n\n\n\f\nsuch as one that would vest discretion in wardens to prevent \ndelivery of materials in any case where in his judgment it \nwould impair a specific prisoner's rehabilitation--go a long \nway to rebut the claim.\n\n     The dissent, nonetheless, seems to regard only such a case-\nby-case approach as constitutional, and makes much of vari-\nous hypothetical situations in which the categorical ban could \nunneccessarily exclude certain publications.  See Dissent at \n15-21.  To the extent that these hypotheticals assume direct \nenforcement of the Ensign Amendment, the likelihood of such \nenforcement is, as we have noted, quite remote and not \nbefore us in this case.  Further, the actions of the Bureau of \nPrisons also suggest that the likelihood of this sort of exclu-\nsion under the actual regulatory scheme is remote.  The \nBureau's Program Statement, for example, listing examples \nof permissible publications, cites National Geographic;  Our \nBod[ies], Our Selves;  Sports Illustrated (Swimsuit Edition);  \nand the Victoria's Secret Catalog.  P.S. 5266.07, at 7. We find \nit all but impossible to believe that the Swimsuit Edition and \nVictoria's Secret pass muster while Michelangelo's David or \nconcentration camp pictures fail;  nor has there been any \nsuggestion that any prison official has attempted to imple-\nment such a bizarre interpretation.  As there is no allegation \nthat women in segregated women's prisons are demanding \nPlayboy, neither the possibility of such demand nor the \nBureau's possible response assists plaintiffs in their over-\nbreadth claim.8\n\n     Leaving aside these possible fringe applications of the \nregulation, we again note that the regulation by its terms only \nrestricts pictures;  a prisoner may read anything he pleases.  \n\n__________\n     8 To the extent that the Dissent's insistence on individualized \ndeterminations turns on a view that general rules with any impact \non First Amendment values must correspond to the underlying \nreason in every application, see, e.g., Dissent at 1 (suggesting that \ngovernment must show that \"any pictorial display of nudity or \nsexual activity will be harmful to the rehabilitation of all prisoners\") \n(emphasis in original), it asserts a burden that few general rules \ncould satisfy.\n\n\n\nThe dissent's appeal to the value of ideas, pointing by way of \nexample to the vistas opened for Malcolm X by his prison \nreading, see Dissent at 15-16, thus makes little sense here.  \nCongress could, we think, reasonably be skeptical of the \nproposition that study of the pictures in Penthouse would \nhelp a prisoner become \"an intelligent customer in the mar-\nketplace of ideas.\"  If anything, the ban could strengthen the \nimpact of literature by removing the distraction of pictures \nthat in almost every case would be pornographic.\n\n     In any event, even under conventional overbreadth doc-\ntrine outside of prison, overbreadth claims by those on the \nmargins of pornography have fared poorly.

Accordingly, such problems of applica-\ntion can be left to the time when, if ever, they arise.\n\n     We find that the statute and regulation satisfy Safley's \ndemand for reasonableness, scoring adequately on all four \nfactors.\n\n\n\f\n                                    * * *\n\n\n     Plaintiffs argue that if we are unpersuaded by the district \ncourt's analysis we should remand the case to allow them to \nintroduce evidence supporting their position.  But that sug-\ngestion misconceives the legal issue under Safley.  The ques-\ntion is not whether curtailment of pictorial smut will advance \nthe prisons' rehabilitative project, but whether Congress \ncould reasonably have believed that it would do so.  The \nstudies cited above, coupled with Congress's implicit appeal to \nethical norms against the undue stimulation of carnal appe-\ntites, indicate the reasonableness of such a belief.  If the \nBureau of Prisons applies the regulations in a manner that \nwould violate the Safley priciples, of course, that would be \nanother case.  Accordingly, the district court should have \ngranted the defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' com-\nplaint insofar as that complaint rested upon Safley.\n\n \n                                    * * *\n\n     Besides the overbreadth issue, which we have already \naddressed in the Safley context, plaintiffs have raised two \nadditional theories--excessive vagueness and a claim that the \nregulations' distinction between pictorial and verbal works is \ncontent-based.  In fact, the distinction between pictorial and \nverbal works seems more directed to form than to content, \nand in any event we have seen that Safley's neutrality \nrequirement both displaces conventional First Amendment \nstrictures on content-based limits and is satisfied by these \nregulations.  Although Safley may well function as an all-\nencompassing free speech test for the circulation of reading \nmaterials in prison, supplanting otherwise applicable First \nAmendment doctrine, it may be that plaintiffs' vagueness \nclaim has independent force.  If it did, of course, the role of \nthe Bureau of Prisons, as manager rather than as law enforc-\ner, might well play an important role in resolution of the \nclaim.  Accordingly, as the district court has not addressed \nthese vagueness issues, we remand the case for it to do so.  \nIn the meantime, we lift the permanent injunction that it has \nimposed on enforcement of the regulations.\n\n                                                                                  So ordered.\n\n      Wald, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  The prohibition to all \nfederal prisoners of publications \"featuring nudity\" or depict-\ning \"sexually explicit\" activities indisputably raises First \nAmendment concerns.

The government argues that the \nreason all publications featuring nudity or sexually explicit \nmaterial, whether or not they are pornographic or obscene, \nshould be withheld from all federal prisoners is that any \npictorial display of nudity or sexual activity communicates \nmessages that are harmful to the rehabilitation of all prison-\ners.

A prisoner's desire to leave \nthe prison once a week to attend religious services, for \nexample, or his desire to correspond with other inmates may \nconflict with the prison's need to maintain institutional securi-\nty.

In adopting a test \"less \nrestrictive than that ordinarily applied to alleged infringe-\nments of fundamental constitutional rights,\" O'Lone, 482 U.S. \nat 349, the Court intended to ensure that \"courts afford \nappropriate deference to prison officials,\" id.  To require that \nprison regulations infringing upon fundamental rights under-\ngo strict scrutiny, as they would outside the prison context, \nwould place an inordinately high obstacle in the way of prison \nadministrators' attempts to run their institution safely and \nefficiently.  Second, and significantly, the Court did not in-\ntend Safley 's lesser standard of review to negate prisoners' \nconstitutional rights altogether, as the majority seems to \nsuggest.  The Court did not say, for example, that prison \nregulations are valid if there is any conceivable basis for their \nexistence, as rational basis review is typically formulated.  \nSee, e.g., United States R.R. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> \n<span class=\"page\">166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179 (1980) (noting that where, under rational basis \nreview, \"there are plausible reasons for Congress' action, our \ninquiry is at an end\").  Rather, the task for courts is to \ndetermine, while giving appropriate deference to the judg-\nment of prison officials, whether a challenged regulation is, in \nfact, reasonable or whether it is an \"exaggerated response\" to \nthe \"legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify \nit.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 89-90 (emphasis added);  see also \nLaurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1445 n.21 \n(2d ed.  1988) (\"Any limit placed on the Court's imagination \nvis-a-vis legislative purpose must be recognized as a tightened \nform of scrutiny.\").  A governmental institution is permitted \n\"regulation more intrusive than what may lawfully apply to \nthe general public,\" Majority Opinion (\"Maj.Op.\") at 5, not \nsimply because of its status but rather because of the identifi-\nable, and unique, needs of that institution.  And although the \nneed for flexibility is perhaps at its highest in the prison \nenvironment, the need for limits on that flexibility is also \nparamount:  Unlike government employees, students, or other \nparticipants in governmental institutions, prisoners have no \nchoice about whether to be subject to the power of the state.\n\n     To read Safley--as the majority appears to--as permitting \nunblinking deference to any \"plausible\" legislative judgment \n\n\n\f\nabout the \"rehabilitative\" benefits of denying a prisoner's \nmost fundamental constitutional right, i.e., her freedom to \nread, renders any and all prisoners' constitutional rights a \nnullity.  I had thought it went without saying that courts do \nnot rely on the mere assertion of a regulation's drafters that \nthe regulation is reasonable;  to do so would amount to an \nabdication of our judicial role.

But were we simply to defer to Con-\ngress's assertion that the Ensign Amendment (\"the Amend-\nment\") was reasonably related to the interest asserted, there \nwould be no need for judicial review at all, for no statute \n\n__________\n     3 Of course, because the majority concludes that the BOP's regu-\nlations, and not the Ensign Amendment, are controlling in this case, \nthe majority's focus on Congress's conclusions may be misguided.  \nSee, e.g., Maj.

But \nsee note 4, infra.\n\n\n\f\ninfringing on inmates' constitutional rights would fail to satis-\nfy this test.  The Court has reminded us that the Safley \nstandard \"is not toothless,\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 414 \n(internal quotation omitted);  more precisely, it is not a license \nfor lawmakers, any more than prison wardens, to shortchange \nthe constitutional rights that the Supreme Court has insisted \nprisoners continue to possess.  Only if our assessment is not \na cursory one can we give adequate weight to both concerns \nthat underlie the Safley standard.  See, e.g., Salaam, 905 \nF.2d at 1171 n.6 (\"Reasonableness in this context refers not \nonly to the relation between the goals of a regulation and its \nmeans, but also to the balance struck between the needs of \nthe prison administrators and the constitutional rights of \nprisoners.\").\n\n     It is crucial, therefore, to ensure that although the strict-\nness of our review is lessened, it is not eliminated altogether.  \nOur task, ultimately, is to assess the fit between the interest \nproffered and the remedy adopted--whether the regulation \nunder consideration is a reasonable means of addressing the \nlegitimate penological interest put forward by the govern-\nment.  In Safley itself, for example, although the prison's \nasserted interests in security and rehabilitation were suffi-\ncient to justify some restriction on the right to marry, the \nCourt held that the particular restriction adopted was too \nbroad to be upheld.  See Safley, 482 U.S. at 97-98 (\"No doubt \nlegitimate security concerns may require placing reasonable \nrestrictions upon an inmate's right to marry, and may justify \nrequiring approval of the superintendent.  The Missouri reg-\nulation, however, represents an exaggerated response to such \nsecurity objectives.\");  id. at 98 (\"[I]n requiring refusal of \npermission absent a finding of a compelling reason to allow \nthe marriage, the rule sweeps much more broadly than can be \nexplained by petitioners' penological objectives.\").  In Thorn-\nburgh, by contrast, the pre-Amendment version of the restric-\ntions under consideration here were found to represent a \nreasonable response to institutional concerns because the \n\"individualized nature\" of the determinations ensured that the \npolicy would not result in \"needless exclusions.\"  Thornburgh, \n490 U.S. at 416-17;  see also id. (noting that even a publica-\n\n\n\f\ntion that met one of the criteria for exclusion would be \nrejected \"only if it is determined to meet that standard under \nthe conditions prevailing at the institution at the time\").  \nThese cases illustrate that the standard of review established \nby Safley sets some limits on the means the government may \nuse to further penological interests.  Although these limits \nare flexible, they are by no means as vaporous as the majori-\nty rules them to be.\n\n     I agree that rehabilitation is, conceptually, a legitimate \ngovernmental interest, even if no one is sure how to achieve it \nand the Federal Sentencing Guidelines have abandoned it as \nan attainable goal.

If \nthe Amendment prohibited the distribution of publications \ncontaining escape plans, the connection between the ban and \nthe penological interest in institutional security would be \nobvious, and we could uphold such a prohibition based on \nlittle or no demonstrated evidence.

The Court's rejection of the \nmarriage restriction at issue in that case clearly turned on the \nquality of the evidence before the Court;  four times the \nCourt concluded that the regulation was not reasonably relat-\ned to penological interests based \"on this record.\"  See Saf-\nley, 482 U.S. at 97 (\"We conclude that on this record, the \nMissouri prison regulation, as written, is not reasonably \nrelated to these penological interests.\");  id. at 98 (\"Nor, on \nthis record, is the marriage restriction reasonably related to \nthe articulated rehabilitation goal.\");  id. at 99 (\"Moreover, \nalthough not necessary to the disposition of this case, we note \nthat on this record the rehabilitative objective asserted to \nsupport the regulation itself is suspect.\");  id.  (\"On this \nrecord, however, the almost complete ban on the decision to \nmarry is not reasonably related to legitimate penological \nobjectives.\") (emphases added).  This repeated qualification \n\n\n\f\nof the Court's negative conclusion about the validity of the \nregulation starkly suggests that while a reasonable relation-\nship might possibly have been demonstrated between the \nmarriage restriction and the interests asserted, the prison \nhad failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that \nrelationship.\n\n     The majority's apparent conclusion that the government \nbears no responsibility for compiling evidence to support the \nbreadth of its ban--in other words, that the courts may \nsimply hypothesize a rational connection--runs counter to the \nwisdom of several other circuit courts.

There is, of course, much material \nthat features nudity or depicts sexual activity that would not qualify \nas pornography under any definition, including many highly regard-\ned works of art.\n\n\nis unclear even in the studies finding a positive connection \nbetween violent pornography and aggressive behavior wheth-\ner the aggression is due to the violent content of the material \nor its sexual content.  See, e.g., Larry Baron & Murray A. \nStraus, Four Theories of Rape in American Society 8 (1989) \n(\"It seems reasonable to conclude ... that it is the violent \ncontent rather than the sexual content that facilitates aggres-\nsion.\");  Richard A. Posner, Sex and Reason 368 (1992) (\"[T]he \neffects [of violent pornography] may be due to the violence \nper se rather than to the erotic component.\").  Thus, while it \nis entirely possible that a narrower publication ban than that \naccomplished by the Amendment could be supported by the \navailable literature, cf., e.g., Dawson, 986 F.2d at 262 (uphold-\ning regulation limiting time, place, and conditions under \nwhich certain inmates could view materials), neither the \ngovernment nor the majority has laid the barest foundation \nfor the far-reaching ban promulgated.  The majority's level of \ncomfort in relying on any statement of any legislator as to \nwhat he thinks will encourage rehabilitation as the sole basis \nfor taking away a First Amendment right is very surprising \nto me, especially since its holding today goes far beyond what \nany court has previously condoned in depriving prisoners of \nconstitutional rights on the mere assertion of a legislator that \nhe supposes rehabilitation to be so advanced.\n\n     In this respect, I believe that it needs to be stressed that \nthe assertion of \"rehabilitation\" as the reason for impinging \non prisoners' First Amendment rights is particularly discon-\ncerting in its potential for abuse.  Unlike its interest in \ninstitutional security, the contours of the government's inter-\nest in rehabilitation are quite amorphous and ill-defined.  At \nthe most basic level, the goal of rehabilitation might be stated \nas returning the prisoner to society in a state so that he will \nhenceforth behave in a law-abiding manner, but no one, not \neven Congress, is so immodest as to claim secure knowledge \nof how this goal is to be achieved in individual cases, let alone \nin the aggregate;  most often, rehabilitation efforts involve \ntherapy, drug and alcohol counseling, basic education, or job \ntraining, but even in these positive attempts, the results are \nfar from reassuring.  Against that backdrop, it is extremely \n\n\n\f\ndifficult, if not impossible, to ascertain precisely if or how a \nparticular publication may work to frustrate the rehabilitative \ngoals of prisoners.  To start with, there is no consensus on \nwhether in order to transform a law violator into a good \ncitizen, he must be \"remolded\" attitudinally and instilled with \ndesirable values or whether it is sufficient that he be con-\nvinced that further criminal activity would be counterproduc-\ntive in his own case, whatever his vision of society or the \nworld.  Rehabilitation may also be viewed--in the majority's \nparlance--as an effort to direct the \"character growth\" of \nprisoners by limiting the reading materials to which he has \naccess.  See Maj. Op. at 11.  But, whatever the rehabilitative \nvision, it should not be possible to proceed on some vague \nassertion of an interest in \"rehabilitation\" without the need to \ndefine the term or to show a connection between the pro-\nscribed activity and the chosen definition;  to do so runs an \noverwhelming risk of overregulation and invasion of the in-\nnermost recesses of the human mind and spirit.  Indeed, \nundertaking the Herculean task of \"character-molding\" is \ninherently problematic in its First Amendment implications, \nfor it presumably involves casting emerging prisoners in \nsociety's own image.  This, of course, is the antithesis of First \nAmendment freedoms;  indeed, \"[t]otalitarian ideologies we \nprofess to hate have styled as 'rehabilitation' the process of \nmolding the unorthodox mind to the shape of prevailing \ndogma.\"   Sobell v.

These examples may sound extreme--\nthey are--but the majority's rationale easily encompasses \nthem in its umbrella-like authorization for restricting prison-\ners' reading material on the basis of a minimum plausibility \ntest for tying the censorship to some vague rehabilitation \nconcept.\n\n     Even if the goal of rehabilitation is a more modest one--to \nconvince the prisoner his own best interest lies in avoiding \nfuture crime--it is hard to see how that goal is furthered by \nreturning him unequipped to be an intelligent customer in the \nmarketplace of ideas.  And while serious questions may well \nbe raised about the value of some of the publications banned \nunder the Amendment, there is much that falls under this \nbroad ban that speaks intelligently to mankind, including \nprisoners:  Michelangelo's David, for example, or grim photo-\ngraphs of naked bodies piled in the pits of Germany's concen-\ntration camps.8  There is even a potential for such depictions \n\n__________\n     8 The majority suggests that the application of the regulations to \nprohibit artistic depictions of nudity or to documentary photographs \nof wartime atrocities would be \"bizarre.\"  See Maj. Op. at 17.  But, \nin fact, even the regulations do not provide for any exceptions to the \nnudity ban based on a publication's artistic or political content.  See \n28 C.F.R. s 540.72(b)(3) (providing possible exception only for \n\n\n\nof nudity to strike a life-changing chord with some prisoners, \na change that should not be prevented from coming to \nfruition.

Of course, as the majori-\nty notes, the Constitution has nothing to say about what \nmessages the government may choose to communicate as a \nspeaker.  See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1991) \n(\"The Government can, without violating the Constitution, \nselectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it \nbelieves to be in the public interest, without at the same time \nfunding an alternate program which seeks to deal with the \nproblem in another way.\").  Congress or the BOP may make \n\n__________\nnudity \"illustrative of medical, educational, or anthropological con-\ntent\").  And although the Victoria's Secret catalog and the Sports \nIllustrated Swimsuit Edition are listed by the BOP as permissible \npublications, the basis for their exclusion from the ban is left to \nconjecture.  Cf. id. s 540.72(b)(2) (defining \"nudity\" as \"a pictorial \ndepiction where ... female breasts are exposed\").  As for the \nnotion that explicit descriptions of sexual activities and nudity are \nstill permitted (an illustrated version of Henry Miller's Tropic of \nCancer is banned but a nonillustrated version is not), this only \nunderscores the arbitrariness of the rehabilitative nexus.\n\n     9 Of course, lawmakers who believe that Malcolm X inspires \nseparatism and racial consciousness may, under the \"remolding\" \ntheory of rehabilitation, prohibit prisoners from reading his writings \nas well.\n\n\nwhatever recreational reading it wishes available in the prison \nlibraries without offending the Constitution;  they may even \nprovide each prisoner with a tract on the harms of pornogra-\nphy in the hope that some readers will take its lessons to \nheart.  But it is quite a different matter for prisons to deny \nall access to certain publications in the name of rehabilitation, \nparticularly in such a broad and overreaching manner as this \none.  If prisoners are to retain any First Amendment rights, \nthe mere assertion of \"rehabilitation\" as the interest to be \nserved by a particular regulation cannot serve to extinguish \nthose rights altogether.\n\n     Because the Amendment and the regulations eliminate the \ndiscretion of prison wardens to make individual determina-\ntions about how particular publications will affect particular \nprisoners in particular prison settings, even rehabilitatively, I \nbelieve it was incumbent upon the government to point to \nsome evidence demonstrating a connection between all publi-\ncations that are sexually explicit or that feature nudity and a \ntendency to engage in criminal or disruptive behavior, keep-\ning in mind that our task is to determine whether such a \nconnection is reasonably likely to exist, not whether one \nmight be conceivable.  Cf., e.g., Mauro, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">550190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at \n*7 (considering whether all materials depicting nudity are \n\"reasonably likely\" to cause violence or to be used to harass \nguards).  Neither the government nor the majority has point-\ned to any such evidence.\n\n     Indeed, the proposition that all material that is sexually \nexplicit or that features nudity will have a detrimental effect \non rehabilitation is belied by the prior actions of the prison \nofficials under the pre-Amendment policy.  At that time, \nprison officials were authorized to prohibit sexually explicit \nmaterials that they believed would negatively affect the disci-\npline or \"good order\" of the institution.  Significantly, the \nprison officials--to whose expertise the Supreme Court has \nrepeated deferred on matters such as this--did not choose to \nprohibit all material that is sexually explicit or that features \nnudity.  Rather, they evaluated the publications individually \nto determine which ones, in their expert opinions, posed a \npotential threat and which did not;  indeed, as the majority \n\n\n\fnotes, \"explicit heterosexual material\" was ordinarily admit-\nted.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 405 n.6 (quoting Program \nStatement 5266.5(b)(2)).  It was this \"individualized nature\" \nof the determinations that led the Thornburgh Court to \nconclude that the regulations at issue in that case were \nrationally related to security interests, the nature of which, \nlike rehabilitation, can change over time.10  See Thornburgh, \n490 U.S. at 417 (\"We agree that it is rational for the Bureau \nto exclude materials that ... are determined by the warden \nto create an intolerable risk of disorder under the conditions \nof a particular prison at a particular time.\").\n\n     Because I believe that, on this record, there is no basis for \nconcluding that there is a rational connection between the \ninterest asserted by the government--rehabilitation--and the \nrestriction chosen to further that interest--a ban on the \ndelivery to all federal prisoners of all publications that are \n\n__________\n     10 It should be noted in this respect that a seemingly innocuous \npublication may be quite detrimental to a prisoner's rehabilitation, \ndepending on the circumstances.

Harper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112381\"><a href=\"/opinion/112381/washington-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> \n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), in which the Court upheld a prison policy that \npermitted the involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs to \ninmates, given that the policy was not unnecessarily broad and \nsupported by a wealth of evidence:\n\n     Its exclusive application is to inmates who are mentally ill and \n     who, as a result of their illness, are gravely disabled or \n     represent a significant danger to themselves or others.  The \n     drugs may be administered for no purpose other than treat-\n     ment, and only under the direction of a licensed psychiatrist.  \n     There is considerable debate over the potential side effects of \n     antipsychotic medications, but there is little dispute in the \n     psychiatric profession that proper use of the drugs is one of the \n     most effective means of treating and controlling a mental \n     illness likely to cause violent behavior.\n\nId. at 226.\n\nsexually explicit or that feature nudity, I would affirm the \ndecision of the district court.  As the majority considers the \nremaining Safley factors, however, I will also offer a few \nthoughts.\n\n     The second Safley factor considers whether there are \"al-\nternative means of exercising the right that remain open to \nprison inmates.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 90.  Although this right \nmust be viewed \"sensibly and expansively,\" Thornburgh, 490 \nU.S. at 417, it cannot be viewed so broadly as to eliminate any \nreason for analysis (or as unhelpfully as the majority's sar-\ndonic reference to an \"entitlement to smut\").  The Thorn-\nburgh Court, for example, noted that although the regulation \nunder consideration in that case permitted the warden to \nmake individualized determinations as to each publication, an \nexercise of discretion that might appear to produce inconsis-\ntent results, \"greater consistency might be attainable only at \nthe cost of a more broadly restrictive rule against admission \nof incoming publications,\" which \"might itself run afoul of the \nsecond [Safley ] factor.\"  Id. at 417 n.15.  Because the \nAmendment eliminates a wide variety of publications that \nfeature nudity for artistic or other reasons, prisoners do not \nhave sufficient means of exercising their right to receive \nmany constitutionally protected materials.  Cf., e.g., Mauro, \n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">550190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (\"[I]n direct contradiction of the \nSupreme Court's cautionary language in Thornburgh, Marico-\npa County has enacted a regulation that sweeps too broadly, \nindiscriminately eliminating large categories of materials \nwithout individualized consideration.\").\n\n     The third factor considers \"the impact accommodation of \nthe asserted constitutional right will have on guards and \nother inmates.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 90.  Where the institu-\ntional interest asserted for a publication ban is security, \naccommodation of the inmate's First Amendment rights may \nindeed cause the \"ripple effect\" of which the Safley Court \nwarned, see id.;  a breach of security with respect to one \nprisoner is likely to result in other breaches in the prison.  In \nthis case, however, there is no evidence by which to judge \nwhether permitting certain inmates to view publications that \nare sexually explicit or that feature nudity will have an \n\n\n\fadverse effect on the rehabilitation of other inmates.  Reha-\nbilitation is a gradual process, and it is entirely possible that \nany momentary lapses caused by the inadvertent receipt of an \ninappropriate publication may be reversed with additional \nrehabilitative efforts.  This is not true of security breaches:  \nOnce an inmate has received information on how to escape \nfrom the prison, he cannot be made to forget it.  It thus \ncannot be concluded, on this record, that accommodation of \nAmatel's First Amendment right will have a significant effect \non the rehabilitation of other inmates.\n\n     Finally, the fourth factor considers whether there are \n\"obvious, easy alternatives\" that \"fully accommodate[ ] the \nprisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological \ninterests\";  if so, this may be evidence that the regulation is \nan \"exaggerated response\" to prison concerns.  Id. at 90-91.  \nOne such alternative comes immediately to mind:  the pre-\nAmendment policy, under which wardens had discretion to \nexamine each incoming publication and determine whether \ninstitutional interests favored its prohibition.  The Court's \napproval of this policy in Thornburgh eliminates any concerns \nthe majority might have that such a policy would be deemed \narbitrary or particularly burdensome;  indeed, since prison \nofficials under the current policy must examine each publica-\ntion to determine whether it is sexually explicit or features \nnudity, the prior policy arguably represents no additional \nadministrative burden.\n\n     Moreover, other aspects of the Amendment suggest that it \nis indeed an \"exaggerated response\" to rehabilitative con-\ncerns.  The Amendment does not allow the warden to take \ninto account whether a prisoner is in a high- or low-security \ninstitution, whether a prisoner is male or female, what kinds \nof crimes the prisoner has committed,11 the nature of the \n\n__________\n     11 For example, the government has provided no evidence on why \na ban on nudity is necessary to rehabilitate those convicted of \nnonsexual and/or nonviolent crimes.  I can think of no reason why \nan embezzler, a tax evader, or a person held in contempt for \nrefusing to testify will be rehabilitated if prevented from looking at \npublications that \"feature\" nudity.  (The statements of the only two \n\n\n\f\nprisoner's sentence,12 how long the prisoner has been incar-\ncerated and how long he or she has left to serve, whether the \nprisoner is receiving rehabilitative treatment,13 or even \nwhether a prisoner is in a prison environment that provides \nan opportunity to share the material with anyone else (partic-\nularly with other prisoners convicted of sex crimes).  In these \nrespects, the Amendment \"sweeps much more broadly than \ncan be explained by [the government's] penological objec-\ntives.\"  Safley, 482 U.S. at 98 (invalidating ban on all prisoner \nmarriages by noting that prison officials had experienced no \nproblems with marriages by male inmates or with inmate-\ncivilian marriages;  the prison's rehabilitative concern \"ap-\npear[ed] from the record to have been centered almost exclu-\nsively on female inmates marrying other inmates or ex-\n\n__________\nmembers of Congress who offered floor comments on the Amend-\nment suggest that their concern was with sex offenders.  See 142 \nCong. Rec. H8262 (daily ed.  July 24, 1996) (\"[I]f we do not adopt \nmy amendment, we are sending the message that it is OK to \nprovide sexually explicit magazines and books to the very prisoners \nwho have committed violent acts against women.\") (statement of \nRep. Ensign);  id.  (\"Far too often, those individuals convicted of \ncrimes have the opportunity, while in prison, to use materials that \nglamorize the very acts for which they were convicted.\") (statement \nof Rep. Christensen).)\n\n     Moreover, the Amendment's ban may also extend to those in-\nmates who have not yet been convicted but rather are imprisoned \nwhile awaiting trial.  The government has not suggested any reason \nfor it to take a rehabilitative interest in these individuals, nor do I \nthink it can legitimately do so.  See, e.g., McGinnis v. Royster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108717\"><a href=\"/opinion/108717/mcginnis-v-royster/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> \n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (1973) (\"[I]t would hardly be appropriate for the State \nto undertake in the pretrial detention period programs to rehabili-\ntate a man still clothed with a presumption of innocence.\").\n\n     12 The government would seem to have less rehabilitative interest \nin, for example, prisoners who have been sentenced to life in prison \nwithout parole or to death.\n\n     13 In some prisons, material featuring adult nudity is an effective \npart of a rehabilitative program.  See, e.g, Waterman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> \n<span class=\"page\">354932</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (citing evidence that adult pornography may be \nhelpful in turning pedophiles away from child pornography).\n\nfelons,\" id. at 99, and thus did not account for the ban on \nother inmate marriages).\n\n     The majority's decision to remand this case for further \nconsideration of Amatel's vagueness challenge leaves a scintil-\nla of hope that this ill-conceived statute will ultimately fail.  \nBecause I cannot agree with the majority's Safley analysis, \nhowever, or with its decision to lift the district court's injunc-\ntion in the interim, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n\n     Justice Holmes once remarked that hard cases make bad \nlaw.  See Northern Sec. Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96033\"><a href=\"/opinion/96033/northern-securities-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \n400 (1904) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  Claims of prisoners to \nread magazines like Playboy or Penthouse may not be the \nideal vehicles for the articulation of First Amendment rights.  \nBut, as Dostoyevsky observed, \"the degree of civilization in a \nsociety is revealed by entering its prisons.\"  F. Dostoyevsky, \nThe House of the Dead 76 (C. Garnett trans., 1957).  Today's \nruling that prisoners may be stripped of rights to view \npublications of their choice on the mere assertion of legisla-\ntors or regulators--far removed from the prison scene and \nwithout supporting evidence of any kind--that those publica-\ntions will hinder their \"rehabilitation\" goes well beyond prior \nprecedent and the case law in other circuits.  It is a most \ntroubling precedent.\n\n       \n</pre>",
