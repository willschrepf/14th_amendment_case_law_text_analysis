At the time of the bringing of the action, the plaintiff, school district No. 15 in Snohomish county, paid into the registry of the court the sum of $9,320.70, which was the retained percentage on a building contract. The state of Washington was made a party defendant, together with a number of other defendants. After the action was instituted, the United States of America interpleaded. The state and, also, the United States sought to recover unemployment insurance taxes which were deducted from the wages of workmen. The Peoples National Bank, West Seattle branch, one of the defendants, asserted a claim to the retained percentage by reason of an assignment from the contractor. The trial was to the court without a jury, and resulted in findings of fact from which it was concluded that the right of the state and of the United States to the fund was superior to that of the bank. Judgment was entered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 232</span> \nin accordance with the findings and conclusions, from which the bank appealed.</p>\n<p>The facts essential to be stated are these: In November, 1938, M.L. Ericksen entered into a contract with school district No. 15 for the construction of an addition to the Edmonds high school building. In March or April, 1939, Ericksen approached the Peoples National Bank, which will be referred to as the bank, with a request for loans to be advanced to him for the purpose of carrying out the contract. Ericksen indicated his willingness to assign to the bank all monies due or payable to him under the contract, for the purpose of securing such advances, when payments of monthly estimates were made.</p>\n<p>July 20, 1939, in furtherance of this understanding, Ericksen executed in writing, and delivered to the bank, an assignment of all monies due or to become due on the contract. This assignment was delivered to the school board in September, 1939. An additional confirmatory assignment was made January 25, 1940. The first assignment provided that Ericksen should turn over to the bank the checks which he received from the school district on the monthly estimates. The second assignment provided that the checks should be drawn in favor of the bank. The assignments were accepted by the school district, and the payments were made to the bank, as provided therein. From time to time the bank advanced money to Ericksen, all of which was used by Ericksen for the payment of labor and materials in carrying out the contract.</p>\n<p>In the judgment entered, as above indicated, the claims of the state and of the United States were made superior to that of the bank. The state was given a judgment against the fund in the sum of $2,639.94, with interest. The United States was given judgment against the fund in the sum of $2,191.51, with interest. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 233</span> \nThe bank was given judgment against the fund in the sum of $22,892.16, together with interest. From this it appears that there was sufficient money in the fund to pay both the claim of the state and that of the United States, but not sufficient to pay the bank. In fact, if the bank's claim was prior, it would exceed the amount of the retained percentage paid into the registry of the court. At the time the retained percentage was paid into the registry of the court, the building had been completed and accepted by the school district.</p>\n<p>The first question is whether the United States or the bank had a prior and superior right to the fund.</p>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> Both assignments provided that: \". . . all monies due or payable, or to become due and payable from Edmonds School District No. 15 under contract for construction of School Building . . .\" were assigned to the bank. Money due or to become due upon a contract, such as the one here involved, is assignable. 6 C.J.S. 1060, &#167; 15. A fund to be assignable does not have to be actually existent.
