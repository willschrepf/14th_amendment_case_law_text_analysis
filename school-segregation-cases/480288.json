He filed a pro se 28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus in federal district court contending his Colorado vehicular eluding\n\nsentence ran afoul of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). The district\n\ncourt denied his petition and dismissed the action on the ground that Apprendi\n\ndoes not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. Mr. Allen appeals that\n\ndecision and we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                          I\n\n      Mr. Allen was convicted by a jury in Colorado state court of one count of\n\naggravated motor theft in violation of C OLO . R EV . S TAT . § 18-4-409; one count of\n\nvehicular eluding in violation of § 18-9-116.5; fourteen counts of felony\n\nmenacing in violation of § 18-3-206; one count of possession of an incendiary\n\ndevice in violation of § 18-12-109(2); one count of false imprisonment in\n\nviolation of § 18-3-303; one count of misdemeanor failure to leave the premises\n\nin violation of § 18-9-119; and eight counts of criminal attempt to commit\n\nreckless manslaughter in violation of §§ 18-3-104, 18-2-101. People v. Allen, 78\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fP.3d 751, 752 (Colo. Ct. App. 2001). 1 Pursuant to Colorado’s general sentencing\n\nlaws, the court sentenced Mr. Allen to a series of concurrent and consecutive\n\nterms resulting in a total sentence of thirty years imprisonment. See C OLO . R EV .\n\nS TAT . §§ 18-1.3-401(6) & (7) (formerly C OLO . R EV . S TAT . §§ 18-1-105(6) & (7)).\n\nThe sentence included a six-year term for vehicular eluding, the maximum\n\naggravated sentence permitted for that offense under § 18-1-105(6). Allen, 751\n\nP.3d at 752.\n\n      Mr. Allen appealed arguing, inter alia, that his aggravated vehicular\n\neluding sentence violated Apprendi. Id. at 754. The Colorado Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the convictions and sentence on direct appeal. See id. at 755. Mr. Allen\n\nthen filed a timely petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Colorado Supreme\n\nCourt denied on April 15, 2002. Id. at 751.\n\n      On March 6, 2003, Mr. Allen filed this federal habeas petition, again\n\nraising Apprendi with regard to his vehicular eluding sentence. Concluding that\n\nApprendi does not apply retroactively to litigants on collateral review, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the petition and denied Mr. Allen’s request for a certificate of\n\nappealability. We granted his motion for a certificate of appealability, permitting\n\nhim to proceed on appeal on the following two claims: (1) whether the district\n\n\n      1\n       People v. Allen was originally published at 43 P.3d 689. It was\nrepublished at 78 P.3d 751 to include modifications on denial of rehearing.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcourt correctly ruled that Apprendi does not apply retroactively to Mr. Allen’s\n\nsentence, and (2) whether Apprendi renders unconstitutional the Colorado statutes\n\nunder which Mr. Allen was sentenced. We address each claim in turn.\n\n\n\n                                         II\n\n      Determining the applicability of Apprendi to a habeas petition requires us\n\nto decide when Mr. Allen’s conviction became “final” within the meaning of the\n\nrelevant statute, here the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). 2 See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2244(d)(1) (indicating state prisoner has one year from the date his conviction\n\nbecomes “final” to seek federal habeas relief). Precedent makes clear that\n\nresolving whether a convicted defendant may find refuge in a rule of criminal\n\nprocedure newly announced by the Supreme Court depends in large part on\n\ntiming. 3 If the conviction is not yet final when the Court announces the rule,\n\n\n      2\n       Because Mr. Allen’s habeas petition was filed after the effective date of\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No.\n104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), it is governed by AEDPA’s provisions. See\nMitchell v. Gibson, 262 F.3d 1036, 1045 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\n      3\n       We have already held that “[b]ecause the rule set forth in Apprendi [v. New\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000)] is rooted in the jury trial and due process guarantees\nof the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments,”Apprendi announced a “new rule of\nconstitutional law.” Browning v. United States, 241 F.3d 1262, 1266 (10th Cir.\n2001) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                        -4-\n\flower courts must apply that rule to the defendant’s case. Griffith v. Kentucky,\n\n479 U.S. 314, 322 (1987). If, however, the conviction is already final, a\n\ndefendant ordinarily may not avail himself of the newly announced rule. Teague\n\nv. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 310 (1989). 4 Thus, our retroactivity analysis hinges\n\nentirely on the meaning of the word “final.”\n\n      The Supreme Court has expressly articulated that “[a] state conviction and\n\nsentence become final for purposes of [the Teague analysis] when the availability\n\nof direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a\n\npetition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been\n\nfinally denied.” Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 390 (1994); see also Griffith,\n\n479 U.S. at 321 n.6. (a final conviction means “a case in which a judgment of\n\nconviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time\n\nfor a petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied”).\n\nMr. Allen was convicted by a jury on September 4, 1998. He timely filed his\n\nnotice of direct appeal on or about November 18, 1998, and his case remained\n\npending in state court until the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari review\n\non April 15, 2002. Apprendi was decided on June 26, 2000.\n\n\n      4\n       To be sure, there are specific circumstances in which a newly announced\nrule may be applied retroactively to an already final conviction. See Teague v.\nLane, 489 U.S. 288, 310 (1989). Because we hold that Mr. Allen’s conviction\nwas not yet final when the Supreme Court announced the rule of Apprendi,\nhowever, we need not detain ourselves exploring these exceptions here.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      As the state concedes in its answer brief, see Aple. Br. at 9, this chronology\n\ndiscloses Mr. Allen’s conviction was not yet “final” for purposes of AEDPA\n\nwhen Apprendi was decided. Indeed, Mr. Allen raised Apprendi both before the\n\nColorado Court of Appeals on initial appeal and in the state supreme court via his\n\ncertiorari petition. Because the rule of Apprendi was newly announced prior to\n\nthe date on which Mr. Allen’s conviction became final, the rule applies to his case\n\nnotwithstanding his invocation of it in a collateral attack. Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court’s determination that Apprendi does not apply retroactively to Mr.\n\nAllen’s vehicular eluding sentence was erroneous.\n\n\n\n                                         III\n\n      The closer question is whether Apprendi renders unconstitutional the\n\nColorado statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced. Under AEDPA, a\n\nfederal court may not grant habeas relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in\n\nstate court, such as Mr. Allen’s Apprendi claim, unless the state court decision\n\n“was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), or\n\n“was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding,” id. § 2254(d)(2). See Turrentine v.\n\nMullin, 390 F.3d 1181, 1188 (10th Cir. 2004). Moreover, state court fact findings\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fare presumed correct unless the petitioner rebuts them by clear and convincing\n\nevidence. See § 2254(e)(1); Hale v. Gibson, 227 F.3d 1298, 1309 (10th Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n         Decisions “contrary to” or representing an “unreasonable application of”\n\nfederal law are independent bases for habeas relief. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n\n362, 404-05 (2000) (O’Connor, J., concurring). A state court decision is contrary\n\nto clearly established federal law under § 2254(d)(1) if the state court arrives at a\n\nconclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or\n\nif the state court decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of\n\nmaterially indistinguishable facts. See id. at 412-13. A state court decision is an\n\nunreasonable application of federal law under § 2254(d)(2) if the state court\n\nidentifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner’s\n\ncase. Id. at 413. “The reasonableness of the state court’s application of federal\n\nlaw is to be evaluated by an objective standard. The Supreme Court has\n\ncautioned that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an\n\nincorrect or erroneous application of federal law.” Mitchell v. Gibson, 262 F.3d\n\n1036, 1045 (10th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nWith these standards in mind, we turn to Mr. Allen’s legal argument.\n\n         Mr. Allen contends the trial court’s decision to increase his vehicular\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\feluding sentence based on facts not found by the jury violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to a trial by jury. In Apprendi, the Supreme Court invalidated a\n\nNew Jersey sentencing statute that permitted judges to assign an enhanced\n\nsentence, greater than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum, based on a\n\npost-conviction judicial finding that the defendant’s offense qualified as a “hate\n\ncrime.” 530 U.S. at 468-69. In order for a defendant’s sentence to comport with\n\nthe Sixth Amendment, “any fact [other than the fact of a prior conviction] that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must\n\nbe submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 490\n\n(emphasis added). The Court explained that the label which the legislature\n\napplies to the fact (such as “sentencing factor” or “element”) is irrelevant because\n\nthe inquiry properly focuses on effect rather than form. Id. at 494. Simply stated,\n\nApprendi forbids courts from imposing a sentence exceeding the statutory\n\nmaximum allowed for the defendant’s crime of conviction.\n\n      Four years later, the Court applied the rule of Apprendi to the State of\n\nWashington’s determinate sentencing regime. Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct.\n\n2531 (2004). Blakely involved a defendant who pled guilty to second-degree\n\nkidnapping, a state offense that carried a statutory maximum of ten years\n\nimprisonment. Based solely on the facts admitted by Mr. Blakely, Washington’s\n\nSentencing Reform Act authorized a “standard” sentencing range of forty-nine to\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\ffifty-three months imprisonment. Id. at 2534-35. Pursuant to the act, however, a\n\ncourt could exceed a fifty-three month sentence for a second-degree kidnapping\n\nconviction if it found a “substantial and compelling reason.” Id. (quoting W ASH .\n\nR EV . C ODE A NN . § 9.94A.310(3)(b)). Because the state court found that Mr.\n\nBlakely had committed his crime with “deliberate cruelty,” it sentenced him to\n\nninety months, a term more than three years greater than the top end of the\n\nstandard range. Id. A majority of the Supreme Court held this practice\n\nunconstitutional and in doing so instructed\n\n      that the “statutory maximum” for Apprendi purposes is the maximum\n      sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the\n      jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. In other words, the relevant\n      “statutory maximum” is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose\n      after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose without any\n      additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury’s verdict\n      alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts “which the law\n      makes essential to the punishment,” and the judge exceeds his proper\n      authority.\n\nId. at 2537 (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original). In the term following\n\nBlakely, the Court extended Apprendi to the federal sentencing guidelines. See\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\n      Under the Colorado sentencing scheme, a trial court must impose a\n\nsentence within the applicable presumptive range for a felony offense unless it\n\nfinds that extraordinary mitigating or aggravating facts are present. See People v.\n\nLeske, 957 P.2d 1030, 1042-43 (Colo. 1998). As explained by the Colorado\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fSupreme Court:\n\n      Felony sentencing in [Colorado] is largely dictated by a complex scheme of\n      interlocking statutes, premised upon the segregation of felony offenses into\n      six levels or classes, each with its own presumptive sentencing range. See\n      § 18-1.3-401, 6 C.R.S. (2002) (formerly § 18-1-105). Under various\n      circumstances, courts are permitted to sentence convicted felons in a\n      mitigated range, as little as half the minimum presumptive sentence, or in\n      an aggravated range, as great as twice the maximum presumptive sentence.\n      § 18-1.3-401(6). Likewise, under various circumstances, courts may be\n      limited to specified portions of the statutorily prescribed range for a given\n      class of felony.\n\nMartinez v. People, 69 P.3d 1029, 1031-32 (Colo. 2003). Mr. Allen’s case\n\ninvolves a departure from the applicable presumptive range based on the presence\n\nof extraordinary aggravating factors under § 18-1.3-401(6), which provides:\n\n      In imposing a sentence to incarceration, the court shall impose a definite\n      sentence which is within the presumptive ranges set forth in subsection (1)\n      of this section unless it concludes that extraordinary mitigating or\n      aggravating circumstances are present, are based on evidence in the record\n      of the sentencing hearing and the presentence report, and support a\n      different sentence which better serves the purposes of this code with\n      respect to sentencing, as set forth in section 18-1-102.5. If the court finds\n      such extraordinary mitigating or aggravating circumstances, it may impose\n      a sentence which is lesser or greater than the presumptive range; except\n      that in no case shall the term of sentence be greater than twice the\n      maximum nor less than one-half the minimum term authorized in the\n      presumptive range for the punishment of the offense.\n\nC OLO . R EV . S TAT . § 18-1.3-401(6) (emphasis added). In other words, a\n\nsentencing court is permitted to impose a sentence beyond the maximum\n\npresumptive range for a given felony offense only if it finds some additional fact\n\nwarranting an enhancement. Id. § 18-1.3-401(1)(b)(I)(6) & (7). A jury’s verdict\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\falone is insufficient to impose a sentence in the aggravated range. See id. In\n\nfact, the trial court must make specific findings on the record detailing the\n\nextraordinary circumstances that justify a variance from the presumptive range.\n\nId. § 18-1.3-401(7).\n\n      Mr. Allen’s vehicular eluding conviction constitutes a class 5 felony\n\noffense carrying a presumptive sentence range of one to three years incarceration\n\nin Colorado. C OLO . R EV . S TAT . §§ 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A) (enumerating penalty\n\nauthorized for conviction of class 5 felony); 18-9-116.5 (expressly providing that\n\nvehicular eluding is a class 5 felony); see also Allen, 78 P.3d at 754. At Mr.\n\nAllen’s sentencing, the state district court found the following facts which it\n\ndetermined where extraordinarily aggravating:\n\n      (1) defendant drove at high speeds the wrong way on major streets and a\n      freeway during rush hour; (2) defendant drove at high speeds on a flat tire\n      and later on the metal rim of a wheel; (3) defendant caused numerous other\n      vehicles to drive off the side of the road and placed many people, including\n      a school bus driver, in fear; (4) the chase was lengthy, both in time and\n      distance, proceeded through a residential area, and placed a large number of\n      people in jeopardy; and (5) defendant’s criminal record, which included\n      several serious juvenile and adult violations, demonstrated that defendant\n      was a significant danger to others.\n\nAllen, 78 P.3d at 755. On the basis of these findings, the court departed from the\n\nthree-year maximum presumptive range authorized by the jury’s verdict and\n\nsentenced Mr. Allen to a six-year term of imprisonment.\n\n      In his initial appeal, Mr. Allen argued that his receipt of a sentence twice\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthe length of that permitted by the jury’s verdict alone offended Apprendi. The\n\nColorado Court of Appeals disagreed, reasoning that “upon conviction by a jury,\n\nand without the proof of more,” Mr. Allen was “exposed to a maximum sentence\n\nof six years incarceration in the DOC, the maximum in the aggravated range.” Id.\n\n(emphasis added). In the court’s opinion, the extraordinary aggravating facts\n\nfound by the judge at Mr. Allen’s sentencing were not, “as was the case in\n\nApprendi, specified facts or considerations that, if found, mandate an increased\n\npenalty range or class of the offense.” Id. (citing Martinez, 32 P.3d at 520).\n\n      Thus, unlike Apprendi, which concerned the imposition of a sentence\n      beyond that provided for the offense by statute, based on a wholly separate\n      fact or element that was not charged and not submitted to the jury, here,\n      defendant received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original\n      charge. Apprendi does not require the invalidation of the sentencing\n      scheme adopted by the General Assembly, which creates a presumptive\n      sentence range and permits the trial court, in its discretion, to sentence in\n      aggravated or mitigated ranges based on unspecified extraordinary\n      aggravating or mitigating factors or circumstances particularized to the\n      defendant or the offense.\n\nId. Indeed, the appellate court’s determination that a defendant convicted of any\n\nfelony is exposed to a sentence up to the aggravated maximum compelled its\n\nconclusion that the Colorado sentencing statutes challenged by Mr. Allen were\n\nbeyond the reach of Apprendi.\n\n      Mr. Allen maintains that even the most cursory examination of Apprendi’s\n\nprogeny makes clear the error of the state court of appeals’ conclusion that\n\naggravated maximums equate to statutory maximums. Because Blakely teaches\n\n                                        -12-\n\fthat “the ‘statutory maximum’ for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a\n\njudge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected by the jury verdict or\n\nadmitted by the defendant,” Mr. Allen argues, the maximum sentence the trial\n\ncourt could have imposed solely on the basis of the facts reflected by the jury\n\nverdict in his case was the presumptive maximum of three years. See Blakely,\n\n124 S. Ct. at 2537.\n\n      In an en banc opinion decided on May 23, 2005, nearly one year after\n\nBlakely was decided, the Colorado Supreme Court essentially agreed with Mr.\n\nAllen’s argument, holding that the “statutory maximum” for Apprendi/Blakely\n\npurposes is the “presumptive range” established for the specific crime with which\n\nthe defendant was charged. Lopez v. People, 113 P.3d 713, 726 (2005). In so\n\nholding, the Colorado Supreme Court rejected the prosecution’s invitation “to\n\nconstrue Colorado’s general sentencing statute as comprising one simple range”\n\ncontaining both mitigating and aggravating factors. Id. Thus, facts comprising\n\naggravating factors not falling into one of the so-called Blakely-exempt or\n\nBlakely-compliant exceptions must be found by a jury before they may be used to\n\nincrease a defendant’s sentence.\n\n      But the current state of the law is irrelevant to the inquiry before us.\n\nBecause the question we must answer is whether the decision in Allen “was\n\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), we\n\nare exclusively concerned with the state of the case law at the time Mr. Allen’s\n\nconviction became final.\n\n      As explained earlier, a conviction becomes final when the availability of a\n\ndirect appeal has been exhausted, and the time for filing a certiorari petition with\n\nthe Supreme Court has elapsed or the Court has denied a timely certiorari petition.\n\nSee Caspari, 510 U.S. at 390. Mr. Allen had 90 days from April 15, 2002 – the\n\nday the Colorado Supreme Court denied review – to petition the Supreme Court\n\nfor a writ of certiorari. That time elapsed and Mr. Allen’s conviction became\n\nfinal within the meaning of AEDPA on July 15, 2002. Consequently, Mr. Allen’s\n\nconviction was final long before the Court issued Blakely on June 24, 2004.\n\nFurthermore, we have expressly held that Blakely did not announce a watershed\n\nrule of criminal procedure which would apply retroactively to petitioners on\n\ncollateral review who raised Apprendi on direct appeal. See United States v.\n\nPrice, 400 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir. 2005) (“we hold that Blakely does not apply\n\nretroactively to convictions that were already final at the time the Court decided\n\nBlakely”). Therefore, all that is left to decide is whether the state court’s decision\n\nin Allen is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, Apprendi.\n\n      As noted previously, the Colorado Court of Appeals held in Allen that\n\nunder the state’s sentencing statutes, a defendant is exposed by the jury’s verdict\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fto a sentence up to the aggravated maximum because the trial court has the\n\ndiscretion to find that one or more facts about the offense or the offender are\n\nextraordinarily aggravating and impose an enhanced sentence. Allen, 78 P.3d at\n\n755. According to the court, because the aggravated maximum was the statutory\n\nmaximum for Sixth Amendment purposes under the Colorado scheme, Mr. Allen\n\nsimply received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original vehicular\n\neluding charge. Id. As a result, the court concluded that Apprendi did not affect\n\nthe operation of the statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced. Id.\n\n      It was not until the decision in Blakely that the Supreme Court clarified the\n\nmeaning of statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes. Blakely, 124 S. Ct. at\n\n2537. Prior to the issuance of Blakely, the federal circuits unanimously believed\n\nthat the “statutory maximum” was the greatest sentence permitted by the statute of\n\nconviction, irrespective of what fact-finding the court conducted to impose that\n\nsentence:\n\n      Based upon Apprendi’s language addressing situations where a sentencing\n      court “increase[d] the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum,” .\n      . . this court subsequently applied Apprendi only where a sentencing court\n      had imposed a sentence above the statutory maximum permitted by the\n      statute of conviction, regardless of what fact finding the court, rather than\n      the jury, conducted to impose a sentence within that statutory maximum.\n\nPrice, 400 F.3d at 847 (citing cases); see also Simpson v. United States, 376 F.3d\n\n679, 681 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “before Blakely was decided, every federal\n\ncourt of appeals had held that Apprendi did not apply to guideline calculations\n\n                                         -15-\n\fmade within the statutory maximum,” citing cases). Indeed, “at the time [Mr.\n\nAllen’s] convictions became final, after Apprendi but before Blakely, a court\n\nwould not have felt compelled to conclude Blakely’s rule was constitutionally\n\nrequired.” Price, 400 F.3d at 848. In lockstep with federal courts, the Colorado\n\nCourt of Appeals ruled that Apprendi’s statutory maximum permitted sentencing\n\ncourts to make findings so long as the sentence ultimately imposed was within the\n\nmaximum range of the statute of conviction. Allen, 78 P.3d at 754-55. We,\n\ntherefore, cannot conclude that at the time the state court evaluated Mr. Allen’s\n\nsentencing argument, its interpretation of Apprendi was unreasonable.\n\n      In sum, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Mr. Allen’s habeas\n\npetition, albeit on grounds different from those relied on by that court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f",

New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).

Concluding that <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply retroactively to litigants on collateral review, the district court dismissed the petition and denied Mr. Allen's request for a certificate of appealability. We granted his motion for a certificate of appealability, permitting him to proceed on appeal on the following two claims: (1) whether the district court correctly ruled that <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply retroactively to Mr. Allen's sentence, and (2) whether <i>Apprendi</i> renders unconstitutional the Colorado statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced.

No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(d)(1) (indicating state prisoner has one year from the date his conviction becomes \"final\" to seek federal habeas relief). Precedent makes clear that resolving whether a convicted defendant may find refuge in a rule of criminal procedure newly announced by the Supreme Court depends in large part on timing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> If the conviction is not yet final when the Court announces the rule, lower courts must apply that rule to the defendant's case. <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 322, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). If, however, the conviction is already final, a defendant ordinarily may not avail himself of the newly announced rule. <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, our retroactivity analysis hinges entirely on the meaning of the word \"final.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has expressly articulated that \"[a] state conviction and sentence become final for purposes of [the <i>Teague</i> analysis] when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally denied.\" <i>Caspari v. Bohlen,</i> 510 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994); <i>see also Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. at 321 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 708. (a final conviction means \"a case in which a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied\"). Mr. Allen was convicted by a jury on September 4, 1998. He timely filed his notice of direct appeal on or about November 18, 1998, and his case remained pending in state court until the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari review on April 15, 2002. <i>Apprendi</i> was decided on June 26, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the state concedes in its answer brief, <i>see</i> Aple. Br. at 9, this chronology discloses Mr. Allen's conviction was not yet \"final\" for purposes of AEDPA when <i>Apprendi</i> was decided. Indeed, Mr. Allen raised <i>Apprendi</i> both before the Colorado Court of Appeals on initial appeal and in the state supreme court via his certiorari petition. Because the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> was newly announced prior to the date on which Mr. Allen's conviction became final, the rule applies to his case notwithstanding his invocation of it in a collateral attack. Accordingly, the district court's determination that <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply retroactively to Mr. Allen's vehicular eluding sentence was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closer question is whether <i>Apprendi</i> renders unconstitutional the Colorado statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced. Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, such as Mr. Allen's <i>Apprendi</i> claim, unless the state court decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2254(d)(2). <i>See Turrentine v. Mullin,</i> 390 F.3d 1181, 1188 (10th Cir.2004). Moreover, state court fact findings are presumed correct unless the petitioner rebuts them by clear and convincing evidence. <i>See</i> &#167; 2254(e)(1); <i>Hale v. Gibson,</i> 227 F.3d 1298, 1309 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions \"contrary to\" or representing an \"unreasonable application of\" federal law are independent bases for habeas relief. <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (O'Connor, J., concurring). A state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under &#167; 2254(d)(1) if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <i>See id.</i> at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495. A state court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law under &#167; 2254(d)(2) if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court's decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case. <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. \"The reasonableness of the state court's application of federal law is to be evaluated by an objective standard. The Supreme Court has cautioned that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect or erroneous application of federal law.\" <i>Mitchell v. Gibson,</i> 262 F.3d 1036, 1045 (10th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). With these standards in mind, we turn to Mr. Allen's legal argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Allen contends the trial court's decision to increase his vehicular eluding sentence based on facts not found by the jury violated his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. In <i>Apprendi,</i> the Supreme Court invalidated a New Jersey sentencing statute that permitted judges to assign an enhanced sentence, greater than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum, based on a post-conviction judicial finding that the defendant's offense qualified as a \"hate crime.\" 530 U.S. at 468-69, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In order for a defendant's sentence to comport with the Sixth Amendment, \"<i>any fact</i> [other than the fact of a prior conviction] that increases the penalty for a crime <i>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum</i> must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (emphasis added). The Court explained that the label which the legislature applies to the fact (such as \"sentencing factor\" or \"element\") is irrelevant because the inquiry properly focuses on effect rather than form. <i>Id.</i> at 494, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Simply stated, <i>Apprendi</i> forbids courts from imposing a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum allowed for the defendant's crime of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four years later, the Court applied the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> to the State of Washington's determinate sentencing regime. <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <i>Blakely</i> involved a defendant who pled guilty to second-degree kidnapping, a state offense that carried a statutory maximum of ten years imprisonment. Based solely on the facts admitted by Mr. Blakely, Washington's Sentencing Reform Act authorized a \"standard\" sentencing range of forty-nine to fifty-three months imprisonment. <i>Id.</i> at 2534-35. Pursuant to the act, however, a court could exceed a fifty-three month sentence for a second-degree kidnapping conviction if it found a \"substantial and compelling reason.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting WASH. REV. CODE ANN. &#167; 9.94A.310(3)(b)). Because the state court found that Mr. Blakely had committed his crime with \"deliberate cruelty,\" it sentenced him to ninety months, a term more than three years greater than the top end of the standard range. <i>Id.</i> A majority of the Supreme Court held this practice unconstitutional and in doing so instructed</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the \"statutory maximum\" for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</i> In other words, the relevant \"statutory maximum\" is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <i>without</i> any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \"which the law makes essential to the punishment,\" and the judge exceeds his proper authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 2537 (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original). In the term following <i>Blakely,</i> the Court extended <i>Apprendi</i> to the federal sentencing guidelines. <i>See United States v.

In the court's opinion, the extraordinary aggravating facts found by the judge at Mr. Allen's sentencing were not, \"as was the case in <i>Apprendi,</i> specified facts or considerations that, if found, mandate an increased penalty range or class of the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Martinez,</i> 32 P.3d at 520).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, unlike <i>Apprendi,</i> which concerned the imposition of a sentence beyond that provided for the offense by statute, based on a wholly separate fact or element that was not charged and not submitted to the jury, here, defendant received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original charge. <i>Apprendi</i> does not require the invalidation of the sentencing scheme adopted by the General Assembly, which creates a presumptive sentence range and permits the trial court, in its discretion, to sentence in aggravated or mitigated ranges based on unspecified extraordinary aggravating or mitigating factors or circumstances particularized to the defendant or the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Indeed, the appellate court's determination that a defendant convicted of any felony is exposed to a sentence up to the aggravated maximum compelled its conclusion that the Colorado sentencing statutes challenged by Mr. Allen were beyond the reach of <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Allen maintains that even the most cursory examination of <i>Apprendi's</i> progeny makes clear the error of the state court of appeals' conclusion that aggravated maximums equate to statutory maximums. Because <i>Blakely</i> teaches that \"the `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected by the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,</i>\" Mr. Allen argues, the maximum sentence the trial court could have imposed solely on the basis of the facts reflected by the jury verdict in his case was the presumptive maximum of three years. <i>See Blakely,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an <i>en banc</i> opinion decided on May 23, 2005, nearly one year after <i>Blakely</i> was decided, the Colorado Supreme Court essentially agreed with Mr. Allen's argument, holding that the \"statutory maximum\" for <i>Apprendi/Blakely</i> purposes is the \"presumptive range\" established for the specific crime with which the defendant was charged. <i>Lopez v. People,</i> 113 P.3d 713, 726 (2005). In so holding, the Colorado Supreme Court rejected the prosecution's invitation \"to construe Colorado's general sentencing statute as comprising one simple range\" containing both mitigating and aggravating factors. <i>Id.</i> Thus, facts comprising aggravating factors not falling into one of the so-called <i>Blakely</i>-exempt or <i>Blakely</i>-compliant exceptions must be found by a jury before they may be used to increase a defendant's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the current state of the law is irrelevant to the inquiry before us. Because the question we must answer is whether the decision in <i>Allen</i> \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), we are exclusively concerned with the state of the case law at the time Mr. Allen's conviction became final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained earlier, a conviction becomes final when the availability of a direct appeal has been exhausted, and the time for filing a certiorari petition with the Supreme Court has elapsed or the Court has denied a timely certiorari petition. <i>See Caspari,</i> 510 U.S. at 390, 114 S.Ct. 948. Mr. Allen had 90 days from April 15, 2002 &#8212; the day the Colorado Supreme Court denied review &#8212; to petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. That time elapsed and Mr. Allen's conviction became final within the meaning of AEDPA on July 15, 2002. Consequently, Mr. Allen's conviction was final long before the Court issued <i>Blakely</i> on June 24, 2004. Furthermore, we have expressly held that <i>Blakely</i> did not announce a watershed rule of criminal procedure which would apply retroactively to petitioners on collateral review who raised <i>Apprendi</i> on direct appeal. <i>See United States v. Price,</i> 400 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir.2005) (\"we hold that <i>Blakely</i> does not apply retroactively to convictions that were already final at the time the Court decided <i>Blakely</i>\"). Therefore, all that is left to decide is whether the state court's decision in <i>Allen</i> is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted previously, the Colorado Court of Appeals held in <i>Allen</i> that under the state's sentencing statutes, a defendant is exposed by the jury's verdict to a sentence up to the aggravated maximum because the trial court has the discretion to find that one or more facts about the offense or the offender are extraordinarily aggravating and impose an enhanced sentence. <i>Allen,</i> 78 P.3d at 755. According to the court, because the aggravated maximum was the statutory maximum for Sixth Amendment purposes under the Colorado scheme, Mr. Allen simply received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original vehicular eluding charge. <i>Id.</i> As a result, the court concluded that <i>Apprendi</i> did not affect the operation of the statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not until the decision in <i>Blakely</i> that the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of statutory maximum for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes. <i>Blakely,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2537. Prior to the issuance of <i>Blakely,</i> the federal circuits unanimously believed that the \"statutory maximum\" was the greatest sentence permitted by <i>the statute of conviction,</i> irrespective of what fact-finding the court conducted to impose that sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon <i>Apprendi's</i> language addressing situations where a sentencing court \"increase[d] the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum,\" ... this court subsequently applied <i>Apprendi</i> only where a sentencing court had imposed a sentence above the statutory maximum permitted by the statute of conviction, regardless of what fact finding the court, rather than the jury, conducted to impose a sentence within that statutory maximum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Price,</i> 400 F.3d at 847 (citing cases); <i>see also Simpson v. United States,</i> 376 F.3d 679, 681 (7th Cir.2004) (stating that \"before <i>Blakely</i> was decided, every federal court of appeals had held that <i>Apprendi</i> did not apply to guideline calculations made within the statutory maximum,\" citing cases). Indeed, \"at the time [Mr. Allen's] convictions became final, after <i>Apprendi</i> but before <i>Blakely,</i> a court would not have felt compelled to conclude <i>Blakely's</i> rule was constitutionally required.\" <i>Price,</i> 400 F.3d at 848. In lockstep with federal courts, the Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that <i>Apprendi's</i> statutory maximum permitted sentencing courts to make findings so long as the sentence ultimately imposed was within the maximum range of the statute of conviction. <i>Allen,</i> 78 P.3d at 754-55. We, therefore, cannot conclude that at the time the state court evaluated Mr. Allen's sentencing argument, its interpretation of <i>Apprendi</i> was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Mr. Allen's habeas petition, albeit on grounds different from those relied on by that court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>People v.

(a final conviction means \"a case in which a judgment of conviction has been rendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a petition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally denied\"). Mr. Allen was convicted by a jury on September 4, 1998. He timely filed his notice of direct appeal on or about November 18, 1998, and his case remained pending in state court until the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari review on April 15, 2002. <i>Apprendi</i> was decided on June 26, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the state concedes in its answer brief, <i>see</i> Aple.

Indeed, Mr. Allen raised <i>Apprendi</i> both before the Colorado Court of Appeals on initial appeal and in the state supreme court via his certiorari petition. Because the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> was newly announced prior to the date on which Mr. Allen's conviction became final, the rule applies to his case notwithstanding his invocation of it in a collateral attack. Accordingly, the district court's determination that <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply retroactively to Mr. Allen's vehicular eluding sentence was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closer question is whether <i>Apprendi</i> renders unconstitutional the Colorado statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced. Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, such as Mr. Allen's <i>Apprendi</i> claim, unless the state court decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1), or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2254(d)(2). <i>See Turrentine v.

In the court's opinion, the extraordinary aggravating facts found by the judge at Mr. Allen's sentencing were not, \"as was the case in <i>Apprendi,</i> specified facts or considerations that, if found, mandate an increased penalty range or class of the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Martinez,</i> 32 P.3d at 520).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, unlike <i>Apprendi,</i> which concerned the imposition of a sentence beyond that provided for the offense by statute, based on a wholly separate fact or element that was not charged and not submitted to the jury, here, defendant received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original charge. <i>Apprendi</i> does not require the invalidation of the sentencing scheme adopted by the General Assembly, which creates a presumptive sentence range and permits the trial court, in its discretion, to sentence in aggravated or mitigated ranges based on unspecified extraordinary aggravating or mitigating factors or circumstances particularized to the defendant or the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Indeed, the appellate court's determination that a defendant convicted of any felony is exposed to a sentence up to the aggravated maximum compelled its conclusion that the Colorado sentencing statutes challenged by Mr. Allen were beyond the reach of <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Allen maintains that even the most cursory examination of <i>Apprendi's</i> progeny makes clear the error of the state court of appeals' conclusion that aggravated maximums equate to statutory maximums. Because <i>Blakely</i> teaches that \"the `statutory maximum' for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <i>solely on the basis of the facts reflected by the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,</i>\" Mr. Allen argues, the maximum sentence the trial court could have imposed solely on the basis of the facts reflected by the jury verdict in his case was the presumptive maximum of three years. <i>See Blakely,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an <i>en banc</i> opinion decided on May 23, 2005, nearly one year after <i>Blakely</i> was decided, the Colorado Supreme Court essentially agreed with Mr. Allen's argument, holding that the \"statutory maximum\" for <i>Apprendi/Blakely</i> purposes is the \"presumptive range\" established for the specific crime with which the defendant was charged. <i>Lopez v.

Consequently, Mr. Allen's conviction was final long before the Court issued <i>Blakely</i> on June 24, 2004.

According to the court, because the aggravated maximum was the statutory maximum for Sixth Amendment purposes under the Colorado scheme, Mr. Allen simply received a sentence to which he was exposed by the original vehicular eluding charge. <i>Id.</i> As a result, the court concluded that <i>Apprendi</i> did not affect the operation of the statutes under which Mr. Allen was sentenced. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not until the decision in <i>Blakely</i> that the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of statutory maximum for <i>Apprendi</i> purposes. <i>Blakely,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2537.
