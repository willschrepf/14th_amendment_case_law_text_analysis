class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 1.<span>            \r\n</span><b>SKOGLUND, J.   </b>This case concerns public access to\r\nrecords that newspaper plaintiff Rutland Herald believes are of intense public\r\ninterest: material related to a criminal investigation of possession of child\r\npornography by employees of the Criminal Justice Training Council at the\r\nVermont Police Academy.  The Herald appeals from a trial court decision\r\ngranting summary judgment to defendants, the Vermont State Police (VSP) and the\r\nOffice of the Attorney General (collectively “the State”), and denying\r\ndisclosure of the records under the Access to Public Records Act (PRA), 1\r\nV.S.A. §§ 315-320.  The court concluded that the records sought by the\r\nHerald, which included inquest records, were exempt from disclosure as “records\r\ndealing with the detection and investigation of crime” under § 317(c)(5). \r\nIt added that the inquest materials were also exempt under § 317(c)(1) as\r\n“records which by law are designated confidential.”  We affirm the court’s\r\ndecision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 2.<span>            \r\n</span>The material facts are undisputed.  In January 2010, the VSP opened\r\nan investigation into possible criminal conduct involving employees of the\r\nTraining Council.  The VSP had been alerted to the possibility of criminal\r\nconduct by the Vermont Department of Human Resources (VDHR), which was\r\nconducting an employment-related investigation into the matter following the\r\ndiscovery of suspicious material on the work computer of employee David\r\nMcMullen.  Inappropriate emails were also apparently discovered on other\r\nemployees’ work computers.  The employees’ work computers were secured,\r\nand the VSP also seized computer equipment from McMullen’s home.  The\r\nfollowing day, McMullen committed suicide.  As a result, the VSP conducted\r\nan investigation into his death.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 3.<span>            \r\n</span>The VSP compiled several files during the course of its investigations,\r\nwhich included inquest-related material.  When its investigations were\r\ncomplete, the VSP submitted its files to the Office of the Attorney General for\r\nprosecutorial review.  The Attorney General declined to commence a\r\nprosecution, finding no criminal conduct by anyone other than McMullen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 4.<span>            \r\n</span>In July 2010, the Herald made a public records request to the VSP and to\r\nthe Attorney General, seeking disclosure of materials related to the\r\ninvestigations of McMullen and other unnamed employees.  The parties\r\nstipulated that the Herald sought access to both the criminal and death\r\ninvestigation files.  The VSP denied the request, asserting that its files\r\nwere exempt from disclosure under § 317(c)(5).  The Attorney General\r\ndenied the request on similar grounds, adding that the inquest materials were\r\nalso exempt under § 317(c)(1) as records designated confidential by law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 5.<span>            \r\n</span>The Herald filed suit in August 2010 and immediately requested summary\r\njudgment in its favor.  The State opposed the Herald’s request and filed a\r\ncross-motion for summary judgment.  At the court’s request, the State\r\nproduced the withheld material for in camera review.  Following oral\r\nargument and in camera review, the court granted summary judgment to the State. \r\nIt concluded, with two minor exceptions,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[1]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nthat the records at issue related to the investigation of possible criminal\r\nactivity and included “no material related to policy, employment practices, or\r\nother activities not directly related to a specific investigation.”  The\r\ncourt noted that § 317(c)(1) offered an additional ground for shielding\r\nthe inquest materials from public view.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 6.<span>            \r\n</span>In reaching its conclusion, the court rejected the Herald’s argument that\r\nbecause any investigation of McMullen ended with his suicide, there was no\r\nbasis for a continuing exemption to disclosure.  The court similarly\r\nrejected the Herald’s contention that the phrase “compiled in the course of a\r\ncriminal . . . investigation” in § 317(c)(5) meant that any exception to\r\ndisclosure was limited to the duration of the investigation.  The court\r\nconcluded that the statutory language contained no time limit and that it\r\ninstead contemplated an “open-ended period of confidentiality.”  The\r\nHerald now appeals from the court’s decision.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 7.<span>            \r\n</span>We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard\r\nas the trial court.  <u>Shlansky v. City of Burlington</u>, 2010 VT 90, ¶\r\n6, 188 Vt. 470, 13 A.3d 1075.  Summary judgment is appropriate if there\r\nare no issues of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter\r\nof law.  <u>Id</u>.; V.R.C.P. 56(c)(3).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 8.<span>            \r\n</span>As we have repeatedly recognized, the PRA represents “a strong policy\r\nfavoring access to public documents and records.”  <u>Wesco, Inc. v.\r\nSorrell</u>, 2004 VT 102, ¶ 10, 177 Vt. 287, 865 A.2d 350.  The PRA’s\r\nstatement of policy specifically provides that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">  It is the\r\npolicy of this subchapter to provide for free and open examination of records\r\nconsistent with Chapter I, Article 6 of the Vermont Constitution.\r\n Officers of government are trustees and servants of the people and it is\r\nin the public interest to enable any person to review and criticize their\r\ndecisions even though such examination may cause inconvenience or\r\nembarrassment.  All people, however, have a right to privacy in their\r\npersonal and economic pursuits, which ought to be protected unless specific\r\ninformation is needed to review the action of a governmental officer.\r\n Consistent with these principles, the general assembly hereby declares\r\nthat certain public records shall be made available to any person as\r\nhereinafter provided.  To that end, the provisions of this subchapter\r\nshall be liberally construed with the view towards carrying out the above\r\ndeclaration of public policy.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">1 V.S.A. § 315.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 9.<span>            \r\n</span>The public interest in knowing what the government is doing “is\r\nparticularly acute in the area of law enforcement.”  <u>Caledonian Record\r\nPubl’g Co. v. Walton</u>, 154 Vt. 15, 21, 573 A.2d 296, 299 (1990).  Of\r\ncourse, the State also has “significant interests in protecting the public from\r\ncriminal activity, prosecuting those who commit crimes, and protecting the\r\nprivacy rights of individual citizens,” and “[t]hese interests may, at times,\r\noverride the interest in public disclosure.”  <u>Id</u>. at 21, 573 A.2d\r\nat 300.  We construe exemptions in the PRA “strictly against the\r\ncustodians of records,” and resolve any doubts “in favor of disclosure.”  <u>Wesco</u>,\r\n2004 VT 102, ¶ 10.  The burden of demonstrating that a record is\r\ncovered by an exemption “is on the agency seeking to avoid disclosure.”  <u>Id</u>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 10.<span>        \r\n</span>Section 317(c)(5) specifically exempts the following material from\r\ndisclosure:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\"> \r\n[R]ecords dealing with the detection and investigation of crime, including\r\nthose maintained on any individual or compiled in the course of a criminal or\r\ndisciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency;\r\nprovided, however, records relating to management and direction of a law\r\nenforcement agency and records reflecting the initial arrest of a person and\r\nthe charge shall be public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">As stated above, the trial court\r\ninspected the records here and concluded that they were “records dealing with\r\nthe detection and investigation of crime.”  The Herald has not challenged\r\nthis threshold determination, and we accept the trial court’s characterization\r\nof these records.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[2]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 11.<span>        \r\n</span>We thus turn to the Herald’s statutory arguments.  The Herald\r\nasserts that disclosure is appropriate because the investigation is complete,\r\nand the public interest favors disclosure.  Citing <u>Walton</u>, 154 Vt.\r\nat 19, 573 A.2d at 299, the Herald contends that this Court has narrowly construed\r\n§ 317(c)(5) in the past and found that the statute contains a “time-based”\r\nelement.  To achieve a narrow construction in this case, the Herald urges\r\nus to apply a balancing test as in <u>Trombley v. Bellows Falls Union High\r\nSchool District No. 27</u>, and weigh “the right of persons ‘to privacy in\r\ntheir personal . . . pursuits’ against the need for ‘specific information . . .\r\nto review the action of a governmental officer.’ ”  160 Vt. 101, 109-10,\r\n624 A.2d 857, 863 (1993) (citing 1 V.S.A. § 315).  The Herald\r\nmaintains that there are no privacy interests at stake because the target of\r\nthe investigation has been identified and is dead, and the remaining employees\r\nhave no expectation of privacy in an investigative report of their on-the-job\r\nbehavior.  It argues that the completion of the investigation heightens\r\nthe public interest in the matter.  The Herald cites cases from other\r\njurisdictions that allow the release of similar material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 12.<span>        \r\n</span>In construing § 317(c)(5), our primary goal is “to discern and give\r\neffect to the intent of the Legislature.”  <u>State v. O’Neill</u>, 165\r\nVt. 270, 275, 682 A.2d 943, 946 (1996).  We look first to the plain\r\nmeaning of statutory language, and if the plain meaning resolves the\r\ninterpretation issue, we generally look no further.  <u>Sawyer v.\r\nSpaulding</u>, 2008 VT 63, ¶ 7, 184 Vt. 545, 955 A.2d 532 (mem.).  As\r\ndiscussed below, we find no support for the imposition of either a time-based\r\nlimitation or a balancing test in the plain language of § 317(c)(5).  The\r\nlanguage instead reflects the Legislature’s intent to permanently and\r\ncategorically exempt all criminal investigatory records from public\r\ndisclosure.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 13.<span>        \r\n</span>As set forth above, the statute exempts “records dealing with the\r\ndetection and investigation of crime, including those <u>maintained</u> on any\r\nindividual or <u>compiled</u> in the course of a criminal or disciplinary\r\ninvestigation.”  1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5) (emphases added). \r\nInvestigation records are “maintained” or kept on individuals on an ongoing\r\nbasis, after active “detection and investigation” is complete.  Using the\r\npast tense of “compile” indicates intent to exempt records both during and\r\nafter the compilation process.  The words “maintained” and “compiled”\r\nsuggest that the Legislature anticipated keeping investigatory records exempt\r\nafter an active investigation had ended.  Like the trial court, we are not\r\npersuaded by the Herald’s argument that the use of the word “compiled” suggests\r\nthat the exception ends when the compilation process ends.  The term\r\n“compiled” describes the type of record involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 14.<span>        \r\n</span>We note, moreover, that had the Legislature intended the exemption to\r\nexist only during an ongoing investigation, it could have been much more\r\nspecific.  For example, 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(13) exempts “information pertaining\r\nto the location of real or personal property for public agency purposes <u>prior\r\nto public announcement of the project</u> and information pertaining to\r\nappraisals or purchase price of real or personal property for public purposes <u>prior\r\nto the formal award of contracts thereof</u>.”  (Emphases added.) \r\nThe PRA also contains other exemptions with specific temporal\r\nlimitations.  See, e.g., <u>id</u>. § 317(c)(14) (exempting “records\r\nwhich are relevant to litigation to which the public agency is a party of\r\nrecord, provided all such matters shall be available to the public after ruled\r\ndiscoverable by the court before which the litigation is pending, but in any\r\nevent <u>upon final termination of the litigation</u>” (emphasis added)); <u>id</u>.\r\n§ 317(c)(23) (exempting records related to research and activities\r\nconducted at state academic institutions “<u>until</u> such data, records or\r\ninformation are <u>published</u>, <u>disclosed</u> in an issued patent <u>or\r\npublicly released</u> by the institution or its authorized agents” (emphases\r\nadded)).  That the Legislature included temporal limitations in numerous\r\nother PRA exemptions makes it unlikely that it intended to include a temporal\r\nlimitation in § 317(c)(5) without specific language to this effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 15.<span>        \r\n</span>The Herald asserts that the strong policy in favor of public oversight\r\nof law enforcement actions must lead to a different result.  It argues\r\nthat the Legislature could not have intended that records relating to the\r\ninvestigation and detection of crime be confidential forever.  Policy\r\narguments such as these “are for the Legislature and not this Court, and we\r\nmust implement the statute as it is written.”  <u>In re Butson</u>, 2006\r\nVT 10, ¶ 7, 179 Vt. 599, 892 A.2d 255 (mem.).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 16.<span>        \r\n</span>The Herald also cites <u>Walton</u>, 154 Vt. 15, 573 A.2d 296, and <u>Trombley</u>,\r\n160 Vt. 101, 624 A.2d 857, in support of its arguments.  We do not find\r\nsufficient support for the Herald’s position in these decisions.  In <u>Walton</u>,\r\nwe considered whether the Department of Public Safety and the Town of St.\r\nJohnsbury were required to disclose the names of individuals who had been\r\nissued citations.  The defendants argued that the citations were exempt\r\nfrom disclosure under 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5) as “records dealing with the\r\ndetection and investigation of crime.”  We rejected this argument, categorizing\r\nsuch records as the “product” of an investigation, rather than a record of such\r\ninvestigation.  <u>Walton</u>, 154 Vt. at 28, 573 A.2d at 303.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 17.<span>        \r\n</span>The Herald asserts that our decision reflects the presence of a\r\ntime-based element in § 317(c)(5) because the decision was based, in part, on\r\nthe timing associated with an arrest, which occurs after the investigation of a\r\ncrime.  It reasons that the records here similarly should fall outside the\r\nterms of the exemption because the “detection and investigation of [the] crime”\r\nis complete.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 18.<span>        \r\n</span>We reject these arguments.  In <u>Walton</u>, we looked to the\r\nnature of a citation record in considering the threshold question of whether\r\nthe records at issue dealt with the investigation or detection of crime; that\r\npoint is uncontested here.  Obviously, the records here could not be\r\nclassified as the “product” of an investigation, as in <u>Walton</u>, without\r\ncompletely ignoring the relevant statutory language and obviating the purpose\r\nof the exemption.  We presume that the Legislature did not intend such an\r\nabsurd result.  <u>TD Banknorth, N.A. v. Dep’t of Taxes</u>, 2008 VT 120,\r\n¶ 32, 185 Vt. 45, 967 A.2d 1148 (presumption against statutory construction\r\nthat leads to absurd results).  Neither the reasoning of <u>Walton</u>,\r\nnor its result determines whether § 317(c)(5) contains an unstated\r\ntemporal limitation for purposes of disclosing investigation records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 19.<span>        \r\n</span>The Herald also cites numerous opinions from other jurisdictions as\r\nsupporting its argument for a temporal limitation on investigative\r\nmaterial.  In fact, decisions from other jurisdictions support the\r\ninterpretation we have adopted.  The difficulty in using such decisions is\r\nthat, although states have adopted equivalents to the PRA, the language of the\r\nstatutes varies widely.  Thus, many of the cases cited by the Herald\r\ninvolve statutory provisions with qualifying language not present in §\r\n317(c)(5).  See, e.g., <u>Christy v. Palm Beach Cnty. Sheriff’s Office</u>,\r\n698 So. 2d 1365, 1366-67 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) (considering “exemptions\r\nfrom disclosure . . . for <u>active</u> criminal\r\nintelligence information and <u>active</u> criminal investigative information,”\r\nand concluding “[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest that the\r\ninformation contained in the file is active” (quotations omitted and emphases\r\nadded)); <u>Rafuse v. Stryker</u>, 813 N.E.2d 558, 560 n.3 (Mass.

Superior Court</u>, the Supreme Court of\r\nCalifornia considered a newspaper’s request for access to a sheriff’s records\r\nof disciplinary proceedings against two deputies.  852 P.2d 377 (Cal.\r\n1993).  The court was required to interpret a subdivision of the\r\nCalifornia Public Records Act that exempted from disclosure “investigatory or\r\nsecurity files compiled by . . . [a] state or local police agency” and\r\n“investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency\r\nfor correctional, law enforcement, or licensing purposes.”  <u>Id</u>. at\r\n384 (citation omitted).  Considering the statute’s language, the court\r\nfound it “noteworthy that nothing therein purports to place a time limit on the\r\nexemption for investigatory files.”  <u>Id</u>. at 390.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 21.<span>        \r\n</span>The court ultimately held that, according to its terms, “the exemption\r\nfor investigatory files does not terminate with the conclusion of the\r\ninvestigation.  Once an investigation . . . has come into being . . .\r\nmaterials that relate to the investigation and, thus, properly belong in the\r\nfile, remain exempt subject to the terms of the statute.”  <u>Id</u>. at\r\n393.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[4]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nCourts from other jurisdictions have reached similar conclusions.  See,\r\ne.g., <u>State ex rel.

Vt. State Colls.</u>, 2003 VT 78, ¶ 9, 175 Vt. 438, 833 A.2d\r\n1273 (reaching similar conclusion as to exemption for “student records,”\r\nexplaining that while term was undefined, the language of the exception was\r\nbroad and unqualified, and nothing in the PRA suggested any “content-based restrictions\r\nlimiting the exception, for example, to student academic performance, financial\r\naid, or other strictly scholastic subjects, or excluding records relating to\r\nviolations of the student ethics code or the criminal law”).  It is not\r\nappropriate under these circumstances to read a balancing test into the\r\nstatute.  See <u>O’Neill</u>, 165 Vt. at 275, 682 A.2d at 946 (“It is\r\ninappropriate to read into a statute something which is not there unless it is <u>necessary</u>\r\nin order to make the statute effective.”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 25.<span>        \r\n</span>Because § 317(c)(5) provides a record-based, rather than content-based,\r\nlimitation, we also reject the Herald’s argument that the court could release\r\ninvestigatory records but require redaction of information.  The Herald\r\ncites two cases where we directed the trial court to consider releasing\r\nredacted versions of records.  Both involved the “personal documents”\r\nexemption at issue in <u>Trombley</u>.  See <u>Kade</u>, 2006 VT 44, ¶ 14;\r\n<u>Norman v.

(quotation omitted).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 34.<span>        \r\n</span>Although it would have been preferable that the Herald raise its\r\nconstitutional arguments more pointedly below, we do find it appropriate to\r\naddress these arguments.  The Herald explicitly devoted multiple\r\nparagraphs, both in its initial complaint, and in its motion for summary\r\njudgment, to the Vermont and Federal Constitutions.  These arguments made\r\nsufficiently clear that the Herald believed that the PRA must be interpreted in\r\nlight of the constitutional issues implicated.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 35.<span>        \r\n</span>We understand the Herald’s constitutional argument to be part of the\r\nHerald’s more general argument that the PRA should not be interpreted to\r\nprevent public access here.  In this light, the constitutional issues are\r\nnot easily segregated from the question of statutory interpretation, which we\r\nconsidered above.  Although the Herald has drawn more attention to the\r\nconstitutional issues on appeal, it is not surprising that an argument\r\npresented as a matter of constitutional avoidance in a trial court should take\r\non the complexion of a contingent argument for unconstitutionality at the\r\nappellate level.  In light of all these considerations and the fact that\r\nthe constitutional issues were briefed by both sides, we find it appropriate to\r\naddress them here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 36.<span>        \r\n</span>We reject the Herald’s argument that the Vermont Constitution itself\r\nmandates disclosure in this case.  The Herald relies primarily on Chapter\r\nI, Article 6, of the Vermont Constitution, which states, “[t]hat all power\r\nbeing originally inherent in and consequently derived from the people,\r\ntherefore, all officers of government, whether legislative or executive, are\r\ntheir trustees and servants; and at all times, in a legal way, accountable to\r\nthem.”  This Article represents a core statement of founding\r\nprinciples.  The provision was originally present in the Vermont\r\nConstitution of 1777, ch. I, art. 5, having there been lifted nearly verbatim\r\nfrom the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.  Pa. Const. of 1776, Declaration\r\nof Rights, cl. IV.  The framers of the Pennsylvania Constitution drew\r\ntheir inspiration, in turn, from the Virginia Constitution of 1776, drafted by\r\nGeorge Mason, which provided “[t]hat all power is vested in, and consequently\r\nderived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and\r\nat all times amenable to them.”  Va. Const. of 1776, Bill of Rights, §\r\n2.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 37.<span>        \r\n</span>Precisely because of its broad significance as a statement of principle,\r\nArticle 6 is not the source for mandating disclosure in this case. \r\nArticle 6 does not provide the specificity necessary to create legal\r\nentitlements with definite character.  See <u>Benning v. State</u>, 161\r\nVt. 472, 477, 641 A.2d 757, 759 (1994) (“The specific words on which\r\nplaintiffs rely lack the specificity that would show the presence of concrete\r\nrights applicable to these circumstances.”); <u>State v.

Bd. of Pub. Works</u>, 276 A.2d\r\n56, 61 (Md. 1971) (stating that the Maryland constitutional provision that\r\n“persons invested with the legislative or executive powers of Government are\r\nTrustees of the Public, and, as such, accountable for their conduct” is\r\n“hortatory in nature”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 39.<span>        \r\n</span>This is not to say that Article 6 must be entirely without practical\r\nsignificance, but rather “the article is not self-executing.”  <u>Shields\r\nv. Gerhart</u>, 163 Vt. 219, 230, 658 A.2d 924, 932 (1995) (citations omitted).\r\n Because Article 6 provides general guiding principles rather than\r\nspecific rights, direct judicial enforcement could occur only where the\r\nLegislature has acted so entirely contrary to the Article as to positively do\r\nviolence to the vision of government described therein.  The Legislature\r\ncertainly may, in contrast, realize the general aims of Article 6 with more\r\nconcrete rights by enacting legislation like the PRA.  See <u>Rowe v.\r\nBrown</u>, 157 Vt. 373, 377, 599 A.2d 333, 336 (1991) (“[F]or enforcement of\r\nthe constitutional maxim, other than popular election, plaintiffs must avail\r\nthemselves of the legislative enactments giving effect to Article 6.”); <u>Welch</u>,\r\n138 Vt. at 128, 411 A.2d at 1352 (“The maxim embodied in Article 6 is\r\nnevertheless given effect through multifarious legislative enactments.”). \r\nIn <u>Town of Brattleboro v.

the means and details of executing the broad principles\r\narticulated in Article 6.  Thus, the realization of Article 6’s\r\nphilosophical vision is subject to those reasonable practical contours that the\r\nLegislature should set forth.  To the extent that § 317(c)(5) exempts\r\nfrom disclosure the records in this case, the Legislature has determined that\r\nthe principle embodied in Article

with the majority decision that 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5) exempts from public\r\naccess executive branch records dealing with the detection and investigation of\r\ncrime, even if the criminal investigation is complete.  I think that\r\nresult is required by the wording of the statute, irrespective of the policy\r\narguments of the Herald.  I also do not believe the statute, so construed,\r\nviolates Article 6 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution.  I add only\r\nthat the exemption appears overbroad and prevents public oversight of how law\r\nenforcement officials do their job, even in instances where there is no reason\r\nfor secrecy—such as protecting confidential sources of information.  I\r\nurge the Legislature to reexamine the wording of the exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 42.<span>        \r\n</span>I also agree that the proviso in § 317(c)(5) for “records relating to\r\nmanagement and direction of a law enforcement agency” does not apply here,\r\nalthough for reasons different from the majority.  The Herald’s assertion\r\nthat the Legislature may have wanted transparency if the investigation of crime\r\ninvolves investigating the actions of a law enforcement agency or its employees\r\nis plausible.  Thus, I do not agree with the majority’s conclusion that\r\nthe Herald’s position would “swallow the exemption.”  <u>Ante</u>, ¶\r\n28.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 43.<span>        \r\n</span>The fundamental difficulty that I have with the Herald’s argument is\r\nthat it is based on an underlying understanding that the “law enforcement\r\nagency” in the language is the agency being investigated rather than the agency\r\nconducting the investigation.  Probably the most obvious reason that this\r\nunderstanding is incorrect is that the proviso covers only records related to\r\nthe management and direction of the agency.  If the Herald’s construction\r\nwere correct, the proviso would cover any criminal activity by the agency and\r\nbe directed primarily at incidents of criminal activity rather than at the\r\nmanagement and direction of the agency.  Indeed, in this case, the Herald\r\nstruggles to demonstrate how the criminal investigation was of the management\r\nof the police academy rather than the criminal activity of one or more\r\nemployees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 44.<span>        \r\n</span>I believe the proper construction is that the law enforcement agency in\r\nthe proviso is the agency conducting the investigation.  The proviso is\r\nneeded because the exemption from public access is so broad.  Since the\r\npurpose of a law enforcement agency is the investigation of crime, the wording\r\nof § 317(c)(5) threatens to make opaque all records of the agency—even those\r\nthat do not involve investigation of particular cases.  Thus, the proviso\r\nis needed to give public access to records that do not deal with the\r\ninvestigation of particular cases but instead with the overall management and\r\ndirection of the agency.  Portions of the legislative history of\r\n§ 317(c)(5), provided by the Herald in its brief, demonstrate that the\r\nproviso was added at the urging of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group\r\n(VPIRG) exactly for this purpose.<span><sup>[9]</sup></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nSince the records the Herald seeks do not relate to the management and\r\ndirection of the VSP, the proviso does not apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 45.<span>        \r\n</span>This brings me to my main disagreement with the majority’s decision—its\r\nconclusion that the inquest records are not publicly accessible in this\r\ncase.  I particularly disagree with the majority’s rationale for its holding—“No\r\nparty argued below, nor do they argue on appeal, that the inquest records are\r\njudicial branch records that must be disclosed under the Rules for Public\r\nAccess to Court Records (PACR).”  <u>Ante</u>, ¶ 31.  This is a\r\nrationale that was not used by the superior court or raised by\r\ndefendants.  It exactly fits the majority’s characterization of this\r\ndissent—it is a “novel issue” “raised sua sponte” “without notice or\r\nopportunity for briefing and argument by the parties.”  <u>Ante</u>, ¶ 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 46.<span>        \r\n</span>It is also wrong.  In fact, the Herald argued both in this Court\r\nand in the superior court that the inquest records are judicial records that\r\nmust be disclosed.  The fact that they did not cite the Rules for Public\r\nAccess to Court Records is irrelevant because those rules made no change in the\r\nlaw with respect to inquest records.  I believe that we should decide this\r\ncase by reviewing the rationale employed by the trial court and deciding this\r\nissue on the merits. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 47.<span>        \r\n</span>According to the affidavit of the assistant attorney general, the\r\nrecords at issue in this case include “an application for an inquest,” “other\r\ndocuments relating to the inquest,” and “materials obtained pursuant to the\r\ninquest.”  The superior court denied access to these materials pursuant to\r\n1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(1), the disclosure exemption that applies to “records which\r\nby law are designated confidential.”  It ruled that the records are by law\r\ndesignated confidential by virtue of 13 V.S.A. § 5134, which provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\"> \r\n[A] stenographer shall be sworn to keep secret all matters and things coming\r\nbefore the judge at such inquest.  Such oath shall be in writing, and the\r\nstenographer shall not disclose testimony so taken by him or her except to the\r\nattorney general, state’s attorney and the judge holding the inquest.  The\r\nminutes of the testimony so taken shall be the property of the state and the\r\nsame or copy thereof shall not go out of the possession of such attorney\r\ngeneral, state’s attorney or their successors except to an attorney appointed\r\nby the supreme court or superior court to act in the place of or assist a\r\nstate’s attorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">The stenographer described in the\r\nsection is hired to “take and transcribe the testimony of the witnesses for the\r\nuse of the state’s attorney.”  <u>Id</u>. § 5133.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 48.<span>        \r\n</span>The majority opinion summarily dismisses the arguments concerning the\r\ninquest materials without describing what happened in this case or providing\r\nthe information necessary for decision on the merits.  In my opinion,\r\nthree points are critical to the decision.  Because the majority has\r\nchosen to reject the Herald’s arguments based on a lack of preservation, I\r\nstart with a discussion of the procedural context for our discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 49.<span>        \r\n</span>As stated by the majority, a reporter from the Herald sought records related\r\nto the death and possible criminal activity of David McMullen from the VSP and\r\nAttorney General’s office.  Those agencies denied the request without\r\ndisclosing that some of the records were inquest records.  They disclosed\r\nthe existence of the inquest records for the first time in their response to\r\nthe Herald’s motion for summary judgment.  The Herald immediately\r\nresponded that the inquest materials were subject to different\r\nregulations.  The Herald noted that the inquest materials were court\r\nrecords subject to 4 V.S.A. § 693,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[10]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nthe disclosure of which could not be controlled by the Attorney General. \r\nIt noted that “the Attorney General has failed to provide even basic\r\ninformation to examine the docket for this inquest, including the name of the\r\ncase, the location of the court and the docket number.”  It concluded with\r\na request that the superior court release the inquest records: “Thus, the Court\r\nshould release the inquest materials because the statute, case law, history of\r\nthe inquest, and facts all warrant disclosure in this case.”  The\r\ndefendants responded that inquest records are confidential by statute, 13\r\nV.S.A. § 5134, and that, in any event, the criminal investigation exemption\r\nunder the PRA, 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5), controls inquest records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 50.<span>        \r\n</span>The superior court ruled that the inquest records are confidential under\r\n13 V.S.A. § 5134, a ruling I believe is wrong as I discuss <u>infra</u>. \r\nThe Herald then moved in this Court for us to order disclosure of the\r\nrecords.  Defendants opposed the motion, in part, on the grounds that the\r\nHerald asked the trial court to disclose the records and is appealing the\r\nrefusal of the court to do so.  A Justice of this Court deferred the\r\nmotion to the merits.  The majority has denied this motion without any\r\nexplanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 51.<span>        \r\n</span>In making its arguments to the superior court and this Court, the Herald\r\nhas relied primarily on two decisions of this Court.  The first is <u>In\r\nre D.L.</u>, 164 Vt. 223, 230, 669 A.2d 1172, 1177 (1995), which holds that the\r\ninquest is an exercise of judicial power and, thus, necessarily that inquest\r\nrecords are judicial records.  The second is <u>In re Sealed Documents</u>,\r\n172 Vt. 152, 156, 772 A.2d 518, 522-23 (2001), which held that search warrant\r\nrecords are publicly accessible court records, subject to closure in specific\r\ninstances, even though they are records that deal with the detection and\r\ninvestigation of crime.  I agree that these cases control the decision\r\nbefore us and require that we hold that the inquest records are\r\naccessible.  There is nothing novel in either the Herald’s argument or the\r\nproper analysis of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 52.<span>        \r\n</span>The second point involves the true nature of the vast majority of modern\r\ninquests.  In denying access to the inquest records, the superior court\r\nrelied upon the statute that makes confidential the record of the testimonial\r\ninquest proceeding taken by a stenographer.  In fact, the testimonial\r\ninquest procedure is, for the most part, a rarely used historical artifact, left\r\nover from the days when the prosecutor did not have the evidence-gathering\r\ntools that exist today.  There have been few, if any, inquest proceedings\r\nin which testimony was taken in years.  Instead, the inquest has been\r\nturned into a proceeding in which the court issues investigatory subpoenas for\r\ndocuments or evidence sought by law enforcement officers, with no in-court\r\nproceeding and no testimony.  The documents or evidence are then provided\r\ndirectly to the law enforcement officers who use them in their investigation. \r\nThe actual process is described in our recent decisions in <u>State v. Simmons</u>,\r\n2011 VT 69, ¶¶ 3-4, ___ Vt. ___, 27 A.3d 1065, and <u>In re Inquest Subpoena\r\n(WCAX)</u>, 2005 VT 103, ¶¶ 2-4, 179 Vt. 12, 890 A.2d 1240.  It is telling\r\nthat proceedings and documents in the latter case were entirely publicly\r\naccessible—directly contrary to the superior court decision in this case. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 53.<span>        \r\n</span>More importantly, the testimonial inquest procedure does not describe\r\nthis case.  The inquest process in this case consists in its entirety of\r\nfour documents.  First, a prosecutor and police officer applied for an\r\ninquest on a standard form, District Court Form 454, printed by the Judiciary\r\nand made available to law enforcement officers.  The form provides both\r\nthe request for the inquest and the court’s approval.  Second, the police\r\nofficer attached an affidavit to the request, specifying the grounds for the\r\nrequest.  Third, the prosecutor and law enforcement officers filed a\r\nsubpoena for the judge to sign, and the judge signed it.  In a case like\r\nthis one, the subpoena specifies the holder of the records and the records and\r\ninformation subject to the subpoena and provides a date by which the records\r\nand information are to be brought to court.  It states, however, that the\r\nrecipient of the subpoena can comply by sending the information to a specified\r\nlaw enforcement officer or prosecutor.  The order for an inquest specifies\r\nno date for a hearing and does not appoint a stenographer.  The order and\r\nsubpoena are faxed to the keeper of the records.  Finally, the entity\r\nsubject to the subpoena complied by fax.  The response did not go to the\r\ncourt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 54.<span>        \r\n</span>It is obvious that the investigatory subpoena is being used in cases\r\nwhere the record keeper will not release the record or information without a\r\ncourt order.  Once the court order is forthcoming, there is no need for\r\nthe record keeper to deal with the court, especially given the invitation to\r\nprovide the record or information directly to the law enforcement officer or prosecutor. \r\nThat occurred in this case.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 55.<span>        \r\n</span>The essence of an inquest is described in 13 V.S.A. § 5132: “A judge may\r\nissue necessary process to bring witnesses before him or her to give evidence\r\nin any matter there under investigation.  The witnesses shall be\r\nsworn.”  In the current use of the inquest statute, there will be no\r\nwitnesses and no witnesses will be sworn.  There will be no “testimony of\r\nthe witnesses” and no stenographer.  See <u>id</u>. at § 5133.<span><sup>[11]</sup></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nThe State is taking the title of the procedure—“inquest”—and using it for a\r\ndifferent purpose and procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 56.<span>        \r\n</span>In many ways, the inquest procedure, as it is currently used, is most\r\nakin to a search warrant because it is authorizing the gathering of evidence\r\ninvoluntarily from a person, including a corporation or other legal\r\nentity.  We noted this identity of purpose in <u>In re Inquest Subpoena\r\n(WCAX)</u>, 2005 VT 103, ¶ 11 n.1.  There is no policy reason to\r\ndistinguish a search warrant and the records used to obtain the warrant from an\r\ninquest investigatory subpoena and the records used to obtain the subpoena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 57.<span>        \r\n</span>My third preliminary point is that the inquest is “viewed as the\r\nexercise of judicial power.”  <u>In re D.L.</u>, 164 Vt. at 230, 669 A.2d\r\nat 1177.  Again, we likened the judicial role in an inquest to the\r\nissuance of a search warrant, <u>id</u>. at 231, 669 A.2d at 1178, and\r\nconcluded “that the [inquest] statute ‘authorizes the courts to perform a\r\nfunction so closely connected with and so far incidental to strictly judicial\r\nproceedings that the courts in obeying the statute would not be exercising\r\nexecutive or nonjudicial powers,’ ” <u>id</u>. at 233, 669 A.2d at 1179\r\n(quoting <u>Lachapelle v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.</u>, 61 N.E.2d 8, 10 (Mass.\r\n1945)).  Thus, despite the investigatory purpose, an inquest is a judicial\r\nproceeding and inquest records are court records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 58.<span>        \r\n</span>Like the issuance of a search warrant, the issuance of an investigatory\r\nsubpoena is both a power critical to law enforcement and an intrusion into the\r\nbasic rights of citizens.  It is one of the greatest powers of the\r\njudiciary and, because of the invasion of citizens’ privacy interests, a power\r\nthat must be carefully regulated to ensure it is not misused.  There are\r\nreasons particularly for oversight of the subpoena power.  Unlike the\r\nsearch warrant power, the constitutional limitations on the subpoena power are\r\nvery limited and more unclear.  See generally 2 W. LaFave, Search &amp;\r\nSeizure § 4.13(a) (4th ed. 2004).  We held in <u>D.L.</u> that a judge can\r\nrefuse to grant a request for an inquest, which necessarily includes the power\r\nto refuse to grant a request for a subpoena, but we did not establish standards\r\nfor exercise of that discretion.  164 Vt. at 234, 669 A.2d at\r\n1179-80.  Thus, subject to very limited constitutional restrictions, a\r\njudge may decide to grant a subpoena request, or not, with no specification of\r\nreasons and with limited—or no—specification of grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 59.<span>        \r\n</span>Three out of four of the records withheld in this case are judicial\r\nbranch records because they are in the control of the judiciary and involve a\r\njudicial action and the basis for that action.  This is the holding of <u>State\r\nv. Tallman</u>, 148 Vt. 465, 472-73, 537 A.2d 422, 426-27 (1987), a case in\r\nwhich the State also argued that the exemption of 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5) followed\r\ncriminal investigation records into the court.  We held in <u>Tallman</u>\r\nthat affidavits of probable cause were executive branch records controlled by §\r\n317(c)(5) “[p]rior to inspection by a court.”  <u>Id</u>. at 472, 537 A.2d\r\nat 426.  After review by a court, access was controlled by Title 4, which\r\nmade them publicly accessible.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[12]</span></span><span></span><span></span> \r\n<u>Tallman</u> was followed with respect to search warrant records in <u>In re\r\nSealed Documents</u>, 172 Vt. at 158-59, 772 A.2d at 524-25.  The rule of <u>Tallman</u>\r\nand <u>In re Sealed Documents</u> is now codified in PACR 3(j).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[13]</span></span><span></span><span></span>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 60.<span>        \r\n</span>The three judicial records are the application for the inquest, the\r\naffidavit, and the subpoena.  The defendants in this case have the\r\nidentical records, either copies of the originals or the originals.  The\r\nfourth record containing the information specified in the subpoena is not a\r\njudicial branch record because it never has been in the possession of the\r\njudiciary and was not the basis for judicial action.  I agree that this\r\nrecord is governed by the PRA and is not subject to public access under 1\r\nV.S.A. § 317(c)(5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 61.<span>        \r\n</span>With the above three points in mind, I think it clear that there is no\r\nstatutory bar to public access to the inquest records at issue in this\r\ncase.  While the statute read broadly provides that the inquest\r\ntestimonial<span><sup>[14]</sup></span><span></span><span></span> hearing is\r\nsecret, and public access is prohibited, nothing in its language suggests that\r\ndocuments created in connection with a so-called “inquest” that never will\r\nproduce a testimonial hearing are covered by the statute.  In this modern\r\ninquest, there is no evidentiary hearing and no stenographer.  Our case\r\nlaw has interpreted the statutes to make the evidentiary hearing secret, see <u>Alexander</u>,\r\n130 Vt. at 60, 286 A.2d at 265, but we have never held secret anything beyond\r\nthe evidentiary hearing and its content.  It is an unjustified expansion\r\nof the statute to hold that its coverage is greater; nothing in the statute\r\nsupports that expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 62.<span>        \r\n</span>There is one other ground for the majority opinion, and it requires\r\nspecial examination because I believe that it is directly contrary to how we\r\nshould treat access-to-public-records appeals.  The majority has\r\napparently ruled that the Herald loses, in part, because it failed to request\r\nthe inquest records from a superior court clerk.  The public records\r\nrequest in this case was made in July 2010, nearly two years ago. \r\nDefendants did not disclose in their response to the request that part of the\r\nrecords being sought were inquest records.  They disclosed the full nature\r\nof the records only in the litigation in the trial court in response to the\r\nHerald’s motion for summary judgment.  The Herald immediately responded\r\nwith a request that the superior judge, before whom the Herald was appearing,\r\nrelease the judicial records, noting that it did not know where and when the inquest\r\noccurred because the defendants did not disclose that information.  The\r\nHerald has renewed that motion here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 63.<span>        \r\n</span>The law specifies no venue for inquest proceedings.  The inquest\r\nhere was requested by an assistant attorney general based on the affidavit of a\r\nstate police officer.  The request could have been made to any superior\r\ncourt, including in Washington County.  As it happened, the inquest\r\nrequest was made in Rutland County, but the Herald had no way to determine\r\nthis.  Indeed, it appears that the Herald is learning this for the first\r\ntime by reading this dissent.  Like search warrants, there is no way to\r\ndetermine where inquest records exist, if at all.  The inability to locate\r\nsearch warrant records has been a subject of recent controversy, with a bill to\r\nrequire a searchable database currently pending in the Vermont Senate. \r\nSee S.138, 2011-2012 Gen. Assem., Adj. Sess. (Vt. 2012).  The exact same\r\nproblem exists with respect to inquest records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 64.<span>        \r\n</span>Whether we are acting under the PRA or PACR, government records are\r\npresumed accessible unless the custodian can show that they come within an\r\nexemption.  It is the custodian’s burden to identify the exemption, not\r\nthe requester’s burden.  The processing of a public records requests is to\r\nbe “expedited in every way.”  1 V.S.A. § 319(b); see also PACR 6(h)\r\n(directing that appeal of denial of access to court records be “decided as soon\r\nas possible”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 65.<span>        \r\n</span>In the face of the clear deviation from the intended expeditious\r\nprocess, the majority has introduced a new technicality to deny access to\r\nrecords—the record must be requested from a superior court clerk, apparently\r\nthe clerk of the county where the record resides.  By this decision, this\r\nCourt is creating an elaborate hide-and-seek game that relies upon artificial\r\nbarriers to deny access without ever reaching the merits.  Thus, after\r\neighteen months of trying, the Herald is told that its request for the inquest\r\nrecords will not be honored because it failed to meet a procedural requirement\r\nraised for the first time by this Court and with which it could not comply\r\nbecause it was denied the information to do so.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 66.<span>        \r\n</span>The issue of access to the inquest records is wholly one of law that has\r\nbeen decided by the superior court in this case and has been briefed and argued\r\nin this Court.  The majority’s objection is a pure technicality; nothing\r\nwould be gained by a decision of the clerk for Rutland Unit or of the superior\r\njudge sitting in Rutland County.  None of the parties raised the objection\r\nof the majority.  If anything, it is a matter of venue that can be, and\r\nwas, waived.  By separate motion, the Herald has asked that we order the\r\nrelease of the inquest records.  We should grant that motion or, in any\r\ncase, decide it on the merits and not a technicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 67.<span>        \r\n</span>There is another reason why it is inappropriate for this Court to\r\ndismiss the inquest record issue without resolving it.  As the majority\r\nstates, this case started as a request to defendants to view certain public\r\nrecords they possess.  Those records include the three inquest-related\r\nrecords at issue.  Defendants have either copies or originals of those\r\nrecords.  Nothing in the PRA or PACR distinguishes between originals and\r\ncopies.  Nor is the status of the holder of the record determinative of\r\nthe right to access the record under either of these governing legal\r\nregimes.  Thus, the law governing access is the same whether the Herald\r\nrequests the records from a superior court clerk or the Attorney General or the\r\nVermont State Police.  These are judicial branch records governed by 4\r\nV.S.A. § 652(4) and PACR.  Thus, the Herald can request these records\r\nfrom defendants and has the same right of public access as if the request were\r\nmade to the superior court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 68.<span>        \r\n</span>The idea that the accessibility of a record depends on from whom it is\r\nrequested is at odds with both common sense and the PRA, which explicitly\r\ncountenances “consultation” between agencies in responding to public records\r\nrequests.  See 1 V.S.A. § 318(a)(5)(C).  The existence of this\r\nprovision in the PRA implies a legislative intent that agencies not summarily\r\ndeny requests for documents in their possession on the grounds that they\r\noriginated in another agency.  Considering an analogous consultation\r\nprovision in the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.\r\n§ 552, federal courts have held that refusing a request and instead\r\nreferring the applicant to the original source of the documents constitutes\r\nimproper withholding of documents.  See <u>McGehee v. CIA</u>, 697 F.2d\r\n1095, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“[An agency] cannot simply refuse to act on the\r\nground that the documents originated elsewhere.”); <u>Founding Church of\r\nScientology of Washington, D.C., Inc. v.

IRS</u>, 792 F.2d\r\n146, 152 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“When . . . a claimed [Freedom of\r\nInformation Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (FOIA)] exemption consists of a generic\r\nexclusion, dependent upon the category of records rather than the subject matter\r\nwhich each individual record contains, resort to a <u>Vaughn</u> index is\r\nfutile.”).  The term <u>Vaughn</u> index arose from <u>Vaughn v.

State”), and denying\r\ndisclosure of the records under the Access to Public Records Act (PRA), 1\r\nV.S.A. §§ 315-320.  The court concluded that the records sought by the\r\nHerald, which included inquest records, were exempt from disclosure as “records\r\ndealing with the detection and investigation of crime” under § 317(c)(5). \r\nIt added that the inquest materials were also exempt under § 317(c)(1) as\r\n“records which by law are designated confidential.”  We affirm the court’s\r\ndecision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 2.<span>            \r\n</span>The material facts are undisputed.  In January 2010, the VSP opened\r\nan investigation into possible criminal conduct involving employees of the\r\nTraining Council.  The VSP had been alerted to the possibility of criminal\r\nconduct by the Vermont Department of Human Resources (VDHR), which was\r\nconducting an employment-related investigation into the matter following the\r\ndiscovery of suspicious material on the work computer of employee David\r\nMcMullen.  Inappropriate emails were also apparently discovered on other\r\nemployees’ work computers.  The employees’ work computers were secured,\r\nand the VSP also seized computer equipment from McMullen’s home.  The\r\nfollowing day, McMullen committed suicide.  As a result, the VSP conducted\r\nan investigation into his death.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 3.<span>            \r\n</span>The VSP compiled several files during the course of its investigations,\r\nwhich included inquest-related material.  When its investigations were\r\ncomplete, the VSP submitted its files to the Office of the Attorney General for\r\nprosecutorial review.  The Attorney General declined to commence a\r\nprosecution, finding no criminal conduct by anyone other than McMullen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 4.<span>            \r\n</span>In July 2010, the Herald made a public records request to the VSP and to\r\nthe Attorney General, seeking disclosure of materials related to the\r\ninvestigations of McMullen and other unnamed employees.  The parties\r\nstipulated that the Herald sought access to both the criminal and death\r\ninvestigation files.  The VSP denied the request, asserting that its files\r\nwere exempt from disclosure under § 317(c)(5).  The Attorney General\r\ndenied the request on similar grounds, adding that the inquest materials were\r\nalso exempt under § 317(c)(1) as records designated confidential by law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 5.<span>            \r\n</span>The Herald filed suit in August 2010 and immediately requested summary\r\njudgment in its favor.  The State opposed the Herald’s request and filed a\r\ncross-motion for summary judgment.  At the court’s request, the State\r\nproduced the withheld material for in camera review.  Following oral\r\nargument and in camera review, the court granted summary judgment to the State. \r\nIt concluded, with two minor exceptions,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[1]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nthat the records at issue related to the investigation of possible criminal\r\nactivity and included “no material related to policy, employment practices, or\r\nother activities not directly related to a specific investigation.”  The\r\ncourt noted that § 317(c)(1) offered an additional ground for shielding\r\nthe inquest materials from public view.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 6.<span>            \r\n</span>In reaching its conclusion, the court rejected the Herald’s argument that\r\nbecause any investigation of McMullen ended with his suicide, there was no\r\nbasis for a continuing exemption to disclosure.  The court similarly\r\nrejected the Herald’s contention that the phrase “compiled in the course of a\r\ncriminal . . . investigation” in § 317(c)(5) meant that any exception to\r\ndisclosure was limited to the duration of the investigation.  The court\r\nconcluded that the statutory language contained no time limit and that it\r\ninstead contemplated an “open-ended period of confidentiality.”  The\r\nHerald now appeals from the court’s decision.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 7.<span>            \r\n</span>We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard\r\nas the trial court.  <u>Shlansky v.

that\r\npoint is uncontested here.  Obviously, the records here could not be\r\nclassified as the “product” of an investigation, as in <u>Walton</u>, without\r\ncompletely ignoring the relevant statutory language and obviating the purpose\r\nof the exemption.  We presume that the Legislature did not intend such an\r\nabsurd result.  <u>TD Banknorth, N.A. v.

I, art. 5, having there been lifted nearly verbatim\r\nfrom the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.  Pa. Const. of 1776, Declaration\r\nof Rights, cl. IV.  The framers of the Pennsylvania Constitution drew\r\ntheir inspiration, in turn, from the Virginia Constitution of 1776, drafted by\r\nGeorge Mason, which provided “[t]hat all power is vested in, and consequently\r\nderived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and\r\nat all times amenable to them.”  Va.

class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 41.<span>        \r\n</span><b>DOOLEY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.  </b>I\r\nconcur with the majority decision that 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5) exempts from public\r\naccess executive branch records dealing with the detection and investigation of\r\ncrime, even if the criminal investigation is complete.  I think that\r\nresult is required by the wording of the statute, irrespective of the policy\r\narguments of the Herald.  I also do not believe the statute, so construed,\r\nviolates Article 6 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution.  I add only\r\nthat the exemption appears overbroad and prevents public oversight of how law\r\nenforcement officials do their job, even in instances where there is no reason\r\nfor secrecy—such as protecting confidential sources of information.  I\r\nurge the Legislature to reexamine the wording of the exemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 42.<span>        \r\n</span>I also agree that the proviso in § 317(c)(5) for “records relating to\r\nmanagement and direction of a law enforcement agency” does not apply here,\r\nalthough for reasons different from the majority.  The Herald’s assertion\r\nthat the Legislature may have wanted transparency if the investigation of crime\r\ninvolves investigating the actions of a law enforcement agency or its employees\r\nis plausible.  Thus, I do not agree with the majority’s conclusion that\r\nthe Herald’s position would “swallow the exemption.”  <u>Ante</u>, ¶\r\n28.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 43.<span>        \r\n</span>The fundamental difficulty that I have with the Herald’s argument is\r\nthat it is based on an underlying understanding that the “law enforcement\r\nagency” in the language is the agency being investigated rather than the agency\r\nconducting the investigation.  Probably the most obvious reason that this\r\nunderstanding is incorrect is that the proviso covers only records related to\r\nthe management and direction of the agency.  If the Herald’s construction\r\nwere correct, the proviso would cover any criminal activity by the agency and\r\nbe directed primarily at incidents of criminal activity rather than at the\r\nmanagement and direction of the agency.  Indeed, in this case, the Herald\r\nstruggles to demonstrate how the criminal investigation was of the management\r\nof the police academy rather than the criminal activity of one or more\r\nemployees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 44.<span>        \r\n</span>I believe the proper construction is that the law enforcement agency in\r\nthe proviso is the agency conducting the investigation.  The proviso is\r\nneeded because the exemption from public access is so broad.  Since the\r\npurpose of a law enforcement agency is the investigation of crime, the wording\r\nof § 317(c)(5) threatens to make opaque all records of the agency—even those\r\nthat do not involve investigation of particular cases.  Thus, the proviso\r\nis needed to give public access to records that do not deal with the\r\ninvestigation of particular cases but instead with the overall management and\r\ndirection of the agency.  Portions of the legislative history of\r\n§ 317(c)(5), provided by the Herald in its brief, demonstrate that the\r\nproviso was added at the urging of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group\r\n(VPIRG) exactly for this purpose.<span><sup>[9]</sup></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nSince the records the Herald seeks do not relate to the management and\r\ndirection of the VSP, the proviso does not apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 45.<span>        \r\n</span>This brings me to my main disagreement with the majority’s decision—its\r\nconclusion that the inquest records are not publicly accessible in this\r\ncase.  I particularly disagree with the majority’s rationale for its holding—“No\r\nparty argued below, nor do they argue on appeal, that the inquest records are\r\njudicial branch records that must be disclosed under the Rules for Public\r\nAccess to Court Records (PACR).”  <u>Ante</u>, ¶ 31.  This is a\r\nrationale that was not used by the superior court or raised by\r\ndefendants.  It exactly fits the majority’s characterization of this\r\ndissent—it is a “novel issue” “raised sua sponte” “without notice or\r\nopportunity for briefing and argument by the parties.”  <u>Ante</u>, ¶ 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 46.<span>        \r\n</span>It is also wrong.  In fact, the Herald argued both in this Court\r\nand in the superior court that the inquest records are judicial records that\r\nmust be disclosed.  The fact that they did not cite the Rules for Public\r\nAccess to Court Records is irrelevant because those rules made no change in the\r\nlaw with respect to inquest records.  I believe that we should decide this\r\ncase by reviewing the rationale employed by the trial court and deciding this\r\nissue on the merits. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 47.<span>        \r\n</span>According to the affidavit of the assistant attorney general, the\r\nrecords at issue in this case include “an application for an inquest,” “other\r\ndocuments relating to the inquest,” and “materials obtained pursuant to the\r\ninquest.”  The superior court denied access to these materials pursuant to\r\n1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(1), the disclosure exemption that applies to “records which\r\nby law are designated confidential.”  It ruled that the records are by law\r\ndesignated confidential by virtue of 13 V.S.A. § 5134, which provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\"> \r\n[A] stenographer shall be sworn to keep secret all matters and things coming\r\nbefore the judge at such inquest.  Such oath shall be in writing, and the\r\nstenographer shall not disclose testimony so taken by him or her except to the\r\nattorney general, state’s attorney and the judge holding the inquest.  The\r\nminutes of the testimony so taken shall be the property of the state and the\r\nsame or copy thereof shall not go out of the possession of such attorney\r\ngeneral, state’s attorney or their successors except to an attorney appointed\r\nby the supreme court or superior court to act in the place of or assist a\r\nstate’s attorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">The stenographer described in the\r\nsection is hired to “take and transcribe the testimony of the witnesses for the\r\nuse of the state’s attorney.”  <u>Id</u>. § 5133.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 48.<span>        \r\n</span>The majority opinion summarily dismisses the arguments concerning the\r\ninquest materials without describing what happened in this case or providing\r\nthe information necessary for decision on the merits.  In my opinion,\r\nthree points are critical to the decision.  Because the majority has\r\nchosen to reject the Herald’s arguments based on a lack of preservation, I\r\nstart with a discussion of the procedural context for our discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 49.<span>        \r\n</span>As stated by the majority, a reporter from the Herald sought records related\r\nto the death and possible criminal activity of David McMullen from the VSP and\r\nAttorney General’s office.  Those agencies denied the request without\r\ndisclosing that some of the records were inquest records.  They disclosed\r\nthe existence of the inquest records for the first time in their response to\r\nthe Herald’s motion for summary judgment.  The Herald immediately\r\nresponded that the inquest materials were subject to different\r\nregulations.  The Herald noted that the inquest materials were court\r\nrecords subject to 4 V.S.A. § 693,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[10]</span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\nthe disclosure of which could not be controlled by the Attorney General. \r\nIt noted that “the Attorney General has failed to provide even basic\r\ninformation to examine the docket for this inquest, including the name of the\r\ncase, the location of the court and the docket number.”  It concluded with\r\na request that the superior court release the inquest records: “Thus, the Court\r\nshould release the inquest materials because the statute, case law, history of\r\nthe inquest, and facts all warrant disclosure in this case.”  The\r\ndefendants responded that inquest records are confidential by statute, 13\r\nV.S.A. § 5134, and that, in any event, the criminal investigation exemption\r\nunder the PRA, 1 V.S.A. § 317(c)(5), controls inquest records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 50.<span>        \r\n</span>The superior court ruled that the inquest records are confidential under\r\n13 V.S.A. § 5134, a ruling I believe is wrong as I discuss <u>infra</u>. \r\nThe Herald then moved in this Court for us to order disclosure of the\r\nrecords.  Defendants opposed the motion, in part, on the grounds that the\r\nHerald asked the trial court to disclose the records and is appealing the\r\nrefusal of the court to do so.  A Justice of this Court deferred the\r\nmotion to the merits.  The majority has denied this motion without any\r\nexplanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Style1\">¶ 51.<span>        \r\n</span>In making its arguments to the superior court and this Court, the Herald\r\nhas relied primarily on two decisions of this Court.  The first is <u>In\r\nre D.L.</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></span>, 230, <span class=\"citation\"

that the\r\ninquest is an exercise of judicial power and, thus, necessarily that inquest\r\nrecords are judicial records.  The second is <u>In re Sealed Documents</u>,\r\n<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></span>, 156, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2285961\"><a href=\"/opinion/2285961/in-re-sealed-documents/\"><span class=\"volume\">772</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 522-23 (2001), which held that search warrant\r\nrecords are publicly accessible court records, subject to closure in specific\r\ninstances, even though they are records that deal with the detection and\r\ninvestigation of crime.  I agree that these cases control the decision\r\nbefore us and require that we hold that the inquest records are\r\naccessible.  There is nothing novel in either the Herald’s argument or the\r\nproper analysis of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 52.<span>        \r\n</span>The second point involves the true nature of the vast majority of modern\r\ninquests.  In denying access to the inquest records, the superior court\r\nrelied upon the statute that makes confidential the record of the testimonial\r\ninquest proceeding taken by a stenographer.  In fact, the testimonial\r\ninquest procedure is, for the most part, a rarely used historical artifact, left\r\nover from the days when the prosecutor did not have the evidence-gathering\r\ntools that exist today.  There have been few, if any, inquest proceedings\r\nin which testimony was taken in years.  Instead, the inquest has been\r\nturned into a proceeding in which the court issues investigatory subpoenas for\r\ndocuments or evidence sought by law enforcement officers, with no in-court\r\nproceeding and no testimony.  The documents or evidence are then provided\r\ndirectly to the law enforcement officers who use them in their investigation. \r\nThe actual process is described in our recent decisions in <u>State v. Simmons</u>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1043770\"><a href=\"/opinion/1043770/state-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span

proceedings and documents in the latter case were entirely publicly\r\naccessible—directly contrary to the superior court decision in this case. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 53.<span>        \r\n</span>More importantly, the testimonial inquest procedure does not describe\r\nthis case.  The inquest process in this case consists in its entirety of\r\nfour documents.  First, a prosecutor and police officer applied for an\r\ninquest on a standard form, District Court Form 454, printed by the Judiciary\r\nand made available to law enforcement officers.  The form provides both\r\nthe request for the inquest and the court’s approval.  Second, the police\r\nofficer attached an affidavit to the request, specifying the grounds for the\r\nrequest.  Third, the prosecutor and law enforcement officers filed a\r\nsubpoena for the judge to sign, and the judge signed it.  In a case like\r\nthis one, the subpoena specifies the holder of the records and the records and\r\ninformation subject to the subpoena and provides a date by which the records\r\nand information are to be brought to court.  It states, however, that the\r\nrecipient of the subpoena can comply by sending the information to a specified\r\nlaw enforcement officer or prosecutor.  The order for an inquest specifies\r\nno date for a hearing and does not appoint a stenographer.  The order and\r\nsubpoena are faxed to the keeper of the records.  Finally, the entity\r\nsubject to the subpoena complied by fax.  The response did not go to the\r\ncourt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 54.<span>        \r\n</span>It is obvious that the investigatory subpoena is being used in cases\r\nwhere the record keeper will not release the record or information without a\r\ncourt order.  Once the court order is forthcoming, there is no need for\r\nthe record keeper to deal with the court, especially given the invitation to\r\nprovide the record or information directly to the law enforcement officer or prosecutor. \r\nThat occurred in this case.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 55.<span>        \r\n</span>The essence of an inquest is described in 13 V.S.A. § 5132: “A judge may\r\nissue necessary process to bring witnesses before him or her to give evidence\r\nin any matter there under investigation.  The witnesses shall be\r\nsworn.”  In the current use of the inquest statute, there will be no\r\nwitnesses and no witnesses will be sworn.  There will be no “testimony of\r\nthe witnesses” and no stenographer.  See <u>id</u>. at § 5133.<span><sup>[11]</sup></span><span></span><span></span> \r\nThe State is taking the title of the procedure—“inquest”—and using it for a\r\ndifferent purpose and procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 56.<span>        \r\n</span>In many ways, the inquest procedure, as it is currently used, is most\r\nakin to a search warrant because it is authorizing the gathering of evidence\r\ninvoluntarily from a person, including a corporation or other legal\r\nentity.  We noted this identity of purpose in <u>In re Inquest Subpoena\r\n(WCAX)</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1493701\"><a href=\"/opinion/1493701/in-re-inquest-subpoena-wcax/\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">VT</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, ¶ 11 n.1.  There is no policy reason to\r\ndistinguish a search warrant and the records used to obtain the warrant from an\r\ninquest investigatory subpoena and the records used to obtain the subpoena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 57.<span>        \r\n</span>My third preliminary point is that the inquest is “viewed as the\r\nexercise of judicial power.”  <u>In re D.L.</u>, 164 Vt. at 230, 669 A.2d\r\nat 1177.  Again, we likened the judicial role in an inquest to the\r\nissuance of a search warrant, <u>id</u>. at 231, 669 A.2d at 1178, and\r\nconcluded “that the [inquest] statute ‘authorizes the courts to perform a\r\nfunction so closely connected with and so far incidental to strictly judicial\r\nproceedings that the courts in obeying the statute would not be exercising\r\nexecutive or nonjudicial powers,’ ” <u>id</u>. at 233, 669 A.2d at 1179\r\n(quoting <u>Lachapelle v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span>, 10 (Mass.\r\n1945)).  Thus, despite the investigatory purpose, an inquest is a judicial\r\nproceeding and inquest records are court records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 58.<span>        \r\n</span>Like the issuance of a search warrant, the issuance of an investigatory\r\nsubpoena is both a power critical to law enforcement and an intrusion into the\r\nbasic rights of citizens.  It is one of the greatest powers of the\r\njudiciary and, because of the invasion of citizens’ privacy interests, a power\r\nthat must be carefully regulated to ensure it is not misused.  There are\r\nreasons particularly for oversight of the subpoena power.  Unlike the\r\nsearch warrant power, the constitutional limitations on the subpoena power are\r\nvery limited and more unclear.  See generally 2 W. LaFave, Search &amp;\r\nSeizure § 4.13(a) (4th ed. 2004).  We held in <u>D.L.</u> that a judge can\r\nrefuse to grant a request for an inquest, which necessarily includes the power\r\nto refuse to grant a request for a subpoena, but we did not establish standards\r\nfor exercise of that discretion.  164 Vt. at 234, 669 A.2d at\r\n1179-80.  Thus, subject to very limited constitutional restrictions, a\r\njudge may decide to grant a subpoena request, or not, with no specification of\r\nreasons and with limited—or no—specification of grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 59.<span>        \r\n</span>Three out of four of the records withheld in this case are judicial\r\nbranch records because they are in the control of the judiciary and involve a\r\njudicial action and the basis for that action.  This is the holding of <u>State\r\nv.

(Vt. 2012).  The exact same\r\nproblem exists with respect to inquest records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 64.<span>        \r\n</span>Whether we are acting under the PRA or PACR, government records are\r\npresumed accessible unless the custodian can show that they come within an\r\nexemption.  It is the custodian’s burden to identify the exemption, not\r\nthe requester’s burden.  The processing of a public records requests is to\r\nbe “expedited in every way.”  1 V.S.A. § 319(b); see also PACR 6(h)\r\n(directing that appeal of denial of access to court records be “decided as soon\r\nas possible”).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 65.<span>        \r\n</span>In the face of the clear deviation from the intended expeditious\r\nprocess, the majority has introduced a new technicality to deny access to\r\nrecords—the record must be requested from a superior court clerk, apparently\r\nthe clerk of the county where the record resides.  By this decision, this\r\nCourt is creating an elaborate hide-and-seek game that relies upon artificial\r\nbarriers to deny access without ever reaching the merits.  Thus, after\r\neighteen months of trying, the Herald is told that its request for the inquest\r\nrecords will not be honored because it failed to meet a procedural requirement\r\nraised for the first time by this Court and with which it could not comply\r\nbecause it was denied the information to do so.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 66.<span>        \r\n</span>The issue of access to the inquest records is wholly one of law that has\r\nbeen decided by the superior court in this case and has been briefed and argued\r\nin this Court.  The majority’s objection is a pure technicality; nothing\r\nwould be gained by a decision of the clerk for Rutland Unit or of the superior\r\njudge sitting in Rutland County.  None of the parties raised the objection\r\nof the majority.  If anything, it is a matter of venue that can be, and\r\nwas, waived.  By separate motion, the Herald has asked that we order the\r\nrelease of the inquest records.  We should grant that motion or, in any\r\ncase, decide it on the merits and not a technicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 67.<span>        \r\n</span>There is another reason why it is inappropriate for this Court to\r\ndismiss the inquest record issue without resolving it.  As the majority\r\nstates, this case started as a request to defendants to view certain public\r\nrecords they possess.  Those records include the three inquest-related\r\nrecords at issue.  Defendants have either copies or originals of those\r\nrecords.  Nothing in the PRA or PACR distinguishes between originals and\r\ncopies.  Nor is the status of the holder of the record determinative of\r\nthe right to access the record under either of these governing legal\r\nregimes.  Thus, the law governing access is the same whether the Herald\r\nrequests the records from a superior court clerk or the Attorney General or the\r\nVermont State Police.  These are judicial branch records governed by 4\r\nV.S.A. § 652(4) and PACR.  Thus, the Herald can request these records\r\nfrom defendants and has the same right of public access as if the request were\r\nmade to the superior court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionText\">¶ 68.<span>        \r\n</span>The idea that the accessibility of a record depends on from whom it is\r\nrequested is at odds with both common sense and the PRA, which explicitly\r\ncountenances “consultation” between agencies in responding to public records\r\nrequests.  See 1 V.S.A. § 318(a)(5)(C).  The existence of this\r\nprovision in the PRA implies a legislative intent that agencies not summarily\r\ndeny requests for documents in their possession on the grounds that they\r\noriginated in another agency.  Considering an analogous consultation\r\nprovision in the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.\r\n§ 552, federal courts have held that refusing a request and instead\r\nreferring the applicant to the original source of the documents constitutes\r\nimproper withholding of documents.  See <u>McGehee v.
