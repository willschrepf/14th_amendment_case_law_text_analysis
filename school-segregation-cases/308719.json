Webb, 643 F.Supp. 1546, 1547 (N.D.Ga.1986) (hereinafter \"Webb II\" ).    Plaintiff-appellees obtained declaratory and injunctive relief barring the enforcement of a Georgia law which regulates, inter alia, the display of material deemed \"harmful to minors.\"    The District Court for the Northern District of Georgia interpreted the statute to \"reduce an adult's selection of reading materials to a book list suitable for a fifth-grade class\" and declared the statute unconstitutional on its face.  Id. at 1548.    We find that the statute is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that reduces the scope of materials covered, produces only a slight burden on adults' access to protected material,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and fully comports with the First Amendment.  We also reverse the district court's determination that an exemption granted in the statute to libraries is subject to strict scrutiny and violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 1984, the Governor of Georgia signed into law Act No. 1319, 1984 Ga.Laws 1495, 1496-1501, which was to take effect on July 1, 1984.  Section 3 of the Act, which is codified at O.C.G.A. Secs. 16-12-102 to 16-12-104 (1988),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> regulates the distribution and display of sexually explicit materials deemed \"harmful to minors\" under the definition provided in section 16-12-102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be useful to analyze the challenged statutory provisions as a group of five distinct components:  (1) the definition in section 16-12-102 of the type of materials deemed \"harmful to minors\" and subjected to the proscriptions set forth in section 16-12-103;  (2) the ban in section 16-12-103(a) on the distribution (in this case, the sale or loan) to a minor of any material \"harmful to minors\";  (3) the ban in section 16-12-103(b) on the exhibition to a minor of any motion picture, show, or other presentation that is \"harmful to minors\";  (4) the prohibition in section 16-12-103(e) on the display in public places where minors may be present of material that is \"harmful to minors\";  and (5) in section 16-12-104, the exemption from coverage under the statute of certain libraries in the state of Georgia.  See American Booksellers Ass'n., v. Webb, 590 F.Supp. 677, 687 (N.D.Ga.1984) (district court order to abstain and grant interim injunctive relief) (hereinafter \"Webb I\" ) (describing the five component parts of the statute);  Hunter v.

New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   Ginsberg approved the use of a \"variable obscenity standard,\" see id. at 636-39, 88 S.Ct. at 1278-80--an adaptation of the general standard for determining adult obscenity to reflect the \"prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors.\"   Id. at 639, 88 S.Ct. at 1280 (quoting N.Y.Penal Law Sec. 484-h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   Five years after the Court decided Ginsberg, it revised the standard for determining adult obscenity in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973).  Section 16-12-102 modifies the Ginsberg test for determining material obscene as to minors in light of the three-part test articulated in Miller for determining adult obscenity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An accused must \"knowingly\" violate the statute's various proscriptions.  See O.C.G.A. Secs. 16-12-103(a), (b), and (e), and 16-12-102(2).  Section 16-12-103(c) also makes it unlawful for any minor falsely to represent that he or she is 18 years of age or older with the intent to procure any material covered by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Sec. 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   Plaintiffs also alleged that the legislature's choice to include in a single enactment provisions relating to sexual offenses against children (Sections I and II of the Act, see footnote 2), together with provisions regulating material \"harmful to minors\" (Section III of the Act), violated Article III, Section V, Paragraph III of the Georgia Constitution--the rule against referring to more than one subject matter in the same bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Act was not scheduled to become effective until July 1, 1984, see O.C.G.A.

Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), until the Georgia courts decided whether the Act violated the \"one subject matter\" provision of the Georgia Constitution.  The court did however grant temporary relief to plaintiffs by enjoining the display ban.   Webb I, 590 F.Supp. at 693-94.    In the interest of judicial economy, the court suggested that Appellants also seek a construction of the challenged provisions in the Georgia courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs appealed to this court, which granted the parties' joint motion to present two certified questions to the Georgia Supreme Court.

Secs. 16-12-102 to 16-12-104 in the absence of enforcement facts, finding instead that the challenge was anticipatory.  American Booksellers Ass'n v.

Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1556.    The court ruled on February 25, 1987, that since the library exemption is not severable from the definition, distribution, exhibition, and display provisions, the entire statute is invalid.  American Booksellers Ass'n v. Webb, 654 F.Supp. 503 (N.D.Ga.1987).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   The court nevertheless stayed that portion of its injunction involving the definition, distribution, and exhibition provisions of the statute pending this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>a. findings of fact</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found \"that in-store display of books is the cornerstone of the [bookselling] industry's marketing practices.  Relatively few books are advertised through the mass media, and, as a result, the vast majority of sales are impulsive selections prompted by a display.\"    Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1549.    The court also found as matter of fact that approximately 500,000 books are in print at any given time and 50,000 new books are published every year;  therefore, booksellers \"cannot hope to read more than a minimal percentage of books that they stock.\"    Id. at 1550.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>b. conclusions of law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made various legal interpretations regarding the coverage of the statute's \"harmful to minors\" definition and thus the reach of the ban on display.  Although several of its findings were noted as \"findings of fact,\" see id. at 1549-51, the parties agree that \"the district court's determinations as to the scope of the phrase 'harmful to minors,' and its specific applicability to particular works\" are mixed questions of law and fact.  Appellees' Brief at 11-12.  See Appellants' Brief at 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   The district court found that \"a significant percentage of an average bookstore's inventory would be barred from display\" by the statute, id. at 1549, and \" 'that the predominate amount of all adult reading material, fiction and nonfiction, could arguably be encompassed within the terms of [the Act].' \"  Id. at 1550 (quoting witness Florence).  The court made these observations on the basis of its interpretation that the \"serious value\" prong of the \"harmful to minors\" definition must be evaluated in light of what \"most minors,\" including the youngest potential readers, could understand and appreciate.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court declined to construe section 16-12-103(e)'s requirement that a person must not \"knowingly ... exhibit, expose, or display in public ... at any ... public place frequented by minors or where minors are or may be invited as part of the general public:  [any material subject to the statute].\"  Rather than determining the least burdensome compliance strategy actually mandated by this language and then evaluating its constitutionality, the court held that displaying material in an adults-only section of a store open to minors, or covering books with blinder racks or adults-only tags, \"would not save the display provision as it is currently drafted\" since, given the court's earlier interpretation of the vast amount of works covered by the statute, these strategies \"would produce a chilling effect.\"    Id. at 1554.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the court found that the statute was not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction since (1) \"the methods of display left available in the wake of the Act do not adequately serve the interests of free speech,\" and (2) defendants failed to submit sufficient evidence that \"the limited contact a minor may have with materials displayed in a bookstore produces a negative [secondary effect of speech]\" that the state may regulate.  Id. at 1555.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court noted, however, that \"the chilling effect attendant to the compliance methods suggested by the defendants might be acceptable if the statute did not apply to \"classic works of literature\" and the predominant amount of adult reading material.  Id. at 1554.    In fact, as the court stated, \"a display statute that applies only to materials inappropriate for minors approaching the age of majority might well survive a constitutional attack.\"    Id. at 1556.    See also id. at 1554 n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court found that the statutory exemption provided to libraries is a classification infringing upon a fundamental right.  Since the strict scrutiny test is applicable under the Equal Protection Clause to classifications affecting the exercise of fundamental rights, and the government failed to demonstrate that the library exemption promoted a compelling governmental interest through a narrowly drawn classification, the court found the exemption unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal requires us first to determine whether the reach of the \"harmful to minors\" definition in section 16-12-102 must be evaluated from the perspective of \"any reasonable minor,\" including an older minor, or whether the tests must be applied in light of the sensibilities and literary comprehension of \"most\" minors, the \"average,\" or even the youngest minor who might seek access to books or other materials with explicit sexual conduct.  Second, we must evaluate the burden on protected speech in light of (1) our interpretation of the amount of material covered and (2) the methods of compliance actually mandated by the ban on display.  Finally, we will decide the appropriate standard of review for the classification drawn by the Georgia legislature regarding who may distribute and display to minors material covered by the Act, and who may not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>II.

Outside of the First Amendment context, the Supreme Court has noted the difficulties inherent in a facial challenge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>that \"[a] facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exist under which the Act would be valid.  The fact that [the challenged statute] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

For this reason, the Court has recognized the so-called overbreadth doctrine in the limited context of First Amendment facial challenges.  Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984).  Since the overbreadth doctrine in effect requires courts to evaluate the potential reach of a statute, conceivable sets of circumstances, and possible direct and indirect burdens on speech,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> \"[t]he Supreme Court has noted that the overbreadth doctrine is 'strong medicine' that should be employed only 'with hesitation, and then \"only as a last resort.\" ' \"    Upper Midwest Booksellers v.

Regulations on display affect \"conduct plus speech.\"    Upper Midwest Booksellers, 780 F.2d at 1391-92;  M.S. News Co. v. Casado, 721 F.2d 1281, 1289 (10th Cir.1983);  American Booksellers Ass'n v.

The key to application of this principle is that the statute must be \"readily susceptible\" to limitation.

FIRST AMENDMENT STANDARDS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to restate the bedrock case law and general principles of First Amendment jurisprudence which guide our analysis.  We are content to note that (1) content-based restrictions on speech survive constitutional scrutiny only under extraordinary circumstances;  but (2) material judged \"obscene\" under the appropriate constitutional standard is not protected by the First Amendment;  (3) indirect burdens placed on protected speech in an effort to regulate obscenity must be supported by important state interests and should not be unnecessarily burdensome;  and (4) the state's interest in protecting its youth justifies a limited burden on free expression.  See generally Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1551-52 (and cases cited therein).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with the Supreme Court's decision in Ginsberg that a state may deny minors access to materials acceptable for adults but obscene for minors.  While the statute in Ginsberg banned only the sale or distribution of this material to minors and did not implicate the First Amendment rights of adults, it is clear from our reading of Ginsberg that a state may, absent an impermissible burden on adults, deny minors all access in any form to materials obscene as to them.  Minors have no right to view or in any way consume this material--even if they do not purchase or otherwise take control of it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ginsberg did not address the difficulties which arise when the government's protection of minors burdens (even indirectly) adults' access to material protected as to them.  We must look to other case law and general principles of First Amendment jurisprudence to discern the constitutional parameters of the government's power under these circumstances.  First, it is clear that a state may not prohibit an adult's access to material that is obscene for minors but not for adults.  As the Supreme Court recently reiterated, the First Amendment forbids reducing the adult population to reading and viewing only works suitable for children.  Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. at 389, 108 S.Ct. at 640-41 (citing Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 73-74, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 2883-84, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983);  Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383-84, 77 S.Ct. 524, 525-26, 1 L.Ed.2d 412 (1957)).  Even where statutes have not been upheld, however, the Supreme Court has recognized that some limitation on the access of adults to material protected for them but harmful to minors is permissible.  Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2838-39, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989) (invalidating total ban on adult access to indecent telephone messages but intimating that a statute restricting access through certain means would be narrowly tailored and constitutional);  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383, 77 S.Ct. at 525-26 (invalidating statute banning reading materials inappropriate for children, but implying that a statute \"reasonably restricted to the evil with which it is said to deal\" would be constitutional).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several courts evaluating variously defined display regulations such as the instant one have emphasized that the state's legitimate interest in protecting its young must be balanced against the right of adults to have access to protected material.  See, e.g., Upper Midwest Booksellers, 780 F.2d at 1394-95;  Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1552.    On the one hand, a state's interest in protecting children from exposure to material obscene as to minors is a substantial and important state interest.  Ferber, 458 U.S. at 757, 102 S.Ct. at 3354-55 (1982);  Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 639-42, 88 S.Ct. at 1280-82.    On the other hand, the indirect burden on adults' First Amendment right to have access to material not obscene for adults must be narrowly drawn.  See Upper Midwest Booksellers, 780 F.2d at 1396-97 (regulation must leave open adequate alternative channels, must not restrict expression at its source, and must not impose \"significant\" restrictions on adult access);  M.S. News Co., 721 F.2d at 1288 (restriction on adults' access to material that is not obscene as to them must be reasonable);  Rendell, 332 Pa.Super. at 581, 481 A.2d at 941 (\"incidental restrictions on First Amendment freedoms must be limited to those essential to the furtherance of that interest\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of courts have evaluated variously defined restrictions on the display of material \"harmful to minors\" in light of the constitutional standards for a reasonable time, place, and manner regulation.  Display restrictions affect the manner in which speech may be presented or accessed, in contrast to a regulation of pure speech at its source or an outright ban on its accessibility to adults.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no relevant distinction in this case between the constitutional standards applicable to a time, place, and manner restriction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and the balancing test described above for a regulation of speech unprotected as to minors that indirectly affects speech protected as to adults.  In evaluating the display ban under either test, the crucial inquiry, at least in this case, is whether the restriction on adults' access to protected speech is unnecessarily burdensome or \"significant,\" or, stated differently, whether alternate modes of adult access are unduly restricted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees contend that Georgia's restriction on the display of material \"harmful to minors\" burdens protected activity in many ways.  The district court considered those potential burdens under the general rubric of \"overbreadth analysis\"--a phrase that courts often use loosely to refer to the propensity of a statute to sweep protected activity into its purview, or unnecessarily to burden protected activity through the collateral effects of its operation on unprotected activity.  There are, however, several distinct types of overbreadth alleged in this case, each of which require separate analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. OVERBREADTH ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>A. Direct Regulation of Protected Activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The type of \"legislative overkill\" most commonly associated with \"overbreadth\" results when lawmakers define the scope of a statute to reach both unprotected expression as well as, at least potentially, protected speech.  For example, in American Booksellers Ass'n v. McAuliffe, 533 F.Supp. 50 (N.D.Ga.1981), the court struck down as overbroad a Georgia statute banning the distribution to minors of, inter alia, a \"picture of nude or partially denuded figures posed or presented in a manner to provoke or arouse lust or passion or to exploit sex.\"    On its face, the statute covered material that would not be obscene as to minors under the Ginsberg standard;  thus, it directly regulated material protected even as to minors and was therefore overbroad.  Id. at 52-53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The definition of material targeted in Georgia Code section 16-12-102 suffers from no such \"legislative overkill\";  it employs a narrowly crafted Ginsberg-type adaptation of the current definition of adult obscenity announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-15, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973).  Although the Supreme Court has not decided what effect Miller will have on the Ginsberg formulation of a variable obscenity standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> we join other courts in finding that the post-Ginsberg definition of adult obscenity announced in Miller (as modified for determining that which is obscene to minors) does not restrict the scope of materials that a state may regulate.  See American Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d 125, 127 n. 2 (4th Cir.1989);  M.S. News Co., 721 F.2d at 1286-87.    Both the Georgia law at issue in this case and the New York statute approved in Ginsberg \"adapted the current obscenity test so it could be used to determine whether material is harmful to minors,\" id. at 1286 n. 4 (comparing the N.Y. statute in Ginsberg with a Wichita, Kansas ordinance derived from the Miller test).  See American Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d at 127.    Nothing in Miller casts any doubt on the constitutional viability of a variable standard of obscenity for minors based upon a Ginsberg-like adaptation of the current Supreme Court standard for determining adult obscenity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees maintain that section 16-12-102's definition is overly broad because it does not accommodate the differences between older and younger minors in maturity levels and capacity to comprehend literary themes.  According to appellees, the use of a single standard for all minors denies older minors access to materials that have serious literary value for them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree, and find that Georgia courts would interpret section 16-12-102 in light of Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 107 S.Ct. 1918, 95 L.Ed.2d 439 (1987).  In Pope, the Supreme Court construed the test for adult obscenity and held that \"[t]he proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member [of the community] would find serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value in allegedly obscene material, but whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole.\"    Id. at 500-501, 107 S.Ct. at 1921 (footnote omitted).  Hunter v. State, 257 Ga. at 571-72, 361 S.E.2d at 788 (1987).  As interpreted in Pope, the first two prongs of the Miller test utilize \"contemporary community standards,\" whereas \"serious value\" is determined not with reference to \"majority approval,\" but on the basis of whether any reasonable person would find serious value--even if the community as a whole, or the \"average\" member of the community, would not.  481 U.S. at 500, 107 S.Ct. at 1920-21.    See the discussion in footnote 18 above.  Pope echoes the fundamental idea that, although \"We the People\" are sovereign under the Constitution, the Founders added the Bill of Rights as a bulwark against the \"tyranny of the majority.\"    If, like the other two prongs of the test for obscenity, we judge \"serious value\" according to the \"degree of local acceptance [the work in question] has won,\" id. at 500, 107 S.Ct. at 1921, then we would compromise the First Amendment's protection against majoritarian pressure to stifle disfavored expression.  See id. at 500-501, 107 S.Ct. at 1920-21;  id. at 506, 107 S.Ct. at 1923-24 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As applied to a Ginsberg-type adaptation of the adult obscenity test, Pope teaches that if any reasonable minor, including a seventeen-year-old, would find serious value, the material is not \"harmful to minors.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>   As the Fourth Circuit and the Virginia Supreme Court recently observed, \" 'if a work is found to have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for a legitimate minority of normal, older adolescents, then it cannot be said to lack such value for the entire class of juveniles taken as a whole.' \"    American Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d at 127 (quoting Commonwealth v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 236 Va. 168, 372 S.E.2d 618, 624 (1988)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 16-12-102 therefore does not reach materials protected as to minors and is not overly broad in that sense.  As we discuss below, this interpretation of the statute's coverage also dramatically decreases the amount of material actually covered by the ban on display and the indirect burden suffered by adults as a result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when the state regulates only speech that is unprotected to one group (minors), the restriction can collaterally burden speech that is protected for another group (adults).

The tremendous volume of material published and the practical inability of booksellers to gain more than a synoptic familiarity with the material they order from publishers would, according to the court, force booksellers to err on the side of caution by \"refusing to order [for display] any book with a suggestive cover or the works of an author known for sexually explicit prose.\"    Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1550.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the burden on booksellers would be far less than the district court suggests.  First, since only a minimal number of works will have serious value for reasonable adults but not for reasonable minors, including older minors, the statute will not increase to any great extent the screening that stores must do in order to comply with Georgia's general obscenity statute, O.C.G.A. Sec. 16-12-80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>   Second, despite the increased opportunity to evaluate the fitness of material at the point of sale to minors, as opposed to ordering from a publisher for display sales,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> the display ban will only incrementally increase the screening necessary for booksellers to comply with the prohibition on the sale of \"harmful\" material to minors, a burden the district found constitutional under Ginsberg--a holding that appellees do not appeal.  Finally, section 16-12-103(e) only prohibits displays that are made \"knowingly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   For these reasons, we find that section 16-12-102's definition does not render the display ban substantially overbroad due to indeterminacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

As we interpret it, the statute covers only material unprotected to minors and is not so indeterminate that it unduly chills protected expression.  Since in the real world material cannot be made \"invisible\" to minors without hampering to a certain extent adults' access to it, we must analyze the compliance strategy section 16-12-103(e) actually mandates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory \"breadth\" that we analyze in this context refers to the degree of practical inconvenience actually required by the language of subsection (e).  Only by focusing on that which the statute requires for compliance with the display ban, rather than on every compliance strategy that is sufficient but not necessary under the statute, can we determine whether section 16-12-103(e) is \"substantially overbroad\" or \"not narrowly drawn.\"    Since this is a facial challenge, we cannot, as appellees seem to suggest, consider the constitutional propriety of the most onerous methods of compliance which a broad reading of subsection (e) could possibly require.

Even if it technically satisfies the prohibition on \"display[ing]\" such material, any method of compliance by which a person knowingly permits minors an unfettered opportunity to peruse the material would elevate form over substance and violate section 16-12-103(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we read \"where minors are or may be invited as part of the general public\" as limiting the clauses specifying the types of premises upon which display is banned.  Thus, if minors are denied access to the premises, booksellers may display such material openly without violating the statute.  Indeed, even a separate room or physical structure that is inaccessible to minors could presumably house open displays of the material.  But we do not read section 16-12-103(e) as requiring such compliance strategies;  thus we need not consider whether the burden on adults' access would be overbroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of the terms \"exhibit,\" \"expose,\" and \"display\"--especially as modified by \"in public\"--strongly suggests that the mere presence of material \"harmful to minors,\" even in that part of premises frequented by minors, would not violate section 16-12-103(e).

Although these methods would prevent actual physical access and perusal by minors--a fundamental aim of the statute--section 16-12-103(e) is not \"readily susceptible\" to an interpretation allowing such a compliance strategy.

Simply put, blinder racks do not \"exhibit, expose, or display in public\" material subject to section 16-12-103(e);  they eliminate the ostentatious and open placement of the materials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>   Therefore, under our reading of section 16-12-103(e), it is not necessary that booksellers physically segregate material placed behind blinder racks from material accessible to minors.  Since the statute is \"readily susceptible\" to such a reading, we need not consider broader interpretations of the requirements for compliance with section 16-12-103(e).  Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. at 397-99, 108 S.Ct. at 645 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>   Placing the relatively small amount of reading material subject to section 16-12-103 behind blinder racks only slightly burdens adults' access to such material.  Blinder racks do not impose a \"substantially overbroad\" regulation on \"conduct plus speech.\"    (See the discussion above at pp. 1499-1500, 1502.)    Adults may peruse and purchase the material without restriction.  Under either the balancing test for regulations on material protected to one group but not another, or the test for the constitutionality of a time, place, and manner regulation, (see the discussion above at p. 1502), the burden on adults' access to material protected as to them is constitutionally insignificant and therefore permissible.  See M.S. News, 721 F.2d at 1288-89 (relying in part on blinder racks exception to uphold statute against facial challenge).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p>V.

In that case, the Eighth Circuit affirmed a district court's determination that \"the strict scrutiny test is the proper standard whenever government classifies individuals' ability to exercise a fundamental right such as speech.\"    602 F.Supp. at 1374.    Our research indicates that only the Colorado Supreme Court, in Tattered Cover, Inc. v. Tooley, 696 P.2d 780, 786 (Colo.1985), has agreed that strict scrutiny applies to a classification involving materials deemed \"harmful to minors.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit held in M.S.

By looking precisely at the conduct implicated by the exemptions to each of the provisions in the Georgia statute, we see that the classification on the right to sell or loan material to minors that is obscene as to them is somewhat distinct from the right to display such material to adults without regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>A.

If the state has a rational basis for concluding that a legitimate interest will be served by the classification, it may create distinctions between the rights of persons and entities to engage in conduct not protected by the Constitution.  San Antonio Indep.  School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 29, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1294-95, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state clearly has an interest in making such material available to minors, if at all, only in an environment free of the commercial pressure to pander to a minor's prurient interest in sex.  See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2635, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973);  Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50, 69, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2452, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality).  Although the exclusion under the Miller test (as adapted in light of Ginsberg, see section 16-12-102(1)(C)) for material with \"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value to minors\" will already exempt most sexually explicit material that one would expect to find in a public library, the library exemption preserves the accessibility of such material to minors for purely educational purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the state has chosen not to exempt all noncommercial entities, or even specific noncommercial entities that could be expected to promote the same interests as libraries, is of no consequence so long as the particular exemption chosen has, as in this case, a rational basis.  If the classification itself is not based upon a suspect distinction such as race,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> the Equal Protection Clause is not offended by an under-inclusive or over-inclusive restriction on one's ability to engage in conduct that is not protected by the Constitution.  United States v. Thornton, 901 F.2d 738 (9th Cir.1990).  Finally, striking down such an exemption would hinder rather than promote robust speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>B.

First, we note that while the Constitution does not protect the distribution to minors of material obscene as to them, creators, publishers, and sellers of such material, as well as adults, are protected from significant or overbroad restrictions on adults' access to materials not obscene as to adults.  Nevertheless, as we discussed above, this protection is not absolute.  Since the state may make such material unavailable to one segment of society--minors--due to its offensiveness and lack of \"serious value\" for them, it may also impose a necessary and moderate amount of burden on the group for whom such material is protected--adults--in an effort to protect young adolescents.  Simply put, the Constitution does not protect unfettered, open placement of such materials in public places accessible to minors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the First Amendment is unoffended by a requirement that erotic material not obscene to adults be placed behind blinder racks, we must consider whether, given the unique nature of the right involved, a state may allow one group of entities--libraries--to operate free of this restriction, while all other entities must adhere to the ban on display.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we note that the plurality in American Mini Theatres found that even a content-based classification of exotic but not obscene material did not violate the Equal Protection Clause since what was ultimately at stake was not the material's total suppression, but only the place where it could be exhibited.  427 U.S. at 71-72, 96 S.Ct. at 2452-53.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>[E]ven though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate....  Whether political oratory or philosophical discussion moves us to applaud or to despise what is said, every schoolchild can understand why our duty to defend the right to speak remains the same.  But few of us would march our sons and daughters off to war to preserve the citizen's right to see \"Specified Sexual Activities\" exhibited in the theaters of our choice.  Even though the First Amendment protects communication in this area from total suppression, we hold that the State may legitimately use the content of these materials as the basis for placing them in a different classification from other motion pictures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 70-71, 96 S.Ct. at 2452.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The classification drawn between libraries and nonlibraries in section 16-12-104 is even less deserving of strict scrutiny since, unlike the zoning ordinance in American Mini Theatres, it turns not on the content of the material presented--the exemption and the ban on display operate only on material obscene as to minors--but on the characteristics of the entity displaying the material--the medium of expression.

As stated above, the under- or over-inclusiveness of the classification does not offend the Equal Protection clause so long as the classification is rationally related to the state's interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">16-12-102 Definitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As used in this part, the term:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>(1) \"Harmful to minors\" means that quality of description or representation, in whatever form, of nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse, when it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>(A) Taken as a whole, predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of minors;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p>(B) Is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p>(C) Is, when taken as a whole, lacking in serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>(2) \"Knowingly\" means having a general knowledge of, or reason to know, or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further inspection or inquiry of both:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p>(A) The character and content of any material described in this part which is reasonably susceptible to examination by the defendant;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>(B) The age of the minor;  provided, however, that an honest mistake shall constitute an excuse from liability in this part if the defendant made a reasonable, bona fide attempt to ascertain the true age of such minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>(3) \"Minor\" means a person less than 18 years of age.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p>(4) \"Sadomasochistic abuse\" means actual or simulated flagellation or torture by or upon a person who is nude, clad in undergarments, a mask or bizarre costume, or the condition of being fettered, bound, or otherwise physically restrained by one so clothed or nude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p>(5) \"Sexual conduct\" means actual or simulated acts of masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse, or physical contact in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification with a person's clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if such be female, breasts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p>(6) \"Sexual excitement\" means the condition of human male or female genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p>(7) \"Sexually explicit nudity\" means a state of undress so as to expose the human male or female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a full opaque covering, or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion thereof below the top of the nipple, or the depiction of covered or uncovered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.

It makes criminal the display of a magazine with an innocuous cover if harmful materials are to be found inside the cover--and this is so whether or not any minor is permitted to view the harmful materials themselves.

The \"secondary effects\" of the regulated speech in Playtime Theatres related to the negative impact of adult theaters or \"regulated uses\" on a neighborhood's environment.  The \"secondary effects\" of materials protected for adults but obscene to minors stem from the impact of in-store access to such materials by minors.  The district court found that the defendants presented no evidence of such \"secondary effects\" from in-store access.  The court reasoned that while in Ginsberg the Supreme Court required only a rational basis for the legislative conclusion that an unlimited right to purchase and view sexually explicit materials would be harmful to minors, since the right of adults to have access to such material is implicated, unlike in Ginsberg, a higher evidentiary standard is required under Playtime Theatres.</p>\n        <p>We agree with the Upper Midwest Booksellers court in finding that the empirical data required to sustain intricate commercial zoning regulations is not necessary to sustain the type of legislation at issue in this case.  780 F.2d at 1397 n. 11.

Compare Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 418, 86 S.Ct. 975, 977, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966) (plurality opinion) and Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77 with Miller, 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2614-15 and O.C.G.A. section 16-12-102(1)(A).</p>\n        <p>The district court suggested that \"[t]he Miller obscenity test does not incorporate the 'taken as a whole' standard into the second part of the test [articulated in Memoirs and Ginsberg ].\"  Webb I, 590 F.Supp. at 688.    The second question in the Memoirs-Ginsberg test is whether the material is \"patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors.\"    Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77.    Cf. Memoirs, 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977 (adult standard).  Similarly, the second test for adult obscenity in Miller is \"whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.\"    Miller, 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615.    Section 16-12-102(1)(B) retains the Ginsberg \"as a whole\" language for the second prong;  therefore, even assuming arguendo that Miller relaxed the standard, the Georgia definition and those like it are either (1) completely consistent with Miller, or (2) narrower than the second prong of the more recent test articulated in Miller.    A state is entirely free to adopt a test for obscenity that is narrower than current First Amendment jurisprudence requires.</p>\n        <p>Our reading of the second prong of the test articulated in Memoirs, see 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977, and in Ginsberg, see 390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77, satisfies us that the Memoirs-Ginsberg test for whether the material is \"patently offensive\" refers specifically to the objectionable portion of the work in question and does not, indeed, cannot logically, be evaluated on the basis of the work as a whole.  That is, whether the sexually explicit portion of the work is \"patently offensive,\"--a necessary condition that is distinct from the other two prongs--does not depend upon or in any way relate to the \"work as a whole\" or to the unobjectionable portions of the allegedly obscene work.  Thus, the absence of the \"as a whole\" language in the Miller test does not work a change in the second prong of the obscenity test.</p>\n        <p>The apparent confusion stems from the fact that the particular articulation of the second test in the statute at issue in Ginsberg asks whether the material was \"patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole.\"    390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77.    The plurality opinion in Memoirs makes no mention of the \"as a whole\" requirement.  See 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977.    It is our view that the phrase \"as a whole\" merely modifies \"community\" and expresses the idea articulated in Memoirs and a later case, Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 107 S.Ct. 1918, 95 L.Ed.2d 439 (1987), that the first and second tests under the pre- and post-Ginsberg (i.e., Miller ) definition of obscenity must be judged with reference to the \"average\" member of the \"whole\" community, whereas the third prong is decided with reference to whether a reasonable member of the community would find serious value in the allegedly obscene material, regardless of whether the \"average\" member of the community or the community \"as a whole\" would find serious value.  Id.;  Hunter v. State, 257 Ga. 571, 573, 361 S.E.2d 787, 789 (1987).  The first and third prongs also require that the allegedly obscene material be viewed \"as a whole.\"    Id.</p>\n        <p>The interpretation that the first two prongs of the Memoirs-Ginsberg definition of obscenity were not changed by Miller in any way material to this appeal is further supported by the fact that the Miller Court did not distinguish the first two prongs of its obscenity test from the Memoirs-Ginsberg test, yet it explicitly declined to adopt the \"utterly without redeeming social value\" test articulated in Memoirs and used in Ginsberg.    The Court instead stated that the state need not prove an \"utter\" lack of value--a \"test that called on the prosecution to prove a negative, i.e., ... a burden virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof,\" 413 U.S. at 22, 93 S.Ct. at 2613, but must instead show that the material, \"taken as a whole,\" lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\"    Id. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615.    In other words, Miller relaxed the third prong of the obscenity test and allowed the government to regulate material that satisfies the other two prongs of the test and has little or no value to society.  We see no reason why the change in section 16-12-102(1)(C) to reflect the Miller standard for serious value should in any way affect the Ginsberg holding that the government may prohibit the sale or distribution of material deemed obscene under the current Supreme Court definition of obscenity for adults, as modified to apply to minors.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The district court seemed to reject this argument in its first order:  \"the Court cannot accept plaintiffs' premise that a single standard for all minors necessarily ... 'restrict[s] older minors to reading or reviewing that which is appropriate for the very young or immature child,' \" Webb I, 590 F.Supp. at 688-89 (footnote omitted), only to embrace it in its second order.  The Webb II court interpreted the statute to cover \" 'the predominant amount of all of the adult reading material' \" because the serious value prong must be applied in light of what \"most\" minors can comprehend, and would cover any work satisfying the first two prongs of the obscenity test while having serious literary value that a ten-year-old could not appreciate, Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1550, or that would not be suitable for a fifth-grade reading list, id. at 1548</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> A seventeen-year-old is of course a member of the group to which \"prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors\" must be applied under Sec. 16-12-102(1)(C).

Curiously, appellees do not appeal the ban on the sale or loan of material defined in section 16-12-102 even though the interpretation that the statute covers material that would hold serious value for older minors would raise serious constitutional overbreadth concerns for both a display ban and a prohibition on sales to older minors.

The Colorado Supreme Court found the statute unconstitutional explicitly on the basis of the trial court's factual finding that the stipulated compliance strategies were not commercially feasible.

See American Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d at 126-27.    In answer to a question certified by the United States Supreme Court in an appeal of the Fourth Circuit's earlier decision that the statute was unconstitutional, see 484 U.S. 383, 108 S.Ct. 636, the Virginia Supreme Court found that the statute would be satisfied by a store policy of prohibiting the perusal of such material by minors whenever observed.

The ban on \"display\" would be but a pyrrhic victory for the legislature and would not serve the purpose of protecting minors if they were allowed simply to reach over the blinder rack and remove the material for unfettered perusal.  We need not specify the steps that must be taken to assure that the opportunity to browse is eliminated.  Since any violation of section 16-12-103 must be done \"knowingly,\" we are confident that a number of options are available that would eliminate the perusal by minors of material placed behind blinder racks without hindering adults' access to such material</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> We recognize that it is possible to read section 16-12-103(e) to require more than the use of blinder racks.  It was suggested at oral argument that in order to satisfy section 16-12-103(e) in an establishment open to minors, material \"harmful to minors\" must be (1) placed behind or underneath the counter, or in some other area not visible to the general public but available to adults upon request;  (2) sealed in plastic and/or fitted with an opaque cover, depending on whether its cover or contents, or both, were subject to the ban, see Sec. 16-12-103(e)(1) and (e)(2);  or (3) placed in a physically separate room or area from that portion of the establishment open to minors.  We make no determination as to whether these suggestions would satisfy the statute</p>\n        <p>Given the district court's factual finding that sales of reading material depend heavily on its \"display\" and availability for perusal by adults, and that requiring adults to request material kept underneath the counter can inhibit choice, these compliance strategies in general seem to impose more burden on adults' access to material protected as to them.  We need not determine whether such burdens would be constitutionally permissible, however, since in a facial challenge the possibility that the Georgia courts could conceivably interpret section 16-12-103(e) more broadly than we do is insufficient to render it invalid.

The court acknowledged in passing dicta that strict scrutiny might be appropriate for evaluating classifications involving material that is obscene for children but not adults.  The Seventh Circuit recently reversed the vagueness holding and affirmed the library exemption without discussing this dicta.  Kucharek v.

Appellees' Brief at 44-45.  See also Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1556 n. 20 (noting \"that the legislature apparently rejected the commercial/noncommercial distinction in amending the Act\").

Outside of \"suspect classification\" Equal Protection analysis, the specific facts upon which the legislature's classification turns do not shed light on the \"fundamentalness\" of the right affected by the classification;  therefore those facts do not influence the level of scrutiny that a court must apply.  Rather, the facts upon which the classification turns help explain both its legislative purpose and the likelihood that the classification will serve this purpose.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> The application of the strict scrutiny standard in cases involving classifications drawn in laws regulating material that is not obscene as to either adults or minors does not conflict with our holding in this case.  In a case relied upon by the Upper Midwest court, for example, Salem Inn, Inc. v. Frank, 522 F.2d 1045, 1049 (2d Cir.1975), the Second Circuit applied strict scrutiny to an ordinance prohibiting topless dancing in bars, restaurants and various other establishments, but allowing such dancing in opera houses, theaters and other places.  See id. at 1046-47 (describing the classification).  The Salem Inn court explicitly pointed out that its decision to apply strict scrutiny turned on the fact that on its face the ordinance reached displays \"of the partially nude female form\" that were not obscene as to even minors and thus constituted completely protected expression:</p>\n        <p>We reemphasize that the ordinance here is directed not at lewdness or obscenity but at nudity which, the [Supreme] Court has reminded us, is not per se 'obscene even as to minors.'</p>\n        <p>Id. at 1049 (citation omitted).  See also Cruz v. Ferre, 571 F.Supp. 125, 134 (S.D.Fla.1983) (strict scrutiny applied to classification drawn between broadcast and cable television in regulation reaching indecent but not obscene material), aff'd, 755 F.2d 1415 (11th Cir.1985).The Ripplinger court agreed with the rational basis test approach in Casado, but placed Tattered Cover, Upper Midwest and Webb II within the category of cases including Salem Inn and Cruz, rather than Casado--although it acknowledged that \"[n]either [Upper Midwest nor Webb II ] is written so narrowly.\"    Ripplinger, 868 F.2d at 1050 n. 7.    We do not agree that the Minneapolis ordinance and the Colorado and Georgia statutes dealt with regulations on \" 'sexually explicit' material rather than 'obscenity' as defined in Miller v.

For example, the state could not draw a classification on the right to somehow deal in such material in an effort to address the effect of such quasi-protected speech on neighborhoods, see American Mini Theatres, or some such other secondary effect of the speech unrelated to the state's interest in protecting the group for whom such material is unprotected--in this case, minors</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The court also found as matter of fact that approximately 500,000 books are in print at any given time and 50,000 new books are published every year;  therefore, booksellers \"cannot hope to read more than a minimal percentage of books that they stock.\"    Id. at 1550.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>b. conclusions of law</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made various legal interpretations regarding the coverage of the statute's \"harmful to minors\" definition and thus the reach of the ban on display.  Although several of its findings were noted as \"findings of fact,\" see id. at 1549-51, the parties agree that \"the district court's determinations as to the scope of the phrase 'harmful to minors,' and its specific applicability to particular works\" are mixed questions of law and fact.  Appellees' Brief at 11-12.  See Appellants' Brief at 11.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   The district court found that \"a significant percentage of an average bookstore's inventory would be barred from display\" by the statute, id. at 1549, and \" 'that the predominate amount of all adult reading material, fiction and nonfiction, could arguably be encompassed within the terms of [the Act].' \"  Id. at 1550 (quoting witness Florence).  The court made these observations on the basis of its interpretation that the \"serious value\" prong of the \"harmful to minors\" definition must be evaluated in light of what \"most minors,\" including the youngest potential readers, could understand and appreciate.

Id. at 1554.    In fact, as the court stated, \"a display statute that applies only to materials inappropriate for minors approaching the age of majority might well survive a constitutional attack.\"    Id. at 1556.

Since the strict scrutiny test is applicable under the Equal Protection Clause to classifications affecting the exercise of fundamental rights, and the government failed to demonstrate that the library exemption promoted a compelling governmental interest through a narrowly drawn classification, the court found the exemption unconstitutional.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Second, we must evaluate the burden on protected speech in light of (1) our interpretation of the amount of material covered and (2) the methods of compliance actually mandated by the ban on display.

The district court considered those potential burdens under the general rubric of \"overbreadth analysis\"--a phrase that courts often use loosely to refer to the propensity of a statute to sweep protected activity into its purview, or unnecessarily to burden protected activity through the collateral effects of its operation on unprotected activity.  There are, however, several distinct types of overbreadth alleged in this case, each of which require separate analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Although the Supreme Court has not decided what effect Miller will have on the Ginsberg formulation of a variable obscenity standard,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> we join other courts in finding that the post-Ginsberg definition of adult obscenity announced in Miller (as modified for determining that which is obscene to minors) does not restrict the scope of materials that a state may regulate.

See American Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d at 127.

In Pope, the Supreme Court construed the test for adult obscenity and held that \"[t]he proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member [of the community] would find serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value in allegedly obscene material, but whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole.\"    Id. at 500-501, 107 S.Ct. at 1921 (footnote omitted).  Hunter v. State, 257 Ga. at 571-72, 361 S.E.2d at 788 (1987).  As interpreted in Pope, the first two prongs of the Miller test utilize \"contemporary community standards,\" whereas \"serious value\" is determined not with reference to \"majority approval,\" but on the basis of whether any reasonable person would find serious value--even if the community as a whole, or the \"average\" member of the community, would not.  481 U.S. at 500, 107 S.Ct. at 1920-21.    See the discussion in footnote 18 above.  Pope echoes the fundamental idea that, although \"We the People\" are sovereign under the Constitution, the Founders added the Bill of Rights as a bulwark against the \"tyranny of the majority.\"    If, like the other two prongs of the test for obscenity, we judge \"serious value\" according to the \"degree of local acceptance [the work in question] has won,\" id. at 500, 107 S.Ct. at 1921, then we would compromise the First Amendment's protection against majoritarian pressure to stifle disfavored expression.

The tremendous volume of material published and the practical inability of booksellers to gain more than a synoptic familiarity with the material they order from publishers would, according to the court, force booksellers to err on the side of caution by \"refusing to order [for display] any book with a suggestive cover or the works of an author known for sexually explicit prose.\"    Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1550.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that the burden on booksellers would be far less than the district court suggests.  First, since only a minimal number of works will have serious value for reasonable adults but not for reasonable minors, including older minors, the statute will not increase to any great extent the screening that stores must do in order to comply with Georgia's general obscenity statute, O.C.G.A. Sec. 16-12-80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>   Second, despite the increased opportunity to evaluate the fitness of material at the point of sale to minors, as opposed to ordering from a publisher for display sales,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> the display ban will only incrementally increase the screening necessary for booksellers to comply with the prohibition on the sale of \"harmful\" material to minors, a burden the district found constitutional under Ginsberg--a holding that appellees do not appeal.  Finally, section 16-12-103(e) only prohibits displays that are made \"knowingly.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   For these reasons, we find that section 16-12-102's definition does not render the display ban substantially overbroad due to indeterminacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

As we interpret it, the statute covers only material unprotected to minors and is not so indeterminate that it unduly chills protected expression.  Since in the real world material cannot be made \"invisible\" to minors without hampering to a certain extent adults' access to it, we must analyze the compliance strategy section 16-12-103(e) actually mandates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statutory \"breadth\" that we analyze in this context refers to the degree of practical inconvenience actually required by the language of subsection (e).  Only by focusing on that which the statute requires for compliance with the display ban, rather than on every compliance strategy that is sufficient but not necessary under the statute, can we determine whether section 16-12-103(e) is \"substantially overbroad\" or \"not narrowly drawn.\"    Since this is a facial challenge, we cannot, as appellees seem to suggest, consider the constitutional propriety of the most onerous methods of compliance which a broad reading of subsection (e) could possibly require.

Thus, if minors are denied access to the premises, booksellers may display such material openly without violating the statute.  Indeed, even a separate room or physical structure that is inaccessible to minors could presumably house open displays of the material.  But we do not read section 16-12-103(e) as requiring such compliance strategies;  thus we need not consider whether the burden on adults' access would be overbroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of the terms \"exhibit,\" \"expose,\" and \"display\"--especially as modified by \"in public\"--strongly suggests that the mere presence of material \"harmful to minors,\" even in that part of premises frequented by minors, would not violate section 16-12-103(e).

We disagree.  Although these methods would prevent actual physical access and perusal by minors--a fundamental aim of the statute--section 16-12-103(e) is not \"readily susceptible\" to an interpretation allowing such a compliance strategy.  Unlike the Virginia statute which the Fourth Circuit recently upheld, section 16-12-103(e) does not contain language that narrows the common usage of the word \"display\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a>   Placing the material entirely in open sight in an establishment \"where minors are or may be invited as part of the general public\" would violate section 16-12-103(e) despite a \"nonperusal\" policy or signs indicating that certain otherwise open areas are off-limits to minors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also suggest that the statute is satisfied by placing material \"harmful to minors\" behind devices commonly referred to as \"blinder racks\" or shelves which cover at least the lower two-thirds of material that would otherwise be exposed to view.  Id. at 41-43.  See M.S. News, 721 F.2d at 1287 (briefly describing \"blinder racks\").  We agree.  Simply put, blinder racks do not \"exhibit, expose, or display in public\" material subject to section 16-12-103(e);  they eliminate the ostentatious and open placement of the materials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>   Therefore, under our reading of section 16-12-103(e), it is not necessary that booksellers physically segregate material placed behind blinder racks from material accessible to minors.  Since the statute is \"readily susceptible\" to such a reading, we need not consider broader interpretations of the requirements for compliance with section 16-12-103(e).  Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. at 397-99, 108 S.Ct. at 645 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>   Placing the relatively small amount of reading material subject to section 16-12-103 behind blinder racks only slightly burdens adults' access to such material.  Blinder racks do not impose a \"substantially overbroad\" regulation on \"conduct plus speech.\"    (See the discussion above at pp. 1499-1500, 1502.)    Adults may peruse and purchase the material without restriction.  Under either the balancing test for regulations on material protected to one group but not another, or the test for the constitutionality of a time, place, and manner regulation, (see the discussion above at p. 1502), the burden on adults' access to material protected as to them is constitutionally insignificant and therefore permissible.

By looking precisely at the conduct implicated by the exemptions to each of the provisions in the Georgia statute, we see that the classification on the right to sell or loan material to minors that is obscene as to them is somewhat distinct from the right to display such material to adults without regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>A.

First, we note that while the Constitution does not protect the distribution to minors of material obscene as to them, creators, publishers, and sellers of such material, as well as adults, are protected from significant or overbroad restrictions on adults' access to materials not obscene as to adults.  Nevertheless, as we discussed above, this protection is not absolute.  Since the state may make such material unavailable to one segment of society--minors--due to its offensiveness and lack of \"serious value\" for them, it may also impose a necessary and moderate amount of burden on the group for whom such material is protected--adults--in an effort to protect young adolescents.  Simply put, the Constitution does not protect unfettered, open placement of such materials in public places accessible to minors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the First Amendment is unoffended by a requirement that erotic material not obscene to adults be placed behind blinder racks, we must consider whether, given the unique nature of the right involved, a state may allow one group of entities--libraries--to operate free of this restriction, while all other entities must adhere to the ban on display.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we note that the plurality in American Mini Theatres found that even a content-based classification of exotic but not obscene material did not violate the Equal Protection Clause since what was ultimately at stake was not the material's total suppression, but only the place where it could be exhibited.  427 U.S. at 71-72, 96 S.Ct. at 2452-53.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>[E]ven though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate....

But few of us would march our sons and daughters off to war to preserve the citizen's right to see \"Specified Sexual Activities\" exhibited in the theaters of our choice.

Although on this appeal we should assume that Georgia would adopt a narrow construction of the section, any such narrowing construction would have to be a reasonable one in the light of the words of the statute.

It makes criminal the display of a magazine with an innocuous cover if harmful materials are to be found inside the cover--and this is so whether or not any minor is permitted to view the harmful materials themselves.

The \"secondary effects\" of the regulated speech in Playtime Theatres related to the negative impact of adult theaters or \"regulated uses\" on a neighborhood's environment.  The \"secondary effects\" of materials protected for adults but obscene to minors stem from the impact of in-store access to such materials by minors.  The district court found that the defendants presented no evidence of such \"secondary effects\" from in-store access.  The court reasoned that while in Ginsberg the Supreme Court required only a rational basis for the legislative conclusion that an unlimited right to purchase and view sexually explicit materials would be harmful to minors, since the right of adults to have access to such material is implicated, unlike in Ginsberg, a higher evidentiary standard is required under Playtime Theatres.</p>\n        <p>We agree with the Upper Midwest Booksellers court in finding that the empirical data required to sustain intricate commercial zoning regulations is not necessary to sustain the type of legislation at issue in this case.  780 F.2d at 1397 n. 11.

The second question in the Memoirs-Ginsberg test is whether the material is \"patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors.\"    Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77.    Cf. Memoirs, 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977 (adult standard).  Similarly, the second test for adult obscenity in Miller is \"whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.\"    Miller, 413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615.    Section 16-12-102(1)(B) retains the Ginsberg \"as a whole\" language for the second prong;  therefore, even assuming arguendo that Miller relaxed the standard, the Georgia definition and those like it are either (1) completely consistent with Miller, or (2) narrower than the second prong of the more recent test articulated in Miller.    A state is entirely free to adopt a test for obscenity that is narrower than current First Amendment jurisprudence requires.</p>\n        <p>Our reading of the second prong of the test articulated in Memoirs, see 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977, and in Ginsberg, see 390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77, satisfies us that the Memoirs-Ginsberg test for whether the material is \"patently offensive\" refers specifically to the objectionable portion of the work in question and does not, indeed, cannot logically, be evaluated on the basis of the work as a whole.  That is, whether the sexually explicit portion of the work is \"patently offensive,\"--a necessary condition that is distinct from the other two prongs--does not depend upon or in any way relate to the \"work as a whole\" or to the unobjectionable portions of the allegedly obscene work.  Thus, the absence of the \"as a whole\" language in the Miller test does not work a change in the second prong of the obscenity test.</p>\n        <p>The apparent confusion stems from the fact that the particular articulation of the second test in the statute at issue in Ginsberg asks whether the material was \"patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole.\"    390 U.S. at 633, 88 S.Ct. at 1276-77.    The plurality opinion in Memoirs makes no mention of the \"as a whole\" requirement.  See 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S.Ct. at 977.    It is our view that the phrase \"as a whole\" merely modifies \"community\" and expresses the idea articulated in Memoirs and a later case, Pope v. Illinois, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111877\"><a href=\"/opinion/111877/pope-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111877\"><a href=\"/opinion/111877/pope-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span> (1987), that the first and second tests under the pre- and post-Ginsberg (i.e., Miller ) definition of obscenity must be judged with reference to the \"average\" member of the \"whole\" community, whereas the third prong is decided with reference to whether a reasonable member of the community would find serious value in the allegedly obscene material, regardless of whether the \"average\" member of the community or the community \"as a whole\" would find serious value.  Id.;  Hunter v. State, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1311446\"><a href=\"/opinion/1311446/hunter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1311446\"><a href=\"/opinion/1311446/hunter-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 789 (1987).  The first and third prongs also require that the allegedly obscene material be viewed \"as a whole.\"    Id.</p>\n        <p>The interpretation that the first two prongs of the Memoirs-Ginsberg definition of obscenity were not changed by Miller in any way material to this appeal is further supported by the fact that the Miller Court did not distinguish the first two prongs of its obscenity test from the Memoirs-Ginsberg test, yet it explicitly declined to adopt the \"utterly without redeeming social value\" test articulated in Memoirs and used in Ginsberg.    The Court instead stated that the state need not prove an \"utter\" lack of value--a \"test that called on the prosecution to prove a negative, i.e., ... a burden virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof,\" 413 U.S. at 22, 93 S.Ct. at 2613, but must instead show that the material, \"taken as a whole,\" lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\"    Id. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615.    In other words, Miller relaxed the third prong of the obscenity test and allowed the government to regulate material that satisfies the other two prongs of the test and has little or no value to society.  We see no reason why the change in section 16-12-102(1)(C) to reflect the Miller standard for serious value should in any way affect the Ginsberg holding that the government may prohibit the sale or distribution of material deemed obscene under the current Supreme Court definition of obscenity for adults, as modified to apply to minors.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The district court seemed to reject this argument in its first order:  \"the Court cannot accept plaintiffs' premise that a single standard for all minors necessarily ... 'restrict[s] older minors to reading or reviewing that which is appropriate for the very young or immature child,' \" Webb I, 590 F.Supp. at 688-89 (footnote omitted), only to embrace it in its second order.  The Webb II court interpreted the statute to cover \" 'the predominant amount of all of the adult reading material' \" because the serious value prong must be applied in light of what \"most\" minors can comprehend, and would cover any work satisfying the first two prongs of the obscenity test while having serious literary value that a ten-year-old could not appreciate, Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1550, or that would not be suitable for a fifth-grade reading list, id. at 1548</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> A seventeen-year-old is of course a member of the group to which \"prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors\" must be applied under Sec. 16-12-102(1)(C).

Curiously, appellees do not appeal the ban on the sale or loan of material defined in section 16-12-102 even though the interpretation that the statute covers material that would hold serious value for older minors would raise serious constitutional overbreadth concerns for both a display ban and a prohibition on sales to older minors.

The ban on \"display\" would be but a pyrrhic victory for the legislature and would not serve the purpose of protecting minors if they were allowed simply to reach over the blinder rack and remove the material for unfettered perusal.  We need not specify the steps that must be taken to assure that the opportunity to browse is eliminated.  Since any violation of section 16-12-103 must be done \"knowingly,\" we are confident that a number of options are available that would eliminate the perusal by minors of material placed behind blinder racks without hindering adults' access to such material</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> We recognize that it is possible to read section 16-12-103(e) to require more than the use of blinder racks.  It was suggested at oral argument that in order to satisfy section 16-12-103(e) in an establishment open to minors, material \"harmful to minors\" must be (1) placed behind or underneath the counter, or in some other area not visible to the general public but available to adults upon request;  (2) sealed in plastic and/or fitted with an opaque cover, depending on whether its cover or contents, or both, were subject to the ban, see Sec. 16-12-103(e)(1) and (e)(2);  or (3) placed in a physically separate room or area from that portion of the establishment open to minors.  We make no determination as to whether these suggestions would satisfy the statute</p>\n        <p>Given the district court's factual finding that sales of reading material depend heavily on its \"display\" and availability for perusal by adults, and that requiring adults to request material kept underneath the counter can inhibit choice, these compliance strategies in general seem to impose more burden on adults' access to material protected as to them.  We need not determine whether such burdens would be constitutionally permissible, however, since in a facial challenge the possibility that the Georgia courts could conceivably interpret section 16-12-103(e) more broadly than we do is insufficient to render it invalid.

The court acknowledged in passing dicta that strict scrutiny might be appropriate for evaluating classifications involving material that is obscene for children but not adults.  The Seventh Circuit recently reversed the vagueness holding and affirmed the library exemption without discussing this dicta.  Kucharek v. Hanaway, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540850\"><a href=\"/opinion/540850/william-h-kucharek-shangri-la-enterprises-inc-doing-business-as-denmark/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1990)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn35\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35_ref\">35</a>\n        <p> Although the M.S. News court referred to the exemption in that case as generally turning on the commercial/noncommercial distinction, the Wichita ordinance at issue did not refer explicitly to \"commercial\" use;  instead, it provided an affirmative defense if the material or performance was \"displayed, presented or disseminated to a minor at a recognized and established school, church, museum, medical clinic, hospital, public library, governmental agency, quasi-governmental agency and [if done] for a bona fide governmental, educational or scientific purpose.\"    Code of the City of Wichita Sec. 5.68.156(3) (1979).  See M.S. News, 721 F.2d at 1291</p>\n        <p>Appellees make much of the fact that section 16-12-104 does not turn specifically on whether the material is distributed, exhibited, or displayed commercially rather than noncommercially.  Appellees' Brief at 44-45.  See also Webb II, 643 F.Supp. at 1556 n. 20 (noting \"that the legislature apparently rejected the commercial/noncommercial distinction in amending the Act\").  Appellants respond that \"[e]ven though the Georgia Act does not on its face exempt as many non-commercial distributions or displays as did the Wichita ordinance [in M.S. News], it is clear that the exempted conduct under the Georgia law is in fact non-commercial.\"    Appellants' Brief at 55.  Outside of \"suspect classification\" Equal Protection analysis, the specific facts upon which the legislature's classification turns do not shed light on the \"fundamentalness\" of the right affected by the classification;  therefore those facts do not influence the level of scrutiny that a court must apply.  Rather, the facts upon which the classification turns help explain both its legislative purpose and the likelihood that the classification will serve this purpose.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn36\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36_ref\">36</a>\n        <p> The application of the strict scrutiny standard in cases involving classifications drawn in laws regulating material that is not obscene as to either adults or minors does not conflict with our holding in this case.

See id. at 1046-47 (describing the classification).  The Salem Inn court explicitly pointed out that its decision to apply strict scrutiny turned on the fact that on its face the ordinance reached displays \"of the partially nude female form\" that were not obscene as to even minors and thus constituted completely protected expression:</p>\n        <p>We reemphasize that the ordinance here is directed not at lewdness or obscenity but at nudity which, the [Supreme] Court has reminded us, is not per se 'obscene even as to minors.'</p>\n        <p>Id. at 1049 (citation omitted).

For example, the state could not draw a classification on the right to somehow deal in such material in an effort to address the effect of such quasi-protected speech on neighborhoods, see American Mini Theatres, or some such other secondary effect of the speech unrelated to the state's interest in protecting the group for whom such material is unprotected--in this case, minors</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
