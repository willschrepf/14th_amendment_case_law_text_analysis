See generally Third\n\nAmended Complaint and Jury Demand (“3d Am. Compl.”). Currently before the Court is the\n\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint (“Pl.’s Mot.”). Upon careful\n\nconsideration of the parties’ submissions, 1 the Court concludes for the following reasons that it\n\nmust grant in part and deny in part the plaintiff’s motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in reaching its\ndecision: (1) the Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth\nAmended Complaint (“Pl.’s Mem.”); (2) the Fourth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand (redlined version)\n(“Proposed 4th Am. Compl.”); (3) the Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth\nAmended Complaint (“Defs.’ Opp’n”); and (4) the Plaintiff’s Reply to Defendant District of Columbia and Daniel\nCipullo’s Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint and Request for Hearing\n(“Pl.’s Reply”).\n\f                                       I.    BACKGROUND\n\n       Defendant Cipullo is the supervisor of Tenisha Jiggetts, the plaintiff’s wife, who is an\n\nAttorney-Advisor for the Criminal Division, 3d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 9–10, and the plaintiff is a retired\n\npolice officer for the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”), id. ¶ 51. On November 6, 2014,\n\nthe plaintiff and defendant Cipullo encountered each other on the sidewalk between the Superior\n\nCourt and MPD headquarters after the plaintiff’s wife had told the plaintiff that defendant\n\nCipullo had obstructed her ability to leave her office. See id. ¶¶ 16, 18. The plaintiff alleges that\n\ndefendant Cipullo thereafter made false statements to an MPD official, claiming that the plaintiff\n\nthreatened him during the encounter. See id. ¶¶ 17, 20–21. The plaintiff was not arrested on the\n\nday that defendant Cipullo initially made his complaint, see id. ¶ 24, but, after defendant Cipullo\n\nallegedly further pursued the matter, see id. ¶¶ 38–39, the plaintiff was arrested and detained for\n\napproximately ten hours on November 21, 2014, see id. ¶¶ 39–42, after being charged with\n\nfelony threatening to kidnap or injure a person in violation of D.C. Code § 22-1810 (2012), id. ¶\n\n42. The charge was subsequently dismissed with prejudice on September 18, 2015. Id. ¶ 56.\n\n       The plaintiff initiated this action on November 3, 2015, see Complaint at 1, and on\n\nNovember 6, 2017, the plaintiff filed his motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, see\n\nPl.’s Mot. at 1. The plaintiff’s Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint adds facts that the plaintiff\n\ncontends were revealed through discovery, as well as two new claims: (1) a 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nclaim, alleging violations under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments; and, in the\n\nalternative, (2) a Bivens action, alleging violations under the same three constitutional\n\namendments. See Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 138–76. Discovery closed on December 18,\n\n2017, see Order (Nov. 17, 2017), ECF No. 47, and the Court held a hearing on the plaintiff’s\n\nmotion on December 21, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                                       II.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), the Court “should freely give leave” to a\n\nparty to amend its pleading “when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). While the\n\nCourt has sole discretion to grant or deny leave to amend, “[l]eave to amend a [pleading] should\n\nbe freely given in the absence of undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice to the opposing party,\n\nrepeated failure to cure deficiencies, or futility.” Richardson v. United States, 193 F.3d 545,\n\n548–49 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)); see also James\n\nMadison Ltd. ex rel. Hecht v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“Courts may deny a\n\nmotion to amend a complaint as futile . . . if the proposed claim would not survive a motion to\n\ndismiss.”). “The burden is on the defendant[s] to show that leave to file an amended complaint\n\nshould be denied.” Afram v. United Food & Commercial Workers Unions & Participating\n\nEmp’rs Health & Welfare Fund, 958 F. Supp. 2d 275, 278 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n                                                III.     ANALYSIS\n\n         The defendants oppose the plaintiff’s motion for leave to again amend his complaint on\n\nthe grounds that (1) the plaintiff failed to earlier cure deficiencies in his complaint, (2) undue\n\ndelay and prejudice, and (3) futility. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 1. 2\n\nA.       The Plaintiff’s Failure to Earlier Cure Deficiencies Argument\n\n         In their written opposition, the defendants argue that the Court should deny the plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for leave to amend because he does not explain “why he failed to include the [proposed]\n\n\n2\n  At the hearing on the motion, the defendants seemingly abandoned their first two grounds and stated that futility\nwas the primary basis of their opposition. However, even if the first two grounds were not abandoned, the Court\nconcludes that the defendants’ positions on these two grounds lack merit. The defendants also argue that the\nplaintiff’s motion should be denied because he “failed to seek leave . . . to add new claims.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 4. This\nargument plainly lacks merit not only because the defendants fail to cite any legal authority to support their\nproposition that the motion should be denied on that basis, see id., but also because the plaintiff’s motion is titled as\na “Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint,” and in that motion, the plaintiff specifically “requests\nleave to amend his Third Amended Complaint to add additional facts and claims as set forth in the [Proposed]\nFourth Amended Complaint,” Pl.’s Mot. at 1.\n\n\n                                                           3\n\famendments . . . in his previously filed Complaints.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 4. The defendants note\n\nthat at the status conference held on August 31, 2017, the Court ordered the plaintiff to file his\n\nthird amended complaint on or before September 22, 2017, see id. at 5; see also Order (Aug. 31,\n\n2017), ECF No. 40, which the plaintiff did, but “[i]n that Complaint, [the p]laintiff brought no\n\nnew claims,” even though “there was nothing that prevented [him] from bringing his proposed\n\nnew claims,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 5. According to the defendants, “by his own admission, [the\n\np]laintiff relies on facts known to him or that should have been known to him when he sought to\n\ncure the original [Complaint] and Second Amended Complaint[].” Id. The plaintiff argues in\n\nresponse that, as of the date he filed his reply on November 28, 2017, the “[d]efendants ha[d] not\n\nresponded to most of th[e] discovery” the plaintiff had submitted to them, but that recent\n\ndiscovery has revealed the actions that defendant Cipullo took “under the authority of his\n\nposition with the [ ] Superior Court,” which prompted the plaintiff’s request to pursue the\n\nproposed constitutional claims. See Pl.’s Reply at 4; see also id. at 6 (“[D]iscovery is ongoing,\n\nand [the plaintiff] seeks leave to amend the complaint to conform to information learned in\n\ndiscovery so that the case may be tried on its merits.”).\n\n       At the motion hearing, the plaintiff clarified that the deposition of MPD Commander\n\nWilliam J. Fitzgerald, which was taken on October 17, 2017, see Pl.’s Reply, Exhibit (“Ex.”) 1\n\n(Transcript of Commander William J. Fitzgerald (“Fitzgerald Dep.”)), revealed how defendant\n\nCipullo allegedly used the color of his office to have the plaintiff arrested and charged, and the\n\nplaintiff promptly filed his motion for leave less than three weeks later, see Pl.’s Mot. at 1. The\n\ndefendants argued in response that Commander Fitzgerald’s deposition did not reveal any new\n\nfacts, but was based upon documents that the plaintiff already had in his possession, because\n\nCommander Fitzgerald did not have an independent recollection of the relevant events. The\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fdefendants, however, did not submit those documents to the Court to support their assertion that\n\nthe plaintiff’s proposed Fourth Amended Complaint “relies on facts known to him or that should\n\nhave been known to him when he sought to cure the original [Complaint] and Second Amended\n\nComplaint[].” Defs.’ Opp’n at 5. Therefore, the Court is unable to evaluate their assertion that\n\nthe plaintiff already knew the facts forming the basis for his constitutional claims, and thus, the\n\ndefendants have failed to meet their burden “to show that leave to file an amended complaint\n\nshould be denied” on this basis. See Afram, 958 F. Supp. 2d at 278. Moreover, even if the\n\nplaintiff already knew or should have known about the relevant facts that purportedly support his\n\nconstitutional claims, the defendants are unable to show any undue prejudice resulting from the\n\nfiling of another amended complaint. See infra Part III.B.\n\nB.     The Undue Delay and Undue Prejudice to the Defendants Argument\n\n       The defendants claim that they will be “unfair[ly] disadvantage[d]” and “blindside[d]” if\n\nthe Court grants the plaintiff’s motion because they will “have to expend additional efforts and\n\nresources” to address the proposed Fourth Amended Complaint and they “seek closure” in this\n\ncase, which “has been pending for just over two years.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 6. The defendants fail\n\nto cite any legal authority to support their proposition that the plaintiff’s motion should be denied\n\non these bases. The plaintiff argues in response to the defendants’ position that “[m]oving to\n\namend the complaint before the close of discovery does not constitute undue delay[, and u]nder\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), a party may amend the complaint to conform to the\n\nevidence at trial or even after trial.” Pl.’s Reply at 6 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)). Moreover, the\n\nplaintiff claims that his amendments will not “delay this case in any way,” Pl.’s Mem. at 2, and\n\nat the hearing on the motion for leave to amend, the plaintiff’s counsel stated that he would not\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fseek additional discovery if he is permitted to assert the plaintiff’s new claims. Moreover, the\n\ndefendants do not contend that additional discovery will be necessary either.\n\n        Courts liberally assess whether Rule 15 motions should be granted, only denying them on\n\nthe basis of undue delay when the plaintiffs waited many years before seeking amendments, after\n\ndiscovery had already concluded or summary judgment had already been granted. See, e.g.,\n\nWilliamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 810 F.2d 243, 247 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n\n(affirming the district court’s denial of leave to amend given that six years had passed since the\n\nplaintiff had raised the issue underlying his proposed claim and summary judgment had already\n\nbeen granted); Becker v. District of Columbia, 258 F.R.D. 182, 184–85 (D.D.C. 2009) (denying\n\nleave to amend because of a five-year delay and discovery had already closed); cf. Barkley v.\n\nU.S. Marshals Serv. ex rel. Hylton, 766 F.3d 25, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (reversing the district\n\ncourt’s denial of leave to amend, even though “[t]he district court ha[d] endured a multitude of\n\nmotions and amendments to the pleadings in th[e] case over the course of more than a decade,”\n\nin part because “[t]he plaintiffs already in the case had raised substantially the same [ ] claims,\n\nno summary judgment motion had been granted, and no discovery had taken place as to [certain]\n\nclaims”). Therefore, a two-year delay between the plaintiff’s initiation of this suit and his\n\nmotion for leave to amend does not constitute undue delay, especially given that discovery was\n\nstill ongoing as of the date the plaintiff filed his motion.\n\n        As for the defendants’ argument regarding their need to “expend additional efforts and\n\nresources” if the plaintiff’s motion is granted, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 6, Judge Friedman recently\n\nrejected a similar argument in a case that had been pending for over four years, noting:\n\n        “Undue prejudice is not mere harm to the non-movant but a denial of the\n        opportunity to present facts or evidence which would have been offered had the\n        amendment been timely.” Does I through III v. District of Columbia, 815 F. Supp.\n        2d 208, 215 (D.D.C. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[A]n amendment\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\f       is not automatically deemed prejudicial if it causes the non-movant to\n       expend additional resources. Any amendment will require some expenditure of\n       resources on the part of the non-moving party. ‘Inconvenience or additional cost\n       to a defendant is not necessarily undue prejudice.’” United States ex rel. Westrick\n       v. Second Chance Body Armor, Inc., 301 F.R.D. 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting City\n       of Moundridge v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 250 F.R.D. 1, 6–7 (D.D.C. 2008)). Indeed,\n       “if [a] court were to employ a policy of denying [ ] leave to amend in every\n       situation where an amended [pleading] may result in additional discovery or\n       expense, then [the] court would fail to abide by the legal standard of granting leave\n       ‘freely . . . when justice so requires.’” Hisler v. Gallaudet Univ., 206 F.R.D. 11, 14\n       (D.D.C. 2002) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)).\n\nUnited States v. All Assets Held at Bank Julius, 229 F. Supp. 3d 62, 69 (D.D.C. 2017)\n\n(alterations in original) (holding that the United States would not suffer an undue burden if the\n\nCourt were to grant the defendant’s motion to amend his answer because “[t]he voluminous\n\namount of material already adduced in discovery on th[e] issue [underlying the proposed\n\namendment] . . . is strong evidence that additional discovery [as a result of the amendment]\n\nw[ould] not be nearly as burdensome as the United States suggests”). And, given that the\n\nplaintiff is not seeking to extend discovery and the defendants do not contend that they will need\n\nadditional discovery if the plaintiff is permitted to assert his new claims,, the defendants cannot\n\nshow that they will be unduly prejudiced on that basis.\n\n       At the hearing on the motion to amend, the defendants’ counsel stated that they would\n\nalso suffer undue prejudice because the plaintiffs’ proposed claims are futile, but that is a\n\nseparate ground for denying the plaintiffs’ motion, not a type of undue prejudice. See\n\nRichardson, 193 F.3d at 548–49 (stating that leave to amend “should be freely given in the\n\nabsence of . . . undue prejudice to the opposing party . . . , or futility” (emphasis added)).\n\nTherefore, the Court concludes that the defendants have not shown that they will suffer undue\n\nprejudice if the plaintiff is permitted to again amend his complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fC.      Futility\n\n        1.      The Proposed Bivens Claim\n\n        “Under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S.\n\n388, 395–97 (1971), a[ ] plaintiff may pursue a lawsuit for damages against federal officials in\n\ntheir personal capacities for constitutional violations.” Jordan v. District of Columbia, 113 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 278, 280 (D.D.C. 2015). The plaintiff’s Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint asserts a\n\nBivens action “to redress the deprivation under color of statute, ordinance, regulation, policy,\n\ncustom, practice or usage of a right, privilege and immunity secured to the plaintiff by the Fourth\n\nand / or Fifth [ ] and / or Fourteenth Amendment[s] to the United States Constitution.” Proposed\n\n4th Am. Compl. ¶ 158. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that “[d]efendant Cipullo . . . deprived\n\n[him] of clearly established rights protected by” these three amendments, id. ¶ 159, or, in the\n\nalternative, “deprived [him] of his liberty when [defendant] Cipullo used his position and federal\n\nauthority as a Director of the . . . Criminal Division to cause [the plaintiff] to be detained and\n\narrested in violation of his rights to due process and to be free from unreasonable restrictions on\n\nhis liberty interests,” id. ¶ 161; see also id. ¶ 163 (“In the alternative, absent his authority as a\n\nfederal actor, [defendant] Cipullo would not have been able to influence the police officers and\n\nprosecutors to take action against [the plaintiff] in violation of his constitutional rights.”).\n\n        The defendants argue that defendant Cipullo is not a federal actor, and cite D.C. Code\n\n§ 11-1726(b)(1) (2011) in support of this proposition. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 6. That section of the\n\nD.C. Code, titled “Compensation and benefits for court personnel,” states that “[n]onjudicial\n\nemployees of the District of Columbia courts shall be treated as employees of the Federal\n\nGovernment solely for purposes of any of the following provisions of title 5, United States\n\nCode,” which concern workers’ compensation, retirement benefits, and life and health insurance\n\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fand other related benefits. See D.C. Code § 11-1726(b)(1). The plaintiff argues in response that\n\nunless the defendants are conceding that defendant Cipullo is not a federal employee, he “is\n\npermitted to plead in the alternative under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(d) and has done\n\nexactly that.” Pl.’s Reply at 12. The plaintiff cites Brown v. Short, 729 F. Supp. 2d 125 (D.D.C.\n\n2010), for the proposition that whether § 1983 or Bivens is applicable to certain District of\n\nColumbia employees is “a close question that poses complex legal issues.” Pl.’s Reply at 12\n\n(quoting Brown, 729 F. Supp. 2d at 132).\n\n        To the Court’s knowledge, the District of Columbia statute cited by the defendants has\n\nbeen cited only in two cases, both concerning labor disputes. See Concerned Court Emps. v.\n\nPolansky, 478 A.2d 1096, 1098 (D.C. 1984) (holding that the actions of the Executive Officer of\n\nthe District of Columbia Courts complied with § 11-1726(b)(1) in setting compensation levels\n\nfor nonjudicial employees); Ass’n of Court Reporters of Superior Court v. Superior Court for\n\nDist. of Columbia, 424 F. Supp. 90, 93–94 (D.D.C. 1976) (holding that the overtime pay\n\nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act did not apply to Superior Court court reporters). In\n\nthe Court’s view, the statute is not dispositive on the issue of whether Superior Court employees\n\nlike defendant Cipullo should be considered state or federal officials in regards to claims alleging\n\nconstitutional violations.\n\n        Usually, most District of Columbia officials are not treated as federal officials subject to\n\na Bivens action. See, e.g., Jordan, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 281 (dismissing the plaintiff’s Bivens\n\naction against the Mayor of the District of Columbia because the Mayor is not a federal official\n\nor employee). Although the Superior Court is distinct from other District of Columbia entities\n\nbecause it “is a congressionally created court and, thus, ‘federal’ in its creation,” it is often\n\ntreated like a state court for purposes of abstention, removal, and certiorari. See Handy v. Shaw,\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fBransford, Veilleux & Roth, 325 F.3d 346, 351 & n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (treating a Superior Court\n\nproceeding as a parallel state court proceeding for purposes of the Colorado River abstention\n\ndoctrine); cf. Johnson v. Gov’t of Dist. of Columbia, 584 F. Supp. 2d 83, 93 (D.D.C. 2008)\n\n(“Thus, it is unclear—and the Court need not determine—the degree to which the District of\n\nColumbia Superior Court and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals can truly be considered\n\n‘integral’ to the District of Columbia government . . . .”). In Johnson, Judge Collyer held that the\n\nDistrict of Columbia could not be held liable for the actions of the United States Marshal for the\n\nSuperior Court because “[t]he Superior Court Marshal’s authority stems directly from the\n\nrelevant provisions of the [federal] Anti-Drug Abuse Act, as it does for every other United States\n\nMarshal.” 584 F. Supp. 2d at 92. And in Brown, Judge Collyer held that the constitutional\n\nclaims asserted against a former United States Marshals Service Detention Security Offer\n\nworking in the Superior Court should be asserted under Bivens, not § 1983, because the Marshal\n\n“was following U.S. Marshal policy without regard to the order of a [Superior Court] judicial\n\nofficer[, and i]n this position, she was a federal actor analogous to the U.S. Marshal[] for the\n\nSuperior Court, to whom [§] 1983 does not apply.” 729 F. Supp. 2d at 133.\n\n       Because whether defendant Cipullo was allegedly acting under color of federal as\n\nopposed to state law in his position of Director of the Criminal Division of the Superior Court is\n\nnot clear to the Court given the limited factual record available to it at this stage of the case, and\n\nbecause the plaintiff is permitted by the Rules to allege claims in the alternative, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 8(d)(2) (“A party may set out [two] or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or\n\nhypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones.”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3)\n\n(“A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.”),\n\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fthe Court is unable to conclude at this stage of the litigation whether the plaintiff’s Bivens claim\n\nis futile.\n\n         2.     The Proposed Claims Asserting Violations of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n         As noted earlier, the plaintiff’s Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint asserts both § 1983\n\nand Bivens claims “to redress the deprivation under color of statute, ordinance, regulation,\n\npolicy, custom, practice or usage of a right, privilege and immunity secured to the plaintiff by the\n\nFourth and / or Fifth [ ] and / or Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”\n\nProposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 139, 158. The defendants argue that the plaintiff cannot assert\n\nclaims for violations of his Fourteenth Amendment rights because this amendment only applies\n\nto states, not the District of Columbia. Defs.’ Opp’n at 7. The plaintiff appears to concede this\n\npoint, stating that “[t]he applicability of the Fourteenth Amendment is irrelevant to the fact that\n\n[the p]laintiff has plead[ed] sufficient facts to create [a] cognizable claim that he was deprived of\n\nhis right to due process under the Fifth Amendment.” Pl.’s Reply at 12.\n\n         The Court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff’s proposed claims asserting\n\nviolations of the Fourteenth Amendment are futile because the Supreme Court made clear in\n\nBolling v. Sharpe that the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to the states, and not to the\n\nDistrict of Columbia. See 347 U.S. 497, 499–500 (1954) (holding that school segregation in the\n\nDistrict of Columbia violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due\n\nProcess Clause); see also Butera v. District of Columbia, 235 F.3d 637, 645 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 2001)\n\n(“Claims of substantive due process violations by State officials are generally analyzed under the\n\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . . While the District of Columbia is not a\n\nstate, it is subject to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment . . . .”); Fouch v. District of\n\nColumbia, 10 F. Supp. 3d 45, 49 n.1 (D.D.C. 2014) (noting that the Fourteenth Amendment is\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fnot applicable to the District of Columbia); Speed v. Mills, 919 F. Supp. 2d 122, 128 (D.D.C.\n\n2013) (dismissing the plaintiff’s § 1983 claim alleging Fourteenth Amendment violations against\n\nthe District of Columbia). Therefore, asserting a claim for violations of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment is futile, and the plaintiff cannot amend his complaint to raise the claim.\n\n       3.      The Proposed Claims Asserting Violations of the Fifth Amendment\n\n       The defendants also argue that the plaintiff cannot assert his substantive due process\n\nclaims under the Fifth Amendment because such claims may only proceed if the claim “is not\n\n‘covered by a specific constitutional provision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment,’”\n\nDefs.’ Opp’n at 8 (quoting Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 843 (1998)), and the\n\nplaintiff’s constitutional false arrest and malicious prosecution claims are covered by the Fourth\n\nAmendment, id. at 8–9. The plaintiff argues in response that “[t]he District of Columbia\n\n[Circuit] has not specifically held that malicious prosecution claims fall under the Fourth\n\nAmendment,” Pl.’s Reply at 11 (citing Pitt v. District of Columbia, 491 F.3d 494, 511 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007)), and that, in any event, he “alleges more than just mere unlawful seizure,” id. According\n\nto the plaintiff, defendant\n\n       Cipullo used his position as an employee of the District of Columbia not only to\n       initiate a false prosecution against [the plaintiff], but also made false statements to\n       ensure the prosecution took place and to have [the plaintiff] barred from the\n       otherwise public courthouse, and intentionally interfered with [the plaintiff’s]\n       ability to live a life free from unwarranted interference by the government.\n\nId.\n\n       In Pitt, the Circuit, after noting that it “ha[d] not yet addressed whether malicious\n\nprosecution can give rise to a violation of the Fourth Amendment,” “join[ed] the large majority\n\nof circuits in holding that malicious prosecution is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to the\n\nextent that the defendant’s actions cause the plaintiff to be unreasonably ‘seized’ without\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fprobable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.” 491 F.3d at 510–11; see also Amobi v.\n\nDist. of Columbia Dep’t of Corrections, 755 F.3d 980, 993 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (analyzing the\n\nplaintiff’s constitutional malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment, but holding\n\nthat the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the alleged violation of\n\nconstitutional rights was not clearly established). Another member of this Court has interpreted\n\nPitt to allow constitutional malicious prosecution claims to proceed as long as there is a predicate\n\nFourth Amendment violation. See Thorp v. District of Columbia, 142 F. Supp. 3d 132, 145\n\n(D.D.C. 2015) (“[The plaintiff] seeks to advance the [malicious prosecution] claim under Section\n\n1983, which, in this circuit, requires a predicate Fourth Amendment violation.” (citing Pitt, 491\n\nF.3d at 511)). Therefore, the defendants are correct that the plaintiff’s constitutional malicious\n\nprosecution claims are cognizable under the Fourth Amendment, and not the Fifth Amendment,\n\nbecause the plaintiff’s claims that his constitutional rights were violated concern defendant\n\nCipullo’s actions that allegedly caused the plaintiff “to be detained and arrested in violation of\n\nhis rights to due process and to be free from unreasonable restrictions on his liberty interests and\n\nunlawfully arrested and detained,” Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶ 142, which fall under the Pitt\n\nrequirement of an unreasonable seizure, see 491 F.3d at 511; see also Lewis, 523 U.S. at 841\n\n(“[I]f a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision, . . . the claim must\n\nbe analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision, not under the rubric of\n\nsubstantive due process.” (quoting United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 272 n.7 (1997))). 3\n\n         As for the plaintiff’s claim that defendant Cipullo also caused him to be barred from the\n\nSuperior Court in violation of his substantive due process rights, see Pl.’s Reply at 11, the\n\n\n3\n The plaintiff’s assertion that defendant Cipullo “also made false statements to ensure the prosecution took place,”\nPl.’s Reply at 11, is encompassed by the malicious prosecution claim, and does not assert a separate constitutional\nviolation.\n\n\n\n                                                         13\n\fallegations in the Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint do not support that this actually\n\noccurred. The Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint does contain facts alleging that defendant\n\nCipullo met with a Superior Court employee about the incident with the plaintiff, see Proposed\n\n4th Am. Compl. ¶ 36, and that Superior Court employees, including former Chief Judge\n\nSatterfield, considered whether to bar the plaintiff from the courthouse, see id. ¶¶ 37–43;\n\nhowever, it does not allege that former Chief Judge Satterfield, former MPD Chief Cathy Lanier,\n\nChief Security Officer Richard Parris, or any other Superior Court or District employee actually\n\nbarred the plaintiff from entering Superior Court as a result of alleged discussions with defendant\n\nCipullo, see generally id. Rather, the plaintiff contends that he was granted pretrial release on\n\nthe condition that he stay away from Superior Court, but that the condition was imposed by the\n\npresiding judge or a magistrate judge on the basis of the information before that judicial officer,\n\nnot because of defendant Cipullo’s alleged meetings or conversations with other Superior Court\n\nemployees. See id. ¶ 59. 4 Therefore, the Court concludes that the only substantive due process\n\nclaims actually alleged in the Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint concern the alleged false\n\narrest and malicious prosecution of the plaintiff, which both fall under the ambit of the Fourth\n\nAmendment, not substantive due process. See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 841. Accordingly, the\n\nplaintiff’s claims alleging violations of his Fifth Amendment substantive due process rights are\n\nfutile, and cannot be a basis for permitting the plaintiff to further amend his complaint.\n\n         4.       The Proposed Claims Asserting Violations of the Fourth Amendment Against the\n                  District of Columbia\n\n         The defendants argue that the plaintiff “has failed to properly plead municipal liability\n\nagainst the District under § 1983” because municipal liability “does not allow for respondeat\n\n\n4\n The plaintiff’s pretrial release condition cannot be challenged here given judicial immunity. See Sibley v. Roberts,\n224 F. Supp. 3d 29, 36 (D.D.C. 2016) (Walton, J.) (noting that judicial immunity extends to “function[s] normally\nperformed by a judge” (quoting Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 12 (1991)), aff’d, 696 F. App’x 526 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\n\n                                                         14\n\fsuperior liability”; instead, “[a] § 1983 plaintiff must identify a municipal policy, custom, or\n\npractice that caused the plaintiff’s alleged constitutional injury.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 9. In response,\n\nthe plaintiff argues that defendant Cipullo’s conduct “involved much more than the sole incident\n\non November 6, 2014,” and that he “directly implicated the policy or custom of the District of\n\nColumbia under which he acted, at least on November 6, 2014.” Pl.’s Reply at 10. According to\n\nthe plaintiff,\n\n        [o]ne policy or custom that implicates the District of Columbia as a defendant, apart\n        from its respondeat superior liability under the common-law counts, is that a private\n        citizen cannot ordinarily seek out a warrant for someone’s arrest, as [defendant]\n        Cipullo tried to do based on his status as an employee at the [ ] Superior Court.\n\nId.\n\n        “In order to hold a municipality liable for civil rights violations of its employees under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, the municipality must have acted in accordance with a ‘government policy or\n\ncustom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to\n\nrepresent official policy.’” Sanders v. District of Columbia, 522 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87–88 (D.D.C.\n\n2007) (quoting Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694\n\n(1978)); see Feirson v. District of Columbia, 506 F.3d 1063, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[T]o\n\nimpose liability on the District under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, [the plaintiff] must show not only a\n\nviolation of his rights under the Constitution or federal law, but also that the [District’s] custom\n\nor policy caused the violation.” (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n“Respondeat superior or vicarious liability will not attach under § 1983, and therefore[,] a\n\nmunicipality cannot be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor.” Burnett v.\n\nSharma, 511 F. Supp. 2d 136, 141 (D.D.C. 2007) (Walton, J.) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted). Accordingly, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint asserting a § 1983\n\nclaim “must allege a predicate violation of some constitutional right, and allege facts that would\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fshow that a custom or policy of the District of Columbia was the ‘moving force’ behind the\n\nalleged constitutional violation.” Agnew v. Gov’t of District of Columbia, 263 F. Supp. 3d 89,\n\n94 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003)),\n\nappeal docketed, No. 17-7114 (D.C. Cir. July 27, 2017). “The order in which a court undertakes\n\neach analytical step is not important.” Yancey v. District of Columbia, 991 F. Supp. 2d 171, 176\n\n(D.D.C. 2013) (citing cases).\n\n       “When a plaintiff seeks to establish ‘custom and policy’ municipal liability under § 1983\n\nin the absence of an express policy, []he must allege ‘concentrated, fully packed, precisely\n\ndelineated scenarios’ as proof that an unconstitutional policy or custom exists.” Page v.\n\nMancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, 284 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Parker v. District of Columbia, 850\n\nF.2d 708, 712 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). “To clear this high hurdle, plaintiffs ordinarily couch ‘custom\n\nor practice’ liability on allegations of ‘practices so persistent and widespread as to practically\n\nhave the force of law.’” Id. (quoting Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 61 (2011)). In other\n\nwords, “[t]he law is clear that ‘[p]roof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity is\n\ninsufficient to impose liability unless there was proof that there was a policy in place that was\n\nunconstitutional.’” Mehari v. District of Columbia, __ F. Supp. 3d __, __, 2017 WL 3283854, at\n\n*7 (D.D.C. July 28, 2017) (second alteration in original) (quoting Sanders, 522 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n88); see also Sanders, 522 F. Supp. 2d at 88 (“The policy or custom must be pervasive to support\n\nmunicipal liability.”).\n\n       Here, the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege a District of Columbia policy or custom\n\nregarding a Superior Court employee’s ability to seek an arrest warrant, having alleged only a\n\nsingle incident of defendant Cipullo, or any other Superior Court employee, allegedly using the\n\ncolor of his or her office to “seek out a warrant for someone’s arrest,” i.e., defendant Cipullo’s\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\factions with regard to the plaintiff in November 2014. See Pl.’s Reply at 10. Therefore, the one\n\nincident of allegedly unconstitutional behavior is insufficient to qualify as pervasive. 5 See\n\nSledge v. District of Columbia, 63 F. Supp. 3d 1, 28 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding that the plaintiff\n\nfailed to establish the District’s municipal liability under § 1983 because the plaintiff “cite[d]\n\nonly his own reports of discriminatory and retaliatory misconduct, and the MPD’s failure to\n\ninvestigate those reports,” but failed to “identif[y] any other similar reports that the District\n\nallegedly ignored”). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the plaintiff’s proposed § 1983 claim\n\nagainst the District of Columbia cannot be a basis for the amendment of his complaint because it\n\nwould be futile to permit him to do so.\n\n         5.       The Proposed Claims Asserting Violations of the Fourth Amendment Against\n                  Defendant Cipullo\n\n                  i.       State Actor Requirement\n\n         The defendants argue that the plaintiff’s “proposed Fourth Amendment violation against\n\n[d]efendant Cipullo cannot be maintained since [d]efendant Cipullo was not a state actor when\n\nthe incident giving rise to this lawsuit occurred.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 10. The defendants, however,\n\nappear to limit what they consider the “incident” to be to only the altercation outside the Superior\n\nCourt on November 6, 2014. See id. at 10–11.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The Court notes that the Supreme Court has held that “municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by\nmunicipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances,” but that is only the case if “the decision to adopt that\nparticular course of action is properly made by [the] government’s authorized decisionmakers” and “represents an\nact of official government ‘policy.’” Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 480–81 (1986). Here, there is no\nallegation that defendant Cipullo was authorized to make official government policy regarding a Superior Court\nemployee’s ability to seek an arrest warrant, and even if he had such authority, that he actually adopted such a\npolicy. See generally Pl.’s Reply; Proposed 4th Am. Compl; see also Singletary v. District of Columbia, 766 F.3d\n66, 74 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding that the Parole Board’s decision to revoke the plaintiff’s parole based on unreliable\nhearsay “was not an ‘act of the municipality’ for purposes of § 1983 because “[n]either the Board as a whole nor the\nthree-member quorum that revoked [the plaintiff’s] parole was authorized to promulgate general rules or other\npolicies” on behalf of the District).\n\n\n                                                         17\n\f       The Supreme Court has explained that “[i]f an individual is possessed of state authority\n\nand purports to act under that authority, his action is state action. It is irrelevant that he might\n\nhave taken the same action had he acted in a purely private capacity or that the particular action\n\nwhich he took was not authorized by state law.” Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 130, 135 (1964).\n\nTherefore, “the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and\n\nthe challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated\n\nas that of the state itself.” Jackson v. Metro Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 351 (1974).\n\n       The Court agrees with the plaintiff that he has alleged that defendant Cipullo’s “conduct\n\nas a state actor involved much more than the sole incident on November 6, 2014,” Pl.’s Reply at\n\n10, because the Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint contains numerous factual allegations\n\nregarding defendant Cipullo’s conduct from November 6, 2014, the day of the altercation\n\nbetween the plaintiff and defendant Cipullo, through November 20, 2014, when a warrant was\n\nissued for the plaintiff’s arrest. These actions include defendant Cipullo allegedly informing\n\nMPD officers during his initial interview on November 6 that he was a director at the Superior\n\nCourt, see Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23, 25; asking one of his supervisors to go to the police\n\nstation so she could be interviewed, id. ¶ 26; discussing the matter with another one of his\n\nsupervisors, id. ¶ 30; calling the former presiding judge of the Criminal Division, Judge Robert\n\nE. Morin, to tell him that he had been threatened by the plaintiff, id. ¶ 31; see also id. ¶ 43\n\n(thanking former Chief Judge Satterfield “for his support in the matter”); discussing the incident\n\nwith the Deputy Director of the Criminal Division, id. ¶ 32; and meeting with various Superior\n\nCourt employees about the incident, id. ¶¶ 33, 36. Treating the plaintiff’s factual allegations as\n\ntrue and giving him the benefit of all reasonable inferences, as the Court must, see Trudeau v.\n\nFed. Trade Comm’n, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006), the Court concludes that the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fhas sufficiently alleged that defendant Cipullo “possessed state authority and purport[ed] to act\n\nunder that authority,” see Griffin, 378 U.S. at 135, if not solely because of his initial encounter\n\nwith the plaintiff, then also as a result of his actions following the encounter—namely, informing\n\nthe interviewing MPD officers of his official position at the Superior Court, discussing the matter\n\nwith various Superior Court employees, and encouraging at least one of those employees to\n\nspeak with MPD, see Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23, 25, 26, 30–33, 36, 43—that ultimately led\n\nthe MPD to revisit its investigation and arrest and charge the plaintiff with a criminal offense.\n\n                ii.     Qualified Immunity\n\n        The defendants argue that even if defendant Cipullo is considered a state actor under\n\n§ 1983, he is entitled to qualified immunity. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 11. According to the\n\ndefendants,\n\n        it is undisputed that [the p]laintiff approached [d]efendant Cipullo outside the\n        courthouse to discuss his conduct with [the p]laintiff’s wife who worked with\n        [d]efendant Cipullo. While [the p]laintiff may not believe he threatened\n        [d]efendant Cipullo, [d]efendant Cipullo felt threatened, called the police and [the\n        p]laintiff was subsequently arrested, and prosecuted. Even if he was mistaken in\n        that [the p]laintiff was not threatening him, [d]efendant Cipullo would be entitled\n        to qualified immunity. No reasonable juror could find that [d]efendant Cipullo did\n        not feel threatened after being approached by the husband of the wife who he\n        supervised and who was questioning him about his interactions with his wife.\n        Accordingly, no basis exists to allow [the p]laintiff to add a constitutional claim to\n        his Complaint given that the claim would be barred against [d]efendant Cipullo\n        based on qualified immunity.\n\nId. at 12 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        In response, the plaintiff contends that “[q]ualified immunity is available only to\n\ngovernment officials sued in their personal and not official capacity.” Pl.’s Reply at 12. This\n\nposition is plainly incorrect. As the Supreme Court has held, “Government officials are entitled\n\nto qualified immunity with respect to ‘discretionary functions’ performed in their official\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fcapacities.” Ziglar v. Abbasi, __ U.S. __, __, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1866 (2017) (emphasis added).\n\nThe Court continued:\n\n        Whether qualified immunity can be invoked turns on the “objective legal\n        reasonableness” of the official’s acts. And reasonableness of official action, in turn,\n        must be “assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time\n        [the action] was taken.” This requirement—that an official loses qualified\n        immunity only for violating clearly established law—protects officials accused of\n        violating “extremely abstract rights.”\n\nId. (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, the fact that defendant Cipullo\n\nis being sued in his official capacity does not preclude him from pursuing a qualified immunity\n\ndefense.\n\n        The plaintiff further argues in opposition to defendant Cipullo’s qualified immunity\n\nposition that defendant Cipullo violated the plaintiff’s right to be free from an unreasonable\n\nseizure, and that he “was aware that he was violating [the plaintiff’s] rights when he initiated the\n\nmalicious prosecution of [the plaintiff] and took other actions against him.” Pl.’s Reply at 13.\n\nThe plaintiff notes that defendant Cipullo, as Director of the Superior Court’s Criminal Division,\n\nhas “knowledge of the law,” but that “[e]ven without this particular legal knowledge, a\n\nreasonable person would conclude that falsely initiating legal proceedings against someone is a\n\nviolation of that person’s rights.” Id.\n\n        The qualified immunity analysis consists of two prongs: (1) “whether the facts alleged\n\nshow that the government official’s conduct violated a ‘constitutional right,’” and (2) “whether\n\nthat right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the incident.” Olaniyi v. District of Columbia,\n\n763 F. Supp. 2d 70, 100 (D.D.C. 2011) (Walton, J.). “With respect to the second step, the\n\n‘relevant, dispositive inquiry . . . is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his\n\nconduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.’” Id. (omission in original) (quoting\n\nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001)). Courts are “permitted to . . . decid[e] which of the\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\ftwo prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the\n\ncircumstances in the particular case at hand.” Id. (quoting Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223,\n\n236 (2009)). “In assessing whether a party is entitled to qualified immunity, the facts must be\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the constitutional injury.” Pitt v. District\n\nof Columbia, 558 F. Supp. 2d 11, 16 (D.D.C. 2008).\n\n                          aa.      The Constitutional False Arrest Claim\n\n        The District of Columbia Circuit has noted that the elements of a constitutional false\n\narrest claim are “substantially identical” to those of a common law claim of false arrest, Amobi,\n\n755 F.3d at 989 (quoting Scott v. District of Columbia, 101 F.3d 748, 753 (D.C. Cir. 1996)), i.e.,\n\n“whether the arresting officer was justified in ordering the arrest of the plaintiff,” Scott, 101 F.3d\n\nat 754. 6 Here, the Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint alleges that “[d]efendant Cipullo’s false\n\nstatements to the MPD official initiated a criminal proceeding against [the p]laintiff,” Proposed\n\n4th Am. Compl. ¶ 145, that “[d]efendant Cipullo acted with malice against [the p]laintiff,” id.\n\n¶ 147, that the plaintiff “was arrested and detained absent a valid, truthful, or lawful basis,” id.\n\n¶ 148, and that the “judicial proceedings instituted by [d]efendant Cipullo’s false statements\n\nagainst [the p]laintiff w[ere] caused by wrongful or improper motives, and without probable\n\ncause to bring[] or sustain [them],” id. ¶ 149; see also id. ¶ 151 (alleging that “[d]efendant\n\nCipullo’s primary purpose in providing false statements to the MPD official, which precipitated\n\nthe events that led to institution and continuation of [the criminal] proceeding against [the\n\np]laintiff, was for a purpose other than that of bringing an offender to justice”).\n\n\n\n\n6\n The circumstances of this case are unique because defendant Cipullo was not the arresting officer. However, the\ndefendants do not argue that defendant Cipullo cannot be held liable for false arrest on that basis, see generally\nDefs.’ Opp’n, and thus, the Court need not consider this issue.\n\n\n                                                        21\n\f       Although the Supreme Court has made clear that the motivation behind the creation of\n\nthe qualified immunity doctrine was “to ensure that ‘insubstantial claims against government\n\nofficials [will] be resolved prior to discovery,’” Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231 (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 n.2 (1987)), and thus, “repeatedly [has]\n\nstressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in\n\nlitigation,” id. at 232 (quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam)), the\n\nCircuit has also stated that “[t]he issue of probable cause in a false arrest case is a mixed question\n\nof law and fact that the trial court should ordinarily leave to the jury,” and “[o]nly where the\n\nfacts are undisputed or clearly established does probable cause become a question of law for the\n\ncourt,” Amobi, 755 F.3d at 990. Here, given that discovery has concluded, the “importance of\n\nresolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation,” see Pearson, 555 U.S. at\n\n232, considering the limited record currently available to the Court, is arguably diminished.\n\nOther members of this Court have determined that qualified immunity cannot be decided before\n\ntrial if disputed issues of fact regarding the reasonableness of an alleged seizure are present. See\n\nSingh v. District of Columbia, 55 F. Supp. 3d 55, 74 (D.D.C. 2014) (“It remains a disputed\n\nquestion of fact whether [the MPD police officer] violated [the plaintiff’s] Fourth Amendment\n\nright through the traffic stop and the arrest. The Court therefore cannot conclude at this stage\n\nthat the officer is shielded by qualified immunity.”); Zhi Chen v. District of Columbia, 808 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 252, 259 (D.D.C. 2011) (“A defendant’s entitlement to qualified immunity is a question\n\nof law to be decided by the court, although sometimes, as in this case, the facts establishing what\n\nthe challenged conduct was are legitimately in dispute and must first be decided by the jury\n\nbefore the court answers the ultimate legal question whether a defendant is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity.” (internal citation omitted)); Halcomb v. Woods, 767 F. Supp. 2d 123, 140 (D.D.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f2011) (same); Halcomb v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 526 F. Supp. 2d 20, 21–22 (D.D.C.\n\n2007) (“With these factual matters in dispute in this [constitutional false arrest] case, the Court\n\ncannot decide before trial whether [the officer] is entitled to qualified immunity.”); see also\n\nWood v. District of Columbia, No. 14-2066 (EGS), 2017 WL 2374346, at *4–7 (D.D.C. May 31,\n\n2017) (not resolving the qualified immunity issue until the summary judgment stage).\n\n       At this point, whether defendant Cipullo made false statements to the MPD or acted with\n\ncorrupt intent in making those statements are questions of disputed material facts. Further,\n\naccepting the plaintiff’s allegations as true, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has sufficiently\n\nalleged that defendant Cipullo knowingly made false statements to the MPD in order for the\n\nplaintiff to be arrested without probable cause. See Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 145–51, 153.\n\nAnd “it is well-established that ‘an arrest without probable cause violates the [F]ourth\n\n[A]mendment.” Ronkin v. Vihn, 71 F. Supp. 3d 124, 132 (D.D.C. 2014) (Walton, J.) (alterations\n\nin original) (quoting Martin v. Malhoyt, 830 F.2d 237, 262 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). Accordingly, the\n\nCourt cannot conclude on the record available to it at this time, that defendant Cipullo is entitled\n\nto qualified immunity on the plaintiff’s proposed constitutional false arrest claim, and therefore,\n\nthe proposed claim cannot be declared futile.\n\n                       bb.     The Constitutional Malicious Prosecution Claim\n\n       Pitt clearly recognizes a constitutional claim for malicious prosecution, provided that a\n\npredicate Fourth Amendment violation exists. See Pitt, 491 F.3d at 511 (“We join the large\n\nmajority of circuits in holding that malicious prosecution is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to\n\nthe extent that the defendant’s actions cause the plaintiff to be unreasonably ‘seized’ without\n\nprobable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.”). And because disputed questions of\n\nfact prevent the Court from resolving the issue of qualified immunity for the false arrest claim,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fthe predicate Fourth Amendment violation, based on the record currently available to it, the\n\nCourt concludes that it is also too early to determine whether defendant Cipullo is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity as to the proposed constitutional malicious prosecution claim. 7 Therefore,\n\nthe plaintiff’s proposed constitutional malicious prosecution claim at this point cannot be\n\nconsidered futile.\n\n                                            IV.     CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the defendants have not shown that\n\nthe plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend should be denied based on the plaintiff’s failure to cure\n\nprior deficiencies or on the grounds of undue delay or undue prejudice to the defendants. The\n\nCourt, however, finds that the plaintiff’s proposed claims based on violations of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments, as well as his § 1983 claim against the District of Columbia, would be\n\nfutile, and thus, denies the plaintiff leave to assert those claims. Finally, the Court cannot\n\nconclude, based on the record currently before it, that the plaintiff’s proposed claims alleging\n\nthat defendant Cipullo violated his Fourth Amendment rights, whether under § 1983 or Bivens,\n\nare futile. Accordingly, the Court must grant in part and deny in part the plaintiff’s motion for\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Common law false arrest and malicious prosecution claims have alaredy been asserted by the plaintiff against the\ndefendants, and constitutional false arrest and malicious prosecution claims proceed under the same analysis as the\ncommon law claims. See Dingle v. District of Columbia, 571 F. Supp. 2d 87, 95 (D.D.C. 2008) (“Common-law and\nconstitutional claims of false arrest are generally analyzed as though they comprise a single cause of action.”);\nThorp, 142 F. Supp. 3d at 146–47 (dismissing the § 1983 malicious prosecution claim for the same reason that it\ndismissed the common law malicious prosecution claim—the plaintiff failed to allege facts showing that the\ncriminal prosecution was terminated in his favor); see also Creecy v. District of Columbia, No. 10–841 (CKK), 2011\nWL 1195780, at *6 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2011) (“Because [the plaintiff] has properly asserted that there was no\nprobable cause for his arrest, he has adequately stated a claim for malicious prosecution under § 1983.”). At no\npoint have the defendants sought to dismiss the plaintiff’s common law false arrest and malicious prosecution\nclaims. Accordingly, the defendants will seemingly suffer no harm in having these constitutional claims proceed so\nthat they and the qualified immunity issue can be resolved on a full factual record, given that discovery has already\nbeen completed. See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 231 (noting that the purpose of the qualified immunity doctrine is to\nprevent insubstantial claims from proceeding to discovery).\n\n\n\n                                                         24\n\fleave to file an amended complaint, and permits the plaintiff to file a fourth amended complaint\n\nasserting only the claims not deemed futile.\n\n           SO ORDERED this 5th day of January, 2018. 8\n\n                                                                  REGGIE WALTON\n                                                                  United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n8\n    The Court will contemporaneously issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n                                                       25\n\f",

See generally Third\n\nAmended Complaint and Jury Demand (“3d Am. Compl.”). Currently before the Court is the\n\nPlaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint (“Pl.’s Mot.”). Upon careful\n\nconsideration of the parties’ submissions, 1 the Court concludes for the following reasons that it\n\nmust grant in part and deny in part the plaintiff’s motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in reaching its\ndecision: (1) the Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth\nAmended Complaint (“Pl.’s Mem.”); (2) the Fourth Amended Complaint and Jury Demand (redlined version)\n(“Proposed 4th Am. Compl.”); (3) the Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth\nAmended Complaint (“Defs.’ Opp’n”); and (4) the Plaintiff’s Reply to Defendant District of Columbia and Daniel\nCipullo’s Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint and Request for Hearing\n(“Pl.’s Reply”).\n\f                                       I.    BACKGROUND\n\n       Defendant Cipullo is the supervisor of Tenisha Jiggetts, the plaintiff’s wife, who is an\n\nAttorney-Advisor for the Criminal Division, 3d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 9–10, and the plaintiff is a retired\n\npolice officer for the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”), id. ¶ 51. On November 6, 2014,\n\nthe plaintiff and defendant Cipullo encountered each other on the sidewalk between the Superior\n\nCourt and MPD headquarters after the plaintiff’s wife had told the plaintiff that defendant\n\nCipullo had obstructed her ability to leave her office. See id. ¶¶ 16, 18. The plaintiff alleges that\n\ndefendant Cipullo thereafter made false statements to an MPD official, claiming that the plaintiff\n\nthreatened him during the encounter. See id. ¶¶ 17, 20–21. The plaintiff was not arrested on the\n\nday that defendant Cipullo initially made his complaint, see id. ¶ 24, but, after defendant Cipullo\n\nallegedly further pursued the matter, see id. ¶¶ 38–39, the plaintiff was arrested and detained for\n\napproximately ten hours on November 21, 2014, see id. ¶¶ 39–42, after being charged with\n\nfelony threatening to kidnap or injure a person in violation of D.C. Code § 22-1810 (2012), id. ¶\n\n42. The charge was subsequently dismissed with prejudice on September 18, 2015. Id. ¶ 56.\n\n       The plaintiff initiated this action on November 3, 2015, see Complaint at 1, and on\n\nNovember 6, 2017, the plaintiff filed his motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, see\n\nPl.’s Mot. at 1. The plaintiff’s Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint adds facts that the plaintiff\n\ncontends were revealed through discovery, as well as two new claims: (1) a 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nclaim, alleging violations under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments; and, in the\n\nalternative, (2) a Bivens action, alleging violations under the same three constitutional\n\namendments. See Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 138–76. Discovery closed on December 18,\n\n2017, see Order (Nov. 17, 2017), ECF No. 47, and the Court held a hearing on the plaintiff’s\n\nmotion on December 21, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f                                       II.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), the Court “should freely give leave” to a\n\nparty to amend its pleading “when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). While the\n\nCourt has sole discretion to grant or deny leave to amend, “[l]eave to amend a [pleading] should\n\nbe freely given in the absence of undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice to the opposing party,\n\nrepeated failure to cure deficiencies, or futility.” Richardson v.

ANALYSIS\n\n         The defendants oppose the plaintiff’s motion for leave to again amend his complaint on\n\nthe grounds that (1) the plaintiff failed to earlier cure deficiencies in his complaint, (2) undue\n\ndelay and prejudice, and (3) futility. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 1. 2\n\nA.       The Plaintiff’s Failure to Earlier Cure Deficiencies Argument\n\n         In their written opposition, the defendants argue that the Court should deny the plaintiff’s\n\nmotion for leave to amend because he does not explain “why he failed to include the [proposed]\n\n\n2\n  At the hearing on the motion, the defendants seemingly abandoned their first two grounds and stated that futility\nwas the primary basis of their opposition. However, even if the first two grounds were not abandoned, the Court\nconcludes that the defendants’ positions on these two grounds lack merit. The defendants also argue that the\nplaintiff’s motion should be denied because he “failed to seek leave . . . to add new claims.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 4. This\nargument plainly lacks merit not only because the defendants fail to cite any legal authority to support their\nproposition that the motion should be denied on that basis, see id., but also because the plaintiff’s motion is titled as\na “Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint,” and in that motion, the plaintiff specifically “requests\nleave to amend his Third Amended Complaint to add additional facts and claims as set forth in the [Proposed]\nFourth Amended Complaint,” Pl.’s Mot. at 1.\n\n\n                                                           3\n\famendments . . . in his previously filed Complaints.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 4. The defendants note\n\nthat at the status conference held on August 31, 2017, the Court ordered the plaintiff to file his\n\nthird amended complaint on or before September 22, 2017, see id. at 5; see also Order (Aug. 31,\n\n2017), ECF No. 40, which the plaintiff did, but “[i]n that Complaint, [the p]laintiff brought no\n\nnew claims,” even though “there was nothing that prevented [him] from bringing his proposed\n\nnew claims,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 5. According to the defendants, “by his own admission, [the\n\np]laintiff relies on facts known to him or that should have been known to him when he sought to\n\ncure the original [Complaint] and Second Amended Complaint[].” Id. The plaintiff argues in\n\nresponse that, as of the date he filed his reply on November 28, 2017, the “[d]efendants ha[d] not\n\nresponded to most of th[e] discovery” the plaintiff had submitted to them, but that recent\n\ndiscovery has revealed the actions that defendant Cipullo took “under the authority of his\n\nposition with the [ ] Superior Court,” which prompted the plaintiff’s request to pursue the\n\nproposed constitutional claims. See Pl.’s Reply at 4; see also id. at 6 (“[D]iscovery is ongoing,\n\nand [the plaintiff] seeks leave to amend the complaint to conform to information learned in\n\ndiscovery so that the case may be tried on its merits.”).\n\n       At the motion hearing, the plaintiff clarified that the deposition of MPD Commander\n\nWilliam J. Fitzgerald, which was taken on October 17, 2017, see Pl.’s Reply, Exhibit (“Ex.”) 1\n\n(Transcript of Commander William J. Fitzgerald (“Fitzgerald Dep.”)), revealed how defendant\n\nCipullo allegedly used the color of his office to have the plaintiff arrested and charged, and the\n\nplaintiff promptly filed his motion for leave less than three weeks later, see Pl.’s Mot. at 1. The\n\ndefendants argued in response that Commander Fitzgerald’s deposition did not reveal any new\n\nfacts, but was based upon documents that the plaintiff already had in his possession, because\n\nCommander Fitzgerald did not have an independent recollection of the relevant events. The\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fdefendants, however, did not submit those documents to the Court to support their assertion that\n\nthe plaintiff’s proposed Fourth Amended Complaint “relies on facts known to him or that should\n\nhave been known to him when he sought to cure the original [Complaint] and Second Amended\n\nComplaint[].” Defs.’ Opp’n at 5. Therefore, the Court is unable to evaluate their assertion that\n\nthe plaintiff already knew the facts forming the basis for his constitutional claims, and thus, the\n\ndefendants have failed to meet their burden “to show that leave to file an amended complaint\n\nshould be denied” on this basis. See Afram, 958 F. Supp. 2d at 278. Moreover, even if the\n\nplaintiff already knew or should have known about the relevant facts that purportedly support his\n\nconstitutional claims, the defendants are unable to show any undue prejudice resulting from the\n\nfiling of another amended complaint. See infra Part III.B.\n\nB.     The Undue Delay and Undue Prejudice to the Defendants Argument\n\n       The defendants claim that they will be “unfair[ly] disadvantage[d]” and “blindside[d]” if\n\nthe Court grants the plaintiff’s motion because they will “have to expend additional efforts and\n\nresources” to address the proposed Fourth Amended Complaint and they “seek closure” in this\n\ncase, which “has been pending for just over two years.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 6. The defendants fail\n\nto cite any legal authority to support their proposition that the plaintiff’s motion should be denied\n\non these bases. The plaintiff argues in response to the defendants’ position that “[m]oving to\n\namend the complaint before the close of discovery does not constitute undue delay[, and u]nder\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), a party may amend the complaint to conform to the\n\nevidence at trial or even after trial.” Pl.’s Reply at 6 (citing Fed.

Moreover, the\n\ndefendants do not contend that additional discovery will be necessary either.\n\n        Courts liberally assess whether Rule 15 motions should be granted, only denying them on\n\nthe basis of undue delay when the plaintiffs waited many years before seeking amendments, after\n\ndiscovery had already concluded or summary judgment had already been granted.

The Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint does contain facts alleging that defendant\n\nCipullo met with a Superior Court employee about the incident with the plaintiff, see Proposed\n\n4th Am.

Rather, the plaintiff contends that he was granted pretrial release on\n\nthe condition that he stay away from Superior Court, but that the condition was imposed by the\n\npresiding judge or a magistrate judge on the basis of the information before that judicial officer,\n\nnot because of defendant Cipullo’s alleged meetings or conversations with other Superior Court\n\nemployees. See id. ¶ 59. 4 Therefore, the Court concludes that the only substantive due process\n\nclaims actually alleged in the Proposed Fourth Amended Complaint concern the alleged false\n\narrest and malicious prosecution of the plaintiff, which both fall under the ambit of the Fourth\n\nAmendment, not substantive due process. See Lewis, 523 U.S. at 841. Accordingly, the\n\nplaintiff’s claims alleging violations of his Fifth Amendment substantive due process rights are\n\nfutile, and cannot be a basis for permitting the plaintiff to further amend his complaint.\n\n         4.

Qualified Immunity\n\n        The defendants argue that even if defendant Cipullo is considered a state actor under\n\n§ 1983, he is entitled to qualified immunity. See Defs.’ Opp’n at 11. According to the\n\ndefendants,\n\n        it is undisputed that [the p]laintiff approached [d]efendant Cipullo outside the\n        courthouse to discuss his conduct with [the p]laintiff’s wife who worked with\n        [d]efendant Cipullo. While [the p]laintiff may not believe he threatened\n        [d]efendant Cipullo, [d]efendant Cipullo felt threatened, called the police and [the\n        p]laintiff was subsequently arrested, and prosecuted. Even if he was mistaken in\n        that [the p]laintiff was not threatening him, [d]efendant Cipullo would be entitled\n        to qualified immunity. No reasonable juror could find that [d]efendant Cipullo did\n        not feel threatened after being approached by the husband of the wife who he\n        supervised and who was questioning him about his interactions with his wife.\n        Accordingly, no basis exists to allow [the p]laintiff to add a constitutional claim to\n        his Complaint given that the claim would be barred against [d]efendant Cipullo\n        based on qualified immunity.\n\nId. at 12 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        In response, the plaintiff contends that “[q]ualified immunity is available only to\n\ngovernment officials sued in their personal and not official capacity.” Pl.’s Reply at 12. This\n\nposition is plainly incorrect. As the Supreme Court has held, “Government officials are entitled\n\nto qualified immunity with respect to ‘discretionary functions’ performed in their official\n\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fcapacities.” Ziglar v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1843</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1866 (2017) (emphasis added).\n\nThe Court continued:\n\n        Whether qualified immunity can be invoked turns on the “objective legal\n        reasonableness” of the official’s acts. And reasonableness of official action, in turn,\n        must be “assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time\n        [the action] was taken.” This requirement—that an official loses qualified\n        immunity only for violating clearly established law—protects officials accused of\n        violating “extremely abstract rights.”\n\nId. (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, the fact that defendant Cipullo\n\nis being sued in his official capacity does not preclude him from pursuing a qualified immunity\n\ndefense.\n\n        The plaintiff further argues in opposition to defendant Cipullo’s qualified immunity\n\nposition that defendant Cipullo violated the plaintiff’s right to be free from an unreasonable\n\nseizure, and that he “was aware that he was violating [the plaintiff’s] rights when he initiated the\n\nmalicious prosecution of [the plaintiff] and took other actions against him.” Pl.’s Reply at 13.\n\nThe plaintiff notes that defendant Cipullo, as Director of the Superior Court’s Criminal Division,\n\nhas “knowledge of the law,” but that “[e]ven without this particular legal knowledge, a\n\nreasonable person would conclude that falsely initiating legal proceedings against someone is a\n\nviolation of that person’s rights.” Id.\n\n        The qualified immunity analysis consists of two prongs: (1) “whether the facts alleged\n\nshow that the government official’s conduct violated a ‘constitutional right,’” and (2) “whether\n\nthat right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the incident.” Olaniyi v.

Further,\n\naccepting the plaintiff’s allegations as true, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has sufficiently\n\nalleged that defendant Cipullo knowingly made false statements to the MPD in order for the\n\nplaintiff to be arrested without probable cause. See Proposed 4th Am. Compl. ¶¶ 145–51, 153.\n\nAnd “it is well-established that ‘an arrest without probable cause violates the [F]ourth\n\n[A]mendment.” Ronkin v.

Cir. 1987)). Accordingly, the\n\nCourt cannot conclude on the record available to it at this time, that defendant Cipullo is entitled\n\nto qualified immunity on the plaintiff’s proposed constitutional false arrest claim, and therefore,\n\nthe proposed claim cannot be declared futile.\n\n                       bb.     The Constitutional Malicious Prosecution Claim\n\n       Pitt clearly recognizes a constitutional claim for malicious prosecution, provided that a\n\npredicate Fourth Amendment violation exists. See Pitt, 491 F.3d at 511 (“We join the large\n\nmajority of circuits in holding that malicious prosecution is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to\n\nthe extent that the defendant’s actions cause the plaintiff to be unreasonably ‘seized’ without\n\nprobable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.”). And because disputed questions of\n\nfact prevent the Court from resolving the issue of qualified immunity for the false arrest claim,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\fthe predicate Fourth Amendment violation, based on the record currently available to it, the\n\nCourt concludes that it is also too early to determine whether defendant Cipullo is entitled to\n\nqualified immunity as to the proposed constitutional malicious prosecution claim. 7 Therefore,\n\nthe plaintiff’s proposed constitutional malicious prosecution claim at this point cannot be\n\nconsidered futile.\n\n                                            IV.     CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the defendants have not shown that\n\nthe plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend should be denied based on the plaintiff’s failure to cure\n\nprior deficiencies or on the grounds of undue delay or undue prejudice to the defendants. The\n\nCourt, however, finds that the plaintiff’s proposed claims based on violations of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments, as well as his § 1983 claim against the District of Columbia, would be\n\nfutile, and thus, denies the plaintiff leave to assert those claims. Finally, the Court cannot\n\nconclude, based on the record currently before it, that the plaintiff’s proposed claims alleging\n\nthat defendant Cipullo violated his Fourth Amendment rights, whether under § 1983 or Bivens,\n\nare futile. Accordingly, the Court must grant in part and deny in part the plaintiff’s motion for\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Common law false arrest and malicious prosecution claims have alaredy been asserted by the plaintiff against the\ndefendants, and constitutional false arrest and malicious prosecution claims proceed under the same analysis as the\ncommon law claims.

Mar. 31, 2011) (“Because [the plaintiff] has properly asserted that there was no\nprobable cause for his arrest, he has adequately stated a claim for malicious prosecution under § 1983.”). At no\npoint have the defendants sought to dismiss the plaintiff’s common law false arrest and malicious prosecution\nclaims. Accordingly, the defendants will seemingly suffer no harm in having these constitutional claims proceed so\nthat they and the qualified immunity issue can be resolved on a full factual record, given that discovery has already\nbeen completed.
