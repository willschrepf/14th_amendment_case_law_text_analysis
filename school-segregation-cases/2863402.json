Wilburn,\n                for appellees.\n\n                  APPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas\nSADLER, J.\n        {¶ 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Edward Hamilton, appeals the November 21, 2014\ndecision and entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granting the motion to\ndismiss filed by defendants-appellees, Ohio Department of Health and its director\n(\"ODH\"), and denying appellant's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.\nFor the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n        {¶ 2} This case concerns the standing of appellant to challenge in a civil action for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief a rule promulgated by ODH that alters certain eligibility\nprotocols, if Ohio's \"Ryan White Part B\" program suffers a future funding shortfall.\n        {¶ 3} Ohio's Ryan White Part B program, which includes the Ohio HIV Drug\nAssistance Program (\"OHDAP\"), arose under the federal Ryan White Act \"Part B - Care\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                 2\n\n\nGrant Program.\" 42 U.S.C. 300ff-21. Part B permits the federal government, \"subject to\nthe availability of appropriations,\" to provide grants to enable applicant states \"to improve\nthe quality, availability and organization of health care and support services for\nindividuals and families with HIV/AIDS.\" Applicant states must provide an assurance\nthat the state will, \"to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that HIV-related health\ncare and support services delivered pursuant to a program established with assistance\n* * * provided without regard to the ability of the individual to pay for such services and\nwithout regard to the current or past health condition of the individual with HIV/AIDS.\"\n42 U.S.C. 300ff-27(b)(7)(B)(i). A state may use the grants to support core medical\nservices, including drug assistance programs, as well as certain support services and\nadministrative expenses.\n          {¶ 4} The Ohio legislature charged ODH with administering the Ohio Ryan White\nPart B program, and in R.C. 3701.241(D) allows its director discretion to adopt rules and\nissue orders as necessary for administration of the funds. In September 2011, appellees\nbegan the administrative rule-making process to revise the code section pertaining to\neligibility for benefits under the Ohio Ryan White Part B program, now numbered Ohio\nAdm.Code 37o1-44-03.\n          {¶ 5} The two appendices which support Ohio Adm.Code 37o1-44-03 are central\nto this appeal. Appendix A establishes medical guidelines to determine the priority in\nwhich an applicant would receive OHDAP services, including access to medications, if a\nwaiting list forms due to insufficient funds.1 Appendix B provides the director of ODH\n\n\n1   Ohio Adm. Code 37o1-44-03, Appendix A: Medical Guidelines, reads:\n\n                  These additional medical guidelines only apply to applications to the\n                  Ohio HIV Drug Assistance Program (OHDAP).\n                  When OHDAP has a waiting list for program enrollment and subject to\n                  sufficient funding, applicants to the Ryan White Part B programs must\n                  meet one of the following medical guidelines to be eligible for expedited\n                  enrollment:\n                  1. Pregnant women who meet all OHDAP eligibility criteria and who are\n                  not eligible for other programs which provide antiretroviral (ARV)\n                  medications.\n                  2. Post partum women (women who [have] given birth within 180 days\n                  prior to applying to OHDAP) who meet all OHDAP eligibility criteria and\n                  who are not eligible for other programs which provide antiretroviral\n                  (ARV) medications.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                               3\n\n\nwith discretion to reduce the maximum gross family income threshold from 300 percent\nof the federal poverty level (\"FPL\") to no less than 100 percent of the FPL, if there is\ninsufficient funding to sustain current services of the program.2\n\n\n              If the OHDAP is able to enroll some but not all individuals from the\n              waiting list (based on insufficient funds), applications from individuals\n              who meet all OHDAP eligibility criteria and who are not eligible for other\n              programs which provide ARV medications will be prioritized as follows:\n              Priority 1: Individuals with HIV and other extreme medical conditions\n              such as, but not limited to, HIV-associated nephropathy or HIV related\n              dementia. The applicant’s HIV-treating physician or nurse practitioner\n              shall complete a medical waiver request consistent with section 3701-44-\n              04 of the Ohio Administrative Code.\n              Priority 2: Individuals with a history of AIDS-defining illness [see\n              paragraph (C) of Appendix A to section 3701-3-12 of the Ohio\n              Administrative Code for indicator diseases diagnosed definitively] and/or\n              a nadir CD4 count of less than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 (or less than\n              14%). Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating physician or\n              nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this priority.\n              Priority 3: Individuals with HIV and a nadir CD4 count between 201-350\n              cells/mm3. Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating\n              physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this\n              priority.\n              Priority 4: Individuals with HIV and a nadir CD4 count between 351-500\n              cells/mm3. Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating\n              physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this\n              priority.\n              Priority 5: Individuals with HIV and a nadir CD4 count above 500\n              cells/mm3. Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating\n              physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this\n              priority.\n              Individuals on the waiting list should notify OHDAP if there is\n              deterioration in their health. Individuals who submit documentation by\n              the HIV-treating physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the\n              individual meets one of the above listed priorities will move to the\n              appropriate priority while retaining their original waiting list date.\n\n2 Ohio Adm.Code 37o1-44-03, Appendix B: Financial Eligibility Guidelines for OHDAP/HIPP/\nSpenddown, reads:\n\n              Applicants to the Ryan White Part B programs must meet the following\n              financial guidelines to be eligible:\n              1. The individual or individual's family gross income must be equal to or\n              less than three hundred percent (300%) of the Federal Poverty Level\n              (FPL) as published in the Federal Register on or before the first of April\n              of each calendar year.\n              2. The calculation shall exclude taxes and any mandatory retirement\n              deduction.\n              Eligibility in Ryan White Part B programs is subject to sufficient funding.\n              Pursuant to division (D) of section 3701.241 of the Revised Code and\n              paragraph (C) of this rule, if there is insufficient funding to sustain\n              current services, the director may, at any time and as necessary for the\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                             4\n\n\n       {¶ 6} On November 2, 2011, appellant filed a complaint asking the court to\ndeclare Ohio Adm.Code 3701-44-03 unenforceable as proposed and asking the court for\ntemporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin ODH from enforcing\nthe rule. Appellant contended that Appendices A and B amounted to a material\nmodification of the new rule that necessitated another public hearing under the rule-\nmaking process in Chapter 119 of the Revised Code. The trial court issued an order\ntemporarily restraining ODH from enforcing or implementing the proposed rule until the\ncourt resolved whether to grant declaratory or injunctive relief.\n       {¶ 7} A few weeks later, the trial court granted appellant's motion for a\npreliminary injunction, enjoining the rule from taking effect until appellees held a public\nhearing in compliance with Chapter 119 of the Revised Code. Analyzing the \"irreparable\nharm\" element of injunction, the trial court found \"[a]t this juncture, [appellant] merely\nseek[s] a[n] R.C. 119.03 public hearing by which [he] may voice [his] opinion on this new\nrule. * * * The disenfranchisement of an affected person to be heard on new rules that\nwould substantially change his or her life constitutes irreparable harm.\" (Nov. 29, 2011\nEntry Granting Preliminary Injunction, 9-10.)\n       {¶ 8} On August 27, 2012, appellees filed a notice of compliance with the court's\norder to properly promulgate the rule under R.C. 119 processes and filed a motion to\ndismiss asserting a lack of controversy. That same day, appellant filed a motion to file an\namended complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order.\n       {¶ 9} On August 28, 2012, the trial court denied appellees' motion to dismiss,\ngranted appellant leave to file an amended complaint, and denied appellant's motion for a\ntemporary restraining order, stating: \"[a] temporary restraining order contemplates a\nsituation where there is an unusual emergency with the imminent threat of harm that\nrequires immediate court consideration. The Court finds that [appellant] failed to satisfy\nthe necessary elements set forth in Civ.R. 65(A) for a temporary restraining order.\"\n(Aug. 29, 2012 Order and Entry, 1-2.) Ohio Adm.Code 3701-44-03 became effective\nAugust 30, 2012.\n\n              effective administration of available funds, issue an order, reducing the\n              maximum gross family income set forth in this appendix for some or all\n              Ryan White Part B programs, but at no time shall the maximum be less\n              than 100% of the FPL.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                              5\n\n\n       {¶ 10} In the amended complaint, the touchstone for this appeal, appellant asserts\nan action to declare Ohio Adm.Code 37o1-44-03 unlawful and to enjoin its enforcement\ndue to the rule's violation of the Ohio Administrative Procedures Act, the Ryan White Act,\nthe Rehabilitation Act, the American with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), and both the Ohio and\nU.S. Constitutions. The amended complaint states that appellant resides in Franklin\nCounty, Ohio, has a verified HIV infection, and currently receives benefits under the Ryan\nWhite Part B Program. The amended complaint also describes the medications funded by\nthe program as \"potentially life-saving\" and potentially costing \"as much as $10,000-\n$40,000 per year, per patient.\" (Aug. 27, 2012 Verified Amended Complaint, 1, 3.)\n       {¶ 11} On September 28, 2012, appellees filed a motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint based, in part, on Civ.R. 12(B)(1) for lack of jurisdiction and Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for\nfailure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. On October 25, 2012, appellant\nfiled a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and, the next day, filed a\nmemorandum in opposition to appellees' motion to dismiss. Appellees filed a reply to\nappellant's memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss on November 2, 2012,\nand a memorandum contra to appellant's motion for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint on November 8, 2012.\n       {¶ 12} On April 1, 2013, the parties jointly moved the court to stay the proceedings\npending a status conference with the court in November of that year to discuss the future\n\"unknown\" status of OHDAP in light of the Affordable Care Act. The trial court granted\nthe parties' motion to stay and, after the November status conference, also granted the\nparties' request to continue the stay until further order of the court.\n       {¶ 13} On November 21, 2014, the trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss\nbased on Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and denied appellant's motion for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint. In so holding, the trial court found that appellant alleged only \"a potential\ninjury based upon [appellees'] conceivable response to a possible scenario (insufficiency\nof funds) outside of [appellant's] and [appellees'] control\" and, as such, did not assert a\nspecific injury that could be redressed by a court decision. (Emphasis sic.) (Nov. 21, 2014\nDecision and Entry, 4.) As an additional basis to grant the motion to dismiss, the court\nalso determined that the claims presented by appellant were not yet ripe for review.\nFinally, the trial court determined that the new information in appellant's proposed\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                          6\n\n\nsecond amended complaint, relevant to whether appellant was an \"applicant\" subject to\nAppendix A, nonetheless did \"not cure [appellant's] standing problem.\" (Nov. 21, 2014\nDecision and Entry, 6.)\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n      {¶ 14} Appellant presents three assignments of error for our review:\n             I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND HAD ABUSED ITS\n             DISCRETION IN GRANTING DEFENDANT-APPELLEE\n             OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH’S MOTION TO DISMISS\n             BY CONCLUDING THAT THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT\n             LACKED STANDING TO BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION\n             BASED ON A LACK OF INJURY WHEN APPELLANT HAS\n             STANDING TO REQUEST DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n\n             II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND HAD ABUSED ITS\n             DISCRETION BY ALLOWING THE REPROMULGATED\n             RULES CREATED BY AN ABUSE OF AGENCY DISCRETION\n             TO REMAIN IN EFFECT THAT CONFLICT WITH AND\n             VIOLATE THE AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT,\n             REHABILITATION ACT, DUE PROCESS CLAUSES OF THE\n             OHIO AND U.S. CONSTITUTION, RYAN WHITE\n             TREATMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2009, AND\n             THE OHIO ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT.\n\n             III. THE TRIAL COURT HAD COMMITTED A PRO-\n             CEDURAL ERROR AND HAD ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN\n             ITS DETERMINATION THAT THE COURT HAD\n             INSTRUCTED THE PLAINTIFF THAT IT WAS WAITING\n             FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INJURY WHEN IN\n             FACT ALL PARTIES HAD KNOWN THAT THIS CAUSE OF\n             ACTION WAS DECLARATORY IN NATURE AND NOT\n             RULING ON ALL PREVIOUS PENDING MOTIONS IN AT\n             [sic] TIMELY MANNER.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n      A. Standard of Review\n      {¶ 15} Whether a party has established standing to bring an action before the court\nis generally a question of law reviewed de novo on appeal. Moore v. Middletown, 133\nOhio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-3897, ¶ 20. Likewise, a trial court's order granting a Civ.R.\n12(B)(6) motion to dismiss is subject to de novo appellate review. Perrysburg Twp. v.\nRossford, 103 Ohio St.3d 79, 2004-Ohio-4362, ¶ 5. When reviewing a Civ.R. 12(B)(6)\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                                7\n\n\nmotion to dismiss, the court may consider only the statements and facts considered in the\npleadings and may not consider or rely on evidence outside of the complaint. Brown v.\nColumbus City Schools Bd. of Edn., 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1067, 2009-Ohio-3230, ¶ 4. The\ncourt must accept the material allegations of the complaint as true and make all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. Maitland v. Ford Motor Co., 103 Ohio\nSt.3d 463, 2004-Ohio-5717, ¶ 11. For the moving defendant to prevail, it must appear\nfrom the face of the complaint that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts that would\nentitle them to relief. Id.\n        B. First Assignment of Error\n        {¶ 16} Under his first assignment of error, appellant asserts he has standing to sue\n(1) under common-law standing because the threatened intra-class discrimination here is\nsufficient to meet the standard for an \"injury,\" (2) under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\nR.C. 2721.03, or (3) by virtue of appellant being an active participant in Ohio's Ryan\nWhite Part B Program giving him a \"real interest\" in the subject matter under State ex. rel\nDallman v. Court of Common Pleas, 35 Ohio St.2d 176 (1973).3 As a preliminary matter,\nwe note that the trial court also determined, as an independent basis to grant the motion\nto dismiss, that the claim is not ripe for review. Appellant did not appeal this holding.\nRegardless, for the following reasons, we disagree with appellant's arguments regarding\nstanding.\n        1. Appellant's Alleged Threatened \"Injury\" Is Not Sufficient\n        Under The Common-Law Standing Standard.\n\n        {¶ 17} Standing does not consider the merits of the plaintiff's claim but instead\nfocuses on \"whether the plaintiffs have alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the\ncontroversy that they are entitled to have a court hear their case.\" ProgressOhio.org, Inc.\n\n3 Although appellant raised an argument for statutory standing under 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(3) of the ADA\nat oral argument, appellant did not present a claim of discrimination under 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(3) in his\ncomplaint, argue this theory to the trial court in opposing the motion to dismiss, or brief this standing\nargument on appeal. \"A party may not change its theory of the case and present new arguments for the\nfirst time on appeal.\" Clifton Care Ctr. v. Ohio Dept. of Job & Family Servs., 10th Dist. No. 12AP-709,\n2013-Ohio-2742, ¶ 13. Neither may a party advance new arguments in its reply brief or at oral argument.\nId.; Andreyko v. Cincinnati, 153 Ohio App.3d 108, 2003-Ohio-2759, ¶ 20, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(b) and\n16(A)(7). See also App.R. 21(I) (\"If counsel on oral argument intends to present authorities not cited in\nthe brief, counsel shall, at least five days prior to oral argument, present in writing such authorities to the\ncourt and to opposing counsel, unless there is good cause for a later presentment.\"). Therefore, we will\nlimit our scope of review to examining those standing arguments asserted in appellant's brief.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                          8\n\n\nv. JobsOhio, 139 Ohio St.3d 520, 2014-Ohio-2382, ¶ 7. Generally, to establish common-\nlaw standing, a plaintiff must show that they suffered \"(1) an injury that is (2) fairly\ntraceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct, and (3) likely to be redressed by\nthe requested relief.\" Moore at ¶ 22.\n        {¶ 18} Appellant argues that, contrary to the trial court's decision, the threatened\nintra-class discrimination here is sufficient to establish an injury to establish common-law\nstanding. We disagree.\n        {¶ 19} Generally, threatened injuries, including threatened discrimination, may\nserve as an \"injury\" for common-law standing purposes.4 State ex rel. Ohio Academy of\nTrial Lawyers v. Sheward, 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 469 (1999). Where a private litigant\nattacks the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, he or she must show threat of an\ninjury in a manner or degree different from that suffered by the public in general. Id. at\n469-70. However, the asserted threatened injury cannot be so remote as to be \"merely\nspeculative.\"     Wurdlow v. Turvy, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-25, 2012-Ohio-4378, ¶ 15.\nSpecifically, the plaintiff must show in the pleadings that he or she is threatened with\n\"direct and concrete injury.\" Sheward at 469. See also Stark-Tuscarawas-Wayne Joint\nSolid Waste Mgt. Dist. v. Republic Waste Servs. of Ohio II, LLC, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-599,\n2009-Ohio-2143, ¶ 24. Said another way, the plaintiff must demonstrate \"a realistic\ndanger arising from the challenged action.\"             Id., quoting Johnson's Island Property\nOwners' Assn. v. Schregardus, 10th Dist. No. 96APH10-1330 (June 30, 1997). See also\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 563-65 (1992) (discussing the federal\nrequirement that a threatened injury be \"imminent\"); Clapper v. Amnesty Interntl. USA,\n133 S.Ct. 1138, 1150 (2013) (holding that in order to establish injury-in-fact based on a\npotential future injury, that injury must be \"certainly impending,\" a test not established\nby the appellant's \"speculative chain of possibilities\").\n        {¶ 20} Here, the complaint alleges appellant is an Ohio resident living with an\nHIV infection who currently utilizes OHDAP, a program which supplies potentially life-\nsaving drugs which can cost as much as $10,000-$40,000 per year, per patient.\n\n4 Under the public-right doctrine outlined in Sheward, a plaintiff may also assert threatened injuries\ninvolving issues \"of great importance and interest to the public\" without having to establish the common-\nlaw injury requirement of standing. Id. at 471. However, \"the public-right doctrine applies only to\noriginal actions in mandamus and/or prohibition.\" ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 10.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                        9\n\n\nHowever, appellant does not plead information regarding the potential for a program\nfunding shortfall to trigger those appendices which appellant alleges are discriminatory.\nNeither does appellant plead any information regarding his own medical or financial\nstatus showing whether and how possible implementation of the two appendices would\naffect him.\n       {¶ 21} We find, under these facts, that the threatened discrimination alleged is too\nremote to appellant to constitute an injury for purposes of common-law standing.5\nTherefore, appellant's argument based on an injury under common-law standing fails.\n       2. Appellant Failed To Establish The Three Prerequisites To\n       Declaratory Relief Under Ohio's Declaratory Judgment Act, R.C.\n       2721.03.\n\n       {¶ 22} Appellant asserts that, as an active participant in Ohio's Ryan White Part B\nProgram, he has standing under Ohio's Declaratory Judgment Act, R.C. 2721.03, and\nsuggests that declaratory actions do not require the traditional \"injury\" standard.\nPursuant to Ohio's declaratory judgment action statute, R.C. 2721.03:\n               [A]ny person * * * whose rights, status, or other legal relations\n               are affected by a * * * rule as defined in section 119.01 of the\n               Revised Code * * * may have determined any question of\n               construction or validity arising under the * * * rule * * * and\n               obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations\n               under it.\n\n       {¶ 23} A declaratory judgment action is a civil proceeding that provides a remedy\nin addition to other available legal and equitable remedies. Wurdlow at ¶ 12, citing\nWalker v. Ghee, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-960 (Jan. 29, 2002). A declaratory judgment action\ncannot be used to elicit a merely advisory opinion. Id. at ¶ 14. Thus, a plaintiff must\nplead \"three prerequisites to declaratory relief\": (1) a real controversy between the parties,\n(2) justiciability, and (3) the necessity of speedy relief to preserve the parties' rights.\nProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 19; Moore at ¶ 49 (\"Courts have the duty to ensure that\nplaintiffs plead [three prerequisites to declaratory relief].\").\n\n\n5  Appellant's proposed second amended complaint, denied by the trial court, offered additional\ninformation regarding whether appellant may be considered an \"applicant\" subject to Appendix A,\nregardless of his current enrollee status, but does not provide information bearing on the other injury\nimpediments.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                           10\n\n\n        {¶ 24} Additionally, \"[a]s with other forms of action, a plaintiff must establish\nstanding as a proper plaintiff to seek declaratory relief.\" Wurdlow at ¶ 14. See also\nMoore at ¶ 49 (\"Courts have the duty to ensure that plaintiffs plead [the three\nprerequisite] elements for purposes of declaratory-judgment actions and that the\ncomplaint sufficiently avers injury, causation, and redressability.\"); ProgressOhio.org,\nInc. at ¶ 7, quoting Ohio Pyro, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of State Fire\nMarshal, 115 Ohio St.3d 375, 2007-Ohio-5024, ¶ 27 (\" 'Before an Ohio court can consider\nthe merits of a legal claim, the person or entity seeking relief must establish standing to\nsue.' \").\n        {¶ 25} Here, under this court's precedent in Wurdlow, a plaintiff must establish\nstanding to seek declaratory relief and, as discussed throughout this decision, appellant\nhas failed to do so.6 Id. at ¶ 14. Moreover, appellant failed to show the \"three\nprerequisites to declaratory relief\"—controversy, justiciability, and necessity of speedy\nrelief—at the pleading stage. ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 17-19 (finding, in considering\nappellant's R.C. 2721.03 standing argument, that appellant failed to plead prerequisites\nto declaratory relief); Moore at ¶ 49 (\"Courts have the duty to ensure that plaintiffs\nplead [three prerequisites] for purposes of declaratory-judgment actions * * *. [O]ur\ngenerosity is tempered by an insistence on sufficiency in the pleadings. If a party fails to\nestablish any of the necessary showings to bring the claims, the judge must dismiss the\ncause.\").\n        {¶ 26} Specifically, appellant provided information, previously discussed, which\nwas insufficient to establish the \"immediacy and reality\" required to constitute a\ncontroversy. Burger Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control Comm., Dept. of Liquor Control, 34\nOhio St.2d 93, 97 (1973), quoting Peltz v. S. Euclid, 11 Ohio St.2d 128, 131 (1967). The\ncomplaint also fails to establish justiciability, which includes consideration of whether\nthe case is ripe for judicial review. Natl. Park Hospitality Assn. v. Dept. of Interior, 538\nU.S. 803, 807-08 (2003), quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49\n(1967) (\"Ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed 'to prevent the courts, through\n\n6 To the extent that appellant suggests R.C. 2721.03, the legislative source of a cause of action for\ndeclaratory relief, may also confer standing upon a plaintiff independently from other sources of standing,\nwe note that this is an unsettled issue but one not dispositive under the facts of this case. See\nProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 17-19; Moore at ¶ 48-49.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                             11\n\n\navoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract\ndisagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from\njudicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects\nfelt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.' \"). As noted, the trial court ruled the\ncase was not ripe, and appellant does not challenge this holding on appeal. Finally,\nwithout any information regarding the potential for a funding shortage and any\ninformation regarding appellant's medical status as it relates to Appendix A priority and\nfinancial status as it relates to Appendix B, the complaint here falls short of establishing\nthe necessity of speedy relief to preserve appellant's access to program services.\nTherefore, in addition to not establishing standing, appellant has not pleaded the\nprerequisites to bring a declaratory action.\n       3. Appellant's Active Participation In Ohio's Ryan White Part B\n       Program Does Not Provide Him With An Independent Source Of\n       Standing Under The \"Real Interest\" Analysis In Dallman.\n\n       {¶ 27} Appellant appears to cite Dallman as an independent source for standing.\nThe syllabus of Dallman states: \"A party lacks standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the\ncourt unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the\nsubject matter of the action.\"\n       {¶ 28} Appellant does not provide authority showing how Dallman, which\naddresses a civil procedure requirement which may defeat standing, may also\nindependently establish a new test for standing. Id. at 179. Moreover, the real-party-in-\ninterest doctrine requires the plaintiff to show that he or she suffered an injury. Mousa v.\nMt. Carmel Health Sys., Inc., 10th Dist. No. 12AP-737, 2013-Ohio-2661, ¶ 12 (\"Because a\nreal party in interest is an individual who has suffered an injury in a matter, a party lacks\nstanding if not a real party in interest.\"). See also Shealy v. Campbell, 20 Ohio St.3d 23,\n24 (1985) (describing real party in interest as \"one who is directly benefitted or injured by\nthe outcome of the case\"). (Emphasis sic.)\n       {¶ 29} Here, appellant's previously established lack of injury necessarily defeats his\nargument regarding having a \"real interest\" in the subject matter under Dallman. To the\nextent that appellant also asserts the rights of other participants within Ohio's Ryan White\nPart B Program, we note that a pro se plaintiff may generally only represent himself and\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                             12\n\n\nthat, as discussed in footnote 4 of this decision, the procedural posture of this action does\nnot permit claims under the public-interest doctrine outlined in Sheward. Williams v.\nGriffith, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-28, 2009-Ohio-4045, ¶ 15; ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 9-10.\n       {¶ 30} Lastly, as an adjunct to his main standing arguments, appellant calls\nattention to the trial court's previous grant of injunctions at the outset of the case.\nThough the trial court did grant temporary and preliminary injunctions arising out of the\noriginal complaint, those rulings were particular to the allegations in that complaint\npertaining to the lack of a hearing prior to enacting the rule, an issue not presented in the\namended complaint, and do not bear on the standing issues brought on appeal.\n       {¶ 31} Accordingly, for the above-stated reasons, appellant's first assignment of\nerror is overruled.\n       C. Second Assignment of Error\n       {¶ 32} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court had a\n\"compulsory duty\" to determine whether the rule was constitutionally and statutorily\nvalid and presents the substance of his claim that the rule violates the ADA, the\nRehabilitation Act, and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. and Ohio constitutions.\n(Emphasis sic.) (Appellant's Brief, 17.)\n       {¶ 33} The law is clear that, before a court can address the merits of a claim, the\nlitigant must establish standing to sue. ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 7, 11; Article IV,\nSection 4(B), Ohio Constitution. As discussed in the first assignment of error, appellant\nhas not established standing to sue. Therefore, the trial court was correct in refusing to\naddress the merits of his claim.\n       {¶ 34} Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n       D. Third Assignment of Error\n       {¶ 35} In his third assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court\ncommitted a procedural error \"by stating that the Appellant had known that the court was\nawaiting on further information from the Appellant when all parties had known that this\naction was declaratory\" and that court delay \"obstructed the Appellant from receiving a\nfinal appealable order in a timely fashion,\" resulting in prejudicial error. (Appellant's\nBrief, 22, 23.)\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                              13\n\n\n       {¶ 36} Beyond indication that a status conference was scheduled for January 29,\n2014, the record on appeal contains no information from which this court could consider\nappellant's argument regarding a procedural error and how it impacted any alleged delay.\nFurther, our review of the record shows the trial court promptly issued decisions and\nentries in response to the parties' filings prior to the stay of the proceedings in April 2013\nand that appellant jointly filed a motion to stay the proceedings and then jointly requested\nto continue the stay in November 2013. As previously stated, we have no record of the\nJanuary 2014 status conference. Under these facts and on this record, we are unable to\nfind prejudicial judicial delay in the trial court's issuance of the decision and entry on\nNovember 21, 2014.\n       {¶ 37} Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n       {¶ 38} Having overruled appellant's three assignments of error, we affirm the\njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n                                                                         Judgment affirmed.\n                                  DORRIAN, J., concurs.\n                                  BRUNNER, J., dissents.\n\nBRUNNER, J., dissenting.\n       {¶ 39} I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority, as I believe appellant\nhas standing to bring his cause of action pursuant to the declaratory judgment statute,\nR.C. 2721.03. That section provides:\n              [A]ny person interested * * * whose rights, status, or other\n              legal relations are affected by a * * * rule as defined in section\n              119.01 of the Revised Code, * * * may have determined any\n              question of construction or validity arising under the * * *\n              rule, * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other\n              legal relations under it.\n\n       {¶ 40} Appellant is an Ohio resident living with an HIV infection who currently\nutilizes a federal program administered through the state of Ohio, known in Ohio as the\nOhio HIV Drug Assistance Program (\"OHDAP\"). OHDAP is a program that supplies\ndrugs that can cost as much as $10,000-$40,000 per year, per patient. The majority\nfinds that appellant does not plead information regarding the potential for a program\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                           14\n\n\nsupply or funding shortfall that would trigger the application of the R.C. 119 rule\nappendices in question to \"ration\" medication to him according to supply. It is on this\npoint that I diverge from the majority. His status and R.C. 2721.03 confer him standing.\n        {¶ 41} Article IV, Section 4(B), Ohio Constitution provides that the common pleas\ncourts' jurisdiction is established by law:\n                The courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have\n                such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters and such\n                powers of review of proceedings of administrative officers and\n                agencies as may be provided by law.\n\nIt is the duty of the Ohio General Assembly to pass laws. \"The legislative power of the\nstate shall be vested in a General Assembly consisting of a Senate and House of\nRepresentatives but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose to the General\nAssembly laws.\" Article II, Section 1, Ohio Constitution. Further, Article II, Section 15(B),\nOhio Constitution provides: \"The style of the laws of this state shall be, 'be it enacted by\nthe General Assembly of the state of Ohio.' \" (Emphasis added.) When the legislature\nconfers standing by a law, it is not the province of the court to dispel it. Appellant pled\nR.C. 2721.03 in his complaint and has sought a finding of constitutionality of the rule in\nquestion. With good reason, he does not wish to wait until his access to the potentially\nlife-saving medication is threatened by either supply or funding. He has a right to have\nhis case heard.\n        {¶ 42} A statute conferring standing and pled by a party in his complaint7 can only\nbe parsed so much to allow courts to avoid hearing matters concerning an administrative\nrule's validity. The majority cites Wurdlow v. Turvy, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-25, 2012-Ohio-\n4378, ¶ 15, for the proposition that a claimed injury cannot be so remote as to be \"merely\nspeculative.\" Wurdlow involved parking regulations, not access to life-saving medication.\nThe interests involved and the damage that could occur by waiting until harm is imminent\nare not appropriately addressed by our reasoning in Wurdlow. That a threatened injury\nmust be \"imminent\" or \"certainly impending\" takes on a different meaning in the context\n\n\n7 The plaintiffs in ProgressOhio.org, Inc. v. JobsOhio, 139 Ohio St.3d 520, 2014-Ohio-2382, did not plead\nstatutory standing. \"Appellants raised no claim of standing under R.C. 2721.03 in the lower courts.\" Id. at\n¶ 18. Therefore, ProgressOhio.org, Inc.'s holding on declaratory judgment is inapposite as to appellant's\nsituation.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                           15\n\n\nof pharmaceutical protocols and their organic effects on patients with HIV. There is\nample authority in case law that recognizes the status of individuals suffering from HIV,\nsuch that this distinction could have and should have been made.            The majority's\nreasoning in applying the language in State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v.\nSheward, 86 Ohio St.3d 451, 469-70 (1999), that appellant must show threat of an injury\nin a manner or degree different from that suffered by the public in general, fails to\nrecognize that an individual living with HIV is not considered to be as the public in\ngeneral.\n      {¶ 43} Other courts in determining constitutional questions have closely examined\nthe nature of HIV. One such court, in the context of determining segregation of HIV from\nnon-HIV prisoners, said this:\n             The human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is a chronic\n             disease. If left untreated, it weakens the immune system and\n             eventually leads to death. The disease unfolds in several\n             stages. Soon after contracting the virus, an infected person\n             enters acute infection. During this time, the person's viral load\n             (the extent to which the virus is present in the blood) rockets\n             upward. People in this stage of the disease can have hundreds\n             of thousands of copies of the virus. Despite that, people in this\n             stage test negative for HIV. This phase, known as the \"window\n             period,\" generally lasts for a few weeks, but can extend as long\n             as three months, and the people experiencing it represent the\n             most infectious group of individuals with HIV.\n\n             Acute HIV gives way to chronic-HIV infection. During this\n             stage, the viral load lowers. The final stage, advanced-HIV\n             infection, occurs when the body's CD4 T-cells, which play a\n             critical role in the immune system, drop to low levels and the\n             viral load rises. More commonly, this final stage is known as\n             acquired immunodeficiency virus, or AIDS.\n\n             HIV emerged in the United States in the early 1980s and soon\n             grew into an epidemic. HIV inevitably progressed to AIDS.\n             Virtually everyone infected died. Meanwhile, no one,\n             including the medical community, understood how HIV was\n             transmitted. Fearing that even casual contact could spread it,\n             doctors treating patients with HIV wore protective gear so\n             extensive it was nicknamed a \"space suit.\" The profound\n             consequences of the disease, combined with lack of knowledge\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                            16\n\n\n              about how it could spread, created an era of hysteria in the\n              epidemic's early days.\n\n              The tide began to turn in the decade that followed. In 1996,\n              the first protease inhibitors were approved to treat HIV.\n              Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), emerged as an\n              effective weapon against the disease. These treatments did not\n              eliminate the virus, but they did restrict its ability to progress\n              and could stave off AIDS. However, while important\n              developments, early treatment combinations had many\n              deficiencies. The medications had to be administered multiple\n              times each day; they had severe side effects, including\n              diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy; and because the regimes\n              were so complicated and so punished patients with side\n              effects, many HIV patients failed to take their medication.\n\n              Today, advances in HIV treatment have profoundly changed\n              the disease. There is still no cure for HIV: indeed, there is only\n              one known case in which a person was completely cured of it.\n              However, modern treatment regimes have rendered it\n              manageable. The vast majority of HIV patients can be treated\n              by one pill once a day; side effects are less severe, and, where\n              they do occur, multiple treatment options allow patients to try\n              different medications until they find one that works; and,\n              most importantly, although people with HIV will require\n              treatment for their entire lives, HIV is no longer invariably\n              fatal. People who receive treatment for HIV can expect to\n              enjoy near-normal lifespans.\n\n(Emphasis added; footnote deleted.) Henderson v. Thomas, 913 F.Supp.2d 1267, 1276-77\n(M.D.Ala.2012).\n       {¶ 44} No one, including appellant, can determine with any degree of certainty a\nstate budget's viability or the industry factors affecting the availability of medication\nadministered by the state under a federal program. Such forces lie outside of any one\nindividual's control. While the federal program may \"go away,\" a state's decisions in how\nto administer it while it is here are subject to review. Based on the nature of the disease,\nappellant's \"injury\" is established by his status. He is a participant in a program and his\naccess to medication administered by it is subject to loss according to a state promulgated\nrule. He has a right to challenge how that rule's implementation will affect him. Were\nappellant to wait to file suit until supply shortages were imminent, he could be threatened\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                  17\n\n\nwith interruption of a sustained therapeutic medical protocol, having to wait for the\noutcome of the litigation. Additionally, he could be confronted with a defense of laches\nfor not having brought this suit in the aftermath of challenging the rule at the\nadministrative level through procedures set forth in R.C. Chapter 119.\n       {¶ 45} Courts cannot deny standing when the legislature has conferred it through\nstatutes such as R.C. 2721.03, the declaratory judgment statute.             The power of the\ncommon pleas court to determine the constitutionality of the rule should have been\nexercised.   \" 'It is the right and duty of judicial tribunals to determine, whether a\nlegislative act drawn in question in a suit pending before them, is opposed to the\nconstitution of the United States, or of this State, and if so found, to treat it as a nullity.' \"\n(Emphasis added.)

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n        {¶ 2} This case concerns the standing of appellant to challenge in a civil action for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief a rule promulgated by ODH that alters certain eligibility\nprotocols, if Ohio's \"Ryan White Part B\" program suffers a future funding shortfall.\n        {¶ 3} Ohio's Ryan White Part B program, which includes the Ohio HIV Drug\nAssistance Program (\"OHDAP\"), arose under the federal Ryan White Act \"Part B - Care\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                 2\n\n\nGrant Program.\" 42 U.S.C. 300ff-21. Part B permits the federal government, \"subject to\nthe availability of appropriations,\" to provide grants to enable applicant states \"to improve\nthe quality, availability and organization of health care and support services for\nindividuals and families with HIV/AIDS.\" Applicant states must provide an assurance\nthat the state will, \"to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that HIV-related health\ncare and support services delivered pursuant to a program established with assistance\n* * * provided without regard to the ability of the individual to pay for such services and\nwithout regard to the current or past health condition of the individual with HIV/AIDS.\"\n42 U.S.C. 300ff-27(b)(7)(B)(i). A state may use the grants to support core medical\nservices, including drug assistance programs, as well as certain support services and\nadministrative expenses.\n          {¶ 4} The Ohio legislature charged ODH with administering the Ohio Ryan White\nPart B program, and in R.C. 3701.241(D) allows its director discretion to adopt rules and\nissue orders as necessary for administration of the funds. In September 2011, appellees\nbegan the administrative rule-making process to revise the code section pertaining to\neligibility for benefits under the Ohio Ryan White Part B program, now numbered Ohio\nAdm.Code 37o1-44-03.\n          {¶ 5} The two appendices which support Ohio Adm.Code 37o1-44-03 are central\nto this appeal. Appendix A establishes medical guidelines to determine the priority in\nwhich an applicant would receive OHDAP services, including access to medications, if a\nwaiting list forms due to insufficient funds.1 Appendix B provides the director of ODH\n\n\n1   Ohio Adm. Code 37o1-44-03, Appendix A: Medical Guidelines, reads:\n\n                  These additional medical guidelines only apply to applications to the\n                  Ohio HIV Drug Assistance Program (OHDAP).\n                  When OHDAP has a waiting list for program enrollment and subject to\n                  sufficient funding, applicants to the Ryan White Part B programs must\n                  meet one of the following medical guidelines to be eligible for expedited\n                  enrollment:\n                  1. Pregnant women who meet all OHDAP eligibility criteria and who are\n                  not eligible for other programs which provide antiretroviral (ARV)\n                  medications.\n                  2. Post partum women (women who [have] given birth within 180 days\n                  prior to applying to OHDAP) who meet all OHDAP eligibility criteria and\n                  who are not eligible for other programs which provide antiretroviral\n                  (ARV) medications.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                               3\n\n\nwith discretion to reduce the maximum gross family income threshold from 300 percent\nof the federal poverty level (\"FPL\") to no less than 100 percent of the FPL, if there is\ninsufficient funding to sustain current services of the program.2\n\n\n              If the OHDAP is able to enroll some but not all individuals from the\n              waiting list (based on insufficient funds), applications from individuals\n              who meet all OHDAP eligibility criteria and who are not eligible for other\n              programs which provide ARV medications will be prioritized as follows:\n              Priority 1: Individuals with HIV and other extreme medical conditions\n              such as, but not limited to, HIV-associated nephropathy or HIV related\n              dementia. The applicant’s HIV-treating physician or nurse practitioner\n              shall complete a medical waiver request consistent with section 3701-44-\n              04 of the Ohio Administrative Code.\n              Priority 2: Individuals with a history of AIDS-defining illness [see\n              paragraph (C) of Appendix A to section 3701-3-12 of the Ohio\n              Administrative Code for indicator diseases diagnosed definitively] and/or\n              a nadir CD4 count of less than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 (or less than\n              14%). Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating physician or\n              nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this priority.\n              Priority 3: Individuals with HIV and a nadir CD4 count between 201-350\n              cells/mm3. Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating\n              physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this\n              priority.\n              Priority 4: Individuals with HIV and a nadir CD4 count between 351-500\n              cells/mm3. Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating\n              physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this\n              priority.\n              Priority 5: Individuals with HIV and a nadir CD4 count above 500\n              cells/mm3. Documentation shall be provided by the HIV-treating\n              physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the individual meets this\n              priority.\n              Individuals on the waiting list should notify OHDAP if there is\n              deterioration in their health. Individuals who submit documentation by\n              the HIV-treating physician or nurse practitioner evidencing how the\n              individual meets one of the above listed priorities will move to the\n              appropriate priority while retaining their original waiting list date.\n\n2 Ohio Adm.Code 37o1-44-03, Appendix B: Financial Eligibility Guidelines for OHDAP/HIPP/\nSpenddown, reads:\n\n              Applicants to the Ryan White Part B programs must meet the following\n              financial guidelines to be eligible:\n              1. The individual or individual's family gross income must be equal to or\n              less than three hundred percent (300%) of the Federal Poverty Level\n              (FPL) as published in the Federal Register on or before the first of April\n              of each calendar year.\n              2. The calculation shall exclude taxes and any mandatory retirement\n              deduction.\n              Eligibility in Ryan White Part B programs is subject to sufficient funding.\n              Pursuant to division (D) of section 3701.241 of the Revised Code and\n              paragraph (C) of this rule, if there is insufficient funding to sustain\n              current services, the director may, at any time and as necessary for the\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                             4\n\n\n       {¶ 6} On November 2, 2011, appellant filed a complaint asking the court to\ndeclare Ohio Adm.Code 3701-44-03 unenforceable as proposed and asking the court for\ntemporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin ODH from enforcing\nthe rule. Appellant contended that Appendices A and B amounted to a material\nmodification of the new rule that necessitated another public hearing under the rule-\nmaking process in Chapter 119 of the Revised Code. The trial court issued an order\ntemporarily restraining ODH from enforcing or implementing the proposed rule until the\ncourt resolved whether to grant declaratory or injunctive relief.\n       {¶ 7} A few weeks later, the trial court granted appellant's motion for a\npreliminary injunction, enjoining the rule from taking effect until appellees held a public\nhearing in compliance with Chapter 119 of the Revised Code. Analyzing the \"irreparable\nharm\" element of injunction, the trial court found \"[a]t this juncture, [appellant] merely\nseek[s] a[n] R.C. 119.03 public hearing by which [he] may voice [his] opinion on this new\nrule. * * * The disenfranchisement of an affected person to be heard on new rules that\nwould substantially change his or her life constitutes irreparable harm.\" (Nov. 29, 2011\nEntry Granting Preliminary Injunction, 9-10.)\n       {¶ 8} On August 27, 2012, appellees filed a notice of compliance with the court's\norder to properly promulgate the rule under R.C. 119 processes and filed a motion to\ndismiss asserting a lack of controversy. That same day, appellant filed a motion to file an\namended complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order.\n       {¶ 9} On August 28, 2012, the trial court denied appellees' motion to dismiss,\ngranted appellant leave to file an amended complaint, and denied appellant's motion for a\ntemporary restraining order, stating: \"[a] temporary restraining order contemplates a\nsituation where there is an unusual emergency with the imminent threat of harm that\nrequires immediate court consideration. The Court finds that [appellant] failed to satisfy\nthe necessary elements set forth in Civ.R. 65(A) for a temporary restraining order.\"\n(Aug. 29, 2012 Order and Entry, 1-2.) Ohio Adm.Code 3701-44-03 became effective\nAugust 30, 2012.\n\n              effective administration of available funds, issue an order, reducing the\n              maximum gross family income set forth in this appendix for some or all\n              Ryan White Part B programs, but at no time shall the maximum be less\n              than 100% of the FPL.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                              5\n\n\n       {¶ 10} In the amended complaint, the touchstone for this appeal, appellant asserts\nan action to declare Ohio Adm.Code 37o1-44-03 unlawful and to enjoin its enforcement\ndue to the rule's violation of the Ohio Administrative Procedures Act, the Ryan White Act,\nthe Rehabilitation Act, the American with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), and both the Ohio and\nU.S. Constitutions. The amended complaint states that appellant resides in Franklin\nCounty, Ohio, has a verified HIV infection, and currently receives benefits under the Ryan\nWhite Part B Program. The amended complaint also describes the medications funded by\nthe program as \"potentially life-saving\" and potentially costing \"as much as $10,000-\n$40,000 per year, per patient.\" (Aug. 27, 2012 Verified Amended Complaint, 1, 3.)\n       {¶ 11} On September 28, 2012, appellees filed a motion to dismiss the amended\ncomplaint based, in part, on Civ.R. 12(B)(1) for lack of jurisdiction and Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for\nfailure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. On October 25, 2012, appellant\nfiled a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and, the next day, filed a\nmemorandum in opposition to appellees' motion to dismiss. Appellees filed a reply to\nappellant's memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss on November 2, 2012,\nand a memorandum contra to appellant's motion for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint on November 8, 2012.\n       {¶ 12} On April 1, 2013, the parties jointly moved the court to stay the proceedings\npending a status conference with the court in November of that year to discuss the future\n\"unknown\" status of OHDAP in light of the Affordable Care Act. The trial court granted\nthe parties' motion to stay and, after the November status conference, also granted the\nparties' request to continue the stay until further order of the court.\n       {¶ 13} On November 21, 2014, the trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss\nbased on Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and denied appellant's motion for leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint. In so holding, the trial court found that appellant alleged only \"a potential\ninjury based upon [appellees'] conceivable response to a possible scenario (insufficiency\nof funds) outside of [appellant's] and [appellees'] control\" and, as such, did not assert a\nspecific injury that could be redressed by a court decision. (Emphasis sic.) (Nov. 21, 2014\nDecision and Entry, 4.) As an additional basis to grant the motion to dismiss, the court\nalso determined that the claims presented by appellant were not yet ripe for review.\nFinally, the trial court determined that the new information in appellant's proposed\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                          6\n\n\nsecond amended complaint, relevant to whether appellant was an \"applicant\" subject to\nAppendix A, nonetheless did \"not cure [appellant's] standing problem.\" (Nov. 21, 2014\nDecision and Entry, 6.)\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n      {¶ 14} Appellant presents three assignments of error for our review:\n             I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND HAD ABUSED ITS\n             DISCRETION IN GRANTING DEFENDANT-APPELLEE\n             OHIO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH’S MOTION TO DISMISS\n             BY CONCLUDING THAT THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT\n             LACKED STANDING TO BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION\n             BASED ON A LACK OF INJURY WHEN APPELLANT HAS\n             STANDING TO REQUEST DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n\n             II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND HAD ABUSED ITS\n             DISCRETION BY ALLOWING THE REPROMULGATED\n             RULES CREATED BY AN ABUSE OF AGENCY DISCRETION\n             TO REMAIN IN EFFECT THAT CONFLICT WITH AND\n             VIOLATE THE AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT,\n             REHABILITATION ACT, DUE PROCESS CLAUSES OF THE\n             OHIO AND U.S. CONSTITUTION, RYAN WHITE\n             TREATMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2009, AND\n             THE OHIO ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT.\n\n             III. THE TRIAL COURT HAD COMMITTED A PRO-\n             CEDURAL ERROR AND HAD ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN\n             ITS DETERMINATION THAT THE COURT HAD\n             INSTRUCTED THE PLAINTIFF THAT IT WAS WAITING\n             FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INJURY WHEN IN\n             FACT ALL PARTIES HAD KNOWN THAT THIS CAUSE OF\n             ACTION WAS DECLARATORY IN NATURE AND NOT\n             RULING ON ALL PREVIOUS PENDING MOTIONS IN AT\n             [sic] TIMELY MANNER.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n      A. Standard of Review\n      {¶ 15} Whether a party has established standing to bring an action before the court\nis generally a question of law reviewed de novo on appeal. Moore v. Middletown, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012-Ohio-3897, ¶ 20. Likewise, a trial court's order granting a Civ.R.\n12(B)(6) motion to dismiss is subject to de novo appellate review.

When reviewing a Civ.R. 12(B)(6)\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                                7\n\n\nmotion to dismiss, the court may consider only the statements and facts considered in the\npleadings and may not consider or rely on evidence outside of the complaint. Brown v.\nColumbus City Schools Bd. of Edn., 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1067, 2009-Ohio-3230, ¶ 4. The\ncourt must accept the material allegations of the complaint as true and make all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. Maitland v. Ford Motor Co., 103 Ohio\nSt.3d 463, 2004-Ohio-5717, ¶ 11. For the moving defendant to prevail, it must appear\nfrom the face of the complaint that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts that would\nentitle them to relief. Id.\n        B. First Assignment of Error\n        {¶ 16} Under his first assignment of error, appellant asserts he has standing to sue\n(1) under common-law standing because the threatened intra-class discrimination here is\nsufficient to meet the standard for an \"injury,\" (2) under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\nR.C. 2721.03, or (3) by virtue of appellant being an active participant in Ohio's Ryan\nWhite Part B Program giving him a \"real interest\" in the subject matter under State ex. rel\nDallman v. Court of Common Pleas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).3 As a preliminary matter,\nwe note that the trial court also determined, as an independent basis to grant the motion\nto dismiss, that the claim is not ripe for review. Appellant did not appeal this holding.\nRegardless, for the following reasons, we disagree with appellant's arguments regarding\nstanding.\n        1.

Appellant Failed To Establish The Three Prerequisites To\n       Declaratory Relief Under Ohio's Declaratory Judgment Act, R.C.\n       2721.03.\n\n       {¶ 22} Appellant asserts that, as an active participant in Ohio's Ryan White Part B\nProgram, he has standing under Ohio's Declaratory Judgment Act, R.C. 2721.03, and\nsuggests that declaratory actions do not require the traditional \"injury\" standard.\nPursuant to Ohio's declaratory judgment action statute, R.C. 2721.03:\n               [A]ny person * * * whose rights, status, or other legal relations\n               are affected by a * * * rule as defined in section 119.01 of the\n               Revised Code * * * may have determined any question of\n               construction or validity arising under the * * * rule * * * and\n               obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations\n               under it.\n\n       {¶ 23} A declaratory judgment action is a civil proceeding that provides a remedy\nin addition to other available legal and equitable remedies. Wurdlow at ¶ 12, citing\nWalker v. Ghee, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-960 (Jan. 29, 2002). A declaratory judgment action\ncannot be used to elicit a merely advisory opinion. Id. at ¶ 14. Thus, a plaintiff must\nplead \"three prerequisites to declaratory relief\": (1) a real controversy between the parties,\n(2) justiciability, and (3) the necessity of speedy relief to preserve the parties' rights.\nProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 19; Moore at ¶ 49 (\"Courts have the duty to ensure that\nplaintiffs plead [three prerequisites to declaratory relief].\").\n\n\n5  Appellant's proposed second amended complaint, denied by the trial court, offered additional\ninformation regarding whether appellant may be considered an \"applicant\" subject to Appendix A,\nregardless of his current enrollee status, but does not provide information bearing on the other injury\nimpediments.\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                           10\n\n\n        {¶ 24} Additionally, \"[a]s with other forms of action, a plaintiff must establish\nstanding as a proper plaintiff to seek declaratory relief.\" Wurdlow at ¶ 14.

Moreover, appellant failed to show the \"three\nprerequisites to declaratory relief\"—controversy, justiciability, and necessity of speedy\nrelief—at the pleading stage. ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 17-19 (finding, in considering\nappellant's R.C. 2721.03 standing argument, that appellant failed to plead prerequisites\nto declaratory relief); Moore at ¶ 49 (\"Courts have the duty to ensure that plaintiffs\nplead [three prerequisites] for purposes of declaratory-judgment actions * * *.

As noted, the trial court ruled the\ncase was not ripe, and appellant does not challenge this holding on appeal. Finally,\nwithout any information regarding the potential for a funding shortage and any\ninformation regarding appellant's medical status as it relates to Appendix A priority and\nfinancial status as it relates to Appendix B, the complaint here falls short of establishing\nthe necessity of speedy relief to preserve appellant's access to program services.\nTherefore, in addition to not establishing standing, appellant has not pleaded the\nprerequisites to bring a declaratory action.\n       3. Appellant's Active Participation In Ohio's Ryan White Part B\n       Program Does Not Provide Him With An Independent Source Of\n       Standing Under The \"Real Interest\" Analysis In Dallman.\n\n       {¶ 27} Appellant appears to cite Dallman as an independent source for standing.\nThe syllabus of Dallman states: \"A party lacks standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the\ncourt unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the\nsubject matter of the action.\"\n       {¶ 28} Appellant does not provide authority showing how Dallman, which\naddresses a civil procedure requirement which may defeat standing, may also\nindependently establish a new test for standing. Id. at 179. Moreover, the real-party-in-\ninterest doctrine requires the plaintiff to show that he or she suffered an injury. Mousa v.\nMt. Carmel Health Sys., Inc., 10th Dist. No. 12AP-737, 2013-Ohio-2661, ¶ 12 (\"Because a\nreal party in interest is an individual who has suffered an injury in a matter, a party lacks\nstanding if not a real party in interest.\").

(Emphasis sic.)\n       {¶ 29} Here, appellant's previously established lack of injury necessarily defeats his\nargument regarding having a \"real interest\" in the subject matter under Dallman. To the\nextent that appellant also asserts the rights of other participants within Ohio's Ryan White\nPart B Program, we note that a pro se plaintiff may generally only represent himself and\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                             12\n\n\nthat, as discussed in footnote 4 of this decision, the procedural posture of this action does\nnot permit claims under the public-interest doctrine outlined in Sheward.

No. 09AP-28, 2009-Ohio-4045, ¶ 15; ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 9-10.\n       {¶ 30} Lastly, as an adjunct to his main standing arguments, appellant calls\nattention to the trial court's previous grant of injunctions at the outset of the case.\nThough the trial court did grant temporary and preliminary injunctions arising out of the\noriginal complaint, those rulings were particular to the allegations in that complaint\npertaining to the lack of a hearing prior to enacting the rule, an issue not presented in the\namended complaint, and do not bear on the standing issues brought on appeal.\n       {¶ 31} Accordingly, for the above-stated reasons, appellant's first assignment of\nerror is overruled.\n       C. Second Assignment of Error\n       {¶ 32} In his second assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court had a\n\"compulsory duty\" to determine whether the rule was constitutionally and statutorily\nvalid and presents the substance of his claim that the rule violates the ADA, the\nRehabilitation Act, and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. and Ohio constitutions.\n(Emphasis sic.) (Appellant's Brief, 17.)\n       {¶ 33} The law is clear that, before a court can address the merits of a claim, the\nlitigant must establish standing to sue. ProgressOhio.org, Inc. at ¶ 7, 11; Article IV,\nSection 4(B), Ohio Constitution. As discussed in the first assignment of error, appellant\nhas not established standing to sue. Therefore, the trial court was correct in refusing to\naddress the merits of his claim.\n       {¶ 34} Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error is overruled.\n       D. Third Assignment of Error\n       {¶ 35} In his third assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court\ncommitted a procedural error \"by stating that the Appellant had known that the court was\nawaiting on further information from the Appellant when all parties had known that this\naction was declaratory\" and that court delay \"obstructed the Appellant from receiving a\nfinal appealable order in a timely fashion,\" resulting in prejudicial error. (Appellant's\nBrief, 22, 23.)\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                              13\n\n\n       {¶ 36} Beyond indication that a status conference was scheduled for January 29,\n2014, the record on appeal contains no information from which this court could consider\nappellant's argument regarding a procedural error and how it impacted any alleged delay.\nFurther, our review of the record shows the trial court promptly issued decisions and\nentries in response to the parties' filings prior to the stay of the proceedings in April 2013\nand that appellant jointly filed a motion to stay the proceedings and then jointly requested\nto continue the stay in November 2013. As previously stated, we have no record of the\nJanuary 2014 status conference. Under these facts and on this record, we are unable to\nfind prejudicial judicial delay in the trial court's issuance of the decision and entry on\nNovember 21, 2014.\n       {¶ 37} Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n       {¶ 38} Having overruled appellant's three assignments of error, we affirm the\njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n                                                                         Judgment affirmed.\n                                  DORRIAN, J., concurs.\n                                  BRUNNER, J., dissents.\n\nBRUNNER, J., dissenting.\n       {¶ 39} I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority, as I believe appellant\nhas standing to bring his cause of action pursuant to the declaratory judgment statute,\nR.C. 2721.03. That section provides:\n              [A]ny person interested * * * whose rights, status, or other\n              legal relations are affected by a * * * rule as defined in section\n              119.01 of the Revised Code, * * * may have determined any\n              question of construction or validity arising under the * * *\n              rule, * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other\n              legal relations under it.\n\n       {¶ 40} Appellant is an Ohio resident living with an HIV infection who currently\nutilizes a federal program administered through the state of Ohio, known in Ohio as the\nOhio HIV Drug Assistance Program (\"OHDAP\"). OHDAP is a program that supplies\ndrugs that can cost as much as $10,000-$40,000 per year, per patient. The majority\nfinds that appellant does not plead information regarding the potential for a program\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                                           14\n\n\nsupply or funding shortfall that would trigger the application of the R.C. 119 rule\nappendices in question to \"ration\" medication to him according to supply. It is on this\npoint that I diverge from the majority. His status and R.C. 2721.03 confer him standing.\n        {¶ 41} Article IV, Section 4(B), Ohio Constitution provides that the common pleas\ncourts' jurisdiction is established by law:\n                The courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have\n                such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters and such\n                powers of review of proceedings of administrative officers and\n                agencies as may be provided by law.\n\nIt is the duty of the Ohio General Assembly to pass laws. \"The legislative power of the\nstate shall be vested in a General Assembly consisting of a Senate and House of\nRepresentatives but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose to the General\nAssembly laws.\" Article II, Section 1, Ohio Constitution. Further, Article II, Section 15(B),\nOhio Constitution provides: \"The style of the laws of this state shall be, 'be it enacted by\nthe General Assembly of the state of Ohio.' \" (Emphasis added.) When the legislature\nconfers standing by a law, it is not the province of the court to dispel it. Appellant pled\nR.C. 2721.03 in his complaint and has sought a finding of constitutionality of the rule in\nquestion. With good reason, he does not wish to wait until his access to the potentially\nlife-saving medication is threatened by either supply or funding. He has a right to have\nhis case heard.\n        {¶ 42} A statute conferring standing and pled by a party in his complaint7 can only\nbe parsed so much to allow courts to avoid hearing matters concerning an administrative\nrule's validity. The majority cites Wurdlow v. Turvy, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-25, 2012-Ohio-\n4378, ¶ 15, for the proposition that a claimed injury cannot be so remote as to be \"merely\nspeculative.\" Wurdlow involved parking regulations, not access to life-saving medication.\nThe interests involved and the damage that could occur by waiting until harm is imminent\nare not appropriately addressed by our reasoning in Wurdlow. That a threatened injury\nmust be \"imminent\" or \"certainly impending\" takes on a different meaning in the context\n\n\n7 The plaintiffs in ProgressOhio.org, Inc. v.

One such court, in the context of determining segregation of HIV from\nnon-HIV prisoners, said this:\n             The human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is a chronic\n             disease. If left untreated, it weakens the immune system and\n             eventually leads to death. The disease unfolds in several\n             stages. Soon after contracting the virus, an infected person\n             enters acute infection. During this time, the person's viral load\n             (the extent to which the virus is present in the blood) rockets\n             upward. People in this stage of the disease can have hundreds\n             of thousands of copies of the virus. Despite that, people in this\n             stage test negative for HIV. This phase, known as the \"window\n             period,\" generally lasts for a few weeks, but can extend as long\n             as three months, and the people experiencing it represent the\n             most infectious group of individuals with HIV.\n\n             Acute HIV gives way to chronic-HIV infection. During this\n             stage, the viral load lowers. The final stage, advanced-HIV\n             infection, occurs when the body's CD4 T-cells, which play a\n             critical role in the immune system, drop to low levels and the\n             viral load rises. More commonly, this final stage is known as\n             acquired immunodeficiency virus, or AIDS.\n\n             HIV emerged in the United States in the early 1980s and soon\n             grew into an epidemic. HIV inevitably progressed to AIDS.\n             Virtually everyone infected died. Meanwhile, no one,\n             including the medical community, understood how HIV was\n             transmitted. Fearing that even casual contact could spread it,\n             doctors treating patients with HIV wore protective gear so\n             extensive it was nicknamed a \"space suit.\" The profound\n             consequences of the disease, combined with lack of knowledge\n\fNo. 14AP-1035                                                                            16\n\n\n              about how it could spread, created an era of hysteria in the\n              epidemic's early days.\n\n              The tide began to turn in the decade that followed. In 1996,\n              the first protease inhibitors were approved to treat HIV.\n              Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), emerged as an\n              effective weapon against the disease. These treatments did not\n              eliminate the virus, but they did restrict its ability to progress\n              and could stave off AIDS. However, while important\n              developments, early treatment combinations had many\n              deficiencies. The medications had to be administered multiple\n              times each day; they had severe side effects, including\n              diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy; and because the regimes\n              were so complicated and so punished patients with side\n              effects, many HIV patients failed to take their medication.\n\n              Today, advances in HIV treatment have profoundly changed\n              the disease. There is still no cure for HIV: indeed, there is only\n              one known case in which a person was completely cured of it.\n              However, modern treatment regimes have rendered it\n              manageable. The vast majority of HIV patients can be treated\n              by one pill once a day; side effects are less severe, and, where\n              they do occur, multiple treatment options allow patients to try\n              different medications until they find one that works; and,\n              most importantly, although people with HIV will require\n              treatment for their entire lives, HIV is no longer invariably\n              fatal. People who receive treatment for HIV can expect to\n              enjoy near-normal lifespans.\n\n(Emphasis added; footnote deleted.) Henderson v.

Such forces lie outside of any one\nindividual's control. While the federal program may \"go away,\" a state's decisions in how\nto administer it while it is here are subject to review. Based on the nature of the disease,\nappellant's \"injury\" is established by his status. He is a participant in a program and his\naccess to medication administered by it is subject to loss according to a state promulgated\nrule. He has a right to challenge how that rule's implementation will affect him.

Additionally, he could be confronted with a defense of laches\nfor not having brought this suit in the aftermath of challenging the rule at the\nadministrative level through procedures set forth in R.C. Chapter 119.\n       {¶ 45} Courts cannot deny standing when the legislature has conferred it through\nstatutes such as R.C. 2721.03, the declaratory judgment statute.             The power of the\ncommon pleas court to determine the constitutionality of the rule should have been\nexercised.   \" 'It is the right and duty of judicial tribunals to determine, whether a\nlegislative act drawn in question in a suit pending before them, is opposed to the\nconstitution of the United States, or of this State, and if so found, to treat it as a nullity.' \"\n(Emphasis added.)
