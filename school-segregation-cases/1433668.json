Reno,\n\n113 S.Ct. 2816 (1993). The district court granted summary judgment\n\nfor the City.       We affirm.\n\n                         Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n       The   City   is   governed    by    a     fifteen-member    City   Council,\n\ncomprised of the Mayor, elected at large, five council members\n\nelected at-large, and nine council members selected through single-\n\nmember districts (Districts A through I).              The City is required to\n\nredistrict the single member districts every two years, and does so\n\nthrough ordinances.            In the wake of the 1990 census, the City\n\ndrafted a new districting plan.            The Department of Justice refused\n\npreclearance, and the City responded by drafting an alternative\n\nplan that created two districts with weak majorities of Hispanic\n\nresidents.     This new plan received preclearance.               Although due to\n\na subsequently reversed district court decision the new precleared\n\nplan was not used in the 1991 elections, see Campos v. City of\n\nHouston, 968 F.2d 446,452 (5th Cir. 1992), the form of that 1991\n\n\n                                          2\n\fplan    was   substantially    followed   in   the    1993   and   1995\n\nredistrictings.    Neither of these plans was challenged on Shaw v.\n\nReno grounds, although the City did face litigation from plaintiffs\n\nclaiming that the City was required to create additional districts\n\nwith Hispanic majorities.     See Campos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d\n\n544 (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming Morris v. city of Houston, 894 F.\n\nSupp. 1062 (S.D. Tex. 1995) granting summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe City).\n\n       In December of 1996, the City of Houston annexed an area to\n\nthe far northeast of the City known as Kingwood.        Kingwood had a\n\npopulation of around 40,000, and some adjustment in the City’s\n\ndistrict boundaries for the 1997 scheduled redistricting was thus\n\nrequired to avoid unbalancing the population of the districts. The\n\nCity drafted a plan placing Kingwood, and the surrounding area that\n\nhad previously been a part of District B, into District E.         Like\n\nprior City redistrictings, this was conducted in part by using a\n\ncomputer program that contained racial and ethnic data at the level\n\nof voting precincts.    After a debate that included the plaintiffs’\n\nlawyer in this case, the Council adopted this plan by ordinance on\n\nApril 9, 1997.    The plan contained a maximum population deviation,\n\nwhen measured by total population, of 8.63%.         Measured by total\n\npopulation, two of its districts had African-American majorities\n\nwhile two others had Hispanic majorities. It received preclearance\n\nfrom the Justice Department on July 7, 1997.\n\n\n                                   3\n\f     The plaintiffs launched this challenge to the 1997 districts\n\non April 9, 1997--the same day the ordinance was adopted--claiming,\n\namong other things, that the districts constituted an impermissible\n\nracial gerrymander and violated the principle of one-person, one-\n\nvote.1   On August 15, 1997, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary\n\ninjunction.    This motion was denied on October 3, 1997. On March 2,\n\n1998, the City filed five separate motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe district court granted all five motions and issued final\n\njudgment in favor of the City on May 7, 1998.             Chen v. City of\n\nHouston, 9 F.Supp.2d 745 (S.D. Tex. 1998). This appeal, limited to\n\nthe one-person, one-vote and racial gerrymander issues, followed.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n     The plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment for the City.             They argue that they\n\nproduced     enough    circumstantial    and    direct   evidence   of   the\n\npredominance of race in the City’s districting decision to allow a\n\nreasonable jury to find in their favor.          They also claim that the\n\ndistrict court erred as a matter of law when it measured the City’s\n\ncompliance with the one-person, one-vote requirement using total\n\npopulation    rather    than   figures   that   accurately   reflected   the\n\ndistribution of potentially eligible voters in the City.             Though\n\n\n1\n     Plaintiffs   also   contended   that    the   plan   violated\nconstitutional requirements regarding ballot secrecy, the right to\npetition for redress of grievances, the right to freely assemble,\nand the right of political association. None of these claims is\nraised on appeal.\n\n                                     4\n\fthe issue is extremely close and difficult, after careful review,\n\nwe   have    concluded      that   the   plaintiffs     failed      to    meet   their\n\nevidentiary burden on the Shaw claim and summary judgment was\n\nappropriate.        We also hold that the use of total population to\n\ntrack      the    size    of   the     districts      does   not,        under   these\n\ncircumstances, violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nI. Standard of Review\n\n      We review a motion for summary judgment by applying the same\n\nstandard as that appropriate for the court below, and in doing so\n\nwe interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant.        Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmovant\n\nfails to demonstrate that there is sufficient summary judgment\n\nevidence to allow a reasonable fact finder to find in its favor on\n\nall essential issues as to which it would bear the burden of proof\n\nat trial.        Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 725 (5th\n\nCir. 1995). However, this review must be understood in the context\n\nof   the    courts’      traditional     reluctance    to    interfere      with   the\n\ndelicate and politically charged area of legislative redistricting.\n\nSee Reynolds v. Sims, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394 (1964) (“legislative\n\nreapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration\n\nand determination”); Hunt v. Cromartie, 119 S.Ct. 1545, 1552\n\n(1999) (legislature has the benefit of presumption of good faith\n\nwhen it conducts districting).                 The Court has clearly indicated\n\nthat this presumption may impact the assessment of the propriety of\n\n\n                                           5\n\fsummary     judgment       in       a   suit    challenging       districts      as   racial\n\ngerrymanders.       See Miller v. Johnson, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 2488 (1995)\n\n(sensitive     nature          of    districting        should    be   considered     “when\n\nassessing under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the adequacy\n\nof a plaintiff’s showing at the various stages of litigation and\n\ndetermining whether to permit discovery or trial to proceed”).\n\n      In this Shaw challenge, the plaintiffs bear the burden of\n\nproving     that    race       was      the    predominant       factor    in   the   City’s\n\ndistricting decisions.                  See Bush v. Vera, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 1951\n\n(1996).     If the plaintiffs can demonstrate that race predominated\n\nso   that   “race        for    its      own    sake,    and     not   other    districting\n\nprinciples,        was    the        legislature’s        dominant        and   controlling\n\nrationale in drawing its district lines,” the districts will be\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny.                   See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2486.           For a\n\nmajority of the Supreme Court, the mere fact that race was given\n\nsome consideration in the districting process, and even the fact\n\nthat minority-majority districts were intentionally created, does\n\nnot alone suffice in all circumstances to trigger strict scrutiny.\n\nSee Shaw v. Hunt, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 1900 (1996) (“Shaw II”); Clark v.\n\nCalhoun County, 88 F.3d 1393, 1404 n.2 (5th Cir. 1996) (identifying\n\nO’Connor, Rehnquist and Bush dissenters as supporting, with Kennedy\n\nreserving the question); Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, 185 F.3d\n\n477, 488 (5th Cir. 1999).                And in the eyes of the author of Shaw,\n\nthe plaintiffs’ burden in establishing racial predominance is a\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fheavy one:\n\n     “To invoke strict scrutiny, a plaintiff must show that\n     the State has relied on race in substantial disregard of\n     customary and traditional districting practices.\n\n     . . . .\n\n     [A]pplication of the Court’s standard helps achieve\n     Shaw’s basic objective of making extreme instances of\n     gerrymandering subject to meaningful judicial review.”\n     Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2497 (O’Connor, concurring)\n     (emphasis added).\n\n     Plaintiffs     nevertheless   argue   that   summary   judgment    is\n\ndisfavored in Shaw cases.     They first argue that the question of\n\nthe City’s intent is inherently a fact-intensive inquiry that is\n\nunsuitable for summary judgment, relying on a recent Supreme Court\n\nreversal of a grant of summary judgment in a districting case.         See\n\nCromartie.     This ignores, however, the fact that in Cromartie the\n\ndistrict court had granted summary judgment for the plaintiff. The\n\nCourt took care to stress that summary judgment was inappropriate\n\nnot only because of the factual nature of the intent requirement,\n\nbut also because the nonmovant did not bear the burden of proof on\n\nthe issue. See id. at 1552 (“Summary judgment in favor of the party\n\nwith the burden of persuasion, however, is inappropriate when the\n\nevidence is susceptible of different interpretations or inferences\n\nby the trier of fact.”) (emphasis added).     The Court also relied on\n\nthe traditional presumption that the legislature acted in good\n\nfaith while districting.     Id.   Here, neither of these factors are\n\npresent.     The plaintiffs here bear the burden of persuasion, and\n\n\n                                    7\n\fthe presumption of legislative integrity adds to, rather than\n\nlessens, their burden facing summary judgment.\n\n     The    plaintiffs       next    argue        that    summary     judgment    is\n\ninappropriate because the case is one of mixed motives--while the\n\nCity has proffered justifications for its actions grounded in\n\ntraditional districting principles, it has also conceded that race\n\nwas a factor in its decisions.         The plaintiffs argue that the Court\n\nhas indicated that a more searching inquiry is needed in such\n\ncases, and summary judgment is thus inappropriate.                    Bush v. Vera,\n\n116 S.Ct. 1941, 1952 (1996) ( in a mixed motive case a “careful\n\nreview   is,   therefore,      necessary         to    determine     whether   these\n\ndistricts   are    subject    to     strict       scrutiny”).        This   position\n\nmisconstrues      Bush.   The       Bush       court   made   this    statement   to\n\ndistinguish mixed motives cases in which the districting body\n\npresented credible evidence of alternative justifications from\n\nthose in which no valid traditional districting purpose was given\n\nand racial intent was obvious.             See id. (distinguishing with cf.\n\ncitation mixed motive case from Miller); Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2485\n\n(noting that district court had found evidence of predominance of\n\nrace was overwhelming “and practically stipulated by the parties\n\ninvolved”). Far from indicating that summary judgment should be\n\ndisfavored, the discussion the plaintiffs highlight demonstrates\n\nthe gravity with which the court approaches facially valid defenses\n\nproffered by the legislature in the districting area.                   The City of\n\n\n                                           8\n\fHouston’s presentation of valid evidence of nonracial intent, which\n\ntransforms the case into one of mixed motives, advances rather than\n\nhinders its case for summary judgment. We will review the district\n\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment using the traditional criteria,\n\nand   take    into   account      both    the    presumption         in   favor   of   a\n\nlegislature’s good faith and a plaintiff’s burden of proof.\n\nII. Circumstantial Evidence of Racial Motivation–The Appearance of\nthe Districts\n\n      A plaintiff may demonstrate that race predominated in a\n\ndistricting decision by introducing circumstantial evidence of the\n\ndistrict’s shape and demographics.              See Shaw II, 116 S.Ct. at         1900\n\n(1996).      The shape alone of some districts may be so bizarre and\n\nirregular that their creation may only be interpreted as “an effort\n\nto segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for\n\ntraditional districting principles.” Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2824;\n\nCromartie, at 1549 n.3 (some highly bizarre districts give rise to\n\ninference that race predominated more strongly than the inference\n\nthat factors such as politics created the distortion).                     When shape\n\nalone is not determinative, plaintiffs may still prove their\n\ncircumstantial       case   by    demonstrating        that    the    districts    are\n\nsufficiently     bizarre     in    relation      to    racial   demographics       and\n\npopulation     densities.         See    Miller,      115   S.Ct.    at   2489.    The\n\nobjective case against a district may also be affected by an\n\nanalysis of whether the district adheres to traditional districting\n\nprinciples other than compactness, such as political considerations\n\n                                           9\n\fand fidelity to administrative boundaries.       See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at\n\n971.\n\n       In a very general sense, Houston’s nine single member council\n\ndistricts can be described as being arranged like pieces of a pie,\n\neach district radiating out from the center to the edge of town.\n\nThe two exceptions are District H, which does not touch the city’s\n\nexternal borders due to a thin bridge between two halves of\n\nDistrict B, and District E, which does not approach the city\n\ncenter.    Were the City a congressional district carved out of the\n\nsurrounding suburbs, its own shape would likely provide ample\n\nfodder for a Shaw claim. The City engulfs independent incorporated\n\nareas, leaving two holes in its west half.       It also includes   three\n\ndetached “islands” to the north of the City proper--two of them\n\nquite large--that are only tenuously connected to the “mainland” by\n\nnarrow and unpopulated corridors. In addition, it includes several\n\npeninsulas jutting out into the countryside, the most outlandish of\n\nwhich extends in a snakelike fashion eastward out of District E\n\nbetween the IH-10 Freeway and the La Porte Highway.         In short, as\n\na glance at the map will readily confirm, the City has vastly\n\nirregular    borders   and   does   not   even   remotely   approach    a\n\nmathematical ideal of compactness.\n\n       But plaintiffs do not challenge the shape of the City of\n\nHouston, and the City is not in fact a congressional district.         The\n\nCity’s highly irregular borders are simply a given that the Council\n\n\n                                    10\n\fwas forced to deal with as best it could in crafting the districts\n\nchallenged here.        Because of the constraint imposed by the City’s\n\nexternal borders, Houston’s city council districts will never enjoy\n\nthe pleasing symmetry of, say, Nebraska or Kansas (to say nothing\n\nof   Colorado    or    Wyoming).      The    City’s    various   peninsulas     and\n\nprotuberances,        and   in   particular    its    archipelago   of   detached\n\nislands, have to be placed somewhere.                While this might at first\n\nglance   leave    particular       districts    open    to   charges     of   being\n\nnoncompact, these breaches of that ideal are unavoidable under the\n\ncircumstances.        Recognizing this, when drafting its guidelines for\n\nthe redistricting, the city’s geographic goal embraced functional\n\nas well as purely spacial compactness considerations.2\n\n      This rather obvious point seems to have escaped both the\n\nplaintiffs and their expert witnesses. The plaintiffs take care to\n\nlift segments of the City’s districts and compare them to elements\n\nof Shaw, Reno, and Miller, but fail to point out this context.\n\nThus, for example, the plaintiffs argue that the City’s districting\n\n\n2\n     Functional compactness is an inherently nebulous term drawn\nfrom a district court decision summarily affirmed by the Supreme\nCourt. See DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F.Supp. 1409 (E.D. Cal. 1994),\nsummarily aff’d, 115 S.Ct. 2637 (1995).        However, as Justice\nKennedy had been at pains to highlight, summary affirmance is not\nan endorsement of a lower court’s reasoning, see Bush, 116 S.Ct. at\n1971 (Kennedy, concurring), and the concept as described in DeWitt\nseems to us open to abuse. However, regardless of its merits when\napplied to an ordinary districting decision, functional compactness\nas applied here merely signals acceptance of reality. Contrary to\nplaintiffs’ assertions, the fact that the City chose to use this\nterm does not indicate that they had abandoned traditional\ndistricting principles.\n\n                                        11\n\fplan used narrow, unpopulated connectors to link District B with\n\nthe Houston Airport area, and that District E has a snaking\n\nprotuberance extending far to the east under the challenged plan.\n\nWhile this is surely correct, and leads to an immediate analogy to\n\nthe Shaw district, it is absolutely irrelevant.         Were Houston to\n\npurge race utterly from its districting process by handing over the\n\ntask   to   a   computer   programmed   to   maximize   purely    spacial\n\ncompactness, these deviations would still be present.            The same\n\nerror infected the expert opinion relied on by plaintiffs to\n\ndemonstrate lack of compactness and bizarre shape.          Plaintiffs’\n\nexpert, Dr. Maggiotto, performed the type of mathematical analysis\n\ncited with approval in several cases and concluded that the City’s\n\ndistricts were not compact.3    However, Dr. Maggiotto failed to take\n\ninto account that substantial deviation from absolute mathematical\n\ncompactness was inherent in the City’s current form.       Accordingly,\n\nwe reject his conclusion.     Even on a motion for summary judgment,\n\nwe are not required to take heed of an ill-reasoned expert opinion.\n\nSee Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. V. Zenith Radio Corp., 106\n\n\n3\n     The mathematical models generally used attempt to quantify\ndepartures from compactness by, for example, drawing a circle\naround the district’s center or connecting the district’s borders\nwith an imaginary string.    The district’s deviation from this\nbenchmark is then analyzed.    Such techniques may or may not be\nprobative when applied to areas in which external boundaries play\na minor role. However, they certainly would need adjustment before\nbeing accepted when applied to a case such a Houston, or for that\nmatter possibly Rhode Island.    If not, the report will reflect\nmassive deviations from compactness caused by factors beyond the\nlegislature’s control.\n\n                                   12\n\fS.Ct. 1348, 1360 n.19 (1986).\n\n     This general failure of the plaintiffs does not, however,\n\nforeclose their case.   They point to several districts which have\n\nborders that deviate from the Euclidean ideal in a manner not\n\nentirely traceable to the City’s external borders.    In particular,\n\nthey highlight districts B, H, I, and E.4   District B, which has an\n\nAfrican-American majority, consists of one “island” around the\n\nHouston airport, and two distinct areas on the “mainland” that are\n\ndivided by District H and are connected only by a thin strip of\n\nland along H’s northern border.    The eastern half of the District\n\nB plunges at one point into District I, and also has its pattern\n\nbroken by the intrusion of an arm of District H.   District H, while\n\npossessing a highly compact substantially rectangular core, has two\n\n“arms” extending to the west and southeast.        The southeast arm\n\ncurls around the borders of districts B and I in an ungainly\n\n4\n     Plaintiffs also challenge districts C, D and A. District D\nis, on the whole, overwhelmingly compact and regular. While the\ndistrict does taper sharply to the north before widening again near\nits apex, this feature hardly detracts from its overall\ncohesiveness. District C has regular borders with District D. Its\nirregularities occur in its borders with districts G and F. Like\nC itself, G and F are “white” “Anglo” districts (G is 79% “Anglo;”\nF is 41.74% “Anglo,” 12.49% “Asian,” 25.36% “Hispanic” and 4.68%\n“Black”); and the plaintiffs have never explained how these\nirregularities can be understood as a racial gerrymander--they have\nnot shown that the areas affected had any special racial\nsignificance. On this record, all that the distortions in these\ndistricts show is that deviations from compactness may occur in\nracially innocuous contexts. Once the shape of the City is taken\ninto account, deviations from compactness in District A arise only\nfrom the intrusion of an arm of District H, and thus the question\nof District A merges into the inquiry into District H’s shape and\ndemographics.\n\n                                  13\n\ffashion and terminates in a small, uneven projection extending a\n\nshort distance back to the west, into District B.                The far more\n\nregular western arm of District H extends for a fair distance into\n\nDistrict A, and at one point tapers sharply to merely point\n\ncontinuity before expanding again. District I by comparison is far\n\nmore   compact,   although    its   eastern   and   western      sections   are\n\nseparated to a certain extent by District B.            District E consists\n\nof a southeastern portion that would be fairly compact but for the\n\nCity’s borders.    However, it also includes the large island in the\n\nLake Houston area to the extreme northeast of the city, with which\n\nit shares a connection only by a narrow eight-mile corridor.                The\n\nnature of this connection cannot be helped, as it is a product of\n\nthe City borders.      As the plaintiffs stress, however, the Lake\n\nHouston island is closer as the crow flies to Districts B and I\n\nthan to the balance of District E.        In previous plans, the portion\n\nof this island then within the City was in fact placed in District\n\nB.\n\n       Certainly, these four districts--B, H, I and E--are not\n\nperfectly   compact.    And    since   District     B   is   a   predominantly\n\nAfrican-American district, Districts H and I contain Hispanic\n\nmajorities, and District E is mainly white or “Anglo,” the shape of\n\nthese districts is not so regular as to preclude the plaintiffs\n\nfrom showing that race predominated in the drawing of a portion of\n\nsome of the extremities of these districts.             But these districts\n\nare not the type of sprawling monstrosities that have previously\n\n                                     14\n\fbeen found to violate Shaw by the Supreme Court.          Indeed, Bush v.\n\nVera discussed districts that substantially overlapped with the\n\ncontested districts H, I and B.       A quick review of the map in Bush\n\nwill demonstrate that the City was far more faithful to the ideal\n\nof compactness than the Texas Legislature was in drafting the Bush\n\nplan. In Bush, legislators attempting to create Houston area seats\n\nfor both Blacks and Hispanics effected this goal by selecting\n\nblock-sized packets of Hispanic or African-American voters and\n\nlinking them each into their respective district.          The end result\n\ncreated two of the three least regular districts in the country,\n\ncomparable to a jigsaw puzzle in which the pieces could not be\n\nremoved.    See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1958.         In Bush, in the area at\n\nissue here, an already somewhat ungainly tentacle of the African-\n\nAmerican district contained uneven veins of loosely interconnected\n\nHispanic blocks that were placed in, and attached tenuously to, the\n\nHispanic district.       Not only does the City’s districting of the\n\nsame area fail to even approach that level of non-compactness, the\n\nrecord indicates that the Council specifically rejected a proposal\n\nby one of its members to redraw its districts to mimic the plan\n\nrejected in Bush on the grounds of noncompactness. In addition, we\n\nnote that the City successfully resisted pressure from private\n\nlitigants   to   draft   a   plan   containing   four   majority-minority\n\ndistricts--something that almost certainly would have created a\n\nmore bizarre plan.   See Campos, 113 F.3d 544.       Race was clearly not\n\n\n                                     15\n\fthe only factor driving the City’s districting, because it avoided\n\nthese extremes.\n\n     While we certainly do not mean to suggest that the extremes of\n\nBush or Shaw are the minimum threshold for a successful suit, we\n\nsimply cannot find that the challenged shape of the districts here\n\noffers adequate evidence that race predominated in the districting.\n\nThis is especially true since some of the specific departures from\n\ncompactness that the plaintiffs highlight are not as dramatic as\n\nthey might initially appear. First, the plaintiffs attempt to paint\n\nthe odd southeastern arm of District H as an attempt to maximize\n\nHispanic numbers in H while avoiding the inclusion of African-\n\nAmericans.    But this argument ignores the fact that District H’s\n\narm borders not only “Black” District B, but also District I--the\n\nother majority Hispanic district in Houston.   Had the City’s sole\n\nreal concern been maintaining the racial purity of these districts,\n\nthat goal could have facially just as easily been accomplished by\n\nplacing H’s southeastern arm in District I, in exchange for the\n\nplacement of District I’s northwestern corner in District H.   This\n\nconfiguration would have appeared far more compact and regular,\n\nsince the arm of H blends naturally into the north of I.   And since\n\nthe relevant borders of the arm itself would not have altered, the\n\nAfrican-American population of B would have been unaltered and the\n\npercentage of Hispanics in both H and I would have remained roughly\n\nequivalent.    Careful demographic analysis of the populations in\n\n\n                                 16\n\fthese disputed areas might disprove this hypothesis, but the\n\nplaintiffs failed to even attempt to provide such data.                      The\n\nevidence does not tie the particularly unusual feature of H’s\n\nborders to race to the exclusion of any other real concerns.\n\n     Second, the usage of a narrow connector to link the two\n\nsections of District B separated by District H is also not as\n\nfacially objectionable as it first appears.           The plaintiffs argue\n\nthat District B’s odd shape is explained by the City’s desire to\n\ncarve out a Hispanic majority for District H, and continuity in B\n\nwas accordingly sacrificed, with the narrow connector a mere token\n\nconcession to the principle.        However, when the area of District B\n\nas a whole, including the dead space not included in the City, is\n\ntaken into account, this picture is far from clear.                 Because a\n\nlarge section of District B is a detached island, B is in some\n\nrespects missing       its   center.    The   geographical      heart   of   the\n\ndistrict is located outside the City limits.           The northern island\n\nof B and its two mainland halves would constitute a facially\n\nunobjectionable compact body if the intervening unincorporated\n\nterritory were included. If one takes this into account, and views\n\nDistrict B   as   an    attempt   to   reflect   a   coherent    geographical\n\nneighborhood in the north of the City that happens to be broken up\n\nby unincorporated dead space, the outline of the district becomes\n\nmuch less offensive.         Rather than being a racial subterfuge, the\n\nstrip of territory connecting the incorporated halves of B can be\n\nproperly seen as marking the central border of a coherent and\n\n                                       17\n\frelatively compact district whose outline is only clouded by the\n\nCity’s irregular borders.\n\n     Lastly, the presence of the detached Lake Houston area in\n\nDistrict E offers less support for the plaintiff than it otherwise\n\nmight.   Concededly, the placement of this area leads to the\n\ncreation of an ungainly district that sprawls from the northern to\n\nthe southern extremity of the City.   And this northeastern island\n\nis closer to District B, so it would seem to do violence to the\n\ncompactness concept to put it anywhere else.   However, this must be\n\nplaced in the context of the City’s most unusual outline.    When a\n\ndistricting body has the opportunity to create truly compact\n\ndistricts and chooses not to, the harm is obvious.     But when, as\n\nhere, spacial compactness is simply impossible, further departure\n\nfrom the principle seems less jarring.    Wherever the island was\n\nplaced, its representative would have to travel several miles\n\noutside of the City proper, and voters in that district would have\n\nhad the odd sensation of being thrown together with an area with\n\nwhich they shared only a technical connection.       Given that the\n\nCity’s design had already decisively severed the island from its\n\nneighbor, its placement in a district that was a few miles farther\n\naway seems less offensive than it would otherwise.       A judicial\n\nanalogy may serve to clarify this point.       We would find it odd\n\nindeed if Congress decided to place Washington State within the\n\nrealm of this Circuit when the opportunity to keep it within the\n\nNinth Circuit was present.   But it is far less troublesome that\n\n                                18\n\fPuerto Rico has been assigned to the First Circuit rather than the\n\nEleventh (or the Fourth).         The placement of Kingwood and its\n\nenvirons is discussed in more detail below, but facially we find\n\nthat its separation mitigates to a large extent the effect of its\n\nplacement in District E.\n\n     In short, when viewed properly, the geographic boundaries here\n\ndo not in and of themselves make out a strong circumstantial case\n\nunder Shaw.     That does not end our inquiry, however.         As Miller\n\nindicated, a district that is not facially outrageous may be\n\nobjectively revealed as a gerrymander by linking its shape to\n\ndemographics and other factors. In Miller, the Court conceded that\n\nthe district’s shape, while hardly perfect, was not sufficient\n\nstanding alone to lead to the conclusion that it was bizarre in a\n\nShaw sense.     It then turned to a closer analysis of the geography\n\nin light of the district’s demographics.             It noted that the\n\ndistrict’s shape became far more troublesome once it was recognized\n\nthat the core of the district was relatively unpopulated, while the\n\ncarefully drawn exterior borders reached out to engulf urban\n\nAfrican-American population centers.          Viewed in light of this\n\nevidence,   a   shape   that   initially   merely   raised   eyebrows   was\n\nrevealed to present overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a\n\nconstitutional violation. See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2489 (“Although\n\nby comparison with other districts the geometric shape of the\n\nEleventh District may not seem bizarre on its face, when its shape\n\n\n                                    19\n\fis   considered   in   conjunction   with    its   racial   and   population\n\ndensities, the story of racial gerrymandering seen by the District\n\nCourt becomes much clearer.”).\n\n      Here, as in Miller, we are presented with districts in which\n\ndeviations from the compactness ideal are present but are not\n\noverwhelming.     But unlike in Miller, the plaintiffs have failed to\n\npresent us with specific demographic data that would clarify the\n\nracial nature of these distortions.          The plaintiff’s expert, Dr.\n\nWeber, merely produced demographic data covering the districts as\n\na whole.   He did not give us a demographic analysis of the specific\n\nfeatures--the arms of H, the connector section in B, and the\n\nnortheast island in E--that are at issue in this case.            His report\n\ndid not show that, for example, the arms of District H contain most\n\nof the district’s population, and H’s compact core is relatively\n\nunpopulated.      Nor was there even data demonstrating that the\n\nwestern arm of H is designed to capture a specific pocket of\n\nHispanics in order to maintain Hispanic supremacy in the district.\n\nBased on a map of Hispanic population dispersion in the record, it\n\nappears this arm includes several areas without, and excludes some\n\nareas with, high ratios of Hispanics. The general, over-broad data\n\nDr. Weber used supports only his conclusion that these districts\n\ncould be made more heterogenous.          And this is hardly relevant--of\n\ncourse if one solely focused on increasing racial heterogeneity one\n\ncould improve this factor, just as one could increase homogeneity\n\n\n                                     20\n\fby adopting the pattern rejected in Bush.                But districters are not\n\nbound--or allowed--to sacrifice traditional districting concerns to\n\nmeeting quotas of diversity, just as they are not allowed to do so\n\nin order to meet quotas of racial concentration.\n\n     Plaintiffs        also   argue   that     the     fact   that    the    number    of\n\nracially    homogenous         precincts       increased      in     the    1997    plan\n\ndemonstrates that the City’s districting was predominantly linked\n\nto race.      Standing alone, however, this fact does nothing to\n\nsupport    the    plaintiffs’      case.         For    reasons      of     their   own,\n\npopulations occasionally shift within urban areas.                     If members of\n\none racial group chose to move out of certain areas, the numbers of\n\nracially   homogenous         precincts    would     increase.        However,      this\n\nphenomenon would not be tied to the actions of the districting\n\nparties–they could keep the borders of the districts static and the\n\nsame effect would be seen.            Indeed, according to the plaintiffs’\n\nversion of events this is precisely what occurred--they criticize\n\nthe 1997 plan for substantially maintaining prior boundaries.\n\nWithout tying this evidence to specific choices by the City, and in\n\nparticular to the discrete noncompact elements of the plan that\n\nthey challenge, this evidence fails to aid the plaintiffs’ case.\n\nUltimately,      the    plaintiffs    failed       to    demonstrate        by   use   of\n\ndemographics, as was done in Miller, that the specific departures\n\nfrom compactness that it challenges are the product of race rather\n\nthan other factors.\n\n\n                                          21\n\f       However, compactness is not the only traditional districting\n\nprinciple.        Other factors, such as the protection of political\n\nincumbents,       the    maintenance       of      administrative        units,     and    the\n\nreflection       of     communities      of     interest,       play    a    part     in   the\n\ndistricting process.             By showing that the design of a district\n\nviolates      these     other     traditional        districting        principles,         the\n\nplaintiffs support their circumstantial case.5                               The districts\n\nclearly adhered to at least one traditional districting principle\n\nby maintaining the integrity of the relevant administrative unit,\n\nvoting precincts (although as discussed below plaintiffs argue that\n\nthese units are themselves tainted). However, the plaintiffs argue\n\nthat    the     districts    do    not     serve     the    traditional        districting\n\nprinciple of reflecting communities of interest.                              In the more\n\negregious       examples    of     gerrymandering,          the   violation         of     this\n\ntraditional principle will be facially obvious.                        Thus the district\n\nchallenged in Shaw could be safely assumed not to have been driven\n\nby communities of interest, since it “winds in snakelike fashion\n\nthrough tobacco          country,     financial        centers,        and   manufacturing\n\nareas”     in     an     attempt      to      gather       up   “enclaves        of      black\n\nneighborhoods”and “even towns are divided.”                        Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at\n\n2821.\n\n\n\n5\n     City council elections are at least formally nonpartisan.\nPerhaps because of this, neither party stresses the traditional\ndistricting principles of general, jurisdiction-wide political\ngerrymandering.\n\n                                              22\n\f     But when presented with closer questions, the Court has\n\nfocused on the specific features of a district that cause it to\n\ndepart from compactness in assessing whether they are unjustifiable\n\non traditional grounds. Thus in Bush, where the State attempted to\n\njustify its decision-making on the analogous traditional ground of\n\npartisan politics--and there was indeed a correlation with politics\n\nwhen the districts were looked at as a whole--the Court found it\n\nsignificant that “the maps reveal that political considerations\n\nwere subordinated to racial classification in the drawing of many\n\nof the most extreme and bizarre district lines.”        Bush, 116 S.Ct.\n\nat 1957.     The fact that the State was willing, in the course of\n\nextending a noncompact tentacle engulfing a pocket of African-\n\nAmerican voters,    to include a large number of Republican voter\n\ntabulation    districts   in   a   congressional   district    ostensibly\n\ndesigned to maximize Democratic power was clear evidence of the\n\nsubordination of politics to race.          Id.    And in Miller, the\n\ndemographic data was heavily reinforced by an analysis of how\n\nspecific choices violated communities of interest.            Because the\n\nchallenged district reached out to include African-American pockets\n\nin several entirely separate urban communities, and linked them\n\ntogether with a sparsely populated and wholly rural core, the\n\n“social, political and economic makeup of the Eleventh District\n\ntells a tale of disparity, not community.” Miller, 115 S.Ct. at\n\n2484.\n\n\n                                    23\n\f     Here,   the    plaintiffs    have    failed    to    link   the    specific\n\ndepartures from compactness that they highlight to the violation of\n\ntraditional districting principles.         They first claim that several\n\nneighborhoods were split in the 1997 plan.          But the City introduced\n\nevidence that more neighborhoods were reunited than were split by\n\nthe plan, and the plaintiffs have not challenged this assertion.\n\nMoreover, the plaintiffs failed to show where the allegedly split\n\nneighborhoods      were.     While   it    may     be    unfortunate     that   a\n\npredominantly    white     neighborhood   was    split    between      two   white\n\ndistricts, the existence of such a districting faux pas may well\n\nhave nothing to do with the racial issues that concern us here.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ evidence of neighborhood splitting is not helpful\n\nto their case.\n\n     Plaintiffs also tendered the opinion of Dr. Maggiotto, who\n\nanalyzed various purportedly relevant statistical indicators of\n\ncommunities of interest.6       His report claims that, in the City as\n\na whole, race varies less within the districts than do his chosen\n\n\n6\n     We note some unease with the categories deployed in the study.\nHere, we are particularly troubled by Dr. Maggiotto’s reliance on\nthe category of “industry of employment.” To expect that any large\ndistrict will be characterized by a single, or a few, industries of\nemployment is problematic, since we have generally left behind the\nera of mill town and mining towns. And a mailroom clerk in a bank\nwill not necessarily enjoy a community of interest with its lending\nofficers. An area such as Silicon Valley may be an exception to\nthis, and the category may be highly relevant when analyzing\ncongressional districts to quantify urban and rural areas. See\nMiller, 115 S.Ct. at 2484, 2490.     But applied to Houston, this\nseems a remarkably unprobative tool. We note this only in passing,\nsince Dr. Maggiotto’s report is not on point in any event.\n\n                                     24\n\findices of community.   This evidence, it is argued, demonstrates\n\nthat race predominated in the City’s districting.     However, the\n\nplaintiffs again use too blunt a statistical tool.   Socio-economic\n\nvariation within districts is almost unavoidable, particularly\n\nwhen, as here, the constituent districting units are fairly large--\n\napproaching 200,000 persons.   Not many, if any, rectangles of this\n\nsize randomly deposited on a map of Houston could be expected to\n\ncapture an essentially homogenous socio-economic group.   At least\n\nwhen relatively large districts are involved, the mere existence of\n\nsocio-economic variations within the district is not probative. To\n\nprovide valid circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race\n\nin the City’s districting, then, Dr. Maggiotto had to tie his data\n\nto specific districting decisions, or the plaintiffs had to place\n\nhis data in context by showing that the variations from available\n\nnormal compactness were likely caused by racial factors. This they\n\nfailed to do. They did not show--or even claim--that, for example,\n\nthe southeastern arm of District H extends outward to reach a\n\npocket of wealthy Hispanics who share nothing other than race with\n\nthe bulk of the district, the way that the Atlanta extremity of the\n\nMiller district shared no commonality with the district’s rural\n\ncore other than race.   Nor did they show that the western arm of H\n\nis designed to reach a pocket of Hispanics at the cost of including\n\non the way neighborhoods that share nothing with the rest of that\n\ndistrict, the way that Texas reached out to a pocket of African-\n\n\n\n                                25\n\fAmericans at the cost of including Republican districts in Bush.\n\nIndeed, the plaintiffs never analyzed or even referred to the\n\nsocio-economic composition of the specific areas created by the\n\nCity’s departure from geographical compactness, relying instead on\n\nbroad statistics covering the entire area.                  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at\n\n1957 n.* (criticizing dissent for relying on statistics showing\n\npolitical     orientation      for   district    as     a     whole,    rather   than\n\nconcentrating on border segments).             Had they done so, perhaps our\n\ndecision today might have been different. But bearing in mind that\n\nit   was    the   plaintiffs’   burden   to     produce       evidence    that   race\n\npredominated, and also remembering the presumption in favor of\n\nlegislative       integrity,    we    cannot     say     that     the    shape   and\n\ndemographics of the districts here provided adequate circumstantial\n\nevidence of the predominance of race to prevent summary judgment.\n\n\n\nIII. Direct Evidence\n\n      Plaintiffs     also   argue    that     they     have    sufficient     direct\n\nevidence that the City’s districting was predominantly driven by\n\nrace.      They focus on two major points. First, they argue that the\n\nmajor decision made during the 1997 districting–that the newly\n\nannexed area of Kingwood should be placed in District E rather than\n\nDistrict B--was predominantly influenced by race.                       Second, they\n\nargue that the 1997 plan substantially maintained the borders of\n\nprevious plans, and that those borders were set by a process in\n\n\n                                       26\n\fwhich race--specifically, the desire to create two black and two\n\nHispanic single member districts--predominated. The City concedes,\n\nas it must, that race--in the form of a desire to comply with the\n\nVoting Rights Act--was a factor in all the plans.             But as we have\n\nstated before, a majority of the Supreme Court does not believe\n\nthat the mere presence of race in the mix of decision making\n\nfactors , and even the desire to craft majority-minority districts,\n\ndoes not alone automatically trigger strict scrutiny.              See Clark,\n\n88 F.3d at 1404 n.2; Theriot, 185 F.3d at 488.\n\n       Before touching on plaintiffs’ most heavily pressed intent\n\nevidence, we briefly dispense with their argument that racial\n\nintent can be inferred from the City’s use of precinct lines.\n\nPlaintiffs assail the district lines because they hew to precinct\n\nlines.   Conformity to such administrative boundaries is ordinarily\n\nseen as a virtue, not a vice, in the districting process.                 See\n\nBush, 116 S.Ct. at 1953 (noting maintenance of some county lines\n\nshowed   traditional     factors   were    not    entirely   ignored).    And\n\nplaintiffs have not identified--and there does not appear to be--a\n\nlarger, more race-neutral, administrative unit that could have been\n\npractically deployed.      Cf. Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2490 (noting that\n\nplan   split   several    counties,    and       thus   violated   traditional\n\ndistricting principles–use of precincts could not mitigate this\n\nfact in congressional districting). But the plaintiffs stress that\n\nthe City had access to racial data on the precinct level.                They\n\n\n                                      27\n\fattempt to analogize this situation to Bush, where the State used\n\na computer system that had racial data available on the block\n\nlevel.      The fact that the plan ultimately adopted split precincts\n\nand used block units instead was found to offer compelling proof\n\nthat race has predominated in the districting.               But the key factor\n\nin Bush was not the mere availability of racial data.               Rather, it\n\nwas   the    abandonment   of    a    traditional    districting    unit,    the\n\nprecinct.       Since   this    step    violated    traditional    districting\n\nprinciples and caused substantial administrative problems, and\n\nsince given the fact the only additional precision the computer\n\nprovided at the block level was racial, the obvious inference was\n\nthat race drove the decision.          See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1959.         Here,\n\nin contrast, the City adhered to the traditional--and apparently\n\nthe   only--administrative           boundaries    readily     available.    The\n\nplaintiffs complain that this is irrelevant, since the size of the\n\nprecincts was deliberately shrunk to allow more precise racial\n\ngerrymandering. However, the City of Houston does not set precinct\n\nsize, and the plaintiffs have not tied the changes in precinct\n\nsizes to any actions of the City.\n\n      A. Kingwood\n\n      The major change made by the City in 1997 was driven by the\n\nCity’s decision to annex Kingwood, an overwhelmingly white (Anglo)\n\nplanned community with a population of around 40,000 people that is\n\nattached to the detached Lake Houston area.            The decision to annex\n\n\n                                        28\n\fKingwood is itself not before this Court.   Rather, the plaintiffs\n\ncomplain that Kingwood--and with it the rest of the northeastern\n\nisland around Lake Houston-- was placed in District E. Previously,\n\nthis island had been attached to District B.   They claim that they\n\nhave direct evidence that race predominated in this decision--\n\nspecifically, that the City’s overwhelming motivation in doing so\n\nwas avoidance of potential section 5 retrogression liability.\n\nBecause   Kingwood has a large population, and because District B\n\nwas close to the one-person, one-vote   population limit, placing\n\nKingwood in B would have forced the City to move areas on the\n\nborders of B into the surrounding districts.   And because the only\n\ndistrict adjacent to B with a white (Anglo) majority--A--was\n\nalready relatively overpopulated, moving areas from B to A would\n\nhave in turn created more spillover effects, resulting in the\n\ndisruptive necessity of redrawing several districts.   Placement of\n\nspillover from B into Districts H or I would initially seem more\n\nattractive, since those districts were underpopulated.    However,\n\nthe addition of African-American voters displaced from B would\n\nseemingly have eliminated the Hispanic majorities in either or both\n\nof these districts.     The City believed that this might have\n\ntriggered retrogression concerns under section 5 of the Voting\n\nRights Act.7 Placement in District E, by comparison, allowed for\n\n7\n     Although we do not reach the question of strict scrutiny, we\nnote that there is evidence in the record indicating that Hispanics\ndo not constitute a majority of the citizen voting age population\nin either of the two nominally Hispanic districts. Citizen voting\n\n                                29\n\fthe smooth integration of Kingwood. Spillover and one-person, one-\n\nvote concerns were minimized, with only relatively minor border\n\nchanges made necessary.\n\n      The evidence clearly indicates that the City’s decision to\n\nplace Kingwood in District E was partially driven by the fear of\n\nretrogression.         Its section 5 filings and the statements of both\n\nthe   drafter     of    the   plan    and      the   council   members    involved\n\nestablishes this, and the City does not contest it.                    Indeed, it\n\nargues that this concern would allow it to survive strict scrutiny\n\nreview.   And to a certain extent--as discussed above, the issue is\n\nnot as pressing when a detached island is concerned--compactness\n\nwas sacrificed in the placement of Kingwood.                Kingwood is closer to\n\nDistrict B than it is to District E.                  However, a review of the\n\nrecord indicates that the Council had before it at the time it made\n\nits decision to place Kingwood in District E two other                   legitimate\n\ngrounds for justifying its decision.                 First, the City wanted to\n\npreserve communities of interest.               Second, it wanted to minimize\n\ndisruption   in    the    run-up     to   the    expected    major   redrawing   of\n\ndistricts following the 2000 census. On this record, we cannot say\n\nthat there has been an adequate showing that race predominated over\n\n\n\n\nage population is the proper measure under section 2 of the Voting\nRights Act. See Campos, 113 F.3d at 548. Conceptual difficulties\nare presented in evaluating retrogression under section 5 when no\nminority-majority districts are present to act as a baseline. See\nReno v. Bossier Parish School Board, 117 S.Ct., 1491, 1503-04\n(1996) (Thomas, concurring).\n\n                                          30\n\fthese concerns.\n\n       The most powerful alternative justification for the City’s\n\nactions is the nature of Kingwood and it greater community of\n\ninterest overlap with portions of District E.                 The Court has noted\n\nthat concern about communities of interest is a valid traditional\n\ndistricting tool that may serve to deflect an inference that race\n\npredominated in districting. See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1954 (evidence\n\nthat “district lines were drawn in part on the basis of evidence\n\n(other than racial data) of where communities of interest existed\n\nmight weaken a plaintiff’s claim that race predominated in the\n\ndrawing of district lines.”).             Here, transcripts of the series of\n\ncouncil debates that led to the final vote on the districting plan\n\ndemonstrate that members of the Council discussed and evaluated\n\ndata   that    indicated    that    Kingwood’s       communities       of    interest\n\noverlapped with District E, but were wildly at variance with\n\nDistrict B.      The fact that this material was available to the\n\nCouncil   at   the   time   they    were       deliberating      on   it    serves   to\n\ndistinguish     this    case       from     others    in      which        alternative\n\njustifications       have   been     raised      after     the    fact      and   only\n\nhypothetically motivated the districting body.                   See Shaw II, 116\n\nS.Ct. at 1902 n.4 (purported justification must be actual purpose\n\nin adopting plan and supported in the evidence); Bush, 116 S.Ct. at\n\n1955 (disregarding community of interest justification because data\n\nwas not before the legislature in an organized fashion).\n\n\n                                          31\n\f      In the Council debates, members of the Council referred to\n\nboth anecdotal and statistical evidence demonstrating that the\n\naverage income and quality of housing in Kingwood were much higher\n\nthat those found in District B, while the percentage of persons on\n\npublic relief and the occurrence of illiteracy was much smaller.\n\nMoreover, the members of the Council did not limit themselves to\n\ngeneral discussions of socioeconomic indicators.          They pointed to\n\nspecific factors that demonstrated that District B’s community\n\nconcerns varied from those in Kingwood.           Because Kingwood is a\n\nplanned community, it has excellent infrastructure. In comparison,\n\nthe infrastructure in District B was referred to as among the worst\n\nin the City.     This would raise the concern that the residents of\n\nKingwood’s desire and need for municipal improvements would diverge\n\nfrom those of other residents of District B.           It was also stated\n\nthat Kingwood had privatized several municipal services, and paid\n\nfor   services   using   regressive      user   fees   rather   than   more\n\nprogressive property taxation.        This difference would obviously\n\nlead to a divergence between the two areas’ approaches to services\n\nand taxation.8    In comparison, District E was said to be far more\n\ncongruent with Kingwood than District B.          Its infrastructure and\n\naverage income were much closer to Kingwood’s.          It also contained\n\nplanned   communities    that   shared    Kingwood’s    special   concerns\n\n8\n     We note that although this discussion was couched in terms of\ncommunities of interest, and the City chooses to defend it as such,\nthere are significant overtones of political as well as community\njustification in the debates.\n\n                                   32\n\fregarding   services     and       taxation.      In    light    of   the    greater\n\nsimilarity between the two areas, in the eyes of the members voting\n\nfor the plan it made sense to place Kingwood in District E.\n\n     Significantly, opponents of the plan--and two Council members,\n\nas well as the plaintiffs’ lawyer in this case, spoke out in some\n\ndepth   against    it    before       the    vote--never        challenged    these\n\nassumptions.        At        no    point      were    the   Council        members’\n\ncharacterization         of        Kingwood’s         socio-economic         status,\n\ninfrastructure, and services called into question in any way.                    The\n\nclosest an opponent of the plan came to undermining the majority’s\n\ncommunity of interest assumptions was a discourse by one of the\n\nmembers who voted against the plan.             He argued that communities of\n\ninterest were inherently linked to geography, and thus could not\n\nbind Kingwood to District E.           In its strong form, this statement\n\nwould make communities of interest a mere subset of geographic\n\ncompactness.      In its weak form, it is generally correct and a\n\nuseful observation to guard against abuses of the community of\n\ninterest rationale. Here, however, this reasoning is inapplicable.\n\nSince Kingwood was separated from the main body of both Districts\n\nB and E, it was never likely to share a sense of geographic\n\nneighborliness with either district.              The question was not one of\n\nplacing Kingwood in either District E or an adjacent community\n\nlinked in the eyes of the populace with Kingwood.                     Instead, the\n\nissue was which of two geographically isolated areas Kingwood and\n\nits surrounds should be shoehorned into–a district in which it had\n\n                                        33\n\fnothing in common or one with which it shared at least some points\n\nof community concern.\n\n     Nor    have    the    plaintiffs      pointed    on   their   appeal    to   any\n\nevidence that undermines the community of interest justification.\n\nAs noted above, their arguments and evidence regarding communities\n\nof interest are fatally flawed by the broad level of generality\n\nthey adopt. Here, this weakness is especially glaring. Plaintiffs\n\nhave not presented data about Kingwood at all, let alone introduced\n\nevidence that undermines the arguments made by proponents of the\n\nplan at the time.           Since Dr. Maggiotto did not separate out\n\nKingwood,    his    data    cannot    be    used     to    undermine   the   City’s\n\njustification here--there is no evidence that factors such as\n\noccupations or educational level create a significant point of\n\ncommonality between Kingwood and District B that mitigates the\n\ndivide created by raw income and other factors.                        Indeed, Dr.\n\nMaggiotto’s evidence largely confirms the City’s analysis.                        It\n\nshows that District B was the second poorest district in the City,\n\nwhile District E was the second richest, and contains the lowest\n\nvariation of income.         At most, plaintiffs have shown that all of\n\nDistrict E is not exactly congruent with Kingwood.                  They have not\n\nshown, and have never claimed, that Kingwood was more similar in\n\nregard to the factors discussed to District B than it was to\n\nDistrict E.        And they never attempted to introduce, by expert\n\nopinion or otherwise, evidence tending to show that this lack of\n\nsimilarity    was    overcome    by   the       presence    of   commonalities    in\n\n                                           34\n\fnonquantifiable indicia of communities of interest.9                      In short,\n\nthis is not a case where a decision is justified by a “mere\n\nrecitation of purported communities of interest” unproven by facts\n\nin the record.       Cf. Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2490.\n\n      Further support for the City’s position is provided by the\n\nspecial nature of the decision of where to place Kingwood.                       Not\n\nonly was the council presented with the awkward task of placing a\n\ndisconnected,    newly-acquired       parcel     of    land   into    a     settled\n\ndistricting scheme, it also did so against the looming background\n\nof the upcoming census.        As a result of the 2000 census, the City\n\nwill in the near future receive significantly better data about its\n\npopulation.      A    report   prepared    for   the    Council      by    a   local\n\nuniversity professor, Dr. Alford, indicated that the City would be\n\nrequired to engage in a major overhaul of its districts in light of\n\nthis data, and that a similar effort in 1997 based on soon-to-be\n\nobsolete census figures would be inefficient.             The City evidently\n\nhas   followed   a    practice   of   confining       major   changes       to   the\n\ndistricting that follows the census.                  See Campos v. City of\n\nHouston, 968 F.2d 446, 449 (5th Cir. 1992) (discussing replacement\n\nof old plan “used during the 1980s” in wake of 1990 census).                      In\n\n\n\n9\n     Had there been meaningful evidence to that effect it might\nwell have been difficult to refute for summary judgment purposes.\nBecause of the inherently subjective nature of the concept, it\nwould seem that reasonable people might disagree as to what\nconstitutes a community. We thus caution against general over-\nreliance on the communities of interest factor.\n\n                                      35\n\flight of this, it is hardly surprising that the City would be\n\nreluctant to place Kingwood in an area which would require major\n\nalterations of the district plan. Several Council members spoke to\n\nthis effect. By placing Kingwood in District E, the City minimized\n\nthe spillover effect mandated by one-person, one-vote concerns, and\n\nthe corresponding mass redrawing of districts that would ensue.\n\nUnder the special--if not wholly unique--situation created here by\n\na major annexation located so soon before the next census, this\n\nwould seem a valid concern.10\n\n     The plaintiffs attempt to undermine this evidence by arguing,\n\nin essence, that the Council’s debates were mere smoke and mirrors\n\nconcocted in anticipation of precisely this lawsuit.    Certainly,\n\nthe debates evidence an intense awareness of the possibility that\n\nthe districting would be subject to a Shaw suit.   The first day of\n\nthe debate began with legal counsel explaining the nuances of\n\nMiller and Bush in great detail to the Council.      However, this\n\nrecord does not support a conclusion that the whole debate was\n\n\n10\n     We note that this conclusion was strongly reinforced in the\neyes of several Council members     by the plaintiffs’ failure to\ndraft an alternative plan.      While the drawing of a flawless\nalternative is not necessary to mount a Shaw suit, and we recognize\nthe difficulties private litigants may have in doing so, it would\ncertainly have helped under the circumstances. Faced with a choice\nbetween a comprehensive plan that was supported by several\nindependent justifications and the plaintiffs’ response--a map of\nthe City showing Kingwood and its environs in District B, with no\nindication of the boundary shifts that would follow--it would not\nbe surprising if the Council members imagined a worst-case scenario\nin regards to disruption (or the possible effects on their own\ndistrict).\n\n                                36\n\fessentially scripted. The voluminous testimony exhibits meaningful\n\ndisputation, and several proponents of the plan used language and\n\ntook positions that are not consistent at all with the hypothesis\n\nthat the supporters of the plan were carefully coached.                 Given the\n\npresumption in favor of legislative good faith granted in this\n\narea, we cannot say on this record that the mere fact that the\n\nCouncil was aware of the meaningful possibility of this litigation\n\nsuffices to create a fact issue as to their statements being mere\n\npretexts for concealed racial motivation.              We cannot say that a\n\nfact issue has been created regarding the predominance of race in\n\nthe   placement    of   Kingwood.       The    decision     was     independently\n\njustified by several factors besides race at the time it was\n\nadopted,    and   the   force   of   the     traditional    concern     that   was\n\nsacrificed--compactness--was diminished by the context of placement\n\nof a detached island.\n\n      B. Continuation of a racially motivated districting structure\n\n      Plaintiffs also contend that the City violated Shaw by failing\n\nto make substantial changes in a districting structure that was\n\noriginally    designed    in    a   manner    that   race   predominated       over\n\ntraditional districting concerns.            The sins of past Councils, and\n\nthe Department of Justice (DOJ), thus are claimed to haunt the\n\ncurrent    Council’s    asserted     ratification     of    their    work.     The\n\ndistrict court summarily rejected this argument, reasoning that the\n\nconstitutionality of the prior plans had never been challenged, and\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\fthe intent behind their creation was thus not properly before the\n\ncourt.     This would appear to have been overly hasty.                   In the\n\ncontext of Voting Rights Act suits, evidence that impermissible\n\nracial intent had tainted the plan upon which the challenged plan\n\nwas based has been allowed, even when enough time has elapsed for\n\na substantial degree of familiarity and political reliance to\n\nemerge.    See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 768-69\n\n(9th Cir. 1990), cert denied 111 S.Ct. 681 (1991).                     The mere\n\npassage of time cannot extinguish entirely the taint of racial\n\ndiscrimination.      See Hunter v. Underwood, 105 S.Ct. 1916 (1985)\n\n(discriminatory intent behind 1901 disenfranchisement provision\n\ncoupled     with   continued     discriminatory       impact    relied    on   to\n\ninvalidate statute).       And in a context like the one before us,\n\nwhere the City redistricts relatively frequently, adoption of the\n\nCity’s position would seem problematic because it would give\n\npotential    challengers    an    incentive      to    launch   more     frequent\n\nlawsuits. If the potential plaintiffs did not sue, they might find\n\nthat the passage of other plans had sanitized the intent embodied\n\nin the prior plan.\n\n      We first note that while race clearly played an important role\n\nin   the   earlier   districting    efforts,     the    quality   of     evidence\n\nintroduced by the plaintiffs in regard to the earlier efforts (as\n\nwell as respecting the 1997 ordinance) falls far short of that\n\nintroduced    in   the   cases   examined   by    the   Supreme   Court.       As\n\n\n                                      38\n\fdiscussed above, the objective, circumstantial evidence of the\n\npredominance of race is far weaker than in those cases.              As for\n\ndirect evidence, in the Shaw cases not only was the end product of\n\nDOJ intervention a monstrosity that massively violated traditional\n\ndistricting principles, but the State also openly stated in its\n\nsection 5 filings that race was its dominant concern rather than\n\njust   a   factor.    See   Shaw   II,   116   S.Ct.   1901    (preclearance\n\nsubmission announced creation of minority districts was State’s\n\n“overriding purpose”).      A similar direct admission of intent was\n\npresent in Bush.     See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957 (testimony of state\n\nofficials in related litigation claimed that race was the primary\n\nconsideration in districting).      And in Miller, where--as here--the\n\ndistrict’s shape was not itself extremely bizarre, the evidence\n\nthat race trumped other concerns was conclusive.              There, the DOJ\n\nrejected proposed plans not once, but twice, and ultimately made it\n\nclear to the State that it would only accept a result that mirrored\n\na plan proposed by a third party, the ACLU.             Ultimately a plan\n\ndesigned around this framework was adopted, as legislators who\n\nvoted in its favor testified,11 simply because the State felt it had\n\n\n\n11\n     Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs have introduced the\naffidavits of two members of the Council who were opposed to the\nplan.   The affidavits do not purport to relate incriminating\nconversations or statements made by proponents of the plan that\nwould serve to demonstrate the majority’s intent--they merely state\nthe dissident Council Members’ personal opinions.        And their\nopinion that race predominated, while no doubt deeply held, cannot\ndemonstrate the impermissible intent of the majority.\n\n                                    39\n\fno other choice.     Obviously, the ACLU lawyer who drew up the\n\noutlines of the plan challenged in Miller could have no firm\n\nunderstanding of, or respect for, the subtleties of traditional\n\ndistricting.   See Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1933 (State “adopted the\n\nJustice    Department’s    entirely      race-focused     approach       to\n\nredistricting”); Johnson v. Miller, 864 F.Supp. 1354, 1368 (S.D.\n\nGa. 1994) (lower court discusses role of ACLU drafter).                 The\n\ninference was thus automatic that race had not only predominated\n\nover, but had indeed almost entirely extinguished, traditional\n\ndistricting concerns.\n\n       Here, in contrast, the only evidence that the plaintiffs\n\nproduced is the raw history of DOJ intervention, which contains no\n\nbrazen admission that race predominated and no details regarding a\n\npattern of DOJ pressure.12      Plaintiffs relied on the fact that in\n\n1991 the City’s original plan was denied preclearance, and that\n\nwhile the plan the City drafted in response creating additional\n\nconcentrations of minorities was never implemented, it formed the\n\ntemplate for the 1993, 1995, and 1997 districtings.        Based solely\n\non these facts and the section 5 filings that accompanied the plans\n\n(and   demographic   evidence    that,   as   we   discussed   above,    is\n\n\n12\n     One piece of evidence that might have proven extremely helpful\nfor the plaintiffs’ case in this regard would be transcripts of\nCouncil debates surrounding the adoption of the prior plans. While\nthe 1997 debate is in the record, the earlier ones are not. Had\nthose debates been as open and detailed as the 1997 record, they\nperhaps could have proven decisive against summary disposition\nhere.\n\n                                   40\n\finsufficient to sustain plaintiffs’ case), the plaintiffs’ expert\n\nDr. Weber opined that race had predominated in all of the City’s\n\ndistricting since 1991. Certainly, this material establishes that\n\nrace was a factor in prior districtings, and that the form of those\n\ndistricts was largely reenacted in 1997.      It also establishes an\n\nintention on the part of the City to establish minority-majority\n\ndistricts. And, a glance at the district maps verifies that the\n\nCity’s original plan was more compact than the ones subsequently\n\nadopted.\n\n     But the City has always conceded these points, and as we\n\ndiscussed above the sacrifice in compactness was not extreme.       And\n\nthis Court has interpreted the Supreme Court’s current position to\n\ninclude a majority in favor of Justice O’Connor’s statement in Bush\n\nthat the intentional creation of minority-majority districts will\n\nnot in and of itself trigger strict scrutiny.     See Bush, 116 S.Ct.\n\nat 1951; Clark, 88 F.3d at 1404 n.2; Theriot, 185 F.3d at 488.      The\n\nplaintiffs’ burden was thus to show that race predominated over\n\ntraditional   districting   concerns,   not   merely   that   the   City\n\nattempted to craft minority-majority districts and that there was\n\nsome but not massive reduction of one such factor--compactness.\n\nHere, all that has been demonstrated is that the DOJ aggressively\n\nforced a consciousness of race and the Voting Rights Act upon the\n\nCity.   The City then abandoned its initial plan--one presumably\n\ngrounded   firmly   in   traditional    districting     principles–and\n\n\n                                 41\n\fultimately adopted a system that met the DOJ’s requirements.                 Were\n\ndistricting   an   exact     science,       in   which   the   application    of\n\ntraditional districting principles always produced one objectively\n\noptimal   solution,   this     would    perhaps      settle    the   question--\n\nabandonment of the optimal traditional plan would demonstrate\n\nsubordination. But districting is hardly a science. It would seem\n\nobvious to us that there is more than one way to draw a district so\n\nthat it can reasonably be described as meaningfully adhering to\n\ntraditional principles, even if not to the same extent or degree as\n\nsome other hypothetical district.\n\n     If, in the wake of the DOJ’s intervention, the City had\n\nreturned to the problem and properly considered race as a factor\n\nalongside traditional districting principles, and the result they\n\nreached had satisfied the DOJ without substantially abandoning\n\nthose principles, race would not automatically have predominated.\n\nFor example, the City could have returned to the drawing board and\n\ngenerated a plan that increased the recognition of communities of\n\ninterest and satisfied the DOJ’s racial concerns.13              The fact that\n\n13\n     Presumably, there is a platonic ideal form covering each of\nthe traditional districting principles, and they will not always\noverlap. For example, adherence to administrative boundaries will\nby its very nature subvert mathematical compactness, since these\nunits are not uniform. When a factor is legitimately raised, it\nwill always in a sense subordinate other factors--the raising of\npolitical concerns will interfere with compactness or communities\nof interest or race. If, after a plan was laboriously crafted, a\nCouncil member objected on the grounds that it severed his\nresidence from his district, and changes were then made, this\nrejection and alteration of the plan would show that political\nconcerns were a factor. But the fact that a finished plan was\n\n                                       42\n\fcompactness   was   somewhat   lessened      in   the   process    would   not\n\nestablish that strict scrutiny was required, because race might not\n\nhave predominated over communities of interest.           Thus abandonment\n\nof an original plan by itself does not demonstrate that race\n\npredominated--the adopted plan may have also been the product of\n\nand   substantially     consistent        with    traditional     districting\n\nprinciples.   The plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence that this\n\ndid not in fact occur.    As discussed above, the plaintiffs failed\n\nto show specific areas in which communities of interest were\n\nsubordinated to race, and they never claimed that the original plan\n\nwas a more adequate reflection of that traditional districting\n\nprinciple than those that followed.          The plaintiffs’ expert, Dr.\n\nWeber, conceded that he did not take into account the City’s desire\n\nto reflect communities of interest, since he believes that the\n\ncriteria used to measure this concept are themselves closely\n\ncorrelated with race.\n\n      While the rabid extremes of the DOJ conduct in Miller should\n\nhardly stand as a minimum litmus test in such matters, it would\n\nseem to us that a plaintiff is required to do more than merely\n\ndemonstrate that the DOJ had somewhat effective input in the\n\nprocess to trigger strict scrutiny. “It is not Justice Department\n\n\nrejected would not in and of itself show that this political input\npredominated.    One or more other factors would surely be\nsacrificed, but not only the political concern that drove it but\nalso other factors might be advanced. Ultimate approval of the\nchange might be based not only on the grounds that led to it being\nproposed, but also because of the other interests it advanced.\n\n                                     43\n\finterference per se that is the concern, but rather the fact that\n\nJustice Department pressure led the State to act based on an\n\noverriding concern with race.”           Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1934.           And\n\nthat is all the plaintiffs have really done here.                    The DOJ will\n\nalmost   always    have   this   kind    of   input     into   the    districting\n\ndecisions of jurisdictions covered under section 5. At least in\n\nthose    jurisdictions,    then,   accepting      the    plaintiffs’      minimal\n\nshowing here would render Justice O’Connor’s allowance for the\n\ncreation    of    minority-majority       districts      of    merely    academic\n\ninterest.    In the process, such a           rule would in practice narrow\n\nwhat is already a difficult passage through the Scylla of the\n\nVoting Rights Act and the Charybdis of Shaw nearly to the vanishing\n\npoint–virtually every decision the jurisdiction made would run\n\naground on the rocks of litigation.            Here, for example, the City\n\nwould have surely run into trouble had it disregarded the DOJ’s\n\nsuggestion regarding the creation of more minority concentrations.\n\nBut by the mere fact of heeding these objections, plaintiffs claim,\n\nthe City automatically exposed itself to a lawsuit triable under\n\nstrict scrutiny. DOJ’s overreaching will occasionally inflict this\n\ndilemma in any event--to exacerbate the problem by making it an\n\nironclad rule would seem inadvisable.\n\n     Given the fact that the plaintiffs bore the burden of proof on\n\nthis issue, and the presumption in favor of the Council’s good\n\nfaith, the plaintiffs needed to undercut the hypothesis that the\n\n\n                                        44\n\fCity’s     plans    were     independently            substantially     justified   by\n\ntraditional districting factors. They failed to do so. An obvious\n\nmechanism would be to use circumstantial evidence based on the\n\ndistricts’ shape and demographics to shore up the direct evidence\n\nof intent. But as discussed above, the plaintiffs’ circumstantial\n\nevidence is inadequate to allow a finding that race predominated.\n\nNor did the plaintiffs point to adequate direct evidence that the\n\ncompliance with the DOJ’s desires was the predominate, driving\n\nforce behind the plan, rather than merely one factor, along with\n\ntraditional ones, in the overall equation.                  Cf., e.g., Abrams, 117\n\nS.Ct. at 1934 (discussing direct evidence from drafter of plan that\n\npreceded    the    one   challenged    in        Miller     that   he   viewed   draft\n\nincluding two majority-minority districts, that it was viewed as\n\nridiculous and not making sense, and going on to note testimony of\n\nlegislators that indicated that all other considerations yielded to\n\nDOJ desire to maximize minority districts).\n\n     And    in     any     case,   while        the    district    court    erred   in\n\ncategorically and totally dismissing evidence of intent garnered\n\nfrom prior plans, it was correct to point out that the state of\n\nmind involved in the prior plans is not of itself what is precisely\n\nand directly the ultimate issue before the Court in this case.                      We\n\nhave noted in a different context that while under Hunter the\n\ndiscriminatory intent of the original drafter may carry forward\n\ndespite subsequent judicial invalidation of the most obviously\n\n\n                                           45\n\fdiscriminatory provisions, intervening reenactment with meaningful\n\nalterations may render the current law valid.                   See Cotton v.\n\nFordice,     157     F.3d      388,    391     (5th     Cir.    1988)     (while\n\ndisenfranchisement constitutional provision originated in attempt\n\nto discriminate, subsequent reenactment with alterations approved\n\nby voters added categories of crimes originally excluded because\n\nthey were not considered “Black” crimes and subtracted a less\n\nserious offense that had been considered a “Black” crime).                 We do\n\nnot suggest that the changes implemented in 1993, 1995, and 1997 to\n\nthe original       framework    were   as    dramatic   as   those   in   Cotton.\n\nHowever, that case broadly stands for the important point that when\n\na plan is reenacted--as opposed to merely remaining on the books\n\nlike the provision in Hunter--the state of mind of the reenacting\n\nbody must also be considered.\n\n     Here, the passage of time lent an additional element to the\n\nCouncil’s intent.       Maintenance of established district lines is\n\nitself a traditional districting principle, and the City included\n\nit in its guidelines for the 1997 revision.             And the adopted plan\n\nminimized the changes in district boundaries. Standing alone, that\n\nwould not matter much here--the mere passage of six years cannot\n\nhave hallowed the current districts with much familiarity or\n\ntradition.    But in the context of the approaching census, this\n\nprinciple would seem to have some validity.              As discussed above,\n\nthe City had before it when it voted on the plan information\n\n\n                                       46\n\findicating that a radical revision of its boundaries (for its soon\n\nto follow elections) will be necessary in light of the 2000 census.\n\nWhat   the    district    court   characterized     as   a   “scorched-earth”\n\nredrawing of the districts--what Dr. Weber’s views would have\n\nlogically required to purge all taint of DOJ interference–would\n\nhave little to recommend it under the circumstances.             Such ground-\n\nup revisions are difficult to implement, and as one Council member\n\nargued,      can   be   “wholly   disruptive    toward   the   political   and\n\nneighborhood relationships we have established in the city.”               This\n\nfact hardly justifies the “freezing“ of district lines in the\n\nmanner the district court seemed to endorse.                 However, it does\n\ncaution against wholesale alteration based on out-of-date census\n\nfigures when the process will in any case have to be done in the\n\nimmediate future.        In the context of close proximity to the census\n\n(with new elections soon to follow), we think that residual doubt\n\nas to the appropriateness of summary judgment is extinguished by\n\nthe fact that the City had valid reasons to adhere to its prior\n\nborders distinct from the grounds which led to their adoption.\n\n       Thus, although the issue on appeal is extremely close, we\n\nultimately conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs’ Shaw claim.           On this record, we cannot say that\n\nplaintiffs have carried their burden and made a sufficient showing,\n\neither circumstantially or directly, to sustain a finding that race\n\npredominated in the districting.            We stress that our decision here\n\n\n\n                                       47\n\frests largely on the evidentiary shortcomings in the plaintiffs’\n\ncase.   We would also add that in our analysis of the direct intent\n\nevidence we relied on the rapid approach of the census, and the\n\nCity’s expectation that a major overhaul of districts (and soon to\n\nfollow elections) will occur at that time. Our opinion here cannot\n\nbe   read   as   a   conclusive   endorsement   of   these   districts’\n\nconstitutional status, since on better showing by the plaintiffs\n\nthe result might well have been different.      Nor can it be viewed as\n\nan open invitation to the City to maintain the current boundaries\n\nand overall structure in the redistricting that follows the 2000\n\ncensus. See Campos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d 544, 548 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (clarifying proper standard of measurement under section 2);\n\nid. at 545 (discussing pattern of election results); United States\n\nv. City of Houston, 800 F.Supp. 504, 508 (S.D. Tex. 1992) (Jones,\n\nJ.) (discussing election results and question of safe versus\n\nmarginal districts in the retrogression context).\n\nIV. One Person, One Vote\n\n     Plaintiffs also contend that the votes of residents of several\n\ndistricts were devalued by the City’s deliberate undersizing of\n\nminority voting districts.    The heart of this one-person, one-vote\n\nclaim is that the City, despite being aware that it contained\n\npockets with extremely high ratios of noncitizens, improperly\n\ncrafted its districts to equalize total population rather than\n\ncitizen voting age population (CVAP).      The plaintiffs argue that\n\n\n                                   48\n\fwhen total population is obviously an imperfect proxy for potential\n\nvoters, the    City    is   constitutionally    required    to   use   a   more\n\naccurate measurement of voters.           And using CVAP figures, it is\n\nclear that several Houston districts fall outside the ten percent\n\nthreshold established as a safe-harbor for population variance in\n\nmunicipal election districts.        The district court rejected this\n\nclaim, and for slightly different reasons we agree.\n\n     The Equal Protection Clause requires         that representatives to\n\nan elected body be drawn from voting districts of substantially\n\nequal population.      Reynolds v. Sims, 84 S.Ct. 1362 (1964).14           This\n\nguarantee extends to local elections. See Avery v. Midland County,\n\n88 S.Ct. 1114 (1968).       However, because state and local elections\n\nare not subject to the explicit commands of the Constitution\n\nregarding federal elections, they are not held to a standard of\n\nabsolute population equity. See Brown v. Thompson, 103 S.Ct. 2690,\n\n2695-96 (1983) (state must make only a good faith effort to ensure\n\npopulation    equity    and   may   balance    population    against       other\n\nlegitimate concerns).       If the maximum variation between districts\n\n\n\n14\n     See, e.g., id. at 1385 “. . . the Equal Protection Clause\nrequires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state\nlegislature must be apportioned on a population basis.     Simply\nstated, an individual’s right to vote for state legislators is\nunconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial\nfashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in\nother parts of the state,” and 1390 “the Equal Protection Clause\nrequires that a state make an honest and good faith effort to\nconstruct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly\nof equal population as is practicable.”\n\n                                     49\n\fexceeds a certain threshold, the state will be required to justify\n\nthe variance by invoking such concerns.             Mahan v. Howell, 93 S.Ct.\n\n987 (1973) (16.4% variation justified by constraints of political\n\nsubdivision    lines).        However,    below    a   certain   threshold    the\n\nplaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case and the\n\ndistricting body will not be required to justify minor variations.\n\nSee Gaffney v. Cummings, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 2330 (1973).              The Court has\n\nindicated that this threshold is ten percent. See, e.g., Connor v.\n\nFinch,   97   S.Ct.   1828,    1833   (1977)      (setting   threshold   at   ten\n\npercent). Here, the maximum variation between the City’s districts\n\nwas found by the district court to be 8.63% when measured by total\n\npopulation, and the plaintiffs have never claimed that using this\n\npopulation base the variation exceeds 10%.               The plaintiffs would\n\nthus appear to have failed to make out a prima facie case.15\n\n\n15\n     The plaintiffs complain that three of the four minority\ndistricts are undersized relative to a hypothetical ideal district.\nThree minority districts are indeed undersized, and one of them is\nthe smallest district in the City. The City concedes that this is\nthe case, and also concedes that this fact is at least partially\ntraceable to concerns that the 1990 census undercounted minorities.\nAt the time the basic outlines of the districts were constructed,\nthe City claims that it believed that there might be a revision of\nthe census, and thus predominantly minority districts were\nundersized to prevent them from later being viewed as oversized.\nBased on the limited information in the record and the City’s\nstatement, it appears clear that this undersizing was not based on\nany scientific measurement designed to correct for perceived flaws\nin the census.     Nor was it applied equally to the minority\npopulation--only minorities living in certain districts were\naffected. Had it been shown that the City’s districts breached the\nten percent threshold when either of these manipulations were\nremoved or when they were applied properly to all minorities in the\nCity, the City’s hasty and unscientific methods to adjust the\n\n                                         50\n\f       The plaintiffs argue, however, that the City’s districts do\n\nshatter the ten percent threshold once the proper measurement of\n\nvoters in utilized.       They argue that they have thus made out a\n\nprima facie case of vote dilution.          Plaintiffs contend that data\n\navailable to the City indicated that areas with concentrated\n\nHispanic populations had an extremely high number of noncitizens.\n\nThey argue that given this well-known fact, the City should have\n\nrecognized that total population would not serve as a meaningful\n\nproxy for potentially eligible voters--areas with concentrations of\n\nHispanics would have a far larger population than potentially\n\neligible      voters.     By    nevertheless   continuing   to   use    total\n\npopulation, the City devalued the votes of residents in districts\n\nthat did not contain concentrations of Hispanic voters. They argue\n\nthat   when    measured   against    the   proper   standard,    the   City’s\n\ndistricts displayed a maximum variance well in excess of the\n\nallowable ten percent.         We have had cause before to note the high\n\nnumber of Hispanic residents of Houston who are not citizens.             See\n\nCampos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d 544, 547 (5th Cir. 1997)\n\n(census figures indicate 45.8% of adult Hispanics in City are\n\n\n\ncensus might well have created a violation. However, plaintiffs\nhave not shown, or even claimed, that this is the case. And even\nif the ten percent de minimis threshold is not viewed as an\nabsolute bar, we cannot say on this sparse record that a reasonable\nfact finder could find that the City’s decisions here evidenced the\n“bad faith, arbitrariness, or invidious discrimination” courts have\nrequired in cases involving variations under ten percent. See Daly\nv. Hunt, 93 F.3d 1212, 1220-21 (4th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                      51\n\fnoncitizens).    And the plaintiffs have produced data that appears\n\nto   clearly   show   that    when     the    CVAP   of   Houston    districts    is\n\ncompared, the maximum variance indeed exceeds the ten percent\n\nthreshold.     If the City were required by the Equal Protection\n\nClause to use CVAP rather than total population in crafting its\n\ndistricts, then, summary judgment for the city would have been\n\ninappropriate.     However, while this is a close question, we find\n\nthat the choice of population figures is a choice left to the\n\npolitical process.        Houston did not violate the Equal Protection\n\nClause.\n\n      Plaintiffs’ argument is straightforward. A Reynolds claim is,\n\nafter all, a “‘one person, one vote’” claim.                  See Reynolds, 84\n\nS.Ct. at 1380 (quoting Gray v. Sanders, 83 S.Ct. 801, 809 (1963)).\n\nSince the inquiry focuses on the dilution of votes, it would be\n\nimproper to allow the votes of two adult citizens to be weighed\n\nequally with the vote of a single adult citizen merely because the\n\nlatter happened to live in proximity to a noncitizen ineligible to\n\nvote.16      Plaintiffs      concede    that    under     many,     if   not   most,\n\n\n16\n     Clearly, the United States Constitution does not forbid the\nstates from restricting the franchise to citizens.      See, e.g.,\nSugarman v. Dougall, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 2851 (“This Court has never\nheld that aleins have a constitutional right to vote or to hold\nhigh public office under the Equal Protection Clause.      Indeed,\nimplicit in many of this Court’s voting rights decisions is the\nnotion that citizenship is a permissible criterion for limiting\nsuch rights”); id. at 2851 n.13 (“In congressional debates leading\nto the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, there is clear\nevidence that Congress not only knew that as a matter of local\npractice aliens had not been granted the right to vote, but that\n\n                                         52\n\fcircumstances this distinction will be irrelevant--generally, the\n\nineligible to vote or to register to do so (whether felons, minors,\n\nor noncitizens) can be assumed to be evenly distributed throughout\n\nthe area to be districted, and the usage of total population is\n\nthus an acceptable surrogate for measuring potential voters. When,\n\nhowever, a districting body knows that large numbers of those\n\nineligible to vote are disproportionately concentrated in certain\n\nareas, it can no longer in good faith use total population as a\n\nproxy for potential voters.   Instead, it is obligated to deploy a\n\nmore sophisticated measurement, such as CVAP.\n\n     Two circuit courts have addressed this issue.       The Ninth\n\n\n\n\nunder the amendment they did not receive a constitutional right of\nsuffrage or a constitutional right to participate in the political\nprocess of state government, and that, indeed, the right to vote\nand the concomitant right of participation in the political process\nwere matters of local law.”). See also Foley v. Connelie, 98 S.Ct.\n1067 at 1070 (1978) (“. . . we have recognized ‘a state’s\nhistorical power to exclude aliens from participation in its\ndemoctractic political institutions’ . . . as a part of the\nsovereign’s obligation ‘to preserve the basic conception of a\npolicial community,’” quoting Dougall, 93 S.Ct. at 2850).       The\nvoting rights protections of the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-\nFourth and Twenty-Sixth Amendments are restricted to “citizens,” as\nis section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973.        The\nprotection of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges And Immunities\nClause, which has been said to embrace “the right to vote for\nnational officers,” Twining v. New Jersey, 29 S.Ct. 14, 19 (1908),\nis limited to “citizens.” And, the congressional representation\npenalty of section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment is brought into\nplay only by    denial of voting rights (except for rebellion or\nother crime) to adult, male inhabitants who are “citizens.”\n\n     On the other hand, we are also aware of no provision of the\nConstitution which expressly or by clear implication prohibits the\nstates from extending the franchise to lawfully resident aliens.\n\n                                53\n\fCircuit has found that total population is not only a permissible\n\nmethod to measure population when known significant concentrations\n\nof those not eligible to vote exist, but has also suggested that\n\nits usage may be required under the Equal Protection Clause in some\n\ncircumstances. See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763,\n\n775 (9th Cir. 1990), cert denied, 111 S.Ct. 681 (1991) (approving\n\ncourt ordered plan using total population and opining that use of\n\nCVAP “would constitute a denial of equal protection to these\n\nHispanic   plaintiffs”).         The   Fourth    Circuit,   confronting      the\n\nanalogous issue of districting when persons below the voting age\n\nwere unevenly distributed, has stated that the choice between total\n\npopulation or a measurement of potential voters is left to the\n\nlegislative body.    In doing so, it implicitly rejected the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s contention that a districting body might be required by\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause to use total population as a baseline.\n\nSee Daly v. Hunt, 93 F.3d 1212, 1227 (4th Cir. 1996) (remanding on\n\nother grounds).     However, in a powerful dissent in Garza, Judge\n\nKozinski concluded that, at least when the plan is court ordered,\n\nthe Constitution requires the use of a measurement that accurately\n\ntracks potential voters.      See Garza, 918 F.2d at 785.\n\n     The Supreme Court has from the beginning of this line of cases\n\nbeen somewhat     evasive   in    regard    to   which   population   must    be\n\nequalized. See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1390 (state should attempt to\n\napportion “so that each [districting unit] has an identical number\n\n\n                                       54\n\fof residents, or citizens, or voters”). However, it has also\n\nindicated with some clarity that the choice has political overtones\n\nthat caution against judicial intrusion.       See Burns v. Richardson,\n\n86 S.Ct. 1286, 1297 (1966) (state not required to use total\n\npopulation figures, since the choice of measurement “involves\n\nchoices about the nature of representation with which we have been\n\nshown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere”).               The\n\ndebate   does   indeed   involve   questions    about   the   nature   of\n\nrepresentative democracy.    As Judge Kozinski’s dissent recognizes,\n\nand the Daly opinion outlines, there is nothing inherent in the\n\nconcept of representative democracy that requires the embrace of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ position.\n\n     The choice presented is, in Judge Kozinski’s terms, one\n\nbetween electoral equality and representational equality.          While\n\nfor the most part obscured by the happy coincidence that eligible\n\nvoters will frequently track the total population evenly--in which\n\ncase either measurement would produce similar results, and total\n\npopulation will probably be used since it is easier to gather--this\n\nis a fundamental and difficult question.          If total population\n\nfigures are used in an area in which potentially eligible voters\n\nare unevenly distributed, the result will necessarily devalue the\n\nvotes of individuals in the area with a higher percentage of\n\npotentially eligible voters.       The large populations in the other\n\ndistrict will leverage the votes of the smaller number of eligible\n\n\n                                    55\n\fvoters there.     However, if a more carefully calibrated measurement\n\nis    embraced   in   order   to    serve    this   principle      of   individual\n\nelectoral equality, the area with the smaller number of voters will\n\nfind itself relatively disadvantaged. Despite the fact that it has\n\na larger population--and thus perhaps a greater need for government\n\nservices than the other community--it will find that its political\n\npower does not adequately reflect its size.               In addition, it could\n\nbe argued that because the representative chosen from such a\n\ndistrict will have a larger number of constituents, the ability of\n\nher constituents--whether or not they are potential voters--to\n\npetition and voice their opinions will be proportionately reduced.\n\nSee Garza, 918 F.2d at 775.           But see Daly, 93 F.3d at 1226-27 &\n\nn.12    (expressing    doubt       regarding    validity     of    equal    access\n\nargument).       If one accepts the principle of representational\n\nequality--that representatives are chosen by a district’s voters,\n\nbut should represent all persons resident therein--these results\n\nmay be     unacceptable.       The choice between these two models is\n\nstark, and because it is rarely encountered, historical and legal\n\nguidance is sparse.\n\n       Judge Kozinski makes a powerful case that the general tenor of\n\nthe    Court’s   opinions     mandates       protection    of     the   individual\n\npotential voter. Certainly, to take just a few examples contained\n\nin Judge Kozinski’s comprehensive summary, there is ample language\n\nin the opinions that strongly implies that it is the right of the\n\n\n\n                                        56\n\findividual potential voter that must be protected.                               See, e.g.,\n\nReynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1384 (“the Equal Protection Clause guarantees\n\nthe opportunity for equal participation by all voters in the\n\nelection of state legislators.                 Diluting the weight of votes\n\nbecause of place of residence impairs basic constitutional rights\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment . . . . To the extent that a\n\ncitizen’s right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen\n\n. . . . the basic principle of representative government remains,\n\nand must remain, unchanged--the weight of a citizen’s vote cannot\n\nbe made to depend on where he lives”); Gaffney, 93 S.Ct. at 2328\n\n(noting that among the variations that made absolute fidelity to\n\npopulation equality impossible was the gap between total population\n\nand potential voters, and stating that “if it is the weight of a\n\nperson’s vote that matters, total population...may not accurately\n\nreflect that body of voters”).\n\n     But    as    Judge       Kozinski    admits,        and    as    the    Daly     court\n\nhighlights,      other    language       can   be    found       that    implies       that\n\nrepresentational equality is the ideal. See, e.g., Mahan, 93 S.Ct.\n\nat 983 (“the basic constitutional principle [is] equality of\n\npopulation among the districts”).               While it does appear that the\n\nnumerical    weight      of    references      is   on    the    side       of    electoral\n\nequality, it is difficult to attach controlling significance to\n\nthis fact, since in almost all cases the Court was dealing with\n\nsituations       in   which     total    population        was       presumptively       an\n\n\n                                          57\n\facceptable proxy for potentially eligible voters.                           Under such\n\ncircumstances,        we   would    expect      to     find        the   terms     used\n\ninterchangeably,       with    perhaps   a    slight    bias       toward    the   more\n\nhistorically resonant phrase--unquestionably, one-person, one-vote.\n\nSupport for this interpretation is provided by the fact that some\n\nof   the   language    Judge    Kozinski      relies   on     is    contradicted     by\n\nstatements within the same opinion. See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1385\n\n(“We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal\n\nProtection Clause requires that the seats . . . must be apportioned\n\non a population basis”); Westberry v. Sanders, 84 S.Ct. 526, 530\n\n(1964) (“To say that a vote is worth more in one district than in\n\nanother would . . . run counter to our fundamental ideas of\n\ndemocratic government”); id. at 535 (“our Constitution’s plain\n\nobjective of making equal representation for equal numbers of\n\npeople the fundamental goal for the House of Representatives”).\n\nWhile fully recognizing the force of Judge Kozinski’s argument, we\n\nthink that the cases he cites are not decisive, given the strong\n\npossibility that much of the language he relies on may be traceable\n\nto the use of terms interchangeably in a context where their\n\nmeaning does not diverge.\n\n      Instead, we turn to Burns, where the Court directly confronted\n\nan actual differential between the concepts.                       We read Burns as\n\ncompelling rejection of the Garza majority view that the Equal\n\nProtection Clause mandates inclusion of aliens in the population\n\n\n                                         58\n\fbase of electoral districts against which the equality requirements\n\nof Reynolds are applied.   Burns states:\n\n     “Neither in Reynolds v. Sims nor in any other decision\n     has this court suggested that the States are required to\n     include aliens, transients, short-term or temporary\n     residents, or persons denied the vote for conviction of\n     crime in the apportionment base by which their\n     legislators are distributed and against which compliance\n     with the Equal Protection Clause is to be measured. The\n     decision to include or exclude any such group involves\n     choices about the nature of representation with which we\n     have been shown no constitutionally founded reason to\n     interfere.   Unless a choice is one the constitution\n     forbids, [citation] the resulting apportionment base\n     offends no constitutional bar, and compliance with the\n     rule established in Reynolds v. Sims is to be measured\n     thereby.\n\n     . . . .\n\n          Hawaii’s special population problems might well have\n     led it to conclude that state citizen population rather\n     than total population should be the basis for\n     comparison.” Id. at 1296-97 (footnote omitted).\n\nFor this reason, we believe the district court erred to the extent\n\nit relied on the Garza majority dicta.17 Judge Kozinski argues that\n\n\n17\n     Our conclusion in this regard is also strengthened by the fact\nthat, as observed in note 16, supra, the constitution does not\npreclude states from denying the franchise to aliens while it\nexplicitly protects “citizens” from such denial on diverse\nspecified grounds. Moreover, the Equal Protection Clause has been\nconstrued to in most cases preclude the denial of the franchise to\ncitizens by means of property ownership or similar qualifications\nfor voting. See, e.g., Kramer v. Union Free School District, 89\nS.Ct. 1886, 1889 (1969) (“close scrutiny . . . is applicable to\nstatutes denying the franchise to citizens who are otherwise\nqualified by residence and age;” second emphasis added , footnote\nomitted).   In these circumstances, it is, at the very least,\ncounter-intuitive to say that the Equal Protection Clause mandates\nthat the right of citizens to vote be diluted to the extent\nnecessary to prevent dilution of a representational right,\nunmentioned in the Constitution, of aliens who have no right to\n\n                                59\n\fBurns should be determinative for electoral equality, since there\n\nthe Court allowed a plan that used an even more nuanced measure of\n\nvoting strength--registered voters.             But we are reluctant to read\n\nBurns’ allowance of such a measure into a command in the face of\n\nwhat appears to us to be a clear statement to the contrary in the\n\nsame    opinion--that     the    choice     between     measurements     “involves\n\nchoices about the nature of representation with which we have been\n\nshown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere”.                     Burns at\n\n1297.\n\n       We also note that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment, on\n\nwhich Reynolds     itself       rests,    do   appear   to   have    debated       this\n\nquestion, and rejected a proposal rooted in--among other things--\n\nthe    principle   of    electoral       equality.      On   December    5,    1865,\n\nRepresentative Stevens introduced a constitutional amendment which\n\napportioned    congressional           representation        among    the     states\n\n“according to their respective legal voters; and for this purpose\n\nnone shall be named as legal voters who are not either natural-born\n\ncitizens or naturalized foreigners.”             See Joseph T. 60 Sneed III,\n\nFootprints    on   the   Rocks    of     The   Mountain:     An   Account     of   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment at 35 (1997) (Footprints).                   Debates over the\n\nprecise basis for apportionment of Congress among the states proved\n\na contentious issue throughout the process that led to the creation\n\nof section 2 of the Amendment.              The overriding question driving\n\n\nvote.\n\n                                          60\n\fthis debate was the issue of how to deal with the denial of the\n\nfranchise to African-Americans.        However, as the inclusion of a\n\ncitizenship provision indicates, an undercurrent of this debate was\n\nthe recognition by many representatives that aliens were unevenly\n\ndistributed throughout the country.       In addition, several western\n\nstates contained an overabundance of males, which, as women were\n\ngenerally not eligible to vote, would disadvantage them relative to\n\nsettled eastern areas in which the genders were balanced if total\n\npopulation rather than eligible voters were used.         Some of the\n\ndebate over whether to base apportionment on potential voters,\n\ncitizens, or population can be tied to this issue.18\n\n     To be sure, the overall context in which the amendment was\n\ndrafted prevents any firm conclusion being drawn as to the framer’s\n\nintent regarding the question before us.     However, we find it is of\n\nsome significance that the proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nhad a meaningful debate on the question, which cannot be said to\n\n\n\n\n18\n     See Footprints at 103-104 (noting proposals to use citizenship\nas a benchmark faced opposition from northern states with large\nalien populations that might imperil passage); 145 (relating speech\nof Senator Hendricks on February 16, 1866, in which he claimed\nopposition of New England to proposal to use eligible voters rather\nthan total population was grounded in part in the relative\npreponderance of women in those states); 415 (reviewing debate on\nproposed language of section 2 basing representation on\ncitizenship, in which representative from New England argued its\nomission of 2.1 million unnaturalized foreigners would unjustly\nweaken the North, while proponent argued that a citizen of\nMassachusetts should not “be entitled to vote on behalf of\nunnaturalized foreigners who happened to live in Massachusetts”).\n\n                                  61\n\fhave been definitively resolved.19      While the final version of\n\nsection 2 provided generally for the use of total population\n\nfigures   for   purposes   of   allocating   the   federal   House   of\n\nRepresentatives among the states, it also included a mechanism to\n\ninsure that egregious departures from the principle of electoral\n\nequality--the disenfranchisement of adult male “citizens”--would be\n\npenalized.   Bearing in mind that analogies drawn from the federal\n\nsystem are not always applicable to the states, see Reynolds, 84\n\nS.Ct. at 1386-89, we have some difficulty in reading the Equal\n\nProtection Clause to require the adoption of a particular theory of\n\npolitical equality.20\n\n\n19\n     The evidence suggests that proponents of absolute electoral\nequality compromised this principle in order to assure passage of\nthe amendment. See Footprints at 415 (noting that Sherman stated\nthat while he preferred a provision that would be based on male\ncitizens, the time had come to unite around a common proposal and\nhe would yield to the decision of the Republican caucus); Reynolds\nat 1399, 1402 (Harlan J. dissenting).\n\n     It would thus be difficult to read the eventual passage of the\ntotal citizen provision as an endorsement by a majority of the\nCongress of representational equality, even putting aside the\nelectoral equality provisions of the second section of section 2.\n20\n     Under Article I, section 2, of the Constitution, the number of\nrepresentatives which each state would have in the United States\nHouse of Representatives was determined on the basis of “the whole\nnumber of free persons” (“excluding Indians not taxed”) plus “three\nfifths of all other persons” (“but each State shall have at least\none Representative”).    Voting qualifications were whatever was\nspecified by each state for the most numerous branch of its\nlegislature.   With ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment on\nDecember 6, 1865, all were “free persons,” so the former slave\nstates would presumably have increased representation in Congress\ndespite still denying the vote to African-Americans. This problem,\nwhich faced Congress in late 1865 and the first part of 1866, could\n\n                                  62\n\f     While hardly determinative, our review of the history of the\n\namendment cautions against judicial intrusion in this sphere--\n\neither   for   or   against   either    particular   theory   of   political\n\nequality.      Given this, and given the Court’s failure, on our\n\n\n\nbe addressed in different ways. Denial of the right to vote on\ngrounds of race could be expressly proscribed.      That route was\ntaken in the Fifteenth Amendment, but not in the Fourteenth.\nRepresentation in the federal House could be allocated among the\nstates on the basis of the number of potentially eligible voters.\nThat choice, too, was rejected. The solution ultimately adopted in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment was to retain the existing structure of\nArticle 1, section 2–including the right of the states to prescribe\nvoting qualifications and the entitlement of each state to at least\none Representative–while eliminating the “three fifths” clause and\nproviding for a proportional reduction in the federal House\nrepresentational base of any state to the extent “the right to\nvote” (in federal or most state elections) was “denied” (except for\nrebellion or other crime) to adult male “citizens” of the state.\nThe essential focus of the debates was on two matters: allocating\nrepresentation of the states in the United States House of\nRepresentatives, and the right of African-Americans to vote. It\nwas not on any general representational as opposed to electoral\nequality theory of government.       Both Footprints and Justice\nHarlan’s dissent in Reynolds make plain that the intent of the\nframers of the Fourteenth Amendment, as reflected in its\nlegislative history, was to continue to leave electoral and\nrepresentational rights in the control of the states to the same\nextent as they had been before the Civil War except that a state’s\nrepresentation in the federal House of Representatives would be\nsubject to reduction on account of denial by it of “the right to\nvote” of its adult, male “citizens.” While the majestic and open-\nended generality of the Equal Protection Clause must be assumed to\nhave justified Reynolds’ failure to accord controlling significance\nto this legislative history, that majestic generality casts no\nmeaningful light whatever on whether the states were thereby\ncommanded to chose undiluted representational equality over\nundiluted electoral equality, or vice versa, where one or the other\nmust be diluted, or were essentially left as free to make that\nchoice as they had previously been.\n\n     Plaintiffs make no argument that state law or the Houston City\nCharter mandates use of CVA population.\n\n                                       63\n\freading, to speak clearly to such a vital question, we see no\n\njustification to depart from the position of Daly.           We reject the\n\nconclusions of both the dissent in Garza and any reading of the\n\nmajority opinion in that case that would mandate the use of total\n\npopulation figures on equal protection grounds.         We thus conclude\n\nthat the district court correctly determined that the plaintiffs\n\nfailed to create an issue of genuine material fact in respect to\n\nthe City’s adherence to the one-person, one-vote principle.\n\n                              Conclusion\n\n     The record is not such as to sustain a finding that race\n\npredominated in the City’s decision-making.       While the plaintiffs\n\nwere able to point to bits and pieces of the City’s plan that might\n\nhave created a valid Shaw claim, they failed to produce evidence\n\nthat would have surmounted the summary judgment threshold.             The\n\npropriety   under   the   Equal   Protection   Clause   of    using   total\n\npopulation rather than a measure of potential voters also presents\n\na close question.     But in face of the lack of more definitive\n\nguidance from the Supreme Court, we conclude that this eminently\n\npolitical question has been left to the political process.\n\n     For the reasons stated, the judgement of the district court is\n\n\n\n                                                                 AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    64\n\f",

They claim that the City's 1997 redistricting violated the principle of one-person, one-vote, and that the districts created constituted a racial gerrymander impermissible under Shaw v. Reno,  113 S.Ct. 2816 (1993).  The district court granted summary judgment for the City.  We affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City is governed by a fifteen-member City Council, comprised of the Mayor, elected at large, five council members elected at-large, and nine council members selected through single-member districts (Districts A through I).  The City is required to redistrict the single member districts every two years, and does so through ordinances.  In the wake of the 1990 census, the City drafted a new districting plan.  The Department of Justice refused preclearance, and the City responded by drafting an alternative plan that created two districts with weak majorities of Hispanic residents.  This new plan received preclearance.  Although due to a subsequently reversed district court decision the new precleared plan was not used in the 1991 elections, see Campos v. City of Houston, 968 F.2d 446,452 (5th Cir. 1992), the form of that 1991 plan was substantially followed in the 1993 and 1995 redistrictings.  Neither of these plans was challenged on Shaw v. Reno grounds, although the City did face litigation from plaintiffs claiming that the City was required to create additional districts with Hispanic majorities.  See Campos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d 544 (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming Morris v. city of Houston, 894 F. Supp. 1062 (S.D. Tex. 1995) granting summary judgment in favor of the City).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1996, the City of Houston annexed an area to the far northeast of the City known as Kingwood.  Kingwood had a population of around 40,000, and some adjustment in the City's district boundaries for the 1997 scheduled redistricting was thus required to avoid unbalancing the population of the districts.  The City drafted a plan placing Kingwood, and the surrounding area that had previously been a part of District B, into District E.  Like prior City redistrictings, this was conducted in part by using a computer program that contained racial and ethnic data at the level of voting precincts.  After a debate that included the plaintiffs' lawyer in this case, the Council adopted this plan by ordinance on April 9, 1997.  The plan contained a maximum population deviation, when measured by total population, of 8.63%.  Measured by total population,two of its districts had African-American majorities while two others had Hispanic majorities.  It received preclearance from the Justice Department on July 7, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs launched this challenge to the 1997 districts on April 9, 1997--the same day the ordinance was adopted--claiming, among other things, that the districts constituted an impermissible racial gerrymander and violated the principle of one-person, one-vote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On August 15, 1997, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  This motion was denied on October 3, 1997. On March 2, 1998, the City filed five separate motions for summary judgment.  The district court granted all five motions and issued final judgment in favor of the City on May 7, 1998.  Chen v. City of Houston, 9 F.Supp.2d 745 (S.D. Tex. 1998).  This appeal, limited to the one-person, one-vote and racial gerrymander issues, followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the City.  They argue that they produced enough circumstantial and direct evidence of the predominance of race in the City's districting decision to allow a reasonable jury to find in their favor.  They also claim that the district court erred as a matter of law when it measured the City's  compliance with the one-person, one-vote requirement using total population rather than figures that accurately reflected the distribution of potentially eligible voters in the City.  Though the issue is extremely close and difficult, after careful review, we have concluded that the plaintiffs failed to meet their evidentiary burden on the Shaw claim and summary judgment was appropriate.  We also hold that the use of total population to track the size of the districts does not, under these circumstances, violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a motion for summary judgment by applying the same standard as that appropriate for the court below, and in doing so we interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.  Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmovant fails to demonstrate that there is sufficient summary judgment evidence to allow a reasonable fact finder to find in its favor on all essential issues as to which it would bear the burden of proof at trial.  Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 725 (5th Cir. 1995).  However, this review must be understood in the context of the courts' traditional reluctance to interfere with the delicate and politically charged area of legislative redistricting.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394 (1964) (\"legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination\"); Hunt v. Cromartie, 119 S.Ct. 1545, 1552  (1999) (legislature has the benefit of presumption of good faith when it conducts districting).  The Court has clearly indicated that this presumption may impact the assessment of the propriety of summary judgment in a suit challenging districts as racial gerrymanders.  See Miller v. Johnson, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 2488 (1995) (sensitive nature of districting should be considered \"when assessing under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the adequacy of a plaintiff's showing at the various stages of litigation and determining whether to permit discovery or trial to proceed\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this Shaw challenge, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that race was the predominant factor in the City's districting decisions.  See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S.952, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 1951 135L.E.2d 248 (1996).  If the plaintiffs can demonstrate that race predominated so that \"race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines,\" the districts will be subject to strict scrutiny.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2486.  For a majority of the Supreme Court, the mere fact that race was given some consideration in the districting process, and even the fact that minority-majority districts were intentionally created, does not alone suffice in all circumstances to trigger strict scrutiny.  See Shaw v. Hunt, 116 S.Ct. 1894, 1900 (1996) (\"Shaw II\"); Clark v. Calhoun County, 88 F.3d 1393, 1404 n.2 (5th Cir. 1996) (identifying O'Connor, Rehnquist and Bush dissenters as supporting, with Kennedy reserving the question); Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, 185 F.3d 477, 488 (5th Cir. 1999).  And in the eyes of the author of Shaw, the plaintiffs' burden in establishing racial predominance is a heavy one:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To invoke strict scrutiny, a plaintiff must show that the State has relied on race in substantial disregard of customary and traditional districting practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]pplication of the Court's standard helps achieve Shaw's basic objective of making extreme instances of gerrymandering subject to meaningful judicial review.\" Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2497 (O'Connor, concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that summary judgment is disfavored in Shaw cases.  They first argue that the question of the City's intent is inherently a fact-intensive inquiry that is unsuitable for summary judgment, relying on a recent Supreme Court reversal of a grant of summary judgment in a districting case.  See Cromartie.  This ignores, however, the fact that in Cromartie the district court had granted summary judgment for the plaintiff.  The Court took care to stress that summary judgment was inappropriate not only because of the factual nature of the intent requirement, but also because the nonmovant did not bear the burden of proof on the issue. See id. at 1552 (\"Summary judgment in favor of the party with the burden of persuasion, however, is inappropriate when the evidence is susceptible of different interpretations or inferences by the trier of fact.\") (emphasis added).  The Court also relied on the traditional presumption that the legislature acted in good faith while districting.  Id.  Here,neither of these factors are present.  The plaintiffs here bear the burden of persuasion, and the presumption of legislative integrity adds to, rather than lessens, their burden facing summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs next argue that summary judgment is inappropriate because the case is one of mixed motives--while the City has proffered justifications for its actions grounded in traditional districting principles, it has also conceded that race was a factor in its decisions.  The plaintiffs argue that the Court has indicated that a more searching inquiry is needed in such cases, and summary judgment is thus inappropriate.  Bush v. Vera, 116 S.Ct. 1941, 1952 (1996) ( in a mixed motive case a \"careful review is, therefore, necessary to determine whether these districts are subject to strict scrutiny\").  This position misconstrues Bush.  The Bush court made this statement to distinguish mixed motives cases in which the districting body presented credible evidence of alternative justifications from those in which no valid traditional districting purpose was given and racial intent was obvious.  See id. (distinguishing with cf. citation mixed motive case from Miller); Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2485 (noting that district court had found evidence of predominance of race was overwhelming \"and practically stipulated by the parties involved\"). Far from indicating that summary judgment should be disfavored, the discussion the plaintiffs highlight demonstrates the gravity with which the court approaches facially valid defenses proffered by the legislature in thedistricting area.  The City of Houston's presentation of valid evidence of nonracial intent, which transforms the case into one of mixed motives, advances rather than hinders its case for summary judgment.  We will review the district court's grant of summary judgment using the traditional criteria, and take into account both the presumption in favor of a legislature's good faith and a plaintiff's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II.  Circumstantial Evidence of Racial Motivation--The Appearance of the Districts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff may demonstrate that race predominated in a districting decision by introducing circumstantial evidence of the district's shape and demographics.  See Shaw II, 116 S.Ct. at  1900 (1996).  The shape alone of some districts may be so bizarre and irregular that their creation may only be interpreted as \"an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles.\" Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2824; Cromartie, at 1549 n.3 (some highly bizarre districts give rise to inference that race predominated more strongly than the inference that factors such as politics created the distortion).  When shape alone is not determinative, plaintiffs may still prove their circumstantial case by demonstrating that the districts are sufficiently bizarre in relation to racial demographics and population densities.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2489.  The objective case against a district may also be affected by an analysis of whether the district adheres to traditional districting principles other than compactness, such as political considerations and fidelity to administrative boundaries.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a very general sense, Houston's nine single member council districts can be described as being arranged like pieces of a pie, each district radiating out from the center to the edge of town.  The two exceptions are District H, which does not touch the city's external borders due to a thin bridge between two halves of District B, and District E, which does not approach the city center.  Were the City a congressional district carved out of the surrounding suburbs, its own shape would likely provide ample fodder for a Shaw claim.  The City engulfs independent incorporated areas, leaving two holes in its west half.  It also includes  three detached \"islands\" to the north of the City proper--two of them quite large--that are only tenuously connected to the \"mainland\" by narrow and unpopulated corridors.  In addition, it includes several peninsulas jutting out into the countryside, the most outlandish of which extends in a snakelike fashion eastward out of District E between the IH-10 Freeway and the La PorteHighway.  In short, as a glance at the map will readily confirm, the City has vastly irregular borders and does not even remotely approach a mathematical ideal of compactness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But plaintiffs do not challenge the shape of the City of Houston, and the City is not in fact a congressional district.  The City's highly irregular borders are simply a given that the Council was forced to deal with as best it could in crafting the districts challenged here.  Because of the constraint imposed by the City's external borders, Houston's city council districts will never enjoy the pleasing symmetry of, say, Nebraska or Kansas (to say nothing of Colorado or Wyoming).  The City's various peninsulas and protuberances, and in particular its archipelago of detached islands, have to be placed somewhere.  While this might at first glance leave particular districts open to charges of being noncompact, these breaches of that ideal are unavoidable under the circumstances.  Recognizing this, when drafting its guidelines for the redistricting, the city's geographic goal embraced functional as well as purely spacial compactness considerations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rather obvious point seems to have escaped both the plaintiffs and their expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs take care to lift segments of the City's districts and compare them to elements of Shaw, Reno, and Miller, but fail to point out this context. Thus, for example, the plaintiffs argue that the City's districting plan used narrow, unpopulated connectors to link District B with the Houston Airport area, and that District E has a snaking protuberance extending far to the east under the challenged plan. While this is surely correct, and leads to an immediate analogy to the Shaw district, it is absolutely irrelevant.  Were Houston to purge race utterly from its districting process by handing over the task to a computer programmed to maximize purely spacial compactness, these deviations would still be present.  The same error infected the expert opinion relied on by plaintiffs to demonstrate lack of compactness and bizarre shape.  Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Maggiotto, performed the type of mathematical analysis cited with approval in several cases and concluded that the City's districts were not compact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  However, Dr. Maggiotto failed to take into account that substantial deviation from absolute mathematical compactness was inherent in the City's current form.  Accordingly, we reject his conclusion.  Even on a motion for summary judgment, we are not required to take heed of an ill-reasoned expert opinion. See Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. V. Zenith Radio Corp., 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1360 n.19 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This general failure of the plaintiffs does not, however, foreclose their case.  They point to several districts which have borders that deviate from the Euclidean ideal in a manner not entirely traceable to the City's external borders.  In particular, they highlight districts B, H, I, and E.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  District B, which has an African-American majority, consists of one \"island\" around the Houston airport, and two distinct areas on the \"mainland\" that are divided by District H and are connected only by a thin strip of land along H's northern border.  The eastern half of the District B plungesat one point into District I, and also has its pattern broken by the intrusion of an arm of District H.  District H, while possessing a highly compact substantially rectangular core, has two \"arms\" extending to the west and southeast.  The southeast arm curls around the borders of districts B and I in an ungainly fashion and terminates in a small, uneven projection extending a short distance back to the west, into District B. The far more regular western arm of District H extends for a fair distance into District A, and at one point tapers sharply to merely point continuity before expanding again. District I by comparison is far more compact, although its eastern and western sections are separated to a certain extent by District B.  District E consists of a southeastern portion that would be fairly compact but for the City's borders.  However, it also includes the large island in the Lake Houston area to the extreme northeast of the city, with which it shares a connection only by a narrow eight-mile corridor. The nature of this connection cannot be helped, as it is a product of the City borders.  As the plaintiffs stress, however, the Lake Houston island is closer as the crow flies to Districts B and I than to the balance of District E.  In previous plans, the portion of this island then within the City was in fact placed in District B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, these four districts--B, H, I and E--are not perfectly compact.  And since District B is a predominantly African-American district, Districts H and I contain Hispanic majorities, and District E is mainly white or \"Anglo,\" the shape of these districts is not so regular as to preclude the plaintiffs from showing that race predominated in the drawing of a portion of some of the extremities of these districts.  But these districts are not the type of sprawling monstrosities that have previously been found to violate Shaw by the Supreme Court.  Indeed, Bush v. Vera discussed districts that substantially overlapped with the contested districts H, I and B.  A quick review of the map in Bush will demonstrate that the City was far more faithful to the ideal of compactness than the Texas Legislature was in drafting the Bush plan.  In Bush, legislators attempting to create Houston area seats for both Blacks and Hispanics effected this goal by selecting block-sized packets of Hispanic or African-American voters and linking them each into their respective district.  The end result created two of the three least regular districts in the country, comparable to a jigsaw puzzle in which the pieces could not be removed.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1958.  In Bush, in the area at issue here, an already somewhat ungainly tentacle of the African-American district contained uneven veins of loosely interconnected Hispanic blocks that were placed in, and attached tenuously to, the Hispanic district.  Not only does the City's districting of the same area fail to even approach that level of non-compactness, the record indicates that the Council specifically rejected a proposal by one of its members to redraw its districts to mimic the plan rejected in Bush on the grounds of noncompactness.  In addition, we note that the City successfully resisted pressure from private litigants to draft a plan containing four majority-minority districts--something that almost certainly would have created a more bizarre plan.  See Campos, 113 F.3d 544.  Race was clearly not the only factor driving the City's districting, because it avoided these extremes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we certainly do not mean to suggest that the extremes of Bush or Shaw are the minimum threshold for a successful suit, we simply cannot find that the challenged shape of the districts here offers adequate evidence that race predominated in the districting.  This is especially true since some of the specific departures from compactness that the plaintiffs highlight are not as dramatic as they might initially appear. First, the plaintiffs attempt to paint the odd southeastern arm of District H as an attempt to maximize Hispanic numbers in H while avoiding the inclusion of African-Americans.  But this argument ignores the fact that District H's arm borders not only \"Black\" District B, but alsoDistrict I--the other majority Hispanic district in Houston.  Had the City's sole real concern been maintaining the racial purity of these districts, that goal could have facially just as easily been accomplished by placing H's southeastern arm in District I, in exchange for the placement of District I's northwest ern corner in District H.  This configuration would have appeared far more compact and regular, since the arm of H blends naturally into the north of I.  And since the relevant borders of the arm itself would not have altered, the African-American population of B would have been unaltered and the percentage of Hispanics in both H and I would have remained roughly equivalent.  Careful demographic analysis of the populations in these disputed areas might disprove this hypothesis, but the plaintiffs failed to even attempt to provide such data.  The evidence does not tie the particularly unusual feature of H's borders to race to the exclusion of any other real concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the usage of a narrow connector to link the two sections of District B separated by District H is also not as facially objectionable as it first appears.  The plaintiffs argue that District B's odd shape is explained by the City's desire to carve out a Hispanic majority for District H, and continuity in B was accordingly sacrificed, with the narrow connector a mere token concession to the principle.  However, when the area of District B as a whole, including the dead space not included in the City, is taken into account, this picture is far from clear.  Because a large section of District B is a detached island, B is in some respects missing its center.  The geographical heart of the district is located outside the City limits.  The northern island of B and its two mainland halves would constitute a facially unobjectionable compact body if the intervening unincorporated territory were included.  If one takes this into account, and views District B as an attempt to reflect a coherent geographical neighborhood in the north of the City that happens to be broken up by unincorporated dead space, the outline of the district becomes much less offensive.  Rather than being a racial subterfuge, the strip of territory connecting the incorporated halves of B can be  properly seen as marking the central border of a coherent and relatively compact district whose outline is only clouded by the City's irregular borders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the presence of the detached Lake Houston area in District E offers less support for the plaintiff than it otherwise might.  Concededly, the placement of this area leads to the creation of an ungainly district that sprawls from the northern to the southern extremity of the City.  And this northeastern island is closer to District B, so it would seem to do violence to the compactness concept to put it anywhere else.  However, this must be placed in the context of the City's most unusual outline.  When a districting body has the opportunity to create truly compact districts and chooses not to, the harm is obvious.  But when, as here, spacial compactness is simply impossible, further departure from the principle seems less jarring.  Wherever the island was placed, its representative would have to travel several miles outside of the City proper, and voters in that district would have had the odd sensation of being thrown together with an area with which they shared only a technical connection.  Given that the City's design had already decisively severed the island from its neighbor, its placement in a district that was a few miles farther away seems less offensive than it would otherwise.  A judicial analogy may serve to clarify this point.  We would find it odd indeed if Congress decided to place Washington State within the realm of this Circuit when the opportunity to keep it within the Ninth Circuit was present.  But it is far less troublesome that Puerto Rico has been assigned to the First Circuit rather than the Eleventh (or the Fourth).  The placement of Kingwood and its environs is discussed in more detail below, but facially we find that its separation mitigates to alarge extent the effect of its placement in District E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, when viewed properly, the geographic boundaries here do not in and of themselves make out a strong circumstantial case under Shaw.  That does not end our inquiry, however.  As Miller indicated, a district that is not facially outrageous may be objectively revealed as a gerrymander by linking its shape to demographics and other factors.  In Miller, the Court conceded that the district's shape, while hardly perfect, was not sufficient standing alone to lead to the conclusion that it was bizarre in a Shaw sense.  It then turned to a closer analysis of the geography in light of the district's demographics.  It noted that the district's shape became far more troublesome once it was recognized that the core of the district was relatively unpopulated, while the carefully drawn exterior borders reached out to engulf urban African-American population centers.  Viewed in light of this evidence, a shape that initially merely raised eyebrows was revealed to present overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a constitutional violation.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2489 (\"Although by comparison with other districts the geometric shape of the Eleventh District may not seem bizarre on its face, when its shape is considered in conjunction with its racial and population densities, the story of racial gerrymandering seen by the District Court becomes much clearer.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Miller, we are presented with districts in which deviations from the compactness ideal are present but are not overwhelming.  But unlike in Miller, the plaintiffs have failed to present us with specific demographic data that would clarify the racial nature of these distortions.  The plaintiff's expert, Dr. Weber, merely produced demographic data covering the districts as a whole.  He did not give us a demographic analysis of the specific features--the arms of H, the connector section in B, and the northeast island in E--that are at issue in this case.  His report did not show that, for example, the arms of District H contain most of the district's population, and H's compact core is relatively unpopulated.  Nor was there even data demonstrating that the western arm of H is designed to capture a specific pocket of Hispanics in order to maintain Hispanic supremacy in the district. Based on a map of Hispanic population dispersion in the record, it appears this arm includes several areas without, and excludes some areas with, high ratios of Hispanics.  The general, over-broad data Dr. Weber used supports only his conclusion that these districts could be made more heterogenous.  And this is hardly relevant--of course if one solely focused on increasing racial heterogeneity one could improve this factor, just as one could increase homogeneity by adopting the pattern rejected in Bush.  But districters are not bound--or allowed--to sacrifice traditional districting concerns to meeting quotas of diversity, just as they are not allowed to do so in order to meet quotas of racial concentration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the fact that the number of racially homogenous precincts increased in the 1997 plan demonstrates that the City's districting was predominantly linked to race.  Standing alone, however, this fact does nothing to support the plaintiffs' case.  For reasons of their own, populations occasionally shift within urban areas.  If members of one racial group chose to move out of certain areas, the numbers of racially homogenous precincts would increase.  However, this phenomenon would not be tied to the actions of the districting parties-they could keep the borders of the districts static and the same effect would be seen.  Indeed, according to the plaintiffs' version of events this is precisely what occurred--they criticize the 1997 plan for substantially maintaining prior boundaries.  Without tying this evidence to specific choices by the City, and in particular to the discrete noncompact elements of the plan that they challenge, this evidence fails to aid the plaintiffs' case.  Ultimately, the plaintiffsfailed to demonstrate by use of demographics, as was done in Miller, that the specific departures from compactness that it challenges are the product of race rather than other factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, compactness is not the only traditional districting principle.  Other factors, such as the protection of political incumbents, the maintenance of administrative units, and the reflection of communities of interest, play a part in the districting process.  By showing that the design of a district violates these other traditional districting principles, the plaintiffs support their circumstantial case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The districts clearly adhered to at least one traditional districting principle by maintaining the integrity of the relevant administrative unit, voting precincts (although as discussed below plaintiffs argue that these units are themselves tainted). However, the plaintiffs argue that the districts do not serve the traditional districting principle of reflecting communities of interest.  In the more egregious examples of gerrymandering, the violation of this traditional principle will be facially obvious.  Thus the district challenged in Shaw could be safely assumed not to have been driven by communities of interest, since it \"winds in snakelike fashion through tobacco country, financial centers, and manufacturing areas\" in an attempt to gather up \"enclaves of black neighborhoods\"and \"even towns are divided.\"  Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But when presented with closer questions, the Court has focused on the specific features of a district that cause it to depart from compactness in assessing whether they are unjustifiable on traditional grounds. Thus in Bush, where the State attempted to justify its decision-making on the analogous traditional ground of partisan politics--and there was indeed a correlation with politics when the districts were looked at as a whole--the Court found it significant that \"the maps reveal that political considerations were subordinated to racial classification in the drawing of many of the most extreme and bizarre district lines.\"  Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957.  The fact that the State was willing, in the course of extending a noncompact tentacle engulfing a pocket of African-American voters,  to include a large number of Republican voter tabulation districts in a congressional district ostensibly designed to maximize Democratic power was clear evidence of the subordination of politics to race.  Id.  And in Miller, the demographic data was heavily reinforced by an analysis of how specific choices violated communities of interest.  Because the challenged district reached out to include African-American pockets in several entirely separate urban communities, and linked them together with a sparsely populated and wholly rural core, the \"social, political and economic makeup of the Eleventh District tells a tale of disparity, not community.\" Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2484.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs have failed to link the specific departures from compactness that they highlight to the violation of traditional districting principles.  They first claim that several neighborhoods were split in the 1997 plan.  But the City introduced evidence that more neighborhoods were reunited than were split by the plan, and the plaintiffs have not challenged this assertion. Moreover, the plaintiffs failed to show where the allegedly split neighborhoods were.  While it may be unfortunate that a predominantly white neighborhood was split between two white districts, the existence of such a districting faux pas may well have nothing to do with the racial issues that concern us here.  The plaintiffs' evidence of neighborhood splitting is not helpful to their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also tendered the opinion of Dr. Maggiotto, who analyzed various purportedly relevant statistical indicators ofcommunities of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  His report claims that, in the City as a whole, race varies less within the districts than do his chosen indices of community.  This evidence, it is argued, demonstrates that race predominated in the City's districting.  However, the plaintiffs again use too blunt a statistical tool.  Socio-economic variation within districts is almost unavoidable, particularly when, as here, the constituent districting units are fairly large--approaching 200,000 persons.  Not many, if any, rectangles of this size randomly deposited on a map of Houston could be expected to capture an essentially homogenous socio-economic group.  At least when relatively large districts are involved, the mere existence of socio-economic variations within the district is not probative.  To provide valid circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race in the City's districting, then, Dr. Maggiotto had to tie his data to specific districting decisions, or the plaintiffs had to place his data in context by showing that the variations from available normal compactness were likely caused by racial factors.  This they failed to do. They did not show--or even claim--that, for example, the southeastern arm of District H extends outward to reach a pocket of wealthy Hispanics who share nothing other than race with the bulk of the district, the way that the Atlanta extremity of the Miller district shared no commonality with the district's rural core other than race.  Nor did they show that the western arm of H is designed to reach a pocket of Hispanics at the cost of including on the way neighborhoods that share nothing with the rest of that district, the way that Texas reached out to a pocket of African-Americans at the cost of including Republican districts in Bush.  Indeed, the plaintiffs never analyzed or even referred to the socio-economic composition of the specific areas created by the City's departure from geographical compactness, relying instead on broad statistics covering the entire area. See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957 n.* (criticizing dissent for relying on statistics showing political orientation for district as a whole, rather than concentrating on border segments).  Had they done so, perhaps our decision today might have been different.  But bearing in mind that it was the plaintiffs' burden to produce evidence that race predominated, and also remembering the presumption in favor of legislative integrity, we cannot say that the shape and demographics of the districts here provided adequate circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race to prevent summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Direct Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that they have sufficient direct evidence that the City's districting was predominantly driven by race.  They focus on two major points. First, they argue that the major decision made during the 1997 districting-that the newly annexed area of Kingwood should be placed in District E rather than District B--was predominantly influenced by race.  Second, they argue that the 1997 plan substantially maintained the borders of previous plans, and that those borders were set by a process in which race--specifically, the desire to create two black and two Hispanic single member districts--predominated.  The City concedes, as it must, that race--in the form of a desire to comply with the Voting Rights Act--was a factor in all the plans.  But aswe have stated before, a majority of the Supreme Court does not believe that the mere presence of race in the mix of decision making factors , and even the desire to craft majority-minority districts, does not alone automatically trigger strict scrutiny.  See Clark, 88 F.3d at 1404 n.2; Theriot, 185 F.3d at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before touching on plaintiffs' most heavily pressed intent evidence, we briefly dispense with their argument that racial intent can be inferred from the City's use of precinct lines. Plaintiffs assail the district lines because they hew to precinct lines.  Conformity to such administrative boundaries is ordinarily seen as a virtue, not a vice, in the districting process.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1953 (noting maintenance of some county lines showed traditional factors were not entirely ignored).  And plaintiffs have not identified--and there does not appear to be--a larger, more race-neutral, administrative unit that could have been practically deployed.  Cf. Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2490 (noting that plan split several counties, and thus violated traditional districting principles-use of precincts could not mitigate this fact in congressional districting).  But the plaintiffs stress that the City had access to racial data on the precinct level.  They attempt to analogize this situation to Bush, where the State used a computer system that had racial data available on the block level.  The fact that the plan ultimately adopted split precincts and used block units instead was found to offer compelling proof that race has predominated in the districting.  But the key factor in Bush was not the mere availability of racial data.  Rather, it was the abandonment of a traditional districting unit, the precinct.  Since this step violated traditional districting principles and caused substantial administrative problems, and since given the fact the only additional precision the computer provided at the block level was racial, the obvious inference was that race drove the decision.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1959.  Here, in contrast, the City adhered to the traditional--and apparently the only--administrative boundaries readily available. The plaintiffs complain that this is irrelevant, since the size of the precincts was deliberately shrunk to allow more precise racial gerrymandering.  However, the City of Houston does not set precinct size, and the plaintiffs have not tied the changes in precinct sizes to any actions of the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Kingwood</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major change made by the City in 1997 was driven by the City's decision to annex Kingwood, an overwhelmingly white (Anglo) planned community with a population of around 40,000 people that is attached to the detached Lake Houston area.  The decision to annex Kingwood is itself not before this Court.  Rather, the plaintiffs complain that Kingwood--and with it the rest of the northeastern island around Lake Houston-- was placed in District E.  Previously, this island had been attached to District B.  They claim that they have direct evidence that race predominated in this decision--specifically, that the City's overwhelming motivation in doing so was avoidance of potential section 5 retrogression liability. Because  Kingwood has a large population, and because District B was close to the one-person, one-vote  population limit, placing Kingwood in B would have forced the City to move areas on the borders of B into the surrounding districts.  And because the only district adjacent to B with a white (Anglo) majority--A--was already relatively overpopulated, moving areas from B to A would have in turn created more spillover effects, resulting in the disruptive necessity of redrawing several districts.  Placement of spillover from B into Districts H or I would initially seem more attractive, since those districts were underpopulated.  However, the addition of African-American voters displaced from B would seemingly have eliminated the Hispanic majorities in either or both of these districts.  The City believed that this might have triggered retrogression concerns under section 5 of the Voting RightsAct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Placement in District E, by comparison, allowed for the smooth integration of Kingwood.  Spillover and one-person, one-vote concerns were minimized, with only relatively minor border changes made necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence clearly indicates that the City's decision to place Kingwood in District E was partially driven by the fear of retrogression.  Its section 5 filings and the statements of both the drafter of the plan and the council members involved establishes this, and the City does not contest it.  Indeed, it argues that this concern would allow it to survive strict scrutiny review.  And to a certain extent--as discussed above, the issue is not as pressing when a detached island is concerned--compactness was sacrificed in the placement of Kingwood.  Kingwood is closer to District B than it is to District E.  However, a review of the record indicates that the Council had before it at the time it made its decision to place Kingwood in District E two other  legitimate grounds for justifying its decision.  First, the City wanted to preserve communities of interest.  Second, it wanted to minimize disruption in the run-up to the expected major redrawing of districts following the 2000 census.  On this record, we cannot say that there has been an adequate showing that race predominated over these concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most powerful alternative justification for the City's actions is the nature of Kingwood and it greater community of interest overlap with portions of District E.  The Court has noted that concern about communities of interest is a valid traditional districting tool that may serve to deflect an inference that race predominated in districting.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1954 (evidence that \"district lines were drawn in part on the basis of evidence (other than racial data) of where communities of interest existed might weaken a plaintiff's claim that race predominated in the drawing of district lines.\").  Here, transcripts of the series of council debates that led to the final vote on the districting plan demonstrate that members of the Council discussed and evaluated data that indicated that Kingwood's communities of interest overlapped with District E, but were wildly at variance with District B.  The fact that this material was available to the Council at the time they were deliberating on it serves to distinguish this case from others in which alternative justifications have been raised after the fact and only hypothetically motivated the districting body.  See Shaw II, 116 S.Ct. at 1902 n.4 (purported justification must be actual purpose in adopting plan and supported in the evidence); Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1955 (disregarding community of interest justification because data was not before the legislature in an organized fashion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Council debates, members of the Council referred to both anecdotal and statistical evidence demonstrating that the  average income and quality of housing in Kingwood were much higher that those found in District B, while the percentage of persons on public relief and the occurrence of illiteracy was much smaller. Moreover, the members of the Council did not limit themselves to general discussions of socioeconomic indicators.  They pointed to specific factors that demonstrated that District B's community concerns varied from those in Kingwood.  Because Kingwood is a planned community, it has excellent infrastructure.  In comparison, the infrastructure in District B was referred to as among the worst in the City.  This wouldraise the concern that the residents of Kingwood's desire and need for municipal improvements would diverge from those of other residents of District B.  It was also stated that Kingwood had privatized several municipal services, and paid for services using regressive user fees rather than more  progressive property taxation.  This difference would obviously lead to a divergence between the two areas' approaches to services and taxation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In comparison, District E was said to be far more congruent with Kingwood than District B.  Its infrastructure and average income were much closer to Kingwood's.   It also contained planned communities that shared Kingwood's special concerns regarding services and taxation.  In light of the greater similarity between the two areas, in the eyes of the members voting for the plan it made sense to place Kingwood in District E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, opponents of the plan--and two Council members, as well as the plaintiffs' lawyer in this case, spoke out in some depth against it before the vote--never challenged these assumptions.  At no point were the Council members' characterization of Kingwood's socio-economic status, infrastructure, and services called into question in any way.  The closest an opponent of the plan came to undermining the majority's community of interest assumptions was a discourse by one of the members who voted against the plan.  He argued that communities of interest were inherently linked to geography, and thus could not bind Kingwood to District E.  In its strong form, this statement would make communities of interest a mere subset of geographic compactness.  In its weak form, it is generally correct and a useful observation to guard against abuses of the community of interest rationale.  Here, however, this reasoning is inapplicable. Since Kingwood was separated from the main body of both Districts B and E, it was never likely to share a sense of geographic neighborliness with either district.  The question was not one of placing Kingwood in either District E or an adjacent community linked in the eyes of the populace with Kingwood.  Instead, the issue was which of two geographically isolated areas Kingwood and its surrounds should be shoehorned into--a district in which it had nothing in common or one with which it shared at least some points of community concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor have the plaintiffs pointed on their appeal to any evidence that undermines the community of interest justification.  As noted above, their arguments and evidence regarding communities of interest are fatally flawed by the broad level of generality they adopt.  Here, this weakness is especially glaring.  Plaintiffs have not presented data about Kingwood at all, let alone introduced evidence that undermines the arguments made by proponents of the plan at the time.  Since Dr. Maggiotto did not separate out Kingwood, his data cannot be used to undermine the City's justification here--there is no evidence that factors such as occupations or educational level create a significant point of commonality between Kingwood and District B that mitigates the divide created by raw income and other factors.  Indeed, Dr. Maggiotto's evidence largely confirms the City's analysis.  It shows that District B was the second poorest district in the City, while District E was the second richest, and contains the lowest variation of income.  At most, plaintiffs have shown that all of District E is not exactly congruent with Kingwood.  They have not shown, and have never claimed, that Kingwood was more similar in regard to the factors discussed to District B than it was to District E.  And they never attempted to introduce, by expert opinion or otherwise, evidence tending to show that this lack of similarity was overcome by the presence of commonalities in nonquantifiable indicia ofcommunities of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In short, this is not a case where a decision is justified by a \"mere recitation of purported communities of interest\" unproven by facts in the record.  Cf. Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2490.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further support for the City's position is provided by the special nature of the decision of where to place Kingwood.  Not only was the council presented with the awkward task of placing a disconnected, newly-acquired parcel of land into a settled districting scheme, it also did so against the looming background of the upcoming census.  As a result of the 2000 census, the City will in the near future receive significantly better data about its population.  A report prepared for the Council by a local university professor, Dr. Alford, indicated that the City would be required to engage in a major overhaul of its districts in light of this data, and that a similar effort in 1997 based on soon-to-be obsolete census figures would be inefficient.  The City evidently has followed a practice of confining major changes to the districting that follows the census.  See Campos v. City of Houston, 968 F.2d 446, 449 (5th Cir. 1992) (discussing replacement of old plan \"used during the 1980s\" in wake of 1990 census).  Inlight of this, it is hardly surprising that the City would be reluctant to place Kingwood in an area which would require major alterations of the district plan.  Several Council members spoke to this effect.  By placing Kingwood in District E, the City minimized the spillover effect mandated by one-person, one-vote concerns, and the corresponding mass redrawing of districts that would ensue.  Under the special--if not wholly unique--situation created here by a major annexation located so soon before the next census, this would seem a valid concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attempt to undermine this evidence by arguing, in essence, that the Council's debates were mere smoke and mirrors concocted in anticipation of precisely this lawsuit.  Certainly, the debates evidence an intense awareness of the possibility that the districting would be subject to a Shaw suit.  The first day of the debate began with legal counsel explaining the nuances of Miller and Bush in great detail to the Council.  However, this record does not support a conclusion that the whole debate was essentially scripted.  The voluminous testimony exhibits meaningful disputation, and several proponents of the plan used language and took positions that are not consistent at all with the hypothesis that the supporters of the plan were carefully coached.  Given the presumption in favor of legislative good faith granted in this area, we cannot say on this record that the mere fact that the Council was aware of the meaningful possibility of this litigation suffices to create a fact issue as to their statements being mere pretexts for concealed racial motivation.  We cannot say that a fact issue has been created regarding the predominance of race in the placement of Kingwood.  The decision was independently justified by several factors besides race at the time it was adopted, and the force of the traditional concern that was sacrificed--compactness--was diminishedby the context of placement of a detached island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Continuation of a racially motivated districting structure</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also contend that the City violated Shaw by failing to make substantial changes in a districting structure that was originally designed in a manner that race predominated over traditional districting concerns.  The sins of past Councils, and the Department of Justice (DOJ), thus are claimed to haunt the current Council's asserted ratification of their work.  The district court summarily rejected this argument, reasoning that the constitutionality of the prior plans had never been challenged, and the intent behind their creation was thus not properly before the court.  This would appear to have been overly hasty.  In the context of Voting Rights Act suits, evidence that impermissible racial intent had tainted the plan upon which the challenged plan was based has been allowed, even when enough time has elapsed for a substantial degree of familiarity and political reliance to emerge.  See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 768-69 (9th Cir. 1990), cert denied 111 S.Ct. 681 (1991).  The mere passage of time cannot extinguish entirely the taint of racial discrimination.  See Hunter v. Underwood, 105 S.Ct. 1916 (1985) (discriminatory intent behind 1901 disenfranchisement provision coupled with continued discriminatory impact relied on to invalidate statute).  And in a context like the one before us, where the City redistricts relatively frequently, adoption of the City's position would seem problematic because it would give potential challengers an incentive to launch more frequent lawsuits.  If the potential plaintiffs did not sue, they might find that the passage of other plans had sanitized the intent embodied in the prior plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that while race clearly played an important role in the earlier districting efforts, the quality of evidence introduced by the plaintiffs in regard to the earlier efforts (as well as respecting the 1997 ordinance) falls far short of that introduced in the cases examined by the Supreme Court.  As discussed above, the objective, circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race is far weaker than in those cases.  As for direct evidence, in the Shaw cases not only was the end product of DOJ intervention a monstrosity that massively violated traditional districting principles, but the State also openly stated in its section 5 filings that race was its dominant concern rather than just a factor.  See Shaw II, 116 S.Ct. 1901 (preclearance submission announced creation of minority districts was State's \"overriding purpose\").  A similar direct admission of intent was present in Bush.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957 (testimony of state officials in related litigation claimed that race was the primary consideration in districting).  And in Miller, where--as here--the district's shape was not itself extremely bizarre, the evidence that race trumped other concerns was conclusive.  There, the DOJ rejected proposed plans not once, but twice, and ultimately made it clear to the State that it would only accept a result that mirrored a plan proposed by a third party, the ACLU.  Ultimately a plan designed around this framework was adopted, as legislators who voted in its favor testified,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> simply because the State felt it had no other choice.  Obviously, the ACLU lawyer who drew up the outlines of the plan challenged in Miller could have no firm understanding of, or respect for, the subtleties of traditional districting.  See Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1933(State \"adopted the Justice Department's entirely race-focused approach to redistricting\"); Johnson v. Miller, 864 F.Supp. 1354, 1368 (S.D. Ga. 1994) (lower court discusses role of ACLU drafter).  The inference was thus automatic that race had not only predominated over, but had indeed almost entirely extinguished, traditional districting concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contrast, the only evidence that the plaintiffs produced is the raw history of DOJ intervention, which contains no brazen admission that race predominated and no details regarding a pattern of DOJ pressure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Plaintiffs relied on the fact that in 1991 the City's original plan was denied preclearance, and that while the plan the City drafted in response creating additional concentrations of minorities was never implemented, it formed the template for the 1993, 1995, and 1997 districtings.  Based solely on these facts and the section 5 filings that accompanied the plans (and demographic evidence that, as we discussed above, is insufficient to sustain plaintiffs' case), the plaintiffs' expert Dr. Weber opined that race had predominated in all of the City's districting since 1991. Certainly, this material establishes that race was a factor in prior districtings, and that the form of those districts was largely reenacted in 1997.  It also establishes an intention on the part of the City to establish minority-majority districts. And, a glance at the district maps verifies that the City's original plan was more compact than the ones subsequently adopted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the City has always conceded these points, and as we discussed above the sacrifice in compactness was not extreme.  And this Court has interpreted the Supreme Court's current position to include a majority in favor of Justice O'Connor's statement in Bush that the intentional creation of minority-majority districts will not in and of itself trigger strict scrutiny.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1951; Clark, 88 F.3d at 1404 n.2; Theriot, 185 F.3d at 488.  The plaintiffs' burden was thus to show that race predominated over traditional districting concerns, not merely that the City attempted to craft minority-majority districts and that there was  some but not massive reduction of one such factor--compactness.  Here, all that has been demonstrated is that the DOJ aggressively forced a consciousness of race and the Voting Rights Act upon the City.  The City then abandoned its initial plan--one presumably grounded firmly in traditional districting principles-and ultimately adopted a system that met the DOJ's requirements.  Were districting an exact science, in which the application of traditional districting principles always produced one objectively optimal solution, this would perhaps settle the question--abandonment of the optimal traditional plan would demonstrate subordination.  But districting is hardly a science.  It would seem obvious to us that there is more than one way to draw a district so that it can reasonably be described as meaningfully adhering to traditional principles, even if not to the same extent or degree as some other hypothetical district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, in the wake of the DOJ's intervention, the City had returned to the problem and properly considered race as a factor alongside traditional districting principles, and the result they reached had satisfied the DOJ without substantially abandoning those principles, race would not automatically have predominated.  For example, the City could have returned to the drawing board and generated a plan that increased the recognition of communities of interest and satisfied the DOJ's racial concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The fact that compactness wassomewhat lessened in the process would not establish that strict scrutiny was required, because race might not have predominated over communities of interest.  Thus abandonment of an original plan by itself does not demonstrate that race predominated--the adopted plan may have also been the product of and substantially consistent with traditional districting principles.  The plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence that this did not in fact occur.  As discussed above, the plaintiffs failed to show specific areas in which communities of interest were subordinated to race, and they never claimed that the original plan was a more adequate reflection of that traditional districting principle than those that followed.  The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, conceded that he did not take into account the City's desire to reflect communities of interest, since he believes that the criteria used to measure this concept are themselves closely correlated with race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the rabid extremes of the DOJ conduct in Miller should hardly stand as a minimum litmus test in such matters, it would seem to us that a plaintiff is required to do more than merely demonstrate that the DOJ had somewhat effective input in the process to trigger strict scrutiny. \"It is not Justice Department interference per se that is the concern, but rather the fact that Justice Department pressure led the State to act based on an overriding concern with race.\"  Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1934.  And that is all the plaintiffs have really done here.  The DOJ will almost always have this kind of input into the districting decisions of jurisdictions covered under section 5. At least in those jurisdictions, then, accepting the plaintiffs' minimal showing here would render Justice O'Connor's allowance for the creation of minority-majority districts of merely academic interest.  In the process, such a  rule would in practice narrow what is already a difficult passage through the Scylla of the Voting Rights Act and the Charybdis of Shaw nearly to the vanishing point--virtually every decision the jurisdiction made would run aground on the rocks of litigation.  Here, for example, the City would have surely run into trouble had it disregarded the DOJ's suggestion regarding the creation of more minority concentrations.  But by the mere fact of heeding these objections, plaintiffs claim, the City automatically exposed itself to a lawsuit triable under strict scrutiny.  DOJ's overreaching will occasionally inflict this dilemma in any event--to exacerbate the problem by making it an ironclad rule would seem inadvisable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the fact that the plaintiffs bore the burden of proof on this issue, and the presumption in favor of the Council's good faith, the plaintiffs needed to undercut the hypothesis that the City's plans were independently substantially justified by traditional districting factors.  They failed to do so.  An obvious mechanism would be to use circumstantial evidence based on the districts' shape and demographics to shore up the direct evidence of intent. But as discussed above, the plaintiffs' circumstantial evidence is inadequate to allow a finding that race predominated.  Nor did the plaintiffs point to adequate direct evidence that the compliance with the DOJ's desires was the predominate, driving force behindthe plan, rather than merely one factor, along with traditional ones, in the overall equation.  Cf., e.g., Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1934 (discussing direct evidence from drafter of plan that preceded the one challenged in Miller that he viewed draft including two majority-minority districts, that it was viewed as ridiculous and not making sense, and going on to note testimony of legislators that indicated that all other considerations yielded to DOJ desire to maximize minority districts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And in any case, while the district court erred in categorically and totally dismissing evidence of intent garnered from prior plans, it was correct to point out that the state of mind involved in the prior plans is not of itself what is precisely and directly the ultimate issue before the Court in this case.  We have noted in a different context that while under Hunter the discriminatory intent of the original drafter may carry forward despite subsequent judicial invalidation of the most obviously discriminatory provisions, intervening reenactment with meaningful alterations may render the current law valid.  See Cotton v. Fordice, 157 F.3d 388, 391 (5th Cir. 1988) (while disenfranchisement constitutional provision originated in attempt to discriminate, subsequent reenactment with alterations approved by voters added categories of crimes originally excluded because they were not considered \"Black\" crimes and subtracted a less serious offense that had been considered a \"Black\" crime).  We do not suggest that the changes implemented in 1993, 1995, and 1997 to the original framework were as dramatic as those in Cotton.  However, that case broadly stands for the important point that when a plan is reenacted--as opposed to merely remaining on the books like the provision in Hunter--the state of mind of the reenacting body must also be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the passage of time lent an additional element to the Council's intent.  Maintenance of established district lines is itself a traditional districting principle, and the City included it in its guidelines for the 1997 revision.  And the adopted plan minimized the changes in district boundaries.  Standing alone, that would not matter much here--the mere passage of six years cannot have hallowed the current districts with much familiarity or tradition.  But in the context of the approaching census, this principle would seem to have some validity.  As discussed above, the City had before it when it voted on the plan information indicating that a radical revision of its boundaries (for its soon to follow elections) will be necessary in light of the 2000 census.  What the district court characterized as a \"scorched-earth\" redrawing of the districts--what Dr. Weber's views would have logically required to purge all taint of DOJ interference-would have little to recommend it under the circumstances.  Such ground-up revisions are difficult to implement, and as one Council member argued, can be \"wholly disruptive toward the political and neighborhood relationships we have established in the city.\"  This fact hardly justifies the \"freezing\" of district lines in the manner the district court seemed to endorse.  However, it does caution against wholesale alteration based on out-of-date census figures when the process will in any case have to be done in the immediate future.  In the context of close proximity to the census (with new elections soon to follow), we think that residual doubt as to the appropriateness of summary judgment is extinguished by the fact that the City had valid reasons to adhere to its prior borders distinct from the grounds which led to their adoption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, although the issue on appeal is extremely close, we ultimately conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the plaintiffs' Shaw claim.  On this record, we cannot say that plaintiffs have carried their burden and made a sufficient showing, either circumstantially or directly, to sustain a finding that race predominated in the districting.  We stress that our decision here rests largely on the evidentiary shortcomings in the plaintiffs' case.  We would also add that in our analysis of thedirect intent evidence we relied on the rapid approach of the census, and the City's expectation that a major overhaul of districts (and soon to follow elections) will occur at that time.  Our opinion here cannot be read as a conclusive endorsement of these districts' constitutional status, since on better showing by the plaintiffs the result might well have been different.  Nor can it be viewed as an open invitation to the City to maintain the current boundaries and overall structure in the redistricting that follows the 2000 census.  See Campos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d 544, 548 (5th Cir. 1997) (clarifying proper standard of measurement under section 2); id. at 545 (discussing pattern of election results); United States v. City of Houston, 800 F.Supp. 504, 508 (S.D. Tex. 1992) (Jones, J.) (discussing election results and question of safe versus marginal districts in the retrogression context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. One Person, One Vote</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also contend that the votes of residents of several districts were devalued by the City's deliberate undersizing of minority voting districts.  The heart of this one-person, one-vote claim is that the City, despite being aware that it contained pockets with extremely high ratios of noncitizens, improperly crafted its districts to equalize total population rather than citizen voting age population (CVAP).  The plaintiffs argue that when total population is obviously an imperfect proxy for potential voters, the City is constitutionally required to use a more accurate measurement of voters.  And using CVAP figures, it is clear that several Houston districts fall outside the ten percent threshold established as a safe-harbor for population variance in municipal election districts.  The district court rejected this claim, and for slightly different reasons we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Equal Protection Clause requires  that representatives to an elected body be drawn from voting districts of substantially equal population.  Reynolds v. Sims, 84 S.Ct. 1362 (1964).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  This guarantee extends to local elections.  See Avery v. Midland County, 88 S.Ct. 1114 (1968).  However, because state and local elections are not subject to the explicit commands of the Constitution regarding federal elections, they are not held to a standard of absolute population equity.  See Brown v. Thompson, 103 S.Ct. 2690, 2695-96 (1983) (state must make only a good faith effort to ensure population equity and may balance population against other legitimate concerns).  If the maximum variation between districts exceeds a certain threshold, the state will be required to justify the variance by invoking such concerns.  Mahan v. Howell, 93 S.Ct. 987 (1973) (16.4% variation justified by constraints of political subdivision lines).  However, below a certain threshold the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case and the districting body will not be required to justify minor variations. See Gaffney v. Cummings, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 2330 (1973).  The Court has indicated that this threshold is ten percent.  See, e.g., Connor v. Finch, 97 S.Ct. 1828, 1833 (1977) (setting threshold at ten percent).  Here, the maximum variation between the City's districts was found by the district court to be 8.63% when measured by total population, and the plaintiffs have never claimed that using this population base the variation exceeds 10%.  The plaintiffs wouldthus appear to have failed to make out a prima facie case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue, however, that the City's districts do shatter the ten percent threshold once the proper measurement of voters in utilized.  They argue that they have thus made out a prima facie case of vote dilution.  Plaintiffs contend that data available to the City indicated that areas with concentrated Hispanic populations had an extremely high number of noncitizens. They argue that given this well-known fact, the City should have recognized that total population would not serve as a meaningful proxy for potentially eligible voters--areas with concentrations of Hispanics would have a far larger population than potentially eligible voters.  By nevertheless continuing to use total population, the City devalued the votes of residents in districts that did not contain concentrations of Hispanic voters.  They argue that when measured against the proper standard, the City's districts displayed a maximum variance well in excess of the allowable ten percent.  We have had cause before to note the high number of Hispanic residents of Houston who are not citizens.  See Campos v. City of Houston, 113 F.3d 544, 547 (5th Cir. 1997) (census figures indicate 45.8% of adult Hispanics in City are noncitizens).  And the plaintiffs have produced data that appears to clearly show that when the CVAP of Houston districts is compared, the maximum variance indeed exceeds the ten percent threshold.  If the City were required by the Equal Protection Clause to use CVAP rather than total population in crafting its districts, then, summary judgment for the city would have been inappropriate.  However, while this is a close question, we find that the choice of population figures is a choice left to the political process.  Houston did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument is straightforward.  A Reynolds claim is, after all, a \"-one person, one vote'\" claim.  See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1380 (quoting Gray v. Sanders, 83 S.Ct. 801, 809 (1963)).  Since the inquiry focuses on the dilution of votes, it would be improper to allow the votes of two adult citizens to be weighed equally with the vote of a single adult citizen merely because the latter happened to live in proximity to a noncitizen ineligible to vote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Plaintiffs concede that undermany, if not most, circumstances this distinction will be irrelevant--generally, the ineligible to vote or to register to do so (whether felons, minors, or noncitizens) can be assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the area to be districted, and the usage of total population is thus an acceptable surrogate for measuring potential voters.  When, however, a districting body knows that large numbers of those ineligible to vote are disproportionately concentrated in certain areas, it can no longer in good faith use total population as a proxy for potential voters.  Instead, it is obligated to deploy a more sophisticated measurement, such as CVAP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuit courts have addressed this issue.  The Ninth Circuit has found that total population is not only a permissible method to measure population when known significant concentrations of those not eligible to vote exist, but has also suggested that its usage may be required under the Equal Protection Clause in some circumstances. See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 775 (9th Cir. 1990), cert denied, 111 S.Ct. 681 (1991) (approving court ordered plan using total population and opining that use of CVAP \"would constitute a denial of equal protection to these Hispanic plaintiffs\").  The Fourth Circuit, confronting the analogous issue of districting when persons below the voting age were unevenly distributed, has stated that the choice between total population or a measurement of potential voters is left to the legislative body.  In doing so, it implicitly rejected the Ninth Circuit's contention that a districting body might be required by the Equal Protection Clause to use total population as a baseline.  See Daly v. Hunt, 93 F.3d 1212, 1227 (4th Cir. 1996) (remanding on other grounds).  However, in a powerful dissent in Garza, Judge Kozinski concluded that, at least when the plan is court ordered, the Constitution requires the use of a measurement that accurately tracks potential voters.  See Garza, 918 F.2d at 785.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has from the beginning of this line of cases been somewhat evasive in regard to which population must be equalized.  See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1390 (state should attempt to apportion \"so that each [districting unit] has an identical number of residents, or citizens, or voters\"). However, it has also indicated with some clarity that the choice has political overtones that caution against judicial intrusion.  See Burns v. Richardson, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1297 (1966) (state not required to use total population figures, since the choice of measurement \"involves choices about the nature of representation with which we havebeen shown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere\").  The debate does indeed involve questions about the nature of representative democracy.  As Judge Kozinski's dissent recognizes,  and the Daly opinion outlines, there is nothing inherent in the concept of representative democracy that requires the embrace of the plaintiffs' position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The choice presented is, in Judge Kozinski's terms, one between electoral equality and representational equality.  While for the most part obscured by the happy coincidence that eligible voters will frequently track the total population evenly--in which case either measurement would produce similar results, and total population will probably be used since it is easier to gather--this is a fundamental and difficult question.  If total population figures are used in an area in which potentially eligible voters are unevenly distributed, the result will necessarily devalue the votes of individuals in the area with a higher percentage of potentially eligible voters.  The large populations in the other district will leverage the votes of the smaller number of eligible voters there.  However, if a more carefully calibrated measurement is embraced in order to serve this principle of individual electoral equality, the area with the smaller number of voters will find itself relatively disadvantaged. Despite the factthat it has a larger population--and thus perhaps a greater need for government services than the other community--it will find that its political power does not adequately reflect its size.  In addition, it could be argued that because the representative chosen from such a district will have a larger number of constituents, the ability of her constituents--whether or not they are potential voters--to petition and voice their opinions will be proportionately reduced.  See Garza, 918 F.2d at 775.  But see Daly, 93 F.3d at 1226-27 &amp; n.12 (expressing doubt regarding validity of equal access argument).  If one accepts the principle of representational equality--that representatives are chosen by a district's voters, but should represent all persons resident therein--these results may be  unacceptable.  The choice between these two models is stark, and because it is rarely encountered, historical and legal guidance is sparse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Kozinski makes a powerful case that the general tenor of the Court's opinions mandates protection of the individual potential voter. Certainly, to take just a few examples contained in Judge Kozinski's comprehensive summary, there is ample language in the opinions that strongly implies that it is the right of the individual potential voter that must be protected.  See, e.g., Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1384 (\"the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the opportunity for equal participation by all voters in the election of state legislators.  Diluting the weight of votes because of place of residence impairs basic constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment . . . . To the extent that a citizen's right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen . . . . the basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged--the weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives\"); Gaffney, 93 S.Ct. at 2328 (noting that among the variations that made absolute fidelity to population equality impossible was the gap between total population and potential voters, and stating that \"if it is the weight of a person's vote that matters, total population...may not accurately reflect that body of voters\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as Judge Kozinski admits, and as the Daly court highlights, other language can be found that implies that representational equality is the ideal.  See, e.g., Mahan, 93 S.Ct. at 983 (\"the basic constitutional principle [is] equality of population among the districts\").  While it does appear that the numerical weight of references is on the side of electoral equality, it is difficult to attach controlling significance to this fact, since in almost all cases the Court was dealing with situations in which total population was presumptively an acceptable proxy for potentially eligible voters.Under such circumstances, we would expect to find the terms used interchangeably, with perhaps a slight bias toward the more historically resonant phrase--unquestionably, one-person, one-vote. Support for this interpretation is provided by the fact that some of the language Judge Kozinski relies on is contradicted by statements within the same opinion.  See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1385 (\"We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats . . . must be apportioned on a population basis\"); Westberry v. Sanders, 84 S.Ct. 526, 530 (1964) (\"To say that a vote is worth more in one district than in another would . . . run counter to our fundamental ideas of democratic government\"); id. at 535 (\"our Constitution's plain objective of making equal representation for equal numbers of people the fundamental goal for the House of Representatives\").  While fully recognizing the force of Judge Kozinski's argument, we think that the cases he cites are not decisive, given the strong possibility that much of the language he relies on may be traceable to the use of terms interchangeably in a context where their meaning does not diverge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we turn to Burns, where the Court directly confronted an actual differential between the concepts.  We read Burns as compelling rejection of the Garza majority view that the Equal Protection Clause mandates inclusion of aliens in the population base of electoral districts against which the equality requirements of Reynolds are applied.  Burns states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Neither in Reynolds v. Sims nor in any other decision has this court suggested that the States are required to include aliens, transients, short-term or temporary residents, or persons denied the vote for conviction of crime in the apportionment base by which their legislators are distributed and against which compliance with the Equal Protection Clause is to be measured.  The decision to include or exclude any such group involves choices about the nature of representation with which we have been shown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere.  Unless a choice is one the constitution forbids, [citation] the resulting apportionment base offends no constitutional bar, and compliance with the rule established in Reynolds v. Sims is to be measured thereby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hawaii's special population problems might well have led it to conclude that state citizen population rather than total population should be the basis for comparison.\"  Id. at 1296-97 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we believe the district court erred to the extent it relied on the Garza majority dicta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Judge Kozinski argues that Burns should be determinative for electoral equality, since there the Court allowed a plan that used an even more nuanced measure of voting strength--registered voters.  But we are reluctant to read Burns' allowance of such a measure into a command in the face of what appears to us to be a clear statement to the contrary in the same opinion--that the choice between measurements \"involveschoices about the nature of representation with which we have been shown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere\".  Burns at 1297.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment, on which Reynolds itself rests, do appear to have debated this question, and rejected a proposal rooted in--among other things--the principle of electoral equality.  On December 5, 1865, Representative Stevens introduced a constitutional amendment which apportioned congressional representation among the states \"according to their respective legal voters; and for this purpose none shall be named as legal voters who are not either natural-born citizens or naturalized foreigners.\"  See Joseph T.  Sneed III, Footprints on the Rocks of The Mountain: An Account of the Fourteenth Amendment at 35 (1997) (Footprints).  Debates over the precise basis for apportionment of Congress among the states proved a contentious issue throughout the process that led to the creation of section 2 of the Amendment.  The overriding question driving this debate was the issue of how to deal with the denial of the franchise to African-Americans.  However, as the inclusion of a citizenship provision indicates, an undercurrent of this debate was the recognition by many representatives that aliens were unevenly distributed throughout the country.  In addition, several western states contained an overabundance of males, which, as women were generally not eligible to vote, would disadvantage them relative to settled eastern areas in which the genders were balanced if total population rather than eligible voters were used.  Some of the debate over whether to base apportionment on potential voters, citizens, or population can be tied to this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the overall context in which the amendment was drafted prevents any firm conclusion being drawn as to the framer's intent regarding the question before us.  However, we find it is of some significance that the proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment had a meaningful debate on the question, which cannot be said to have been definitively resolved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  While the final version of section 2 provided generally for the use of total population figures for purposes of allocating the federal House of Representatives among the states, it also included a mechanism to insure that egregious departures from the principle of electoral equality--the disenfranchisement of adult male \"citizens\"--would be penalized.  Bearing in mind that analogies drawn from the federal system are not always applicable to the states, see Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1386-89, we have some difficulty in reading the Equal Protection Clause to require the adoption of a particular theory of political equality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While hardly determinative, our review of the history of the amendment cautions against judicial intrusion in this sphere--either for or against either particular theory of political equality.  Given this, and given the Court's failure, on our reading, to speak clearly to such a vital question, we see no justification to depart from the position of Daly.  We reject the conclusions of both the dissent in Garza and any reading of the majority opinion in that case that would mandate the use of total population figures on equal protection grounds.  We thus conclude that the district court correctly determined that the plaintiffs failed to create an issue of genuine material fact in respect to the City's adherence to the one-person, one-vote principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is not such as to sustain a finding that race predominated in the City's decision-making.  While the plaintiffs were able to point to bits and pieces of the City's plan that might have created a valid Shaw claim, they failed to produce evidence that would have surmounted the summary judgment threshold.  The propriety under the Equal Protection Clause of using total population rather than a measure of potential voters also presents a close question.  But in face of the lack of more definitive guidance from the Supreme Court, we conclude that this eminently political question has been left to the political process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the judgement of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also contended that the plan violated constitutional requirements regarding ballot secrecy, the right to petition for redress of grievances, the right to freely assemble, and the right of political association.

See DeWitt v. Wilson, 856 F.Supp. 1409 (E.D. Cal. 1994), summarily aff'd, 115 S.Ct. 2637 (1995).  However, as Justice Kennedy had been at pains to highlight, summary affirmance is not an endorsement of a lower court's reasoning, see Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1971 (Kennedy, concurring),  and the concept as described in DeWitt seems to us open to abuse.  However, regardless of its merits when applied to an ordinary districting decision, functional compactness as applied here merely signals acceptance of reality.  Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, the fact that the City chose to use this term does not indicate that they had abandoned traditional districting principles.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The mathematical models generally used attempt to quantify departures from compactness by, for example, drawing a circle around the district's center or connecting the district's borders with an imaginary string.  The district's deviation from this benchmark is then analyzed.  Such techniques may or may not be probative when applied to areas in which external boundaries play a minor role.  However, they certainly would need adjustment before being accepted when applied to a case such a Houston, or for that matter possibly Rhode Island.  If not, the report will reflect massive deviations from compactness caused by factors beyond the legislature's control.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also challenge districts C, D and A.  District D is, on the whole, overwhelmingly compact and regular.  While the district does taper sharply to the north before widening again near its apex, this feature hardly detracts from its overall cohesiveness.  District C has regular borders with District D.  Its irregularities occur in its borders with districts G and F.  Like  C itself, G and F are \"white\" \"Anglo\" districts (G is 79% \"Anglo;\" F is 41.74% \"Anglo,\" 12.49% \"Asian,\" 25.36% \"Hispanic\" and 4.68% \"Black\"); and the plaintiffs have never explained how these irregularities can be understood as a racial gerrymander--they have not shown that the areas affected had any special racial significance.  On this record, all that the distortions in these districts show is that deviations from compactness may occur in racially innocuous contexts.  Once the shape of the City is taken into account, deviations from compactness in District A arise only from the intrusion of an arm of District H, and thus the question of District A merges into the inquiry into District H's shape and demographics.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> City council elections are at least formally nonpartisan.

And a mailroom clerk in a bank will not necessarily enjoy a community of interest with its lending  officers.  An area such as Silicon Valley may be an exception to this, and the category may be highly relevant when analyzing congressional districts to quantify urban and rural areas.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2484, 2490.  But applied to Houston, this seems a remarkably unprobative tool.

Conceptual difficulties are presented in evaluating retrogression under section 5 when no minority-majority districts are present to act as a baseline.  See Reno v.

Faced with a choice between a comprehensive plan that was supported by several independent justifications and the plaintiffs' response--a map of the City showing Kingwood and its environs in District B, with no indication of the boundary shifts that would follow--it would not be surprising if the Council members imagined a worst-case scenario in regards to disruption (or the possible effects on their own district).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs have introduced the affidavits of two members of the Council who were opposed to the plan.  The affidavits do not purport to relate incriminating conversations or statements made by proponents of the plan that would serve to demonstrate the majority's intent--they merely state the dissident Council Members' personal opinions.  And their opinion that race predominated, while no doubt deeply held, cannot demonstrate the impermissible intent of the majority.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> One piece of evidence that might have proven extremely helpful for the plaintiffs' case in this regard would be transcripts of Council debates surrounding the adoption of the prior plans.  While the 1997 debate is in the record, the earlier ones are not.  Had those debates been as open and detailed as the 1997 record, they perhaps could have proven decisive against summary disposition here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Presumably, there is a platonic ideal form covering each of the traditional districting principles, and they will not always overlap.  For example, adherence to administrative boundaries will by its very nature subvert mathematical compactness, since these units are not uniform.  When a factor is legitimately raised, it will always in a sense subordinate other factors--the raising of political concerns will interfere with compactness or communities of interest or race.  If, after a plan was laboriously crafted, a Council member objected on the grounds that it severed his residence from his district, and changes were then made, this rejection and alteration of the plan would show that political concerns were a factor.  But the fact that a finished plan was rejected would not in and of itself show that this political input predominated.  One or more other factors would surely be sacrificed, but not only the political concern that drove it but also other factors might be advanced.  Ultimate approval of the change might be based not only on the grounds that led to it being proposed, but also because of the other interests it advanced.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., id. at 1385 \". . . the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.  Simply stated, an individual's right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the state,\" and 1390 \"the Equal Protection Clause requires that a state make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs complain that three of the four minority districts are undersized relative to a hypothetical ideal district. Three minority districts are indeed undersized, and one of them is the smallest district in the City.  The City concedes that this is the case, and also concedes that this fact is at least partially traceable to concerns that the 1990 census undercounted minorities. At the time the basic outlines of the districts were constructed, the City claims that it believed that there might be a revision of the census, and thus predominantly minority districts were undersized  to prevent them from later being viewed as oversized. Based on the limited information in the record and the City's statement, it appears clear that this undersizing was not based on any scientific measurement designed to correct for perceived flaws in the census.  Nor was it applied equally to the minority population--only minorities living in certain districts were affected.  Had it been shown that the City's districts breached the ten percent threshold when either of these manipulations were removed or when they were applied properly to all minorities in the City, the City's hasty and unscientific methods to adjust the census might well have created a violation.  However, plaintiffs have not shown, or even claimed, that this is the case.  And even if the ten percent de minimis threshold is not viewed as an absolute bar, we cannot say on this sparse record that a reasonable fact finder could find that the City's decisions here evidenced the \"bad faith, arbitrariness, or invidious discrimination\" courts have required in cases involving variations under ten percent.

Hunt, 93 F.3d 1212, 1220-21 (4th Cir. 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Clearly, the United States Constitution does not forbid the states from restricting the franchise to citizens.  See, e.g., Sugarman v. Dougall, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 2851 (\"This Court has never held that aleins have a constitutional right to vote or to hold high public office under the Equal Protection Clause.  Indeed, implicit in many of this Court's voting rights decisions is the notion that citizenship is a permissible criterion for limiting such rights\"); id. at 2851 n.13 (\"In congressional debates leading to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, there is clear evidence that Congress not only knew that as a matter of local practice aliens had not been granted the right to vote, but that under the amendment they did not receive a constitutional right of suffrage or a constitutional right to participate in the political process of state government, and that, indeed, the right to vote and the concomitant right of participation in the political process were matters of local law.\").  See also Foley v.Connelie, 98 S.Ct. 1067 at 1070 (1978) (\". . . we have recognized -a state's historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its democtractic political institutions' . . . as a part of the sovereign's obligation -to preserve the basic conception of a policial community,'\" quoting Dougall, 93 S.Ct. at 2850).  The voting rights protections of the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Sixth Amendments are restricted to \"citizens,\" as is section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ' 1973.  The protection of the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges And Immunities Clause, which has been said to embrace \"the right to vote for national officers,\" Twining v. New Jersey, 29 S.Ct. 14, 19 (1908), is limited to \"citizens.\"  And, the congressional representation penalty of section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment is brought into play only by  denial of voting rights (except for rebellion or other crime) to adult, male inhabitants who are \"citizens.\"</p>\n        <p>On the other hand, we are also aware of no provision of the Constitution which expressly or by clear implication prohibits the states from extending the franchise to lawfully resident aliens.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion in this regard is also strengthened by the fact that, as observed in note 16, supra, the constitution does not preclude states from denying the franchise to aliens while it explicitly protects \"citizens\" from such denial on diverse specified grounds.  Moreover, the Equal Protection Clause has been construed to in most cases preclude the denial of the franchise to citizens by means of property ownership or similar qualifications for voting.  See, e.g., Kramer v. Union Free School District, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 1889 (1969) (\"close scrutiny . . . is applicable to statutes denying the franchise to citizens who are otherwise qualified by residence and age;\" second emphasis added , footnote omitted).  In these circumstances, it is, at the very least, counter-intuitive to say that the Equal Protection Clause mandates that the right of citizens to vote be diluted to the extent necessary to prevent dilution of a representational right, unmentioned in the Constitution, of aliens who have no right to vote.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> See Footprints at 103-104 (noting proposals to use citizenship as a benchmark faced opposition from northern states with large alien populations that might imperil passage); 145 (relating speech of Senator Hendricks on February 16, 1866, in which he claimed opposition of New England to proposal to use eligible voters rather than total population was grounded in part in the relative preponderance of women in those states); 415 (reviewing debate on proposed language of section 2 basing representation on citizenship, in which representative from New England argued its omission of 2.1 million unnaturalized foreigners would unjustly weaken the North, while proponent argued that a citizen of Massachusetts should not \"be entitled to vote on behalf of unnaturalized foreigners who happened to live in Massachusetts\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p>The evidence suggests that proponents of absolute electoral equality compromised this principle in order to assure passage of the amendment.

Voting qualifications were whatever was specified by each state for the most numerous branch of its legislature.  With ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment on December 6, 1865, all were \"free persons,\" so the former slave states would presumably have increased representation in Congress despite still denying the vote to African-Americans.  This problem, which faced Congress in late 1865 and the first part of 1866, could be addressed in different ways.  Denial of the right to vote on grounds of race could be expressly proscribed.  That route was taken in the Fifteenth Amendment, but not in the Fourteenth.  Representation in the federal House could beallocated among the states on the basis of the number of potentially eligible voters.  That choice, too, was rejected.  The solution ultimately adopted in the Fourteenth Amendment was to retain the existing structure of Article 1, section 2-including the right of the states to prescribe voting qualifications and the entitlement of each state to at least one Representative-while eliminating the \"three fifths\" clause and providing for a proportional reduction in the federal House representational base of any state to the extent \"the right to vote\" (in federal or most state elections) was \"denied\" (except for rebellion or other crime) to adult male \"citizens\" of the state.  The essential focus of the debates was on two matters: allocating representation of the states in the United States House of Representatives, and the right of African-Americans to vote.  It was not on any general representational as opposed to electoral equality theory of government.  Both Footprints and Justice Harlan's dissent in Reynolds make plain that the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, as reflected in its legislative history, was to continue to leave electoral and representational rights in the control of the states to the same extent as they had been before the Civil War except that a state's representation in the federal House of Representatives would be subject to reduction on account of denial by it of \"the right to vote\" of its adult, male \"citizens.\"  While the majestic and open-ended generality of the Equal Protection Clause must be assumed to have justified Reynolds' failure to accord controlling significance to this legislative history, that majestic generality casts no meaningful light whatever on whether the states were thereby commanded to chose undiluted representational equality over undiluted electoral equality, or vice versa, where one or the other must be diluted, or were essentially left as free to make that choice as they had previously been.</p>\n        <p>Plaintiffs make no argument that state law or the Houston City Charter mandates use of CVA population.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

They claim that the City's 1997 redistricting violated the principle of one-person, one-vote, and that the districts created constituted a racial gerrymander impermissible under Shaw v. Reno,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City is governed by a fifteen-member City Council, comprised of the Mayor, elected at large, five council members elected at-large, and nine council members selected through single-member districts (Districts A through I).  The City is required to redistrict the single member districts every two years, and does so through ordinances.  In the wake of the 1990 census, the City drafted a new districting plan.  The Department of Justice refused preclearance, and the City responded by drafting an alternative plan that created two districts with weak majorities of Hispanic residents.  This new plan received preclearance.  Although due to a subsequently reversed district court decision the new precleared plan was not used in the 1991 elections, see Campos v. City of Houston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586330\"><a href=\"/opinion/586330/jesse-campos-wr-resendez-morris-and-mexican-american-bar-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>,452 (5th Cir. 1992), the form of that 1991 plan was substantially followed in the 1993 and 1995 redistrictings.  Neither of these plans was challenged on Shaw v. Reno grounds, although the City did face litigation from plaintiffs claiming that the City was required to create additional districts with Hispanic majorities.  See Campos v. City of Houston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11902\"><a href=\"/opinion/11902/campos-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1997) (affirming Morris v. city of Houston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094759/morris-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Tex. 1995) granting summary judgment in favor of the City).</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 1996, the City of Houston annexed an area to the far northeast of the City known as Kingwood.  Kingwood had a population of around 40,000, and some adjustment in the City's district boundaries for the 1997 scheduled redistricting was thus required to avoid unbalancing the population of the districts.  The City drafted a plan placing Kingwood, and the surrounding area that had previously been a part of District B, into District E.  Like prior City redistrictings, this was conducted in part by using a computer program that contained racial and ethnic data at the level of voting precincts.  After a debate that included the plaintiffs' lawyer in this case, the Council adopted this plan by ordinance on April 9, 1997.  The plan contained a maximum population deviation, when measured by total population, of 8.63%.  Measured by total population,two of its districts had African-American majorities while two others had Hispanic majorities.  It received preclearance from the Justice Department on July 7, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs launched this challenge to the 1997 districts on April 9, 1997--the same day the ordinance was adopted--claiming, among other things, that the districts constituted an impermissible racial gerrymander and violated the principle of one-person, one-vote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On August 15, 1997, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  This motion was denied on October 3, 1997. On March 2, 1998, the City filed five separate motions for summary judgment.  The district court granted all five motions and issued final judgment in favor of the City on May 7, 1998.  Chen v.

They argue that they produced enough circumstantial and direct evidence of the predominance of race in the City's districting decision to allow a reasonable jury to find in their favor.  They also claim that the district court erred as a matter of law when it measured the City's  compliance with the one-person, one-vote requirement using total population rather than figures that accurately reflected the distribution of potentially eligible voters in the City.  Though the issue is extremely close and difficult, after careful review, we have concluded that the plaintiffs failed to meet their evidentiary burden on the Shaw claim and summary judgment was appropriate.  We also hold that the use of total population to track the size of the districts does not, under these circumstances, violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a motion for summary judgment by applying the same standard as that appropriate for the court below, and in doing so we interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.  Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmovant fails to demonstrate that there is sufficient summary judgment evidence to allow a reasonable fact finder to find in its favor on all essential issues as to which it would bear the burden of proof at trial.

However, this review must be understood in the context of the courts' traditional reluctance to interfere with the delicate and politically charged area of legislative redistricting.  See Reynolds v.

If the plaintiffs can demonstrate that race predominated so that \"race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines,\" the districts will be subject to strict scrutiny.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2486.  For a majority of the Supreme Court, the mere fact that race was given some consideration in the districting process, and even the fact that minority-majority districts were intentionally created, does not alone suffice in all circumstances to trigger strict scrutiny.

They first argue that the question of the City's intent is inherently a fact-intensive inquiry that is unsuitable for summary judgment, relying on a recent Supreme Court reversal of a grant of summary judgment in a districting case.  See Cromartie.  This ignores, however, the fact that in Cromartie the district court had granted summary judgment for the plaintiff.  The Court took care to stress that summary judgment was inappropriate not only because of the factual nature of the intent requirement, but also because the nonmovant did not bear the burden of proof on the issue. See id. at 1552 (\"Summary judgment in favor of the party with the burden of persuasion, however, is inappropriate when the evidence is susceptible of different interpretations or inferences by the trier of fact.\") (emphasis added).  The Court also relied on the traditional presumption that the legislature acted in good faith while districting.  Id.  Here,neither of these factors are present.  The plaintiffs here bear the burden of persuasion, and the presumption of legislative integrity adds to, rather than lessens, their burden facing summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs next argue that summary judgment is inappropriate because the case is one of mixed motives--while the City has proffered justifications for its actions grounded in traditional districting principles, it has also conceded that race was a factor in its decisions.  The plaintiffs argue that the Court has indicated that a more searching inquiry is needed in such cases, and summary judgment is thus inappropriate.  Bush v. Vera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118040\"><a href=\"/opinion/118040/bush-v-vera/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1941</span></a></span>, 1952 (1996) ( in a mixed motive case a \"careful review is, therefore, necessary to determine whether these districts are subject to strict scrutiny\").  This position misconstrues Bush.  The Bush court made this statement to distinguish mixed motives cases in which the districting body presented credible evidence of alternative justifications from those in which no valid traditional districting purpose was given and racial intent was obvious.  See id. (distinguishing with cf. citation mixed motive case from Miller); Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2485 (noting that district court had found evidence of predominance of race was overwhelming \"and practically stipulated by the parties involved\"). Far from indicating that summary judgment should be disfavored, the discussion the plaintiffs highlight demonstrates the gravity with which the court approaches facially valid defenses proffered by the legislature in thedistricting area.  The City of Houston's presentation of valid evidence of nonracial intent, which transforms the case into one of mixed motives, advances rather than hinders its case for summary judgment.  We will review the district court's grant of summary judgment using the traditional criteria, and take into account both the presumption in favor of a legislature's good faith and a plaintiff's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II.  Circumstantial Evidence of Racial Motivation--The Appearance of the Districts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff may demonstrate that race predominated in a districting decision by introducing circumstantial evidence of the district's shape and demographics.  See Shaw II, 116 S.Ct. at  1900 (1996).  The shape alone of some districts may be so bizarre and irregular that their creation may only be interpreted as \"an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles.\" Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2824; Cromartie, at 1549 n.3 (some highly bizarre districts give rise to inference that race predominated more strongly than the inference that factors such as politics created the distortion).  When shape alone is not determinative, plaintiffs may still prove their circumstantial case by demonstrating that the districts are sufficiently bizarre in relation to racial demographics and population densities.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2489.  The objective case against a district may also be affected by an analysis of whether the district adheres to traditional districting principles other than compactness, such as political considerations and fidelity to administrative boundaries.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 971.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a very general sense, Houston's nine single member council districts can be described as being arranged like pieces of a pie, each district radiating out from the center to the edge of town.  The two exceptions are District H, which does not touch the city's external borders due to a thin bridge between two halves of District B, and District E, which does not approach the city center.  Were the City a congressional district carved out of the surrounding suburbs, its own shape would likely provide ample fodder for a Shaw claim.  The City engulfs independent incorporated areas, leaving two holes in its west half.  It also includes  three detached \"islands\" to the north of the City proper--two of them quite large--that are only tenuously connected to the \"mainland\" by narrow and unpopulated corridors.  In addition, it includes several peninsulas jutting out into the countryside, the most outlandish of which extends in a snakelike fashion eastward out of District E between the IH-10 Freeway and the La PorteHighway.  In short, as a glance at the map will readily confirm, the City has vastly irregular borders and does not even remotely approach a mathematical ideal of compactness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But plaintiffs do not challenge the shape of the City of Houston, and the City is not in fact a congressional district.  The City's highly irregular borders are simply a given that the Council was forced to deal with as best it could in crafting the districts challenged here.  Because of the constraint imposed by the City's external borders, Houston's city council districts will never enjoy the pleasing symmetry of, say, Nebraska or Kansas (to say nothing of Colorado or Wyoming).  The City's various peninsulas and protuberances, and in particular its archipelago of detached islands, have to be placed somewhere.  While this might at first glance leave particular districts open to charges of being noncompact, these breaches of that ideal are unavoidable under the circumstances.  Recognizing this, when drafting its guidelines for the redistricting, the city's geographic goal embraced functional as well as purely spacial compactness considerations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rather obvious point seems to have escaped both the plaintiffs and their expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs take care to lift segments of the City's districts and compare them to elements of Shaw, Reno, and Miller, but fail to point out this context. Thus, for example, the plaintiffs argue that the City's districting plan used narrow, unpopulated connectors to link District B with the Houston Airport area, and that District E has a snaking protuberance extending far to the east under the challenged plan. While this is surely correct, and leads to an immediate analogy to the Shaw district, it is absolutely irrelevant.  Were Houston to purge race utterly from its districting process by handing over the task to a computer programmed to maximize purely spacial compactness, these deviations would still be present.  The same error infected the expert opinion relied on by plaintiffs to demonstrate lack of compactness and bizarre shape.  Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Maggiotto, performed the type of mathematical analysis cited with approval in several cases and concluded that the City's districts were not compact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  However, Dr. Maggiotto failed to take into account that substantial deviation from absolute mathematical compactness was inherent in the City's current form.  Accordingly, we reject his conclusion.  Even on a motion for summary judgment, we are not required to take heed of an ill-reasoned expert opinion. See Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. V. Zenith Radio Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1348</span></a></span>, 1360 n.19 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This general failure of the plaintiffs does not, however, foreclose their case.  They point to several districts which have borders that deviate from the Euclidean ideal in a manner not entirely traceable to the City's external borders.  In particular, they highlight districts B, H, I, and E.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  District B, which has an African-American majority, consists of one \"island\" around the Houston airport, and two distinct areas on the \"mainland\" that are divided by District H and are connected only by a thin strip of land along H's northern border.  The eastern half of the District B plungesat one point into District I, and also has its pattern broken by the intrusion of an arm of District H.  District H, while possessing a highly compact substantially rectangular core, has two \"arms\" extending to the west and southeast.  The southeast arm curls around the borders of districts B and I in an ungainly fashion and terminates in a small, uneven projection extending a short distance back to the west, into District B. The far more regular western arm of District H extends for a fair distance into District A, and at one point tapers sharply to merely point continuity before expanding again. District I by comparison is far more compact, although its eastern and western sections are separated to a certain extent by District B.  District E consists of a southeastern portion that would be fairly compact but for the City's borders.  However, it also includes the large island in the Lake Houston area to the extreme northeast of the city, with which it shares a connection only by a narrow eight-mile corridor. The nature of this connection cannot be helped, as it is a product of the City borders.  As the plaintiffs stress, however, the Lake Houston island is closer as the crow flies to Districts B and I than to the balance of District E.  In previous plans, the portion of this island then within the City was in fact placed in District B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, these four districts--B, H, I and E--are not perfectly compact.  And since District B is a predominantly African-American district, Districts H and I contain Hispanic majorities, and District E is mainly white or \"Anglo,\" the shape of these districts is not so regular as to preclude the plaintiffs from showing that race predominated in the drawing of a portion of some of the extremities of these districts.  But these districts are not the type of sprawling monstrosities that have previously been found to violate Shaw by the Supreme Court.  Indeed, Bush v. Vera discussed districts that substantially overlapped with the contested districts H, I and B.  A quick review of the map in Bush will demonstrate that the City was far more faithful to the ideal of compactness than the Texas Legislature was in drafting the Bush plan.  In Bush, legislators attempting to create Houston area seats for both Blacks and Hispanics effected this goal by selecting block-sized packets of Hispanic or African-American voters and linking them each into their respective district.  The end result created two of the three least regular districts in the country, comparable to a jigsaw puzzle in which the pieces could not be removed.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1958.  In Bush, in the area at issue here, an already somewhat ungainly tentacle of the African-American district contained uneven veins of loosely interconnected Hispanic blocks that were placed in, and attached tenuously to, the Hispanic district.  Not only does the City's districting of the same area fail to even approach that level of non-compactness, the record indicates that the Council specifically rejected a proposal by one of its members to redraw its districts to mimic the plan rejected in Bush on the grounds of noncompactness.  In addition, we note that the City successfully resisted pressure from private litigants to draft a plan containing four majority-minority districts--something that almost certainly would have created a more bizarre plan.  See Campos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11902\"><a href=\"/opinion/11902/campos-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>.  Race was clearly not the only factor driving the City's districting, because it avoided these extremes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we certainly do not mean to suggest that the extremes of Bush or Shaw are the minimum threshold for a successful suit, we simply cannot find that the challenged shape of the districts here offers adequate evidence that race predominated in the districting.  This is especially true since some of the specific departures from compactness that the plaintiffs highlight are not as dramatic as they might initially appear. First, the plaintiffs attempt to paint the odd southeastern arm of District H as an attempt to maximize Hispanic numbers in H while avoiding the inclusion of African-Americans.  But this argument ignores the fact that District H's arm borders not only \"Black\" District B, but alsoDistrict I--the other majority Hispanic district in Houston.  Had the City's sole real concern been maintaining the racial purity of these districts, that goal could have facially just as easily been accomplished by placing H's southeastern arm in District I, in exchange for the placement of District I's northwest ern corner in District H.  This configuration would have appeared far more compact and regular, since the arm of H blends naturally into the north of I.  And since the relevant borders of the arm itself would not have altered, the African-American population of B would have been unaltered and the percentage of Hispanics in both H and I would have remained roughly equivalent.  Careful demographic analysis of the populations in these disputed areas might disprove this hypothesis, but the plaintiffs failed to even attempt to provide such data.  The evidence does not tie the particularly unusual feature of H's borders to race to the exclusion of any other real concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the usage of a narrow connector to link the two sections of District B separated by District H is also not as facially objectionable as it first appears.  The plaintiffs argue that District B's odd shape is explained by the City's desire to carve out a Hispanic majority for District H, and continuity in B was accordingly sacrificed, with the narrow connector a mere token concession to the principle.  However, when the area of District B as a whole, including the dead space not included in the City, is taken into account, this picture is far from clear.  Because a large section of District B is a detached island, B is in some respects missing its center.  The geographical heart of the district is located outside the City limits.  The northern island of B and its two mainland halves would constitute a facially unobjectionable compact body if the intervening unincorporated territory were included.  If one takes this into account, and views District B as an attempt to reflect a coherent geographical neighborhood in the north of the City that happens to be broken up by unincorporated dead space, the outline of the district becomes much less offensive.  Rather than being a racial subterfuge, the strip of territory connecting the incorporated halves of B can be  properly seen as marking the central border of a coherent and relatively compact district whose outline is only clouded by the City's irregular borders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the presence of the detached Lake Houston area in District E offers less support for the plaintiff than it otherwise might.  Concededly, the placement of this area leads to the creation of an ungainly district that sprawls from the northern to the southern extremity of the City.  And this northeastern island is closer to District B, so it would seem to do violence to the compactness concept to put it anywhere else.  However, this must be placed in the context of the City's most unusual outline.  When a districting body has the opportunity to create truly compact districts and chooses not to, the harm is obvious.  But when, as here, spacial compactness is simply impossible, further departure from the principle seems less jarring.  Wherever the island was placed, its representative would have to travel several miles outside of the City proper, and voters in that district would have had the odd sensation of being thrown together with an area with which they shared only a technical connection.  Given that the City's design had already decisively severed the island from its neighbor, its placement in a district that was a few miles farther away seems less offensive than it would otherwise.  A judicial analogy may serve to clarify this point.  We would find it odd indeed if Congress decided to place Washington State within the realm of this Circuit when the opportunity to keep it within the Ninth Circuit was present.  But it is far less troublesome that Puerto Rico has been assigned to the First Circuit rather than the Eleventh (or the Fourth).  The placement of Kingwood and its environs is discussed in more detail below, but facially we find that its separation mitigates to alarge extent the effect of its placement in District E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, when viewed properly, the geographic boundaries here do not in and of themselves make out a strong circumstantial case under Shaw.  That does not end our inquiry, however.  As Miller indicated, a district that is not facially outrageous may be objectively revealed as a gerrymander by linking its shape to demographics and other factors.  In Miller, the Court conceded that the district's shape, while hardly perfect, was not sufficient standing alone to lead to the conclusion that it was bizarre in a Shaw sense.  It then turned to a closer analysis of the geography in light of the district's demographics.  It noted that the district's shape became far more troublesome once it was recognized that the core of the district was relatively unpopulated, while the carefully drawn exterior borders reached out to engulf urban African-American population centers.  Viewed in light of this evidence, a shape that initially merely raised eyebrows was revealed to present overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a constitutional violation.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2489 (\"Although by comparison with other districts the geometric shape of the Eleventh District may not seem bizarre on its face, when its shape is considered in conjunction with its racial and population densities, the story of racial gerrymandering seen by the District Court becomes much clearer.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Miller, we are presented with districts in which deviations from the compactness ideal are present but are not overwhelming.  But unlike in Miller, the plaintiffs have failed to present us with specific demographic data that would clarify the racial nature of these distortions.  The plaintiff's expert, Dr. Weber, merely produced demographic data covering the districts as a whole.  He did not give us a demographic analysis of the specific features--the arms of H, the connector section in B, and the northeast island in E--that are at issue in this case.  His report did not show that, for example, the arms of District H contain most of the district's population, and H's compact core is relatively unpopulated.  Nor was there even data demonstrating that the western arm of H is designed to capture a specific pocket of Hispanics in order to maintain Hispanic supremacy in the district. Based on a map of Hispanic population dispersion in the record, it appears this arm includes several areas without, and excludes some areas with, high ratios of Hispanics.  The general, over-broad data Dr. Weber used supports only his conclusion that these districts could be made more heterogenous.  And this is hardly relevant--of course if one solely focused on increasing racial heterogeneity one could improve this factor, just as one could increase homogeneity by adopting the pattern rejected in Bush.  But districters are not bound--or allowed--to sacrifice traditional districting concerns to meeting quotas of diversity, just as they are not allowed to do so in order to meet quotas of racial concentration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that the fact that the number of racially homogenous precincts increased in the 1997 plan demonstrates that the City's districting was predominantly linked to race.  Standing alone, however, this fact does nothing to support the plaintiffs' case.  For reasons of their own, populations occasionally shift within urban areas.  If members of one racial group chose to move out of certain areas, the numbers of racially homogenous precincts would increase.  However, this phenomenon would not be tied to the actions of the districting parties-they could keep the borders of the districts static and the same effect would be seen.  Indeed, according to the plaintiffs' version of events this is precisely what occurred--they criticize the 1997 plan for substantially maintaining prior boundaries.  Without tying this evidence to specific choices by the City, and in particular to the discrete noncompact elements of the plan that they challenge, this evidence fails to aid the plaintiffs' case.  Ultimately, the plaintiffsfailed to demonstrate by use of demographics, as was done in Miller, that the specific departures from compactness that it challenges are the product of race rather than other factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, compactness is not the only traditional districting principle.  Other factors, such as the protection of political incumbents, the maintenance of administrative units, and the reflection of communities of interest, play a part in the districting process.  By showing that the design of a district violates these other traditional districting principles, the plaintiffs support their circumstantial case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The districts clearly adhered to at least one traditional districting principle by maintaining the integrity of the relevant administrative unit, voting precincts (although as discussed below plaintiffs argue that these units are themselves tainted). However, the plaintiffs argue that the districts do not serve the traditional districting principle of reflecting communities of interest.  In the more egregious examples of gerrymandering, the violation of this traditional principle will be facially obvious.  Thus the district challenged in Shaw could be safely assumed not to have been driven by communities of interest, since it \"winds in snakelike fashion through tobacco country, financial centers, and manufacturing areas\" in an attempt to gather up \"enclaves of black neighborhoods\"and \"even towns are divided.\"  Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2821.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But when presented with closer questions, the Court has focused on the specific features of a district that cause it to depart from compactness in assessing whether they are unjustifiable on traditional grounds. Thus in Bush, where the State attempted to justify its decision-making on the analogous traditional ground of partisan politics--and there was indeed a correlation with politics when the districts were looked at as a whole--the Court found it significant that \"the maps reveal that political considerations were subordinated to racial classification in the drawing of many of the most extreme and bizarre district lines.\"  Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957.  The fact that the State was willing, in the course of extending a noncompact tentacle engulfing a pocket of African-American voters,  to include a large number of Republican voter tabulation districts in a congressional district ostensibly designed to maximize Democratic power was clear evidence of the subordination of politics to race.  Id.  And in Miller, the demographic data was heavily reinforced by an analysis of how specific choices violated communities of interest.  Because the challenged district reached out to include African-American pockets in several entirely separate urban communities, and linked them together with a sparsely populated and wholly rural core, the \"social, political and economic makeup of the Eleventh District tells a tale of disparity, not community.\" Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2484.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiffs have failed to link the specific departures from compactness that they highlight to the violation of traditional districting principles.  They first claim that several neighborhoods were split in the 1997 plan.  But the City introduced evidence that more neighborhoods were reunited than were split by the plan, and the plaintiffs have not challenged this assertion. Moreover, the plaintiffs failed to show where the allegedly split neighborhoods were.  While it may be unfortunate that a predominantly white neighborhood was split between two white districts, the existence of such a districting faux pas may well have nothing to do with the racial issues that concern us here.  The plaintiffs' evidence of neighborhood splitting is not helpful to their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also tendered the opinion of Dr. Maggiotto, who analyzed various purportedly relevant statistical indicators ofcommunities of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  His report claims that, in the City as a whole, race varies less within the districts than do his chosen indices of community.  This evidence, it is argued, demonstrates that race predominated in the City's districting.  However, the plaintiffs again use too blunt a statistical tool.  Socio-economic variation within districts is almost unavoidable, particularly when, as here, the constituent districting units are fairly large--approaching 200,000 persons.  Not many, if any, rectangles of this size randomly deposited on a map of Houston could be expected to capture an essentially homogenous socio-economic group.  At least when relatively large districts are involved, the mere existence of socio-economic variations within the district is not probative.  To provide valid circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race in the City's districting, then, Dr. Maggiotto had to tie his data to specific districting decisions, or the plaintiffs had to place his data in context by showing that the variations from available normal compactness were likely caused by racial factors.  This they failed to do. They did not show--or even claim--that, for example, the southeastern arm of District H extends outward to reach a pocket of wealthy Hispanics who share nothing other than race with the bulk of the district, the way that the Atlanta extremity of the Miller district shared no commonality with the district's rural core other than race.  Nor did they show that the western arm of H is designed to reach a pocket of Hispanics at the cost of including on the way neighborhoods that share nothing with the rest of that district, the way that Texas reached out to a pocket of African-Americans at the cost of including Republican districts in Bush.  Indeed, the plaintiffs never analyzed or even referred to the socio-economic composition of the specific areas created by the City's departure from geographical compactness, relying instead on broad statistics covering the entire area. See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957 n.* (criticizing dissent for relying on statistics showing political orientation for district as a whole, rather than concentrating on border segments).  Had they done so, perhaps our decision today might have been different.  But bearing in mind that it was the plaintiffs' burden to produce evidence that race predominated, and also remembering the presumption in favor of legislative integrity, we cannot say that the shape and demographics of the districts here provided adequate circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race to prevent summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Direct Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also argue that they have sufficient direct evidence that the City's districting was predominantly driven by race.  They focus on two major points. First, they argue that the major decision made during the 1997 districting-that the newly annexed area of Kingwood should be placed in District E rather than District B--was predominantly influenced by race.  Second, they argue that the 1997 plan substantially maintained the borders of previous plans, and that those borders were set by a process in which race--specifically, the desire to create two black and two Hispanic single member districts--predominated.  The City concedes, as it must, that race--in the form of a desire to comply with the Voting Rights Act--was a factor in all the plans.  But aswe have stated before, a majority of the Supreme Court does not believe that the mere presence of race in the mix of decision making factors , and even the desire to craft majority-minority districts, does not alone automatically trigger strict scrutiny.  See Clark, 88 F.3d at 1404 n.2; Theriot, 185 F.3d at 488.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before touching on plaintiffs' most heavily pressed intent evidence, we briefly dispense with their argument that racial intent can be inferred from the City's use of precinct lines. Plaintiffs assail the district lines because they hew to precinct lines.  Conformity to such administrative boundaries is ordinarily seen as a virtue, not a vice, in the districting process.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1953 (noting maintenance of some county lines showed traditional factors were not entirely ignored).  And plaintiffs have not identified--and there does not appear to be--a larger, more race-neutral, administrative unit that could have been practically deployed.  Cf. Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2490 (noting that plan split several counties, and thus violated traditional districting principles-use of precincts could not mitigate this fact in congressional districting).  But the plaintiffs stress that the City had access to racial data on the precinct level.  They attempt to analogize this situation to Bush, where the State used a computer system that had racial data available on the block level.  The fact that the plan ultimately adopted split precincts and used block units instead was found to offer compelling proof that race has predominated in the districting.  But the key factor in Bush was not the mere availability of racial data.  Rather, it was the abandonment of a traditional districting unit, the precinct.  Since this step violated traditional districting principles and caused substantial administrative problems, and since given the fact the only additional precision the computer provided at the block level was racial, the obvious inference was that race drove the decision.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1959.  Here, in contrast, the City adhered to the traditional--and apparently the only--administrative boundaries readily available. The plaintiffs complain that this is irrelevant, since the size of the precincts was deliberately shrunk to allow more precise racial gerrymandering.  However, the City of Houston does not set precinct size, and the plaintiffs have not tied the changes in precinct sizes to any actions of the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Kingwood</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The major change made by the City in 1997 was driven by the City's decision to annex Kingwood, an overwhelmingly white (Anglo) planned community with a population of around 40,000 people that is attached to the detached Lake Houston area.  The decision to annex Kingwood is itself not before this Court.  Rather, the plaintiffs complain that Kingwood--and with it the rest of the northeastern island around Lake Houston-- was placed in District E.  Previously, this island had been attached to District B.  They claim that they have direct evidence that race predominated in this decision--specifically, that the City's overwhelming motivation in doing so was avoidance of potential section 5 retrogression liability. Because  Kingwood has a large population, and because District B was close to the one-person, one-vote  population limit, placing Kingwood in B would have forced the City to move areas on the borders of B into the surrounding districts.  And because the only district adjacent to B with a white (Anglo) majority--A--was already relatively overpopulated, moving areas from B to A would have in turn created more spillover effects, resulting in the disruptive necessity of redrawing several districts.  Placement of spillover from B into Districts H or I would initially seem more attractive, since those districts were underpopulated.  However, the addition of African-American voters displaced from B would seemingly have eliminated the Hispanic majorities in either or both of these districts.  The City believed that this might have triggered retrogression concerns under section 5 of the Voting RightsAct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Placement in District E, by comparison, allowed for the smooth integration of Kingwood.  Spillover and one-person, one-vote concerns were minimized, with only relatively minor border changes made necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence clearly indicates that the City's decision to place Kingwood in District E was partially driven by the fear of retrogression.  Its section 5 filings and the statements of both the drafter of the plan and the council members involved establishes this, and the City does not contest it.  Indeed, it argues that this concern would allow it to survive strict scrutiny review.  And to a certain extent--as discussed above, the issue is not as pressing when a detached island is concerned--compactness was sacrificed in the placement of Kingwood.  Kingwood is closer to District B than it is to District E.  However, a review of the record indicates that the Council had before it at the time it made its decision to place Kingwood in District E two other  legitimate grounds for justifying its decision.  First, the City wanted to preserve communities of interest.  Second, it wanted to minimize disruption in the run-up to the expected major redrawing of districts following the 2000 census.  On this record, we cannot say that there has been an adequate showing that race predominated over these concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most powerful alternative justification for the City's actions is the nature of Kingwood and it greater community of interest overlap with portions of District E.  The Court has noted that concern about communities of interest is a valid traditional districting tool that may serve to deflect an inference that race predominated in districting.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1954 (evidence that \"district lines were drawn in part on the basis of evidence (other than racial data) of where communities of interest existed might weaken a plaintiff's claim that race predominated in the drawing of district lines.\").  Here, transcripts of the series of council debates that led to the final vote on the districting plan demonstrate that members of the Council discussed and evaluated data that indicated that Kingwood's communities of interest overlapped with District E, but were wildly at variance with District B.  The fact that this material was available to the Council at the time they were deliberating on it serves to distinguish this case from others in which alternative justifications have been raised after the fact and only hypothetically motivated the districting body.  See Shaw II, 116 S.Ct. at 1902 n.4 (purported justification must be actual purpose in adopting plan and supported in the evidence); Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1955 (disregarding community of interest justification because data was not before the legislature in an organized fashion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Council debates, members of the Council referred to both anecdotal and statistical evidence demonstrating that the  average income and quality of housing in Kingwood were much higher that those found in District B, while the percentage of persons on public relief and the occurrence of illiteracy was much smaller. Moreover, the members of the Council did not limit themselves to general discussions of socioeconomic indicators.  They pointed to specific factors that demonstrated that District B's community concerns varied from those in Kingwood.  Because Kingwood is a planned community, it has excellent infrastructure.  In comparison, the infrastructure in District B was referred to as among the worst in the City.  This wouldraise the concern that the residents of Kingwood's desire and need for municipal improvements would diverge from those of other residents of District B.  It was also stated that Kingwood had privatized several municipal services, and paid for services using regressive user fees rather than more  progressive property taxation.  This difference would obviously lead to a divergence between the two areas' approaches to services and taxation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  In comparison, District E was said to be far more congruent with Kingwood than District B.  Its infrastructure and average income were much closer to Kingwood's.   It also contained planned communities that shared Kingwood's special concerns regarding services and taxation.  In light of the greater similarity between the two areas, in the eyes of the members voting for the plan it made sense to place Kingwood in District E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, opponents of the plan--and two Council members, as well as the plaintiffs' lawyer in this case, spoke out in some depth against it before the vote--never challenged these assumptions.  At no point were the Council members' characterization of Kingwood's socio-economic status, infrastructure, and services called into question in any way.  The closest an opponent of the plan came to undermining the majority's community of interest assumptions was a discourse by one of the members who voted against the plan.  He argued that communities of interest were inherently linked to geography, and thus could not bind Kingwood to District E.  In its strong form, this statement would make communities of interest a mere subset of geographic compactness.  In its weak form, it is generally correct and a useful observation to guard against abuses of the community of interest rationale.  Here, however, this reasoning is inapplicable. Since Kingwood was separated from the main body of both Districts B and E, it was never likely to share a sense of geographic neighborliness with either district.  The question was not one of placing Kingwood in either District E or an adjacent community linked in the eyes of the populace with Kingwood.  Instead, the issue was which of two geographically isolated areas Kingwood and its surrounds should be shoehorned into--a district in which it had nothing in common or one with which it shared at least some points of community concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor have the plaintiffs pointed on their appeal to any evidence that undermines the community of interest justification.  As noted above, their arguments and evidence regarding communities of interest are fatally flawed by the broad level of generality they adopt.  Here, this weakness is especially glaring.  Plaintiffs have not presented data about Kingwood at all, let alone introduced evidence that undermines the arguments made by proponents of the plan at the time.  Since Dr. Maggiotto did not separate out Kingwood, his data cannot be used to undermine the City's justification here--there is no evidence that factors such as occupations or educational level create a significant point of commonality between Kingwood and District B that mitigates the divide created by raw income and other factors.  Indeed, Dr. Maggiotto's evidence largely confirms the City's analysis.  It shows that District B was the second poorest district in the City, while District E was the second richest, and contains the lowest variation of income.  At most, plaintiffs have shown that all of District E is not exactly congruent with Kingwood.  They have not shown, and have never claimed, that Kingwood was more similar in regard to the factors discussed to District B than it was to District E.  And they never attempted to introduce, by expert opinion or otherwise, evidence tending to show that this lack of similarity was overcome by the presence of commonalities in nonquantifiable indicia ofcommunities of interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In short, this is not a case where a decision is justified by a \"mere recitation of purported communities of interest\" unproven by facts in the record.  Cf. Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2490.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further support for the City's position is provided by the special nature of the decision of where to place Kingwood.  Not only was the council presented with the awkward task of placing a disconnected, newly-acquired parcel of land into a settled districting scheme, it also did so against the looming background of the upcoming census.  As a result of the 2000 census, the City will in the near future receive significantly better data about its population.  A report prepared for the Council by a local university professor, Dr. Alford, indicated that the City would be required to engage in a major overhaul of its districts in light of this data, and that a similar effort in 1997 based on soon-to-be obsolete census figures would be inefficient.  The City evidently has followed a practice of confining major changes to the districting that follows the census.  See Campos v. City of Houston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586330\"><a href=\"/opinion/586330/jesse-campos-wr-resendez-morris-and-mexican-american-bar-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span>, 449 (5th Cir. 1992) (discussing replacement of old plan \"used during the 1980s\" in wake of 1990 census).  Inlight of this, it is hardly surprising that the City would be reluctant to place Kingwood in an area which would require major alterations of the district plan.  Several Council members spoke to this effect.  By placing Kingwood in District E, the City minimized the spillover effect mandated by one-person, one-vote concerns, and the corresponding mass redrawing of districts that would ensue.  Under the special--if not wholly unique--situation created here by a major annexation located so soon before the next census, this would seem a valid concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attempt to undermine this evidence by arguing, in essence, that the Council's debates were mere smoke and mirrors concocted in anticipation of precisely this lawsuit.  Certainly, the debates evidence an intense awareness of the possibility that the districting would be subject to a Shaw suit.  The first day of the debate began with legal counsel explaining the nuances of Miller and Bush in great detail to the Council.  However, this record does not support a conclusion that the whole debate was essentially scripted.  The voluminous testimony exhibits meaningful disputation, and several proponents of the plan used language and took positions that are not consistent at all with the hypothesis that the supporters of the plan were carefully coached.  Given the presumption in favor of legislative good faith granted in this area, we cannot say on this record that the mere fact that the Council was aware of the meaningful possibility of this litigation suffices to create a fact issue as to their statements being mere pretexts for concealed racial motivation.  We cannot say that a fact issue has been created regarding the predominance of race in the placement of Kingwood.  The decision was independently justified by several factors besides race at the time it was adopted, and the force of the traditional concern that was sacrificed--compactness--was diminishedby the context of placement of a detached island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Continuation of a racially motivated districting structure</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also contend that the City violated Shaw by failing to make substantial changes in a districting structure that was originally designed in a manner that race predominated over traditional districting concerns.  The sins of past Councils, and the Department of Justice (DOJ), thus are claimed to haunt the current Council's asserted ratification of their work.  The district court summarily rejected this argument, reasoning that the constitutionality of the prior plans had never been challenged, and the intent behind their creation was thus not properly before the court.  This would appear to have been overly hasty.  In the context of Voting Rights Act suits, evidence that impermissible racial intent had tainted the plan upon which the challenged plan was based has been allowed, even when enough time has elapsed for a substantial degree of familiarity and political reliance to emerge.  See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span>, 768-69 (9th Cir. 1990), cert denied <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span> (1991).  The mere passage of time cannot extinguish entirely the taint of racial discrimination.  See Hunter v. Underwood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111413\"><a href=\"/opinion/111413/hunter-v-underwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1916</span></a></span> (1985) (discriminatory intent behind 1901 disenfranchisement provision coupled with continued discriminatory impact relied on to invalidate statute).  And in a context like the one before us, where the City redistricts relatively frequently, adoption of the City's position would seem problematic because it would give potential challengers an incentive to launch more frequent lawsuits.  If the potential plaintiffs did not sue, they might find that the passage of other plans had sanitized the intent embodied in the prior plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first note that while race clearly played an important role in the earlier districting efforts, the quality of evidence introduced by the plaintiffs in regard to the earlier efforts (as well as respecting the 1997 ordinance) falls far short of that introduced in the cases examined by the Supreme Court.  As discussed above, the objective, circumstantial evidence of the predominance of race is far weaker than in those cases.  As for direct evidence, in the Shaw cases not only was the end product of DOJ intervention a monstrosity that massively violated traditional districting principles, but the State also openly stated in its section 5 filings that race was its dominant concern rather than just a factor.  See Shaw II, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1901</span></span> (preclearance submission announced creation of minority districts was State's \"overriding purpose\").  A similar direct admission of intent was present in Bush.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1957 (testimony of state officials in related litigation claimed that race was the primary consideration in districting).  And in Miller, where--as here--the district's shape was not itself extremely bizarre, the evidence that race trumped other concerns was conclusive.  There, the DOJ rejected proposed plans not once, but twice, and ultimately made it clear to the State that it would only accept a result that mirrored a plan proposed by a third party, the ACLU.  Ultimately a plan designed around this framework was adopted, as legislators who voted in its favor testified,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> simply because the State felt it had no other choice.  Obviously, the ACLU lawyer who drew up the outlines of the plan challenged in Miller could have no firm understanding of, or respect for, the subtleties of traditional districting.  See Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1933(State \"adopted the Justice Department's entirely race-focused approach to redistricting\"); Johnson v. Miller, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1354</span></span>, 1368 (S.D. Ga. 1994) (lower court discusses role of ACLU drafter).  The inference was thus automatic that race had not only predominated over, but had indeed almost entirely extinguished, traditional districting concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in contrast, the only evidence that the plaintiffs produced is the raw history of DOJ intervention, which contains no brazen admission that race predominated and no details regarding a pattern of DOJ pressure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Plaintiffs relied on the fact that in 1991 the City's original plan was denied preclearance, and that while the plan the City drafted in response creating additional concentrations of minorities was never implemented, it formed the template for the 1993, 1995, and 1997 districtings.  Based solely on these facts and the section 5 filings that accompanied the plans (and demographic evidence that, as we discussed above, is insufficient to sustain plaintiffs' case), the plaintiffs' expert Dr. Weber opined that race had predominated in all of the City's districting since 1991. Certainly, this material establishes that race was a factor in prior districtings, and that the form of those districts was largely reenacted in 1997.  It also establishes an intention on the part of the City to establish minority-majority districts. And, a glance at the district maps verifies that the City's original plan was more compact than the ones subsequently adopted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the City has always conceded these points, and as we discussed above the sacrifice in compactness was not extreme.  And this Court has interpreted the Supreme Court's current position to include a majority in favor of Justice O'Connor's statement in Bush that the intentional creation of minority-majority districts will not in and of itself trigger strict scrutiny.  See Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1951; Clark, 88 F.3d at 1404 n.2; Theriot, 185 F.3d at 488.  The plaintiffs' burden was thus to show that race predominated over traditional districting concerns, not merely that the City attempted to craft minority-majority districts and that there was  some but not massive reduction of one such factor--compactness.  Here, all that has been demonstrated is that the DOJ aggressively forced a consciousness of race and the Voting Rights Act upon the City.  The City then abandoned its initial plan--one presumably grounded firmly in traditional districting principles-and ultimately adopted a system that met the DOJ's requirements.  Were districting an exact science, in which the application of traditional districting principles always produced one objectively optimal solution, this would perhaps settle the question--abandonment of the optimal traditional plan would demonstrate subordination.  But districting is hardly a science.  It would seem obvious to us that there is more than one way to draw a district so that it can reasonably be described as meaningfully adhering to traditional principles, even if not to the same extent or degree as some other hypothetical district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, in the wake of the DOJ's intervention, the City had returned to the problem and properly considered race as a factor alongside traditional districting principles, and the result they reached had satisfied the DOJ without substantially abandoning those principles, race would not automatically have predominated.  For example, the City could have returned to the drawing board and generated a plan that increased the recognition of communities of interest and satisfied the DOJ's racial concerns.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The fact that compactness wassomewhat lessened in the process would not establish that strict scrutiny was required, because race might not have predominated over communities of interest.  Thus abandonment of an original plan by itself does not demonstrate that race predominated--the adopted plan may have also been the product of and substantially consistent with traditional districting principles.  The plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence that this did not in fact occur.  As discussed above, the plaintiffs failed to show specific areas in which communities of interest were subordinated to race, and they never claimed that the original plan was a more adequate reflection of that traditional districting principle than those that followed.  The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Weber, conceded that he did not take into account the City's desire to reflect communities of interest, since he believes that the criteria used to measure this concept are themselves closely correlated with race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the rabid extremes of the DOJ conduct in Miller should hardly stand as a minimum litmus test in such matters, it would seem to us that a plaintiff is required to do more than merely demonstrate that the DOJ had somewhat effective input in the process to trigger strict scrutiny. \"It is not Justice Department interference per se that is the concern, but rather the fact that Justice Department pressure led the State to act based on an overriding concern with race.\"  Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1934.  And that is all the plaintiffs have really done here.  The DOJ will almost always have this kind of input into the districting decisions of jurisdictions covered under section 5. At least in those jurisdictions, then, accepting the plaintiffs' minimal showing here would render Justice O'Connor's allowance for the creation of minority-majority districts of merely academic interest.  In the process, such a  rule would in practice narrow what is already a difficult passage through the Scylla of the Voting Rights Act and the Charybdis of Shaw nearly to the vanishing point--virtually every decision the jurisdiction made would run aground on the rocks of litigation.  Here, for example, the City would have surely run into trouble had it disregarded the DOJ's suggestion regarding the creation of more minority concentrations.  But by the mere fact of heeding these objections, plaintiffs claim, the City automatically exposed itself to a lawsuit triable under strict scrutiny.  DOJ's overreaching will occasionally inflict this dilemma in any event--to exacerbate the problem by making it an ironclad rule would seem inadvisable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the fact that the plaintiffs bore the burden of proof on this issue, and the presumption in favor of the Council's good faith, the plaintiffs needed to undercut the hypothesis that the City's plans were independently substantially justified by traditional districting factors.  They failed to do so.  An obvious mechanism would be to use circumstantial evidence based on the districts' shape and demographics to shore up the direct evidence of intent. But as discussed above, the plaintiffs' circumstantial evidence is inadequate to allow a finding that race predominated.  Nor did the plaintiffs point to adequate direct evidence that the compliance with the DOJ's desires was the predominate, driving force behindthe plan, rather than merely one factor, along with traditional ones, in the overall equation.  Cf., e.g., Abrams, 117 S.Ct. at 1934 (discussing direct evidence from drafter of plan that preceded the one challenged in Miller that he viewed draft including two majority-minority districts, that it was viewed as ridiculous and not making sense, and going on to note testimony of legislators that indicated that all other considerations yielded to DOJ desire to maximize minority districts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And in any case, while the district court erred in categorically and totally dismissing evidence of intent garnered from prior plans, it was correct to point out that the state of mind involved in the prior plans is not of itself what is precisely and directly the ultimate issue before the Court in this case.  We have noted in a different context that while under Hunter the discriminatory intent of the original drafter may carry forward despite subsequent judicial invalidation of the most obviously discriminatory provisions, intervening reenactment with meaningful alterations may render the current law valid.  See Cotton v. Fordice, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></span>, 391 (5th Cir. 1988) (while disenfranchisement constitutional provision originated in attempt to discriminate, subsequent reenactment with alterations approved by voters added categories of crimes originally excluded because they were not considered \"Black\" crimes and subtracted a less serious offense that had been considered a \"Black\" crime).  We do not suggest that the changes implemented in 1993, 1995, and 1997 to the original framework were as dramatic as those in Cotton.  However, that case broadly stands for the important point that when a plan is reenacted--as opposed to merely remaining on the books like the provision in Hunter--the state of mind of the reenacting body must also be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the passage of time lent an additional element to the Council's intent.  Maintenance of established district lines is itself a traditional districting principle, and the City included it in its guidelines for the 1997 revision.  And the adopted plan minimized the changes in district boundaries.  Standing alone, that would not matter much here--the mere passage of six years cannot have hallowed the current districts with much familiarity or tradition.  But in the context of the approaching census, this principle would seem to have some validity.  As discussed above, the City had before it when it voted on the plan information indicating that a radical revision of its boundaries (for its soon to follow elections) will be necessary in light of the 2000 census.  What the district court characterized as a \"scorched-earth\" redrawing of the districts--what Dr. Weber's views would have logically required to purge all taint of DOJ interference-would have little to recommend it under the circumstances.  Such ground-up revisions are difficult to implement, and as one Council member argued, can be \"wholly disruptive toward the political and neighborhood relationships we have established in the city.\"  This fact hardly justifies the \"freezing\" of district lines in the manner the district court seemed to endorse.  However, it does caution against wholesale alteration based on out-of-date census figures when the process will in any case have to be done in the immediate future.  In the context of close proximity to the census (with new elections soon to follow), we think that residual doubt as to the appropriateness of summary judgment is extinguished by the fact that the City had valid reasons to adhere to its prior borders distinct from the grounds which led to their adoption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, although the issue on appeal is extremely close, we ultimately conclude that the district court correctly dismissed the plaintiffs' Shaw claim.  On this record, we cannot say that plaintiffs have carried their burden and made a sufficient showing, either circumstantially or directly, to sustain a finding that race predominated in the districting.  We stress that our decision here rests largely on the evidentiary shortcomings in the plaintiffs' case.  We would also add that in our analysis of thedirect intent evidence we relied on the rapid approach of the census, and the City's expectation that a major overhaul of districts (and soon to follow elections) will occur at that time.  Our opinion here cannot be read as a conclusive endorsement of these districts' constitutional status, since on better showing by the plaintiffs the result might well have been different.  Nor can it be viewed as an open invitation to the City to maintain the current boundaries and overall structure in the redistricting that follows the 2000 census.  See Campos v.

The plaintiffs argue that when total population is obviously an imperfect proxy for potential voters, the City is constitutionally required to use a more accurate measurement of voters.  And using CVAP figures, it is clear that several Houston districts fall outside the ten percent threshold established as a safe-harbor for population variance in municipal election districts.

Plaintiffs contend that data available to the City indicated that areas with concentrated Hispanic populations had an extremely high number of noncitizens. They argue that given this well-known fact, the City should have recognized that total population would not serve as a meaningful proxy for potentially eligible voters--areas with concentrations of Hispanics would have a far larger population than potentially eligible voters.  By nevertheless continuing to use total population, the City devalued the votes of residents in districts that did not contain concentrations of Hispanic voters.  They argue that when measured against the proper standard, the City's districts displayed a maximum variance well in excess of the allowable ten percent.  We have had cause before to note the high number of Hispanic residents of Houston who are not citizens.  See Campos v. City of Houston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11902\"><a href=\"/opinion/11902/campos-v-city-of-houston/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 547 (5th Cir. 1997) (census figures indicate 45.8% of adult Hispanics in City are noncitizens).  And the plaintiffs have produced data that appears to clearly show that when the CVAP of Houston districts is compared, the maximum variance indeed exceeds the ten percent threshold.  If the City were required by the Equal Protection Clause to use CVAP rather than total population in crafting its districts, then, summary judgment for the city would have been inappropriate.  However, while this is a close question, we find that the choice of population figures is a choice left to the political process.  Houston did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument is straightforward.  A Reynolds claim is, after all, a \"-one person, one vote'\" claim.  See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1380 (quoting Gray v. Sanders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106547\"><a href=\"/opinion/106547/gray-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span>, 809 (1963)).  Since the inquiry focuses on the dilution of votes, it would be improper to allow the votes of two adult citizens to be weighed equally with the vote of a single adult citizen merely because the latter happened to live in proximity to a noncitizen ineligible to vote.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Plaintiffs concede that undermany, if not most, circumstances this distinction will be irrelevant--generally, the ineligible to vote or to register to do so (whether felons, minors, or noncitizens) can be assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the area to be districted, and the usage of total population is thus an acceptable surrogate for measuring potential voters.  When, however, a districting body knows that large numbers of those ineligible to vote are disproportionately concentrated in certain areas, it can no longer in good faith use total population as a proxy for potential voters.  Instead, it is obligated to deploy a more sophisticated measurement, such as CVAP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two circuit courts have addressed this issue.  The Ninth Circuit has found that total population is not only a permissible method to measure population when known significant concentrations of those not eligible to vote exist, but has also suggested that its usage may be required under the Equal Protection Clause in some circumstances. See Garza v. County of Los Angeles, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></span>, 775 (9th Cir. 1990), cert denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span> (1991) (approving court ordered plan using total population and opining that use of CVAP \"would constitute a denial of equal protection to these Hispanic plaintiffs\").  The Fourth Circuit, confronting the analogous issue of districting when persons below the voting age were unevenly distributed, has stated that the choice between total population or a measurement of potential voters is left to the legislative body.  In doing so, it implicitly rejected the Ninth Circuit's contention that a districting body might be required by the Equal Protection Clause to use total population as a baseline.  See Daly v. Hunt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725014\"><a href=\"/opinion/725014/jack-w-daly-vynone-d-williams-kerry-p-humphrey-aileen-b-lockhart-mark/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span>, 1227 (4th Cir. 1996) (remanding on other grounds).  However, in a powerful dissent in Garza, Judge Kozinski concluded that, at least when the plan is court ordered, the Constitution requires the use of a measurement that accurately tracks potential voters.  See Garza, 918 F.2d at 785.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has from the beginning of this line of cases been somewhat evasive in regard to which population must be equalized.  See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1390 (state should attempt to apportion \"so that each [districting unit] has an identical number of residents, or citizens, or voters\"). However, it has also indicated with some clarity that the choice has political overtones that caution against judicial intrusion.  See Burns v. Richardson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107220\"><a href=\"/opinion/107220/burns-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1286</span></a></span>, 1297 (1966) (state not required to use total population figures, since the choice of measurement \"involves choices about the nature of representation with which we havebeen shown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere\").  The debate does indeed involve questions about the nature of representative democracy.  As Judge Kozinski's dissent recognizes,  and the Daly opinion outlines, there is nothing inherent in the concept of representative democracy that requires the embrace of the plaintiffs' position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The choice presented is, in Judge Kozinski's terms, one between electoral equality and representational equality.  While for the most part obscured by the happy coincidence that eligible voters will frequently track the total population evenly--in which case either measurement would produce similar results, and total population will probably be used since it is easier to gather--this is a fundamental and difficult question.  If total population figures are used in an area in which potentially eligible voters are unevenly distributed, the result will necessarily devalue the votes of individuals in the area with a higher percentage of potentially eligible voters.  The large populations in the other district will leverage the votes of the smaller number of eligible voters there.  However, if a more carefully calibrated measurement is embraced in order to serve this principle of individual electoral equality, the area with the smaller number of voters will find itself relatively disadvantaged. Despite the factthat it has a larger population--and thus perhaps a greater need for government services than the other community--it will find that its political power does not adequately reflect its size.  In addition, it could be argued that because the representative chosen from such a district will have a larger number of constituents, the ability of her constituents--whether or not they are potential voters--to petition and voice their opinions will be proportionately reduced.  See Garza, 918 F.2d at 775.  But see Daly, 93 F.3d at 1226-27 &amp; n.12 (expressing doubt regarding validity of equal access argument).  If one accepts the principle of representational equality--that representatives are chosen by a district's voters, but should represent all persons resident therein--these results may be  unacceptable.  The choice between these two models is stark, and because it is rarely encountered, historical and legal guidance is sparse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Kozinski makes a powerful case that the general tenor of the Court's opinions mandates protection of the individual potential voter. Certainly, to take just a few examples contained in Judge Kozinski's comprehensive summary, there is ample language in the opinions that strongly implies that it is the right of the individual potential voter that must be protected.  See, e.g., Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1384 (\"the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the opportunity for equal participation by all voters in the election of state legislators.  Diluting the weight of votes because of place of residence impairs basic constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment . . . . To the extent that a citizen's right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen . . . . the basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged--the weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives\"); Gaffney, 93 S.Ct. at 2328 (noting that among the variations that made absolute fidelity to population equality impossible was the gap between total population and potential voters, and stating that \"if it is the weight of a person's vote that matters, total population...may not accurately reflect that body of voters\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as Judge Kozinski admits, and as the Daly court highlights, other language can be found that implies that representational equality is the ideal.  See, e.g., Mahan, 93 S.Ct. at 983 (\"the basic constitutional principle [is] equality of population among the districts\").  While it does appear that the numerical weight of references is on the side of electoral equality, it is difficult to attach controlling significance to this fact, since in almost all cases the Court was dealing with situations in which total population was presumptively an acceptable proxy for potentially eligible voters.Under such circumstances, we would expect to find the terms used interchangeably, with perhaps a slight bias toward the more historically resonant phrase--unquestionably, one-person, one-vote. Support for this interpretation is provided by the fact that some of the language Judge Kozinski relies on is contradicted by statements within the same opinion.  See Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1385 (\"We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats . . . must be apportioned on a population basis\"); Westberry v. Sanders, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106739\"><a href=\"/opinion/106739/wesberry-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 530 (1964) (\"To say that a vote is worth more in one district than in another would . . . run counter to our fundamental ideas of democratic government\"); id. at 535 (\"our Constitution's plain objective of making equal representation for equal numbers of people the fundamental goal for the House of Representatives\").  While fully recognizing the force of Judge Kozinski's argument, we think that the cases he cites are not decisive, given the strong possibility that much of the language he relies on may be traceable to the use of terms interchangeably in a context where their meaning does not diverge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, we turn to Burns, where the Court directly confronted an actual differential between the concepts.  We read Burns as compelling rejection of the Garza majority view that the Equal Protection Clause mandates inclusion of aliens in the population base of electoral districts against which the equality requirements of Reynolds are applied.  Burns states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Neither in Reynolds v. Sims nor in any other decision has this court suggested that the States are required to include aliens, transients, short-term or temporary residents, or persons denied the vote for conviction of crime in the apportionment base by which their legislators are distributed and against which compliance with the Equal Protection Clause is to be measured.  The decision to include or exclude any such group involves choices about the nature of representation with which we have been shown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere.  Unless a choice is one the constitution forbids, [citation] the resulting apportionment base offends no constitutional bar, and compliance with the rule established in Reynolds v. Sims is to be measured thereby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hawaii's special population problems might well have led it to conclude that state citizen population rather than total population should be the basis for comparison.\"  Id. at 1296-97 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this reason, we believe the district court erred to the extent it relied on the Garza majority dicta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Judge Kozinski argues that Burns should be determinative for electoral equality, since there the Court allowed a plan that used an even more nuanced measure of voting strength--registered voters.  But we are reluctant to read Burns' allowance of such a measure into a command in the face of what appears to us to be a clear statement to the contrary in the same opinion--that the choice between measurements \"involveschoices about the nature of representation with which we have been shown no constitutionally founded reason to interfere\".  Burns at 1297.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment, on which Reynolds itself rests, do appear to have debated this question, and rejected a proposal rooted in--among other things--the principle of electoral equality.  On December 5, 1865, Representative Stevens introduced a constitutional amendment which apportioned congressional representation among the states \"according to their respective legal voters; and for this purpose none shall be named as legal voters who are not either natural-born citizens or naturalized foreigners.\"  See Joseph T.  Sneed III, Footprints on the Rocks of The Mountain: An Account of the Fourteenth Amendment at 35 (1997) (Footprints).  Debates over the precise basis for apportionment of Congress among the states proved a contentious issue throughout the process that led to the creation of section 2 of the Amendment.  The overriding question driving this debate was the issue of how to deal with the denial of the franchise to African-Americans.  However, as the inclusion of a citizenship provision indicates, an undercurrent of this debate was the recognition by many representatives that aliens were unevenly distributed throughout the country.  In addition, several western states contained an overabundance of males, which, as women were generally not eligible to vote, would disadvantage them relative to settled eastern areas in which the genders were balanced if total population rather than eligible voters were used.  Some of the debate over whether to base apportionment on potential voters, citizens, or population can be tied to this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the overall context in which the amendment was drafted prevents any firm conclusion being drawn as to the framer's intent regarding the question before us.  However, we find it is of some significance that the proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment had a meaningful debate on the question, which cannot be said to have been definitively resolved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  While the final version of section 2 provided generally for the use of total population figures for purposes of allocating the federal House of Representatives among the states, it also included a mechanism to insure that egregious departures from the principle of electoral equality--the disenfranchisement of adult male \"citizens\"--would be penalized.  Bearing in mind that analogies drawn from the federal system are not always applicable to the states, see Reynolds, 84 S.Ct. at 1386-89, we have some difficulty in reading the Equal Protection Clause to require the adoption of a particular theory of political equality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While hardly determinative, our review of the history of the amendment cautions against judicial intrusion in this sphere--either for or against either particular theory of political equality.  Given this, and given the Court's failure, on our reading, to speak clearly to such a vital question, we see no justification to depart from the position of Daly.  We reject the conclusions of both the dissent in Garza and any reading of the majority opinion in that case that would mandate the use of total population figures on equal protection grounds.  We thus conclude that the district court correctly determined that the plaintiffs failed to create an issue of genuine material fact in respect to the City's adherence to the one-person, one-vote principle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is not such as to sustain a finding that race predominated in the City's decision-making.  While the plaintiffs were able to point to bits and pieces of the City's plan that might have created a valid Shaw claim, they failed to produce evidence that would have surmounted the summary judgment threshold.  The propriety under the Equal Protection Clause of using total population rather than a measure of potential voters also presents a close question.  But in face of the lack of more definitive guidance from the Supreme Court, we conclude that this eminently political question has been left to the political process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, the judgement of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also contended that the plan violated constitutional requirements regarding ballot secrecy, the right to petition for redress of grievances, the right to freely assemble, and the right of political association.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2637</span></span> (1995).  However, as Justice Kennedy had been at pains to highlight, summary affirmance is not an endorsement of a lower court's reasoning, see Bush, 116 S.Ct. at 1971 (Kennedy, concurring),  and the concept as described in DeWitt seems to us open to abuse.  However, regardless of its merits when applied to an ordinary districting decision, functional compactness as applied here merely signals acceptance of reality.  Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, the fact that the City chose to use this term does not indicate that they had abandoned traditional districting principles.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The mathematical models generally used attempt to quantify departures from compactness by, for example, drawing a circle around the district's center or connecting the district's borders with an imaginary string.  The district's deviation from this benchmark is then analyzed.  Such techniques may or may not be probative when applied to areas in which external boundaries play a minor role.  However, they certainly would need adjustment before being accepted when applied to a case such a Houston, or for that matter possibly Rhode Island.  If not, the report will reflect massive deviations from compactness caused by factors beyond the legislature's control.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also challenge districts C, D and A.  District D is, on the whole, overwhelmingly compact and regular.  While the district does taper sharply to the north before widening again near its apex, this feature hardly detracts from its overall cohesiveness.  District C has regular borders with District D.  Its irregularities occur in its borders with districts G and F.  Like  C itself, G and F are \"white\" \"Anglo\" districts (G is 79% \"Anglo;\" F is 41.74% \"Anglo,\" 12.49% \"Asian,\" 25.36% \"Hispanic\" and 4.68% \"Black\"); and the plaintiffs have never explained how these irregularities can be understood as a racial gerrymander--they have not shown that the areas affected had any special racial significance.  On this record, all that the distortions in these districts show is that deviations from compactness may occur in racially innocuous contexts.  Once the shape of the City is taken into account, deviations from compactness in District A arise only from the intrusion of an arm of District H, and thus the question of District A merges into the inquiry into District H's shape and demographics.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> City council elections are at least formally nonpartisan.

Here, we are particularly troubled by Dr. Maggiotto's reliance on the category of \"industry of employment.\"  To expect that any large district will be characterized by a single, or a few, industries of employment is problematic, since we have generally left behind the era of mill town and mining towns.  And a mailroom clerk in a bank will not necessarily enjoy a community of interest with its lending  officers.  An area such as Silicon Valley may be an exception to this, and the category may be highly relevant when analyzing congressional districts to quantify urban and rural areas.  See Miller, 115 S.Ct. at 2484, 2490.  But applied to Houston, this seems a remarkably unprobative tool.

Conceptual difficulties are presented in evaluating retrogression under section 5 when no minority-majority districts are present to act as a baseline.  See Reno v.

While the drawing of a flawless alternative is not necessary to mount a Shaw suit, and we recognize the difficulties private litigants may have in doing so, it would certainly have helped under the circumstances.  Faced with a choice between a comprehensive plan that was supported by several independent justifications and the plaintiffs' response--a map of the City showing Kingwood and its environs in District B, with no indication of the boundary shifts that would follow--it would not be surprising if the Council members imagined a worst-case scenario in regards to disruption (or the possible effects on their own district).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs have introduced the affidavits of two members of the Council who were opposed to the plan.  The affidavits do not purport to relate incriminating conversations or statements made by proponents of the plan that would serve to demonstrate the majority's intent--they merely state the dissident Council Members' personal opinions.  And their opinion that race predominated, while no doubt deeply held, cannot demonstrate the impermissible intent of the majority.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> One piece of evidence that might have proven extremely helpful for the plaintiffs' case in this regard would be transcripts of Council debates surrounding the adoption of the prior plans.  While the 1997 debate is in the record, the earlier ones are not.  Had those debates been as open and detailed as the 1997 record, they perhaps could have proven decisive against summary disposition here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> Presumably, there is a platonic ideal form covering each of the traditional districting principles, and they will not always overlap.  For example, adherence to administrative boundaries will by its very nature subvert mathematical compactness, since these units are not uniform.  When a factor is legitimately raised, it will always in a sense subordinate other factors--the raising of political concerns will interfere with compactness or communities of interest or race.  If, after a plan was laboriously crafted, a Council member objected on the grounds that it severed his residence from his district, and changes were then made, this rejection and alteration of the plan would show that political concerns were a factor.  But the fact that a finished plan was rejected would not in and of itself show that this political input predominated.  One or more other factors would surely be sacrificed, but not only the political concern that drove it but also other factors might be advanced.  Ultimate approval of the change might be based not only on the grounds that led to it being proposed, but also because of the other interests it advanced.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., id. at 1385 \". . . the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis.

At the time the basic outlines of the districts were constructed, the City claims that it believed that there might be a revision of the census, and thus predominantly minority districts were undersized  to prevent them from later being viewed as oversized. Based on the limited information in the record and the City's statement, it appears clear that this undersizing was not based on any scientific measurement designed to correct for perceived flaws in the census.  Nor was it applied equally to the minority population--only minorities living in certain districts were affected.  Had it been shown that the City's districts breached the ten percent threshold when either of these manipulations were removed or when they were applied properly to all minorities in the City, the City's hasty and unscientific methods to adjust the census might well have created a violation.  However, plaintiffs have not shown, or even claimed, that this is the case.  And even if the ten percent de minimis threshold is not viewed as an absolute bar, we cannot say on this sparse record that a reasonable fact finder could find that the City's decisions here evidenced the \"bad faith, arbitrariness, or invidious discrimination\" courts have required in cases involving variations under ten percent.

The voting rights protections of the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Sixth Amendments are restricted to \"citizens,\" as is section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ' 1973.

Moreover, the Equal Protection Clause has been construed to in most cases preclude the denial of the franchise to citizens by means of property ownership or similar qualifications for voting.  See, e.g., Kramer v. Union Free School District, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107971\"><a href=\"/opinion/107971/kramer-v-union-free-school-dist-no-15/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In these circumstances, it is, at the very least, counter-intuitive to say that the Equal Protection Clause mandates that the right of citizens to vote be diluted to the extent necessary to prevent dilution of a representational right, unmentioned in the Constitution, of aliens who have no right to vote.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> See Footprints at 103-104 (noting proposals to use citizenship as a benchmark faced opposition from northern states with large alien populations that might imperil passage); 145 (relating speech of Senator Hendricks on February 16, 1866, in which he claimed opposition of New England to proposal to use eligible voters rather than total population was grounded in part in the relative preponderance of women in those states); 415 (reviewing debate on proposed language of section 2 basing representation on citizenship, in which representative from New England argued its omission of 2.1 million unnaturalized foreigners would unjustly weaken the North, while proponent argued that a citizen of Massachusetts should not \"be entitled to vote on behalf of unnaturalized foreigners who happened to live in Massachusetts\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p>The evidence suggests that proponents of absolute electoral equality compromised this principle in order to assure passage of the amendment.

Voting qualifications were whatever was specified by each state for the most numerous branch of its legislature.  With ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment on December 6, 1865, all were \"free persons,\" so the former slave states would presumably have increased representation in Congress despite still denying the vote to African-Americans.  This problem, which faced Congress in late 1865 and the first part of 1866, could be addressed in different ways.  Denial of the right to vote on grounds of race could be expressly proscribed.  That route was taken in the Fifteenth Amendment, but not in the Fourteenth.  Representation in the federal House could beallocated among the states on the basis of the number of potentially eligible voters.  That choice, too, was rejected.  The solution ultimately adopted in the Fourteenth Amendment was to retain the existing structure of Article 1, section 2-including the right of the states to prescribe voting qualifications and the entitlement of each state to at least one Representative-while eliminating the \"three fifths\" clause and providing for a proportional reduction in the federal House representational base of any state to the extent \"the right to vote\" (in federal or most state elections) was \"denied\" (except for rebellion or other crime) to adult male \"citizens\" of the state.  The essential focus of the debates was on two matters: allocating representation of the states in the United States House of Representatives, and the right of African-Americans to vote.  It was not on any general representational as opposed to electoral equality theory of government.  Both Footprints and Justice Harlan's dissent in Reynolds make plain that the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, as reflected in its legislative history, was to continue to leave electoral and representational rights in the control of the states to the same extent as they had been before the Civil War except that a state's representation in the federal House of Representatives would be subject to reduction on account of denial by it of \"the right to vote\" of its adult, male \"citizens.\"  While the majestic and open-ended generality of the Equal Protection Clause must be assumed to have justified Reynolds' failure to accord controlling significance to this legislative history, that majestic generality casts no meaningful light whatever on whether the states were thereby commanded to chose undiluted representational equality over undiluted electoral equality, or vice versa, where one or the other must be diluted, or were essentially left as free to make that choice as they had previously been.</p>\n        <p>Plaintiffs make no argument that state law or the Houston City Charter mandates use of CVA population.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
