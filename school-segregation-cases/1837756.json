If the school board at some future date adopts an assignment plan which violates section 1705, or which reinstates policies underlying discriminatory site selection, or which in any other respect is alleged to be the renewal of a purpose to segregate students on a prohibited basis, then a civil action can be commenced to correct the alleged violation, and upon a finding that a violation exists, a remedial decree would be entirely proper.  Nothing in this opinion forecloses the possibility of such future action.  To the extent the district court found, however, that if released from its jurisdiction the Board intended to adopt a neighborhood schools policy which would violate the mandates of section 1705, such a finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
