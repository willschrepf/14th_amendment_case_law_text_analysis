Resulting from a\nnationwide campaign to force Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to increase\nhealth insurance benefits for its 16,000 Maryland employees, the\nAct’s minimum spending provision was crafted to cover just Wal-\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  5\nMart. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, of which Wal-Mart is\na member, brought suit against James D. Fielder, Jr., the Maryland\nSecretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, to declare that the Act\nis preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974 (\"ERISA\") and to enjoin the Act’s enforcement. On cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court entered judgment\ndeclaring that the Act is preempted by ERISA and therefore not\nenforceable, and this appeal followed.\n\n   Because Maryland’s Fair Share Health Care Fund Act effectively\nrequires employers in Maryland covered by the Act to restructure\ntheir employee health insurance plans, it conflicts with ERISA’s goal\nof permitting uniform nationwide administration of these plans. We\nconclude therefore that the Maryland Act is preempted by ERISA and\naccordingly affirm.\n\n                                   I\n\n   Before enactment of the Fair Share Health Care Fund Act (\"Fair\nShare Act\"), 2006 Md. Laws 1, Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 8.5-\n101 to -107, the Maryland General Assembly heard extensive testi-\nmony about the rising costs of the Maryland Medical Assistance Pro-\ngram (Medicaid and children’s health programs). It learned that\nbetween fiscal years 2003 and 2006, annual expenditures on the Pro-\ngram increased from $3.46 billion to $4.7 billion. The General\nAssembly also perceived that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a particularly\nlarge employer, provided its employees with a substandard level of\nhealthcare benefits, forcing many Wal-Mart employees to depend on\nstate-subsidized healthcare programs. Indeed, the Maryland Depart-\nment of Legislative Services (which has the duties of providing the\nMaryland General Assembly with research, analysis, assessments, and\nevaluations of legislative issues) prepared an analytical report of the\nproposed Fair Share Act for the General Assembly, that discussed\nonly Wal-Mart’s employee benefits practices. In the background por-\ntion of the report, the Department of Legislative Services wrote:\n\n    Several States, facing rapidly-increasing Medicaid costs, are\n    turning to the private sector to bear more of the costs. Wal-\n    Mart, in particular, has been the focus of several states, who\n    are accusing the company of providing substandard health\n\f6               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\n    benefits to its employees. According to the New York Times,\n    Wal-Mart full-time employees earn an average $1,200 a\n    month, or about $8 an hour.\n\n    Some states claim many Wal-Mart employees end up on\n    public health programs such as Medicaid. A survey by\n    Georgia officials found that more than 10,000 children of\n    Wal-Mart employees were enrolled in the state’s children’s\n    health insurance program (CHIP) at a cost of nearly $10\n    million annually. Similarly, a North Carolina hospital found\n    that 31% of 1,900 patients who said they were Wal-Mart\n    employees were enrolled in Medicaid, and an additional\n    16% were uninsured.\n\n    As a result, some States have turned to Wal-Mart to assume\n    more of the financial burden of its workers’ health care\n    costs. California passed a law in 2003 that will require most\n    employers to either provide health coverage to employees or\n    pay into a state insurance pool that would do so. Advocates\n    of the law say Wal-Mart employees cost California health\n    insurance programs about $32 million annually. Washington\n    state is exploring implementing a similar state law.\n\n    According to the [New York] Times, Wal-Mart said that its\n    employees are mostly insured, citing internal surveys show-\n    ing that 90% of workers have health coverage, often through\n    Medicare or family members’ policies. Wal-Mart officials\n    say the company provides health coverage to about 537,000,\n    or 45% of its total workforce. As a matter of comparison,\n    Costco Wholesale provides health insurance to 96% of eligi-\n    ble employees.\n\n   In response, the General Assembly enacted the Fair Share Act in\nJanuary 2006, to become effective January 1, 2007. The Act applies\nto employers that have at least 10,000 employees in Maryland, Md.\nCode Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 8.5-102, and imposes spending and\nreporting requirements on such employers. The core provision pro-\nvides:\n\n    An employer that is not organized as a nonprofit organiza-\n    tion and does not spend up to 8% of the total wages paid to\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                 7\n    employees in the State on health insurance costs shall pay\n    to the Secretary an amount equal to the difference between\n    what the employer spends for health insurance costs and an\n    amount equal to 8% of the total wages paid to employees in\n    the State.\n\nId. § 8.5-104(b). An employer that fails to make the required payment\nis subject to a civil penalty of $250,000. Id. § 8.5-105(b).\n\n   The Act also requires a covered employer to submit an annual\nreport on January 1 of each year to the Secretary, in which the\nemployer must disclose: (1) how many employees it had for the prior\nyear, (2) its \"health insurance costs,\" and (3) the percentage of com-\npensation it spent on \"health insurance costs\" for the \"year immedi-\nately preceding the previous calendar year.\" Id. § 8.5-103(a)(1). The\nAct defines \"health insurance costs\" to include expenditures on both\nhealthcare and health insurance to the extent that they are deductible\nunder § 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Id. § 8.5-101.\n\n   Any payments collected by the Secretary are directed to the Fair\nShare Health Care Fund, which is held by the Treasurer of the State\nand accounted for by the State Comptroller like all other state funds.\nMd. Code Ann., Health-Gen. § 15-142(d), (g). The funds so collected,\nhowever, may be used only to support the Maryland Medical Assis-\ntance Program, which consists of Maryland’s Medicaid and children’s\nhealth programs. Id. § 15-142(f).\n\n   The record discloses that only four employers have at least 10,000\nemployees in Maryland: Johns Hopkins University, Giant Food, Nor-\nthrop Grumman, and Wal-Mart. The Fair Share Act subjected Johns\nHopkins, as a nonprofit organization, to a lower 6% spending thresh-\nold which Johns Hopkins already satisfies. Giant Food, which\nemploys unionized workers, spends over the 8% threshold on health\ninsurance and lobbied in support of the Fair Share Act. Northrop\nGrumman, a defense contractor, was subject to the minimum spend-\ning requirement in an earlier version of the Act, but the General\nAssembly included an amendment that effectively excluded Northrop\nGrumman. Because Northrop Grumman has many high-salaried\nemployees in Maryland, the General Assembly was able to exclude\nit by an amendment that permits an employer, in calculating its total\n\f8                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nwages paid, to exempt compensation paid to employees in excess of\nthe median household income in Maryland. See Md. Code Ann., Lab.\n& Empl. § 8.5-103(b)(1). The parties agree that only Wal-Mart, who\nemploys approximately 16,000 in Maryland, is currently subject to\nthe Act’s minimum spending requirements. Wal-Mart representatives\ntestified that it spends about 7 to 8% of its total payroll on healthcare,\nfalling short of the Act’s 8% threshold.\n\n   The legislative record also makes clear that legislators and affected\nparties assumed that the Fair Share Act would force Wal-Mart to\nincrease its spending on healthcare benefits rather than to pay monies\nto the State. For example, one of the Act’s sponsors, Senator Thomas\nV. Mike Miller, Jr., Maryland Senate President, described the Act\nduring a floor debate: \"It takes people who should be getting health\nbenefits at work off the [State’s] rolls and it requires those employers\nto provide it.\" Floor Debate on Senate Bill 790, 2006 Leg., 421st\nSess., (Md. Jan. 12, 2006) (emphasis added).\n\n   Shortly after enactment of the Fair Share Act, the Retail Industry\nLeaders Association (\"RILA\") commenced this action against the\nMaryland Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation to declare\nthe Act preempted by ERISA and to enjoin the Secretary from enforc-\ning it. RILA is a trade association whose members are major compa-\nnies from all segments of retailing, including Wal-Mart, as well as\nmany of Wal-Mart’s competitors, such as Best Buy Company, Target\nCorporation, Lowe’s Companies, and IKEA. Many of these competi-\ntors are represented on RILA’s board, which voted unanimously to\nauthorize RILA to prosecute this action.\n\n   RILA’s complaint alleged that the Fair Share Act was preempted\nby ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144. It also alleged that the Fair Share Act\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution and the \"special law\" prohibition of the\nMaryland Constitution, art. III, § 33.\n\n   Shortly after filing its complaint, RILA filed a motion for summary\njudgment on its ERISA-preemption claim and its equal-protection\nclaim. In response, the Secretary filed a motion to dismiss RILA’s\ncomplaint for lack of jurisdiction, arguing (1) that RILA lacked stand-\ning; (2) that its claims were not ripe; and (3) that its complaint was\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                       9\nbarred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, which prohibits\nfederal courts in most cases from enjoining, suspending, or restraining\na State’s collection of taxes. In the alternative, the Secretary filed a\ncross-motion for summary judgment addressing all three of RILA’s\nclaims.\n\n   The district court rejected the Secretary’s jurisdictional arguments\nand concluded that ERISA preempted the Fair Share Act because the\nAct effectively mandated that employers spend a minimum amount\non healthcare benefit plans. The court also found that the Fair Share\nAct did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the Act’s\nclassifications were not irrational. Each party appealed, challenging\nthe rulings adverse to it.\n\n                                     II\n\n   We address first the Secretary’s jurisdictional challenges based on\nstanding, ripeness, and the Tax Injunction Act.\n\n                                     A\n\n   While RILA does not assert injury to itself, it claims \"associational\nstanding\" to enforce the rights of its members. See Hunt v. Washing-\nton State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 345 (1977)\n(authorizing the standing of an association when (a) its members\nwould otherwise have standing1 to sue in their own right; (b) the inter-\nests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and\n(c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the par-\nticipation of individual members in the lawsuit\"). Associational stand-\ning may exist even when just one of the association’s members would\nhave standing. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975)\n(explaining that an \"association must allege that its members, or any\none of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury\" (emphasis\nadded)).\n  1\n   The well-known criteria for standing are that the plaintiff must allege\nan (1) injury in fact (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s conduct\nand (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v.\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); Allen v. Wright, 468\nU.S. 737, 751 (1984).\n\f10               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\n   The Secretary argues first that no member of RILA has standing to\nsue in its own right because the injuries claimed in this case are not\nsufficiently imminent. He notes that the Fair Share Act is not yet\neffective and that he has not yet promulgated regulations implement-\ning the Act.\n\n   To be sure, the alleged injury must, for standing purposes, be \"con-\ncrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. But \"one does not have to\nawait the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventative\nrelief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough.\" Friends of\nthe Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Cooper Recycling Corp., 204 F.3d 149, 160\n(4th Cir. 2000) (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union,\n442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)).\n\n   In this case, if Wal-Mart’s injury is not actual, it is certainly\nimpending. First, RILA alleges, and the district court concluded, that\nWal-Mart’s healthcare spending falls below 8% of its total wages.\nAccordingly, Wal-Mart faces the imminent injury of being forced\neither to increase its healthcare spending by January 1, 2007, or to\nmake a payment to the Secretary. Second, the Fair Share Act’s report-\ning requirements impose administrative burdens on Wal-Mart even\nnow. According to Wal-Mart’s Director of United States Benefits\nDesign, Wal-Mart presently administers its healthcare plans on a\nnationwide basis and does not specifically track its expenditures for\nMaryland employees. Thus, the Act will force Wal-Mart to alter its\ninternal accounting practices to acquire the information required for\nthe report that is due on January 1, 2007, and to incur expenses now\nin preparing and filing it with the Secretary. Finally, the Act’s mini-\nmum spending provision will hamper Wal-Mart’s ability to adminis-\nter its employee benefit plans in a uniform manner across the nation.\nSee N.Y. State Conf. of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers\nIns. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 658-59 (1999) (describing uniform plan\nadministration as a benefit that ERISA gives to employers).\n\n   The Secretary also argues, focusing only on the 8% threshold\nspending requirement, that Wal-Mart’s alleged injury is merely \"hy-\npothetical\" because it is not certain that Wal-Mart’s healthcare expen-\nditures fall below 8%. To make this argument, the Secretary lifted out\nof context a fragment from the testimony of a Wal-Mart representa-\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   11\ntive given before a legislative committee that Wal-Mart’s healthcare\nspending \"could be at 10 or 12 percent, but we don’t know.\" In the\nnext breath, however, the representative stated, \"Based off the defini-\ntions under this bill, we took plenty of time — Lisa Woods spent\nplenty of time researching the different areas of law . . . we believe\nwe do fall at 7 or 8%.\" At least four Wal-Mart representatives testi-\nfied before a legislative committee or by affidavit that Wal-Mart\nspends below 8% of its total payroll on healthcare. If the Secretary\nseriously does not believe that Wal-Mart spends below 8% on health-\ncare benefits, then he second-guesses the General Assembly which\nfocused on this fact as the reason to enact the Fair Share Act in the\nfirst place.\n\n   Seeking to undermine RILA’s satisfaction of another element nec-\nessary for associational standing, the Secretary contends that the\nnature of RILA’s suit requires that at least one of its members, Wal-\nMart, participate in the lawsuit, thus destroying the basis for RILA’s\nassociational standing. See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 435. This argument is\nsomewhat peculiar because the Secretary has maintained that the Act\nis not special legislation directed at Wal-Mart. Even so, based on the\nnature of the action actually filed and the relief sought, we see little,\nif any, need for Wal-Mart or any other RILA member to present indi-\nvidualized proof. RILA’s two challenges to the Fair Share Act — pre-\nemption under ERISA and violation of the Equal Protection Clause\n— require the court to make judgments regarding the nature and oper-\nation of the Act generally and require no findings of fact regarding\nthe specific operations of Wal-Mart or other RILA members. While\nthe Secretary may wish to challenge the suggestion that Wal-Mart’s\nhealthcare spending fails to satisfy the 8% threshold, such a challenge\nwould still not address the other injuries in fact sustained by Wal-\nMart, as we discussed above. Nor does the relief requested depend\nupon proofs particular to individual members. Unlike a suit for money\ndamages, which would require examination of each member’s unique\ninjury, this action seeks a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief,\nthe type of relief for which associational standing was originally rec-\nognized. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 515.\n\n   Finally, the Secretary argues that associational standing is not\nappropriate because various RILA members supposedly have con-\nflicting interests. See Md. Highways Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Mary-\n\f12               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nland, 933 F.2d 1246, 1252-53 (4th Cir. 1991). In Maryland Highways\nContractors, an association of contractors challenged a Maryland pro-\ngram that preferred businesses owned primarily by minorities in\nawarding state procurement contracts. Id. at 1248. We explained that\nassociational standing was not appropriate \"when conflicts of interest\namong members of the association require that the members must join\nthe suit individually in order to protect their own interests.\" Id. at\n1252. That case, however, is readily distinguishable from this one.\nWhile RILA members do compete in the marketplace, they uniformly\nendorsed the present litigation. RILA’s board includes representatives\nfrom numerous competitors of Wal-Mart, including Best Buy Com-\npany, IKEA, and Target Corporation, and the board voted unani-\nmously to prosecute this action. Unlike Maryland Highways\nContractors, id. (noting that no minority-owned businesses were rep-\nresented on the association’s board and that the board did not inform\nits membership of the suit), this case presents no hint that RILA’s\nboard authorized this suit without the knowledge or support of any\nRILA member or faction.\n\n   At bottom, the prudential considerations of the Hunt test for associ-\national standing do not counsel against permitting RILA to bring this\nsuit, and we reject the Secretary’s challenge on that ground.\n\n                                   B\n\n   For reasons similar to those advanced to challenge RILA’s stand-\ning, the Secretary contends that RILA’s claims are not ripe for\nreview. He argues that because Wal-Mart is not certain to suffer\ninjury under the Fair Share Act, RILA’s action is not ripe. See Pacific\nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm’n,\n461 U.S. 190, 200 (1983) (noting the purpose of the ripeness doctrine\nis \"to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudica-\ntion, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over\nadministrative policies\").\n\n   A ripeness review consists of inquiries into \"the fitness of the\nissues for judicial decision\" and \"the hardship to the parties of with-\nholding court consideration.\" Pacific Gas & Elec., 461 U.S. at 201.\nAn issue is not fit for review if \"it rests upon contingent future events\nthat may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\"\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  13\nTexas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998). But if an issue is\n\"predominantly legal,\" not depending upon the potential occurrence\nof factual events, it is more likely to be found ripe. Pacific Gas &\nElec., 461 U.S. at 201.\n\n   As we have explained, Wal-Mart will very likely incur liability to\nthe State under the Act’s minimum spending provision and is cer-\ntainly subject to the reporting requirements. Accordingly, it must alter\nits internal accounting procedures and healthcare spending now to\ncomply with the Act. The Secretary’s argument that the issues are\nunripe because the regulations under the Act have not been promul-\ngated do not change this. Regulations could not alter the Act’s provi-\nsions, which clearly establish the healthcare spending and reporting\nrequirements that RILA claims are invalid. In addition, this appeal\npresents purely legal questions that, because of their certain applica-\nbility to Wal-Mart, are ripe for review. Accordingly, we also reject\nthe Secretary’s ripeness challenge.\n\n                                   C\n\n   Finally, the Secretary contends that this litigation is barred by the\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341. He characterizes the Fair Share\nAct as a state law that imposes a tax on employers. The district court\ndisagreed and concluded that the Fair Share Act constitutes a \"health-\ncare regulation,\" rather than a \"tax.\" We agree with the district court.\n\n   The Tax Injunction Act prohibits district courts from enjoining,\nsuspending, or restraining the assessment, levy, or collection of any\ntax under state law where, as the Act provides, \"a plain, speedy and\nefficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\" 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1341. Because the Tax Injunction Act is meant to prevent taxpayers\nfrom \"disrupting state government finances,\" Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S.\n88, 104 (2004), its applicability depends primarily on whether a given\nmeasure serves \"revenue raising purposes\" rather than \"regulatory or\npunitive purposes.\" See Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Caffrey, 205 F.3d\n130, 134 (4th Cir. 2000). The less a measure serves as a revenue-\nraising provision, the less likely it is protected by the Tax Injunction\nAct. See Hager v. City of W. Peoria, 84 F.3d 865, 870-72 (7th Cir.\n1996) (finding the Tax Injunction Act did not bar review of a provi-\n\f14               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nsion because \"the ordinances were passed to control certain activities,\nnot to raise revenues\").\n\n   While the Valero court provided various inquiries to help deter-\nmine whether a charge imposed by state law is a tax, i.e., primarily\na revenue-raising measure, or a fee or penalty, see Valero, 205 F.3d\nat 134 (\"(1) What entity imposes the charge; (2) what population is\nsubject to the charge; and (3) what purposes are served by the use of\nthe monies obtained by the charge\" ), we can readily conclude, with-\nout a seriatim analysis, that the Fair Share Act is not a tax provision.\nThere is overriding evidence that the Fair Share Act’s primary pur-\npose is to regulate employers’ healthcare spending, not to raise reve-\nnue. This becomes especially demonstrable in light of the\nimprobability that the Act will generate any revenue. Wal-Mart’s\nDirector of Benefits Design testified that Wal-Mart would increase its\nhealthcare spending rather than make payments to the State, denying\nthe State any revenue from the measure. The circumstances surround-\ning the Act’s enactment confirms that this is precisely the result that\nthe General Assembly intended. Particularly persuasive is the Depart-\nment of Legislative Services’ description of the Act in which it stated,\n\"To the extent large employers do not spend at least 6% or 8% on\nhealth insurance costs as required, Fair Share Health Care special\nfund’s revenues could increase from employers paying the difference\nbetween the required and actual amounts spent on health insurance\"\n(emphasis added). Thus, the official description of the Act as pre-\nsented to the General Assembly represented that it mandated that\nemployers provide a certain level of benefits, and only if they violated\nthat mandate would the State collect monies. Such a mechanism is a\nquintessential fee or penalty, not a tax.\n\n   The Secretary argues to the contrary by pointing to the fact that the\nFair Share Act itself declares its purpose to establish \"the Fair Share\nHealth Care Fund\" and that \"the purpose of the Fund is to support the\noperations of the [Maryland Medical Assistance] Program.\" 2006 Md.\nLaw 1. This superficial characterization, however, does not determine\nthe Act’s actual purpose and effect; its content and context do. We\nconclude that the Fair Share Act cannot be properly characterized as\na \"tax\" provision as that term is used in the Tax Injunction Act.\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                 15\n   In sum, we hold that RILA has standing; that RILA’s claim is ripe\nfor adjudication; and that RILA’s complaint is not barred by the Tax\nInjunction Act.\n\n                                  III\n\n   On the merits of whether ERISA preempts the Fair Share Act, the\nSecretary contends that the district court misunderstood the nature\nand effect of the Fair Share Act, erroneously finding that the Act\nmandates an employer’s provision of healthcare benefits and therefore\n\"relates to\" ERISA plans. The Secretary offers a different character-\nization of the Fair Share Act — one with which ERISA is not con-\ncerned. He describes the Act as \"part of the State’s comprehensive\nscheme for planning, providing, and financing health care for its citi-\nzens.\" In his view, the Act imposes a payroll tax on covered employ-\ners and offers them a credit against that tax for their healthcare\nspending. The revenue from this tax funds a Fair Share Health Care\nFund, which is used to offset the costs of Maryland’s Medical Assis-\ntance Program.\n\n   To resolve the question whether ERISA preempts the Fair Share\nAct, we consider first the scope of ERISA’s preemption provision, 29\nU.S.C. § 1144(a), and then the nature and effect of the Fair Share Act\nto determine whether it falls within the scope of ERISA’s preemption.\n\n                                  A\n\n   ERISA establishes comprehensive federal regulation of employers’\nprovision of benefits to their employees. It does not mandate that\nemployers provide specific employee benefits but leaves them free,\n\"for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare\nplans.\" Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U.S. 73, 78\n(1995). Instead, ERISA regulates the employee benefit plans that an\nemployer chooses to establish, setting \"various uniform standards,\nincluding rules concerning reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary\nresponsibility.\" Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 91 (1983).\n\n   The vast majority of healthcare benefits that an employer extends\nto its employees qualify as an \"employee welfare benefit plan,\" which\nERISA defines broadly as:\n\f16                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\n     any plan, fund, or program which . . . was established or is\n     maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants\n     or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or\n     otherwise, . . . medical, surgical, or hospital care or bene-\n     fits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability,\n     death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship\n     or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship\n     funds, or prepaid legal services . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1002(1) (emphasis added). While an employer’s one-time\ngrant of some benefit that requires no administrative scheme does not\nconstitute an ERISA \"plan,\" a grant of a benefit that occurs periodi-\ncally and requires the employer to maintain some ongoing administra-\ntive support generally constitutes a \"plan.\" See Fort Halifax Packing\nCo. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 12 (1987) (finding that a one-time sever-\nance payment upon a plant closing did not constitute an ERISA\n\"plan\" because it did not require a \"scheme\" of ongoing administra-\ntion); Elmore v. Cone Mills Corp., 23 F.3d 855, 861 (4th Cir. 1994)\n(en banc) (explaining that even an employer’s informal provision of\nbenefits may be a \"plan\"); cf. Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U.S. 107,\n115-16 (1989) (finding that ordinary vacation benefits, paid out of an\nemployer’s general assets like wages rather than out of a dedicated\nfund, do not qualify as an \"employee benefit plan\"). Because the defi-\nnition of an ERISA \"plan\" is so expansive, nearly any systematic pro-\nvision of healthcare benefits to employees constitutes a plan.\n\n   The primary objective of ERISA was to \"provide a uniform regula-\ntory regime over employee benefit plans.\" Aetna Health Inc. v.\nDavila, 542 U.S. 200, 208 (2004); see also Shaw, 463 U.S. at 98-100\n(reviewing the legislative history of ERISA’s preemption provision).\nTo accomplish this objective, § 514(a) of ERISA broadly preempts\n\"any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate\nto any employee benefit plan\" covered by ERISA. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1144(a) (emphasis added). This preemption provision aims \"to min-\nimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with con-\nflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal\nGovernment\" and to reduce \"the tailoring of plans and employer con-\nduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction.\" Ingersoll-\nRand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 142 (1990).\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   17\n   The language of ERISA’s preemption provision — covering all\nlaws that \"relate to\" an ERISA plan — is \"clearly expansive.\" Travel-\ners, 514 U.S. at 655. The Supreme Court has focused judicial analysis\nby explaining that a state law \"relates to\" an ERISA plan \"if it has a\nconnection with or reference to such a plan.\" Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97.\nBut even these terms, \"taken to extend to the furthest stretch of [their]\nindeterminacy,\" would have preemption \"never run its course.\" Trav-\nelers, 514 U.S. at 655. Accordingly, we do not rely on \"uncritical lit-\neralism\" but attempt to ascertain whether Congress would have\nexpected the Fair Share Act to be preempted. See id. at 656; Califor-\nnia Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., 519\nU.S. 316, 325 (1997). To make this determination, we look \"to the\nobjectives of the ERISA statute\" as well as \"to the nature of the effect\nof the state law on ERISA plans,\" Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325, recog-\nnizing that ERISA is not presumed to supplant state law, especially\nin cases involving \"fields of traditional state regulation,\" which\ninclude \"the regulation of matters of health and safety,\" De Buono v.\nNYSA-ILA Med. & Clinical Servs. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 814 n.8 (1997)\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n   Through application of these principles, the Supreme Court has\nheld that not all state healthcare regulations are equal for purposes of\nERISA preemption. States continue to enjoy wide latitude to regulate\nhealthcare providers. See, e.g., De Buono, 520 U.S. at 815-16\n(upholding a state tax on gross receipts for patient services at hospi-\ntals, residential healthcare facilities, and diagnostic and treatment cen-\nters); Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658-59 (upholding a state mandate that\nhospitals charge certain insurers at higher rates than Blue Cross &\nBlue Shield). And ERISA explicitly saves state regulations of insur-\nance companies from preemption. See 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A);\nMetro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 739-47 (1985).\nBut unlike laws that regulate healthcare providers and insurance com-\npanies, \"state laws that mandate[ ] employee benefit structures or their\nadministration\" are preempted by ERISA. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658.\nSuch state-imposed regulation of employers’ provision of employee\nbenefits conflict with ERISA’s goal of establishing uniform, nation-\nwide regulation of employee benefit plans. Id. at 657-58.\n\n  Thus, in Shaw, the Supreme Court held that ERISA preempted a\nNew York law requiring employers to structure their employee bene-\n\f18                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nfit plans to provide the same benefits for pregnancy-regulated disabil-\nities as for other disabilities. 463 U.S. at 97. A multi-state employer\ncould only comply with New York’s mandate by varying its benefits\nfor New York employees or by varying its benefits for all employees.\nSee Travelers, 514 U.S. at 657 (construing Shaw). In either event, the\nNew York law would interfere with the employer’s ability to adminis-\nter its ERISA plans uniformly on a nationwide basis. Id.\n\n    In line with Shaw, courts have readily and routinely found preemp-\ntion of state laws that act directly upon an employee benefit plan or\neffectively require it to establish a particular ERISA-governed bene-\nfit. See, e.g., Metro. Life, 471 U.S. at 739 (concluding that a Massa-\nchusetts law \"related to\" ERISA plans where it required an employer\nhealthcare fund that provided hospital expense benefits also to cover\nmental health expenses); American Med. Sec., Inc. v. Bartlett, 111\nF.3d 358, 360 (4th Cir. 1997) (striking down a Maryland statute that\nhad the \"purpose and effect\" of \"forc[ing] state-mandated health bene-\nfits on self-funded ERISA plans\"). Likewise, Shaw dictates that\nERISA preempt state laws that directly regulate employers’ contribu-\ntions to or structuring of their plans. See, e.g., Local Union 598 v. J.A.\nJones Constr. Co., 846 F.2d 1213, 1218 (9th Cir. 1988), aff’d mem.,\n488 U.S. 881 (1988) (striking a state law that mandated minimum\ncontributions to an apprenticeship training fund); Stone & Webster\nEngineering Corp. v. Ilsley, 690 F.2d 323, 328-29 (2d Cir. 1982),\naff’d mem., 463 U.S. 1220 (1983) (striking a Connecticut law that\nrequired an employer to provide health and life insurance to a former\nemployee receiving workers’ compensation).\n\n   A state law that directly regulates the structuring or administration\nof an ERISA plan is not saved by inclusion of a means for opting out\nof its requirements. See Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.S. 141, 150-51\n(2001). In Egelhoff, the Court held that ERISA preempted a Washing-\nton statute that voided the designation of a spouse as a beneficiary of\na nonprobate asset, including ERISA-governed life insurance policies.\nId. at 142-43. Its effect was to require plan administrators to \"pay\nbenefits to the beneficiaries chosen by state laws, rather than to those\nidentified in the plan documents.\" Id. at 147. Even though the statute\npermitted employers to opt out of the law with specific plan language,\nthe Court struck the law down under ERISA’s preemption provision\nbecause it still mandated that plan administrators \"either follow\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                    19\nWashington’s beneficiary designation scheme or alter the terms of\ntheir plans so as to indicate that they will not follow it.\" Id. at 150.\nAdditionally, a proliferation of laws like Washington’s would have\nundermined ERISA’s objective of sparing plan administrators the task\nof monitoring the laws of all 50 States and modifying their plan docu-\nments accordingly. Id. at 150-51.\n\n   In sum, a state law has an impermissible \"connection with\"2 an\nERISA plan if it directly regulates or effectively mandates some ele-\nment of the structure or administration of employers’ ERISA plans.\nOn the other hand, a state law that creates only indirect economic\nincentives that affect but do not bind the choices of employers or their\nERISA plans is generally not preempted. See Travelers, 514 U.S. at\n658. In deciding which of these principles is applicable, we assess the\neffect of a state law on the ability of ERISA plans to be administered\nuniformly nationwide. Even if a state law provides a route by which\nERISA plans can avoid the state law’s requirements, taking that route\nmight still be too disruptive of uniform plan administration to avoid\npreemption. See Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at 151.\n\n                                    B\n\n  We now consider the nature and effect of the Fair Share Act to\ndetermine whether it falls within ERISA’s preemption. At its heart,\n  2\n    A state law is preempted also if it contains a \"reference to\" an ERISA\nplan, the alternative characterization referred to in Shaw for finding that\nit \"relates to\" an ERISA plan. Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97. The district court\ndid not reach this issue because it found that preemption through the Fair\nShare Act’s \"connection with\" ERISA plans. Because of our ruling in\nthis opinion, we likewise do not reach the question. But we note that this\nstandard applies more narrowly to preempt state law, examining the text\nof the statute to determine whether its own terms bring ERISA plans\nunder its operation. See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325 (explaining that a\nstate law contains a \"reference to\" an ERISA plan if it \"acts immediately\nand exclusively upon ERISA plans\" or if \"the existence of ERISA plans\nis essential to the law’s operation\"); see also District of Columbia v.\nGreater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125, 128 (1992) (invalidat-\ning a law that required an employer \"who provides health insurance cov-\nerage for an employee\" to provide the equivalent insurance while the\nemployee was receiving workers compensation benefits).\n\f20                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nthe Fair Share Act requires every employer of 10,000 or more Mary-\nland employees to pay to the State an amount that equals the differ-\nence between what the employer spends on \"health insurance costs\"\n(which includes any costs \"to provide health benefits\") and 8% of its\npayroll. Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 8.5-101, 8.5-104. As Wal-\nMart noted by way of affidavit, it would not pay the State a sum of\nmoney that it could instead spend on its employees’ healthcare. This\nwould be the decision of any reasonable employer. Healthcare bene-\nfits are a part of the total package of employee compensation an\nemployer gives in consideration for an employee’s services. An\nemployer would gain from increasing the compensation it offers\nemployees through improved retention and performance of present\nemployees and the ability to attract more and better new employees.\nIn contrast, an employer would gain nothing in consideration of pay-\ning a greater sum of money to the State. Indeed, it might suffer from\nlower employee morale and increased public condemnation.\n\n   In effect, the only rational choice employers have under the Fair\nShare Act is to structure their ERISA healthcare benefit plans so as\nto meet the minimum spending threshold.3 The Act thus falls squarely\nunder Shaw’s prohibition of state mandates on how employers struc-\nture their ERISA plans. See Shaw, 463 U.S. at 96-97. Because the\nFair Share Act effectively mandates that employers structure their\nemployee healthcare plans to provide a certain level of benefits, the\nAct has an obvious \"connection with\" employee benefit plans and so\nis preempted by ERISA.\n\n   This view of the Fair Share Act is reinforced by the position of the\nState of Maryland itself. The Maryland General Assembly intended\nthe Act to have precisely this effect. As we noted in Part I, the context\nfor enactment of the Act, including the Department of Legislative\n  3\n    Theoretically, a covered employer whose healthcare spending for\nemployees falls short of the 8% minimum could, by other steps, avoid\nregulation without restructuring or altering the administration of its\nERISA plans. It could move plants from the State to bring its employee\nnumber under 10,000; it could reduce wages to increase the proportion\nof its payroll devoted to healthcare spending; it could violate the Act and\nincur a civil penalty; or it could leave the State altogether. But not even\nthe Secretary advances these arguments.\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                    21\nServices’ official description of it, shows that legislators and inter-\nested parties uniformly understood the Act as requiring Wal-Mart to\nincrease its healthcare spending. If this is not the Act’s effect, one\nwould have to conclude, which we do not, that the Maryland legisla-\nture misunderstood the nature of the bill that it carefully drafted and\ndebated. For these reasons, the amount that the Act prescribes for\npayment to the State is actually a fee or a penalty that gives the\nemployer an irresistible incentive to provide its employees with a\ngreater level of health benefits.\n\n   It is a stretch to claim, as the Secretary does, that the Fair Share Act\nis a revenue statute of general application. When it was enacted, the\nGeneral Assembly knew that it applied, and indeed intended that it\napply, to one employer in Maryland — Wal-Mart. The General\nAssembly designed the statute to avoid applying the 8% level to\nJohns Hopkins University; it knew that Giant Food was unionized and\nalready was providing more than 8%; and it amended the statute to\navoid including Northrop Grumman. Even as the statute is written, the\ncategory of employers employing 10,000 employees in Maryland\nincludes only four persons in Maryland and therefore could hardly be\nintended to function as a revenue act of general application.\n\n   While the Secretary argues that the Fair Share Act is designed to\ncollect funds for medical care under the Maryland Medical Assistance\nProgram, the core provision of the Act aims at requiring covered\nemployers to provide medical benefits to employees. The effect of\nthis provision will force employers to structure their recordkeeping\nand healthcare benefit spending to comply with the Fair Share Act.\nFunctioning in that manner, the Act would disrupt employers’ uni-\nform administration of employee benefit plans on a nationwide basis.\nAs Wal-Mart officials averred, Wal-Mart does not presently allocate\nits contributions to ERISA plans or other healthcare spending by\nState, and so the Fair Share Act would require it to segregate a sepa-\nrate pool of expenditures for Maryland employees.\n\n  This problem would not likely be confined to Maryland. As a result\nof similar efforts elsewhere to pressure Wal-Mart to increase its\nhealthcare spending, other States and local governments have adopted\nor are considering healthcare spending mandates that would clash\nwith the Fair Share Act. For example, two New York counties\n\f22               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nrecently adopted provisions to require Wal-Mart to spend an amount\non healthcare to be determined annually by an administrative agency.\nSee N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 22-506(c)(2); Suffolk County, N.Y., Reg.\nLocal Laws § 325-3. Similar legislation under consideration in Min-\nnesota calculates total wages, from which an employer’s minimum\nspending level is determined, with reference to Minnesota’s median\nhousehold income. See H.F. 3143, 84th Leg. Sess. (Minn. 2006). If\npermitted to stand, these laws would force Wal-Mart to tailor its\nhealthcare benefit plans to each specific State, and even to specific\ncities and counties. This is precisely the regulatory balkanization that\nCongress sought to avoid by enacting ERISA’s preemption provision.\nSee Shaw, 463 U.S. at 98-100.\n\n   The Secretary argues that the Act is not mandatory and therefore\ndoes not, for preemption purposes, have a \"connection with\"\nemployee benefit plans because it gives employers two options to\navoid increasing benefits to employees. An employer can, under the\nFair Share Act, (1) increase healthcare spending on employees in\nways that do not qualify as ERISA plans; or (2) refuse to increase\nbenefits to employees and pay the State the amount by which the\nemployer’s spending falls short of 8%. Because employers have these\nchoices, the Secretary argues, the Fair Share Act does not preclude\nWal-Mart from continuing its uniform administration of ERISA plans\nnationwide. He maintains that the Fair Share Act is more akin to the\nlaws upheld in Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658-59, and Dillingham, 519\nU.S. at 319, which merely created economic incentives that affected\nemployers’ choices while not effectively dictating their choice. This\nargument fails for several reasons.\n\n   First, the laws involved in Travelers and Dillingham are inapposite\nbecause they dealt with regulations that only indirectly regulated\nERISA plans. In Travelers, a New York law required hospitals to add\na surcharge to the fees they demanded from most insurance compa-\nnies, but the law exempted Blue Cross and Blue Shield from having\nto pay the surcharge. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658-59. The effect of the\nlaw was to make Blue Cross and Blue Shield a cheaper and more\nattractive option for ERISA-covered healthcare plans to purchase.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the law because it did not act directly\nupon employers or their plans but merely created \"an indirect eco-\nnomic influence\" on plans. Id. at 659. The New York law did not\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   23\n\"bind plan administrators to any particular choice.\" Id. Nor did this\nincentive to choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield \"preclude uniform admin-\nistrative practice\" on a nationwide basis. Id. The Court acknowledged,\nhowever, that a state law could produce such \"acute, albeit indirect,\neconomic effects . . . as to force an ERISA plan to adopt a certain\nscheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of\ninsurers\" and therefore be preempted by ERISA. Id. at 668. In short,\nwhile the state law in Travelers directly regulated hospitals’ charges\nto insurance companies, it only indirectly affected the prices ERISA\nplans would pay for insurance policies.\n\n   Likewise, in Dillingham, a California law directly regulated wages\nthat contractors paid to apprentices on public construction projects,\nwhich only indirectly affected ERISA-covered apprenticeship pro-\ngrams’ incentives to obtain state certification. 519 U.S. at 332-34. The\nlaw permitted contractors to pay apprentices a lower-than-prevailing\nwage if the apprentices participated in a state-certified apprentice pro-\ngram. Id. at 319-20. The effect of the law was to create an indirect\nincentive for ERISA-governed programs to obtain state certification.\nId. at 332-33. This incentive, the Court concluded, was not so strong\nthat it effectively eliminated the programs’ choice as to whether to\nseek state certification. Id. Noncertified apprentice programs were\nstill free to supply apprentices for private projects at no disadvantage\nand to supply apprentices for public projects with just a slight disad-\nvantage. Id. at 332. Accordingly, the Court upheld the prevailing\nwage law as more akin to the law in Travelers than to the law in\nShaw. Id. at 334.\n\n   In contrast, to Travelers and Dillingham, the Fair Share Act\ndirectly regulates employers’ structuring of their employee health\nbenefit plans. This tighter causal link between the regulation and\nemployers’ ERISA plans makes the Fair Share Act much more analo-\ngous to the regulations at issue in Shaw and Egelhoff, both of which\nwere found to be preempted by ERISA.\n\n   Second, the choices given in the Fair Share Act, on which the Sec-\nretary relies to argue that the Act is not a mandate on employers, are\nnot meaningful alternatives by which an employer can increase its\nhealthcare spending to comply with the Fair Share Act without affect-\ning its ERISA plans. It is true that an employer could maintain on-site\n\f24                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nmedical clinics, the expenditures for which would qualify as \"health\ninsurance costs\" under the Fair Share Act because they are deductible\nunder § 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. § 213(d);\nMd. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 8.5-101. At the same time, such\nexpenditures would not amount to the establishment of an \"employee\nwelfare benefit plan\" under ERISA. See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-1(c)(2).\nThe ERISA regulation, however, defines non-ERISA clinics quite\nnarrowly as \"the maintenance on the premises of an employer of facil-\nities for the treatment of minor injuries or illness or rendering first aid\nin case of accidents occurring during working hours.\" Id. And the\nDepartment of Labor strictly interprets the regulation not to cover a\nfacility that treats members of employees’ families or more than\n\"minor injuries.\" See Labor Dep’t Op. No. 83-35A, 1983 WL 22520\n(1983). Thus, qualifying clinics could not provide more than simple,\ncircumscribed care that would not involve substantial expenditures.\nThey simply would not be a serious means by which employers could\nincrease healthcare spending to comply with the Fair Share Act.\n\n   In addition to on-site medical clinics, employers could, under the\nFair Share Act, contribute to employees’ Health Savings Accounts as\na means of non-ERISA healthcare spending. Under federal tax law,\neligible individuals may establish and make pretax contributions to a\nHealth Savings Account and then use those monies to pay or reim-\nburse medical expenses. See 26 U.S.C. § 223. Employers’ contribu-\ntions to employees’ Health Savings Accounts qualify as healthcare\nspending for purposes of the Fair Share Act. See Md. Code Ann., Lab.\n& Empl. § 8.5-101(d)(2). This option of contributing to Health Sav-\nings Accounts, however, is available under only limited conditions,\nwhich undermine the impact of this option. For example, only if an\nindividual is covered under a high deductible health plan and no other\nmore comprehensive health plan is he eligible to establish a Health\nSavings Account. See 26 U.S.C. § 223(c)(1). This undoubtedly\nreduces greatly the pool of Wal-Mart employees who would be eligi-\nble to establish Health Savings Accounts. In addition, for an employ-\ner’s contribution to a Health Savings Account to be exempt from\nERISA, the Health Savings Account must be established voluntarily\nby the employee. See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Employee Benefits Sec.\nAdmin., Field Assistance Bulletin 2004-1. This would likely shrink\nfurther the potential for Health Savings Accounts contributions as\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  25\nmany employees would not undertake to establish Health Savings\nAccounts.\n\n   More importantly, even if on-site medical clinics and contributions\nto Health Savings Accounts were a meaningful avenue by which Wal-\nMart could incur non-ERISA healthcare spending, we would still con-\nclude that the Fair Share Act had an impermissible \"connection with\"\nERISA plans. The undeniable fact is that the vast majority of any\nemployer’s healthcare spending occurs through ERISA plans. Thus,\nthe primary subjects of the Fair Share Act are ERISA plans, and any\nattempt to comply with the Act would have direct effects on the\nemployer’s ERISA plans. If Wal-Mart were to attempt to utilize non-\nERISA health spending options to satisfy the Fair Share Act, it would\nneed to coordinate those spending efforts with its existing ERISA\nplans. For example, an individual would be eligible to establish a\nHealth Savings Account only if he is enrolled in a high deductible\nhealth plan. See 29 U.S.C. § 223(c)(1). In order for Wal-Mart to make\nwidespread contributions to Health Savings Accounts, it would have\nto alter its package of ERISA health insurance plans to encourage its\nemployees to enroll in one of its high deductible health plans. From\nthe employer’s perspective, the categories of ERISA and non-ERISA\nhealthcare spending would not be isolated, unrelated costs. Decisions\nregarding one would affect the other and thereby violate ERISA’s\npreemption provision.\n\n   Further, the Fair Share Act and a proliferation of similar laws in\nother jurisdictions would force Wal-Mart or any employer like it to\nmonitor these varying laws and manipulate its healthcare spending to\ncomply with them, whether by increasing contributions to its ERISA\nplans or navigating the narrow regulatory channel between the Fair\nShare Act’s definition of healthcare spending and ERISA’s definition\nof an employee benefit plan. In this way, the Fair Share Act is directly\nanalogous to the Washington State statute in Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at\n147-48, that revoked a spouse’s beneficiary designation upon divorce.\nEven though the Washington statute included an opt-out provision,\nthe Court held the law to be preempted because it required plan\nadministrators to \"maintain a familiarity with the laws of all 50 States\nso that they can update their plans as necessary to satisfy the opt-out\nrequirements of other, similar statutes.\" Id. at 151. The Fair Share Act\nlikewise would deny Wal-Mart the uniform nationwide administration\n\f26               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nof its healthcare plans by requiring it to keep an eye on conflicting\nstate and local minimum spending requirements and adjust its health-\ncare spending accordingly.\n\n   Perhaps recognizing the insufficiency of a non-ERISA healthcare\nspending option, the Secretary relies most heavily on its argument\nthat the Fair Share Act gives employers the choice of paying the State\nrather than altering their healthcare spending. The Secretary contends\nthat, in certain circumstances, it would be rational for an employer to\nchoose to do so. It conceives that an employer, whose healthcare\nspending comes close to the 8% threshold, may find it more cost-\neffective to pay the State the required amount rather than incur the\ncosts of altering the administration of its healthcare plans. The exis-\ntence of this stylized scenario, however, does nothing to refute the\nfact that in most scenarios, the Act would cause an employer to alter\nthe administration of its healthcare plans. Indeed, identifying the nar-\nrow conditions under which the Act would not force an employer to\nincrease its spending on healthcare plans only reinforces the conclu-\nsion that the overwhelming effect of the Act is to mandate spending\nincreases. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that Wal-\nMart representatives averred that Wal-Mart would in fact increase\nhealthcare spending rather than pay the State.\n\n  In short, the Fair Share Act leaves employers no reasonable choices\nexcept to change how they structure their employee benefit plans.\n\n   Because the Act directly regulates employers’ provision of health-\ncare benefits, it has a \"connection with\" covered employers’ ERISA\nplans and accordingly is preempted by ERISA.\n\n                                  IV\n\n   On its cross-appeal, RILA contends that the district court erred in\nfinding that the Fair Share Act does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause. Because we have concluded that the Fair Share Act is pre-\nempted by ERISA, we need not consider RILA’s equal-protection\nclaim.\n\n                                   V\n\n   The Maryland General Assembly, in furtherance of its effort to\nrequire Wal-Mart to spend more money on employee health benefits\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  27\nand thus reduce Wal-Mart’s employees’ reliance on Medicaid,\nenacted the Fair Share Act. Not disguised was Maryland’s purpose to\nrequire Wal-Mart to change, at least in Maryland, its employee bene-\nfit plans and how they are administered. This goal, however, directly\nclashes with ERISA’s preemption provision and ERISA’s purpose of\nauthorizing Wal-Mart and others like it to provide uniform health\nbenefits to its employees on a nationwide basis.\n\n   Were we to approve Maryland’s enactment solely for its noble pur-\npose, we would be leading a charge against the foundational policy\nof ERISA, and surely other States and local governments would fol-\nlow. As sensitive as we are to the right of Maryland and other States\nto enact laws of their own choosing, we are also bound to enforce\nERISA as the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" U.S. Const. art. VI.\n\n  The judgment of the district court is\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED.\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Maryland, like most states, is wrestling with explosive growth in\nthe cost of Medicaid. Innovative ideas for solving the funding crisis\nare required, and the federal government, as the co-sponsor of Medic-\naid, has consistently called upon the states to function as laboratories\nfor developing workable solutions. In response to this call and its own\nfunding predicament, Maryland enacted the Fair Share Health Care\nFund Act (Maryland Act or Act) in 2006 to require very large\nemployers, such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to assume greater responsi-\nbility for employee health insurance costs that are now shunted to\nMedicaid. I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion that the\nMaryland Act is preempted by ERISA. The Act offers a covered\nemployer the option to pay an assessment into a state fund that will\nsupport Maryland’s Medicaid program. Thus, the Act offers a means\nof compliance that does not impact ERISA plans, and it is not pre-\nempted.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   \"Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program financed by the\nstates and federal government\" that provides medical care for about\n\f28               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\n60 million Americans, a number made up of low-income adults and\ntheir dependent children. Nat’l Governors Ass’n & Nat’l Ass’n of\nState Budget Officers, The Fiscal Survey of States 4 (2006). Medicaid\nwas originally intended to provide help to the most vulnerable rather\nthan to a broader population of the working poor and their families.\nIn short, Congress intended for the Medicaid program to serve only\nas the \"payer of last resort.\" See S. Rep. No. 99-146, at 312-13 (1985),\nas reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 42, 279-80. Over time, however,\nMedicaid has become the payer of first resort for a large percentage\nof patients. In 2006 state and federal Medicaid spending totaled an\nestimated $320 billion. Medicaid — the fastest-growing expense for\nmany states — dominates the state budgeting process around the\ncountry. Program expenditures currently make up about twenty-two\npercent of total state spending annually, and these outlays are pro-\njected to grow at a rate of eight percent over the next decade. Already,\nbetween one-quarter and one-third of the states have experienced sig-\nnificant shortfalls in their annual Medicaid appropriations, suggesting\nthat those with lower incomes are being pushed to Medicaid at an\nunexpected (and alarming) rate.\n\n   The increase in Medicaid spending is caused in part by the decline\nin employer-sponsored health insurance. In Maryland’s words, Med-\nicaid \"has been transformed into a corporate subsidy, with taxpayer-\nfunded employee health care an integral component of [many] an\nemployer’s benefits program.\" Reply Br. of Appellant at 4. Wal-Mart,\nwhich is subject to the Maryland Act, is cited as a company that\nabuses the Medicaid program. \"Wal-Mart has more employees and\ndependents on subsidized Medicaid or similar programs than any\nother company nationwide.\" J.A. 321. A Georgia survey \"found that\nmore than 10,000 children of Wal-Mart employees were enrolled in\nthe state’s children’s health insurance program . . . at a cost of nearly\n$10 million annually.\" J.A. 89. Similarly, a study by a North Carolina\nhospital found that thirty-one percent of Wal-Mart employees were\nenrolled in Medicaid and an additional sixteen percent were unin-\nsured. In an internal company memo of fairly recent origin, Wal-Mart\nacknowledged that \"[t]wenty-seven percent of [its employees’] chil-\ndren are on [Medicaid],\" and an additional nineteen percent are unin-\nsured. J.A. 321.\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                 29\n                                  II.\n\n   Maryland has its own Medicaid funding crisis. The state’s Medical\nAssistance (Medicaid and children’s health) Program now consumes\nabout seventeen percent of the state general fund, and it is one of the\nfastest growing components of the budget. Maryland’s 2007 Medical\nAssistance expenditures are expected to total $4.7 billion. Over the\nnext five years the state’s Medicaid costs are projected to grow at a\nrate that exceeds growth in general fund revenues by about three per-\ncent. Increasing enrollment in the program is a contributing factor.\nEnrollment growth is being spurred by the continuing rise in the num-\nber of children qualifying for Medicaid due to low family income. As\nemployers drop or fail to offer affordable family health care coverage,\nmore and more children of low income employees are forced into\nMedicaid or other taxpayer-funded insurance. Rising health care costs\nand the increase in the number of uninsured residents of all ages are\nalso factors that accelerate the growth in Maryland’s Medicaid bud-\nget. Even though many of the uninsured may not qualify for Medic-\naid, they nevertheless drive up Medicaid costs under Maryland’s \"all-\npayor\" system. The all-payor system requires those who pay their\nhospital bills in Maryland to subsidize the cost of hospital care ren-\ndered to uninsured patients. The costs of treating those who cannot\npay are added into the state-approved rates charged to those who can\npay through insurance or other means. See Md. Code Ann. Health-\nGen. §§ 19-211, 214, 219. The all-payor rates rise as the number of\nuninsured persons increases. Medicaid, as a significant purchaser of\nmedical care in Maryland, is thus forced to bear an ever greater bur-\nden as the number of patients without employer-backed health insur-\nance increases.\n\n   Maryland’s annual Medicaid obligations are exceeding legislative\nappropriations by enormous sums. The shortfall in 2006 was esti-\nmated to be around $130 million. The state has made up the deficit\nin part by transferring money from other programs. Such stopgap\nmeasures, however, are becoming less sustainable with each passing\nmonth. To deal with the crisis, Maryland, like many other states, has\nsought new ways to constrain health care costs and generate addi-\ntional revenue for its Medicaid program.\n\n  The Maryland Act is part of the state’s effort to deal with the\nmounting funding pressures. The Act establishes the Fair Share\n\f30                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nHealth Care Fund to \"support the operations of the [Maryland Medi-\ncal Assistance] Program.\" Md. Code Ann. Health-Gen. § 15-142(c).\nThe fund will receive revenue from assessments on large employers\nthat fail to meet the Act’s spending requirements for health insurance.\nId. § 15-142(e). The Act requires each employer with 10,000 or more\nemployees in Maryland to submit an annual report specifying its\nMaryland employee number, the amount it spent on health insurance\nin Maryland, and the percentage of payroll it spent on health insur-\nance in the state. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. § 8.5-103. Currently,\nfour employers in Maryland are subject to the Act. A for-profit\nemployer, of which there are three, must spend eight percent or more\nof total wages on health insurance or pay the difference to the Secre-\ntary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. Id. § 8.5-104(b). Health\ninsurance costs include all tax deductible spending on employee\nhealth insurance or health care allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.\nId. § 8.5-101(d). Nothing in the Act demonstrates an intent to restrict\nits application solely to Wal-Mart.\n\n   The Act instructs the Secretary to place any revenue collected in\na special fund to defray the costs of Maryland’s Medicaid program.\nMd. Code Ann. Health-Gen. § 15-142. In this way, the Act will sup-\nport the state’s Medical Assistance Program either by directly defray-\ning Medicaid costs or by prompting covered employers to spend more\non employee health insurance.\n\n                                   III.\n\n   I agree with the majority that the claims asserted by the Retail\nIndustry Leaders Association (RILA) are justiciable, but not for all of\nthe same reasons. RILA has associational standing to sue because it\nalleges that one of its members, Wal-Mart, faces the imminent injury\nof being forced to comply with the Act’s reporting requirements and\neither to pay an assessment or to increase its spending on employee\nhealth insurance. This allegation is sufficient to satisfy the injury ele-\nment necessary for standing. There is thus no need to rely on RILA’s\nargument that the Act will injure Wal-Mart by impeding its ability to\nadminister its employee benefit plans in a uniform fashion. The Act\nwill not cause such an injury, as I explain later on.\n\n  My conclusion that this action is not barred by the Tax Injunction\nAct also rests on different reasons. The majority is wrong to charac-\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  31\nterize the Act’s stated revenue raising purpose as superficial. The Act\nlegitimately anticipates a potential revenue stream, despite making\navailable an alternative mode of compliance that does not generate\nrevenue. The Act’s revenue raising component is directly connected\nto the regulatory purpose of assessing employers that rely dispropor-\ntionately on state-subsidized programs to provide health care for their\nemployees.\n\n   \"To determine whether a particular charge is a ‘fee’ or a ‘tax,’ the\ngeneral inquiry is to assess whether the charge is for revenue raising\npurposes, making it a ‘tax,’ or for regulatory or punitive purposes,\nmaking it a ‘fee.’\" Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Caffrey, 205 F.3d 130,\n134 (4th Cir. 2000). An assessment is more likely to be a fee than a\ntax if it is imposed by an administrative agency, it is aimed at a small\ngroup rather than the public at large, and any revenue collected is\nplaced in a special fund dedicated to the purposes of the regulation.\nCollins Holding Corp. v. Jasper County, 123 F.3d 797, 800 (4th Cir.\n1997).\n\n   In this case the Act was passed by the legislature and has revenue\nraising potential. Other indicators suggest, however, that the Act’s\nassessment scheme is more in the nature of a regulatory fee than a tax.\nThe Act applies to a very small group — only four employers. The\nassessment may generate revenue, but its primary purpose is punitive\nin nature. It assesses employers that provide substandard health bene-\nfits or none at all. Any revenue collected serves to recoup costs\nincurred by the state due to such behavior; collections are not depos-\nited in the general fund. The regulatory purpose is further evidenced\nby the Act’s creation of a special fund administered by the Secretary\nof Labor, Licensing, and Regulation and dedicated to defraying the\nstate’s Medicaid costs. These characteristics show the significant dif-\nferences between the assessment imposed by the Act and a typical tax\nimposed on a large segment of the population and used to benefit the\ngeneral public. See Valero, 205 F.3d at 135. Because the assessment\nis not a tax, I therefore agree with the majority’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the Tax Injunction Act does not deprive the federal courts of\njurisdiction to consider this case.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   I respectfully dissent on the issue of ERISA preemption because\nthe Act does not force a covered employer to make a choice that\n\f32               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nimpacts an employee benefit plan. An employer can comply with the\nAct either by paying assessments into the special fund or by increas-\ning spending on employee health insurance. The Act expresses no\npreference for one method of Medicaid support or the other. As a\nresult, the Act is not preempted by ERISA.\n\n   ERISA supersedes \"any and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate\nto any employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). State laws \"relate\nto\" ERISA plans if they have a \"connection with\" or make \"reference\nto\" such plans. Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96-97\n(1983). The Maryland Act does neither.\n\n   A state statute has an impermissible connection with an ERISA\nplan when it requires the establishment of a plan, mandates particular\nemployee benefits, or impacts plan administration. See Fort Halifax\nPacking Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 14 (1987) (state can require one-\ntime, lump sum severance payments because they would not require\nthe establishment or maintenance of a plan); Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532\nU.S. 141, 147-50 (2001) (state cannot automatically revoke a benefi-\nciary designation of an ex-spouse in a plan policy); Shaw, 463 U.S.\nat 97, 100 (state cannot require ERISA plans to cover pregnancy).\nThe Act offers a compliance option that does not require an employer\nto maintain an ERISA plan, administer plans according to state-\nprescribed rules, or offer a certain level of ERISA benefits. Also, the\nAct does not contain an impermissible reference to ERISA plans. It\nallows an employer to maintain a uniform national plan, albeit at a\ncost. It is thus not the sort of law that Congress intended to preempt.\nIndeed, the Act is a legitimate response to congressional expectations\nthat states develop creative ways to deal with the Medicaid funding\nproblem.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   The Act does not compel an employer to establish or maintain an\nERISA plan in order to comply with its provisions. ERISA plan\nexpenditures are considered in the calculation of an employer’s total\nlevel of health insurance spending, but this factor does not create an\nimpermissible connection with an ERISA plan. See Burgio & Cam-\npofelice, Inc. v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Labor, 107 F.3d 1000, 1009 (2d\nCir. 1997); Keystone Chapter, Associated Builders & Contractors,\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                    33\nInc. v. Foley, 37 F.3d 945, 961 (3d Cir. 1994). The Act offers a com-\npliance option that is not predicated on the existence of an ERISA\nplan. Again, an employer may comply by paying an assessment into\nMaryland’s Fair Share Health Care Fund.\n\n                                    B.\n\n   The Act does not impede an employer’s ability to administer its\nERISA plans under nationally uniform provisions. A problem would\narise if the Act dictated a plan’s system for processing claims, paying\nbenefits, or determining beneficiaries. See Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at 147,\n150. But the Act does none of those things. The only aspect of the Act\nthat might impact plan administration is the requirement for reporting\ndata about Maryland employee numbers, payroll, and ERISA plan\nspending. However, any burden this requirement puts on plan admin-\nistration is simply too slight to trigger ERISA preemption. See Foley,\n37 F.3d at 963 (requiring employers to record benefits contributions\nwill not influence decisions about the structure of ERISA plans and\nso will not impede the administration of nationwide plans); see also\nMinn. Chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. v. Minn.\nDep’t of Labor & Industry, 866 F. Supp. 1244, 1247 (D. Minn. 1993)\n(\"The requirement of calculating [the cost of benefits] falls on the\nemployer itself, but does not place any administrative burden on the\nplan. The requirements of calculating costs and keeping records may\nsomewhat increase the cost of the benefits plans, but this incidental\nimpact on the plans need not lead to preemption.\").\n\n                                    C.\n\n   The Act does not mandate a certain level of ERISA benefits. A\nstatute that \"alters the incentives, but does not dictate the choices, fac-\ning ERISA plans\" is not preempted. Calif. Div. of Labor Standards\nEnforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc., 519 U.S. 316, 334\n(1997). The ERISA preemption provision allows for uniformity of\nadministration and coverage, but \"cost uniformity was almost cer-\ntainly not an object of pre-emption.\" N.Y. State Conference of Blue\nCross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 662\n(1995).\n\n   Under the Act employers have the option of either paying an\nassessment or increasing ERISA plan health insurance. This choice is\n\f34               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nreal. The assessment does not amount to an exorbitant fee that leaves\na large employer with no choice but to alter its ERISA plan offerings.\nSee id. at 664. According to Wal-Mart estimates, the company faces,\nat most, a potential assessment of one percent of its Maryland payroll.\nPaying the assessment would thus not be a financial burden that\nleaves Wal-Mart with a Hobson’s choice, that is, no real choice but\nto increase health insurance benefits. Wal-Mart contends that it would\nnever choose to pay the assessment when given the option of gaining\nemployee goodwill through increased benefits. To begin with, Wal-\nMart’s bald claim that it would increase benefits appears dubious.\nWal-Mart has not seen fit thus far to use comprehensive health insur-\nance as a means of generating employee goodwill. More important,\nWal-Mart’s claim that it would increase benefits rather than pay the\nfee is irrelevant because the choice to increase benefits is not com-\npelled by the Act. That choice would simply be a business judgment\nthat Wal-Mart is free to make. Indeed, an employer close to the\nrequired statutory percentage, such as Wal-Mart, may find it easier to\npay the assessment than to increase health insurance spending. So\nlong as the assessment is not so high as to make its selection finan-\ncially untenable, an employer may freely evaluate whether the ability\nto maintain current levels of health insurance spending is worth the\nprice of the assessment.\n\n   The majority attempts to distinguish Travelers and Dillingham by\ncontrasting the indirect regulation of ERISA plans in those cases with\nwhat it deems a direct regulation here. I disagree with the majority’s\nassertion that the Maryland Act directly regulates ERISA plans.\n\"Where a legal requirement may be easily satisfied through means\nunconnected to ERISA plans, and only relates to ERISA plans at the\nelection of an employer, it ‘affect[s] employee benefit plans in too\ntenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the\nlaw \"relates to\" the plan.’\" Foley, 37 F.3d at 960 (quoting Shaw, 463\nU.S. at 100 n. 21). Moreover, Travelers and Dillingham focused not\non nebulous distinctions between direct and indirect effects, but on\nestablishing a general rule for ERISA preemption that \"look[s] both\nto the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the\nstate law that Congress understood would survive as well as to the\nnature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\" Dillingham, 519\nU.S. at 325 (emphasis added) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\nThe statutes in Travelers and Dillingham were permissible regulations\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   35\nof ERISA plans primarily because they did not mandate a particular\nlevel of benefits or impact plan administration, not because of the\nnon-ERISA targets of the regulations. See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 664;\nDillingham, 519 U.S. at 332-33.\n\n   We must similarly focus our inquiry on any threat the Maryland\nAct poses to the purposes of the ERISA preemption provision rather\nthan on hazy distinctions between direct and indirect regulations. See\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 656. Congress generally does not intend to pre-\nempt acts in traditional areas of state regulation, such as health and\nsafety. De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical & Clinical Servs. Fund, 520\nU.S. 806, 813-14 (1997). The purpose of the Act, to relieve state\nMedicaid burdens and improve health care for low income residents,\nfalls into this category. Travelers and Dillingham demonstrate that so\nlong as the regulation impacts a traditional area of state concern, and\nemployers are left with an effective choice that avoids ERISA impli-\ncations, the regulation may stand.\n\n   Rather than fitting within the ERISA preemption target, the Mary-\nland Act is in line with Congress’s intention that states find innova-\ntive ways to solve the Medicaid funding crisis. Congress already\ndirects states to \"take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal\nliability of [and to seek reimbursement from] third parties (including\nhealth insurers . . . or other parties that are, by statute, contract, or\nagreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health\ncare item or service) to pay for care and services available under\n[Medicaid].\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) & (B). I recognize, of\ncourse, that the Maryland Act goes beyond this basic directive, but it\nis nevertheless a legitimate response to the consistent encouragement\nCongress has given to the states to find \"novel approaches\" and to\n\"develop innovative and effective solutions\" to deal with the worsen-\ning Medicaid funding problem. S. Rep. No. 99-146, at 462 (1985), as\nreprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 42, 421 (remarks of Sen. Orrin G.\nHatch); see also Travelers, 514 U.S. at 665 (recognizing that Con-\ngress has \"sought to encourage . . . state responses to growing health\ncare costs and the widely diverging availability of health services\").\n\n                                   D.\n\n   The Act also contains no impermissible reference to an ERISA\nplan. Such a reference occurs only when a statute explicitly refers to\n\f36              RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nor relies upon the existence of an ERISA plan. District of Columbia\nv. Greater Wash. Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125, 130 (1992) (statute pre-\nempted because it applied to \"health insurance coverage,\" which is an\nERISA plan). Obligations under the Act are tied to a covered employ-\ner’s level of tax deductible health insurance spending. The Act does\nnot make any explicit statement about ERISA plans or rely on their\nexistence.\n\n                                 E.\n\n   As the record makes clear, Maryland is being buffeted by escalat-\ning Medicaid costs. The Act is a permissible response to the problem.\nBecause a covered employer has the option to comply with the Act\nby paying an assessment — a means that is not connected to an\nERISA plan — I would hold that the Act is not preempted.\n\f",

Resulting from a\nnationwide campaign to force Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to increase\nhealth insurance benefits for its 16,000 Maryland employees, the\nAct’s minimum spending provision was crafted to cover just Wal-\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  5\nMart. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, of which Wal-Mart is\na member, brought suit against James D. Fielder, Jr., the Maryland\nSecretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, to declare that the Act\nis preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974 (\"ERISA\") and to enjoin the Act’s enforcement. On cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, the district court entered judgment\ndeclaring that the Act is preempted by ERISA and therefore not\nenforceable, and this appeal followed.\n\n   Because Maryland’s Fair Share Health Care Fund Act effectively\nrequires employers in Maryland covered by the Act to restructure\ntheir employee health insurance plans, it conflicts with ERISA’s goal\nof permitting uniform nationwide administration of these plans. We\nconclude therefore that the Maryland Act is preempted by ERISA and\naccordingly affirm.\n\n                                   I\n\n   Before enactment of the Fair Share Health Care Fund Act (\"Fair\nShare Act\"), 2006 Md. Laws 1, Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 8.5-\n101 to -107, the Maryland General Assembly heard extensive testi-\nmony about the rising costs of the Maryland Medical Assistance Pro-\ngram (Medicaid and children’s health programs). It learned that\nbetween fiscal years 2003 and 2006, annual expenditures on the Pro-\ngram increased from $3.46 billion to $4.7 billion. The General\nAssembly also perceived that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a particularly\nlarge employer, provided its employees with a substandard level of\nhealthcare benefits, forcing many Wal-Mart employees to depend on\nstate-subsidized healthcare programs. Indeed, the Maryland Depart-\nment of Legislative Services (which has the duties of providing the\nMaryland General Assembly with research, analysis, assessments, and\nevaluations of legislative issues) prepared an analytical report of the\nproposed Fair Share Act for the General Assembly, that discussed\nonly Wal-Mart’s employee benefits practices. In the background por-\ntion of the report, the Department of Legislative Services wrote:\n\n    Several States, facing rapidly-increasing Medicaid costs, are\n    turning to the private sector to bear more of the costs. Wal-\n    Mart, in particular, has been the focus of several states, who\n    are accusing the company of providing substandard health\n\f6               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\n    benefits to its employees. According to the New York Times,\n    Wal-Mart full-time employees earn an average $1,200 a\n    month, or about $8 an hour.\n\n    Some states claim many Wal-Mart employees end up on\n    public health programs such as Medicaid. A survey by\n    Georgia officials found that more than 10,000 children of\n    Wal-Mart employees were enrolled in the state’s children’s\n    health insurance program (CHIP) at a cost of nearly $10\n    million annually. Similarly, a North Carolina hospital found\n    that 31% of 1,900 patients who said they were Wal-Mart\n    employees were enrolled in Medicaid, and an additional\n    16% were uninsured.\n\n    As a result, some States have turned to Wal-Mart to assume\n    more of the financial burden of its workers’ health care\n    costs. California passed a law in 2003 that will require most\n    employers to either provide health coverage to employees or\n    pay into a state insurance pool that would do so. Advocates\n    of the law say Wal-Mart employees cost California health\n    insurance programs about $32 million annually. Washington\n    state is exploring implementing a similar state law.\n\n    According to the [New York] Times, Wal-Mart said that its\n    employees are mostly insured, citing internal surveys show-\n    ing that 90% of workers have health coverage, often through\n    Medicare or family members’ policies. Wal-Mart officials\n    say the company provides health coverage to about 537,000,\n    or 45% of its total workforce. As a matter of comparison,\n    Costco Wholesale provides health insurance to 96% of eligi-\n    ble employees.\n\n   In response, the General Assembly enacted the Fair Share Act in\nJanuary 2006, to become effective January 1, 2007. The Act applies\nto employers that have at least 10,000 employees in Maryland, Md.\nCode Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 8.5-102, and imposes spending and\nreporting requirements on such employers. The core provision pro-\nvides:\n\n    An employer that is not organized as a nonprofit organiza-\n    tion and does not spend up to 8% of the total wages paid to\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                 7\n    employees in the State on health insurance costs shall pay\n    to the Secretary an amount equal to the difference between\n    what the employer spends for health insurance costs and an\n    amount equal to 8% of the total wages paid to employees in\n    the State.\n\nId. § 8.5-104(b). An employer that fails to make the required payment\nis subject to a civil penalty of $250,000. Id. § 8.5-105(b).\n\n   The Act also requires a covered employer to submit an annual\nreport on January 1 of each year to the Secretary, in which the\nemployer must disclose: (1) how many employees it had for the prior\nyear, (2) its \"health insurance costs,\" and (3) the percentage of com-\npensation it spent on \"health insurance costs\" for the \"year immedi-\nately preceding the previous calendar year.\" Id. § 8.5-103(a)(1). The\nAct defines \"health insurance costs\" to include expenditures on both\nhealthcare and health insurance to the extent that they are deductible\nunder § 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Id. § 8.5-101.\n\n   Any payments collected by the Secretary are directed to the Fair\nShare Health Care Fund, which is held by the Treasurer of the State\nand accounted for by the State Comptroller like all other state funds.\nMd. Code Ann., Health-Gen. § 15-142(d), (g). The funds so collected,\nhowever, may be used only to support the Maryland Medical Assis-\ntance Program, which consists of Maryland’s Medicaid and children’s\nhealth programs. Id. § 15-142(f).\n\n   The record discloses that only four employers have at least 10,000\nemployees in Maryland: Johns Hopkins University, Giant Food, Nor-\nthrop Grumman, and Wal-Mart. The Fair Share Act subjected Johns\nHopkins, as a nonprofit organization, to a lower 6% spending thresh-\nold which Johns Hopkins already satisfies. Giant Food, which\nemploys unionized workers, spends over the 8% threshold on health\ninsurance and lobbied in support of the Fair Share Act. Northrop\nGrumman, a defense contractor, was subject to the minimum spend-\ning requirement in an earlier version of the Act, but the General\nAssembly included an amendment that effectively excluded Northrop\nGrumman. Because Northrop Grumman has many high-salaried\nemployees in Maryland, the General Assembly was able to exclude\nit by an amendment that permits an employer, in calculating its total\n\f8                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v.

The parties agree that only Wal-Mart, who\nemploys approximately 16,000 in Maryland, is currently subject to\nthe Act’s minimum spending requirements. Wal-Mart representatives\ntestified that it spends about 7 to 8% of its total payroll on healthcare,\nfalling short of the Act’s 8% threshold.\n\n   The legislative record also makes clear that legislators and affected\nparties assumed that the Fair Share Act would force Wal-Mart to\nincrease its spending on healthcare benefits rather than to pay monies\nto the State. For example, one of the Act’s sponsors, Senator Thomas\nV. Mike Miller, Jr., Maryland Senate President, described the Act\nduring a floor debate: \"It takes people who should be getting health\nbenefits at work off the [State’s] rolls and it requires those employers\nto provide it.\" Floor Debate on Senate Bill 790, 2006 Leg., 421st\nSess., (Md. Jan. 12, 2006) (emphasis added).\n\n   Shortly after enactment of the Fair Share Act, the Retail Industry\nLeaders Association (\"RILA\") commenced this action against the\nMaryland Secretary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation to declare\nthe Act preempted by ERISA and to enjoin the Secretary from enforc-\ning it. RILA is a trade association whose members are major compa-\nnies from all segments of retailing, including Wal-Mart, as well as\nmany of Wal-Mart’s competitors, such as Best Buy Company, Target\nCorporation, Lowe’s Companies, and IKEA. Many of these competi-\ntors are represented on RILA’s board, which voted unanimously to\nauthorize RILA to prosecute this action.\n\n   RILA’s complaint alleged that the Fair Share Act was preempted\nby ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144. It also alleged that the Fair Share Act\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution and the \"special law\" prohibition of the\nMaryland Constitution, art. III, § 33.\n\n   Shortly after filing its complaint, RILA filed a motion for summary\njudgment on its ERISA-preemption claim and its equal-protection\nclaim. In response, the Secretary filed a motion to dismiss RILA’s\ncomplaint for lack of jurisdiction, arguing (1) that RILA lacked stand-\ning; (2) that its claims were not ripe; and (3) that its complaint was\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                       9\nbarred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, which prohibits\nfederal courts in most cases from enjoining, suspending, or restraining\na State’s collection of taxes. In the alternative, the Secretary filed a\ncross-motion for summary judgment addressing all three of RILA’s\nclaims.\n\n   The district court rejected the Secretary’s jurisdictional arguments\nand concluded that ERISA preempted the Fair Share Act because the\nAct effectively mandated that employers spend a minimum amount\non healthcare benefit plans. The court also found that the Fair Share\nAct did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the Act’s\nclassifications were not irrational. Each party appealed, challenging\nthe rulings adverse to it.\n\n                                     II\n\n   We address first the Secretary’s jurisdictional challenges based on\nstanding, ripeness, and the Tax Injunction Act.\n\n                                     A\n\n   While RILA does not assert injury to itself, it claims \"associational\nstanding\" to enforce the rights of its members.

FIELDER\n   The Secretary argues first that no member of RILA has standing to\nsue in its own right because the injuries claimed in this case are not\nsufficiently imminent. He notes that the Fair Share Act is not yet\neffective and that he has not yet promulgated regulations implement-\ning the Act.\n\n   To be sure, the alleged injury must, for standing purposes, be \"con-\ncrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. But \"one does not have to\nawait the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventative\nrelief. If the injury is certainly impending, that is enough.\" Friends of\nthe Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Cooper Recycling Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767710\"><a href=\"/opinion/767710/friends-of-the-earth-incorporated-citizens-local-environmental-action/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160\n(4th Cir. 2000) (quoting Babbitt v.

First, RILA alleges, and the district court concluded, that\nWal-Mart’s healthcare spending falls below 8% of its total wages.\nAccordingly, Wal-Mart faces the imminent injury of being forced\neither to increase its healthcare spending by January 1, 2007, or to\nmake a payment to the Secretary. Second, the Fair Share Act’s report-\ning requirements impose administrative burdens on Wal-Mart even\nnow. According to Wal-Mart’s Director of United States Benefits\nDesign, Wal-Mart presently administers its healthcare plans on a\nnationwide basis and does not specifically track its expenditures for\nMaryland employees. Thus, the Act will force Wal-Mart to alter its\ninternal accounting practices to acquire the information required for\nthe report that is due on January 1, 2007, and to incur expenses now\nin preparing and filing it with the Secretary. Finally, the Act’s mini-\nmum spending provision will hamper Wal-Mart’s ability to adminis-\nter its employee benefit plans in a uniform manner across the nation.\nSee N.Y. State Conf. of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers\nIns. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658-59 (1999) (describing uniform plan\nadministration as a benefit that ERISA gives to employers).\n\n   The Secretary also argues, focusing only on the 8% threshold\nspending requirement, that Wal-Mart’s alleged injury is merely \"hy-\npothetical\" because it is not certain that Wal-Mart’s healthcare expen-\nditures fall below 8%. To make this argument, the Secretary lifted out\nof context a fragment from the testimony of a Wal-Mart representa-\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   11\ntive given before a legislative committee that Wal-Mart’s healthcare\nspending \"could be at 10 or 12 percent, but we don’t know.\" In the\nnext breath, however, the representative stated, \"Based off the defini-\ntions under this bill, we took plenty of time — Lisa Woods spent\nplenty of time researching the different areas of law . . . we believe\nwe do fall at 7 or 8%.\" At least four Wal-Mart representatives testi-\nfied before a legislative committee or by affidavit that Wal-Mart\nspends below 8% of its total payroll on healthcare. If the Secretary\nseriously does not believe that Wal-Mart spends below 8% on health-\ncare benefits, then he second-guesses the General Assembly which\nfocused on this fact as the reason to enact the Fair Share Act in the\nfirst place.\n\n   Seeking to undermine RILA’s satisfaction of another element nec-\nessary for associational standing, the Secretary contends that the\nnature of RILA’s suit requires that at least one of its members, Wal-\nMart, participate in the lawsuit, thus destroying the basis for RILA’s\nassociational standing. See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 435. This argument is\nsomewhat peculiar because the Secretary has maintained that the Act\nis not special legislation directed at Wal-Mart. Even so, based on the\nnature of the action actually filed and the relief sought, we see little,\nif any, need for Wal-Mart or any other RILA member to present indi-\nvidualized proof. RILA’s two challenges to the Fair Share Act — pre-\nemption under ERISA and violation of the Equal Protection Clause\n— require the court to make judgments regarding the nature and oper-\nation of the Act generally and require no findings of fact regarding\nthe specific operations of Wal-Mart or other RILA members. While\nthe Secretary may wish to challenge the suggestion that Wal-Mart’s\nhealthcare spending fails to satisfy the 8% threshold, such a challenge\nwould still not address the other injuries in fact sustained by Wal-\nMart, as we discussed above. Nor does the relief requested depend\nupon proofs particular to individual members. Unlike a suit for money\ndamages, which would require examination of each member’s unique\ninjury, this action seeks a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief,\nthe type of relief for which associational standing was originally rec-\nognized. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 515.\n\n   Finally, the Secretary argues that associational standing is not\nappropriate because various RILA members supposedly have con-\nflicting interests. See Md. Highways Contractors Ass’n, Inc. v. Mary-\n\f12               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561795\"><a href=\"/opinion/561795/the-maryland-highways-contractors-association-incorporated-v-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1252-53 (4th Cir. 1991). In Maryland Highways\nContractors, an association of contractors challenged a Maryland pro-\ngram that preferred businesses owned primarily by minorities in\nawarding state procurement contracts. Id. at 1248. We explained that\nassociational standing was not appropriate \"when conflicts of interest\namong members of the association require that the members must join\nthe suit individually in order to protect their own interests.\" Id. at\n1252. That case, however, is readily distinguishable from this one.\nWhile RILA members do compete in the marketplace, they uniformly\nendorsed the present litigation. RILA’s board includes representatives\nfrom numerous competitors of Wal-Mart, including Best Buy Com-\npany, IKEA, and Target Corporation, and the board voted unani-\nmously to prosecute this action. Unlike Maryland Highways\nContractors, id. (noting that no minority-owned businesses were rep-\nresented on the association’s board and that the board did not inform\nits membership of the suit), this case presents no hint that RILA’s\nboard authorized this suit without the knowledge or support of any\nRILA member or faction.\n\n   At bottom, the prudential considerations of the Hunt test for associ-\national standing do not counsel against permitting RILA to bring this\nsuit, and we reject the Secretary’s challenge on that ground.\n\n                                   B\n\n   For reasons similar to those advanced to challenge RILA’s stand-\ning, the Secretary contends that RILA’s claims are not ripe for\nreview. He argues that because Wal-Mart is not certain to suffer\ninjury under the Fair Share Act, RILA’s action is not ripe. See Pacific\nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev.

But if an issue is\n\"predominantly legal,\" not depending upon the potential occurrence\nof factual events, it is more likely to be found ripe. Pacific Gas &\nElec., 461 U.S. at 201.\n\n   As we have explained, Wal-Mart will very likely incur liability to\nthe State under the Act’s minimum spending provision and is cer-\ntainly subject to the reporting requirements. Accordingly, it must alter\nits internal accounting procedures and healthcare spending now to\ncomply with the Act. The Secretary’s argument that the issues are\nunripe because the regulations under the Act have not been promul-\ngated do not change this. Regulations could not alter the Act’s provi-\nsions, which clearly establish the healthcare spending and reporting\nrequirements that RILA claims are invalid. In addition, this appeal\npresents purely legal questions that, because of their certain applica-\nbility to Wal-Mart, are ripe for review. Accordingly, we also reject\nthe Secretary’s ripeness challenge.\n\n                                   C\n\n   Finally, the Secretary contends that this litigation is barred by the\nTax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341. He characterizes the Fair Share\nAct as a state law that imposes a tax on employers. The district court\ndisagreed and concluded that the Fair Share Act constitutes a \"health-\ncare regulation,\" rather than a \"tax.\" We agree with the district court.\n\n   The Tax Injunction Act prohibits district courts from enjoining,\nsuspending, or restraining the assessment, levy, or collection of any\ntax under state law where, as the Act provides, \"a plain, speedy and\nefficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\" 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1341. Because the Tax Injunction Act is meant to prevent taxpayers\nfrom \"disrupting state government finances,\" Hibbs v. Winn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136987\"><a href=\"/opinion/136987/hibbs-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (2004), its applicability depends primarily on whether a given\nmeasure serves \"revenue raising purposes\" rather than \"regulatory or\npunitive purposes.\" See Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.

The less a measure serves as a revenue-\nraising provision, the less likely it is protected by the Tax Injunction\nAct. See Hager v. City of W.

FIELDER\nsion because \"the ordinances were passed to control certain activities,\nnot to raise revenues\").\n\n   While the Valero court provided various inquiries to help deter-\nmine whether a charge imposed by state law is a tax, i.e., primarily\na revenue-raising measure, or a fee or penalty, see Valero, 205 F.3d\nat 134 (\"(1) What entity imposes the charge; (2) what population is\nsubject to the charge; and (3) what purposes are served by the use of\nthe monies obtained by the charge\" ), we can readily conclude, with-\nout a seriatim analysis, that the Fair Share Act is not a tax provision.\nThere is overriding evidence that the Fair Share Act’s primary pur-\npose is to regulate employers’ healthcare spending, not to raise reve-\nnue. This becomes especially demonstrable in light of the\nimprobability that the Act will generate any revenue. Wal-Mart’s\nDirector of Benefits Design testified that Wal-Mart would increase its\nhealthcare spending rather than make payments to the State, denying\nthe State any revenue from the measure. The circumstances surround-\ning the Act’s enactment confirms that this is precisely the result that\nthe General Assembly intended. Particularly persuasive is the Depart-\nment of Legislative Services’ description of the Act in which it stated,\n\"To the extent large employers do not spend at least 6% or 8% on\nhealth insurance costs as required, Fair Share Health Care special\nfund’s revenues could increase from employers paying the difference\nbetween the required and actual amounts spent on health insurance\"\n(emphasis added). Thus, the official description of the Act as pre-\nsented to the General Assembly represented that it mandated that\nemployers provide a certain level of benefits, and only if they violated\nthat mandate would the State collect monies. Such a mechanism is a\nquintessential fee or penalty, not a tax.\n\n   The Secretary argues to the contrary by pointing to the fact that the\nFair Share Act itself declares its purpose to establish \"the Fair Share\nHealth Care Fund\" and that \"the purpose of the Fund is to support the\noperations of the [Maryland Medical Assistance] Program.\" 2006 Md.\nLaw 1. This superficial characterization, however, does not determine\nthe Act’s actual purpose and effect; its content and context do. We\nconclude that the Fair Share Act cannot be properly characterized as\na \"tax\" provision as that term is used in the Tax Injunction Act.\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                 15\n   In sum, we hold that RILA has standing; that RILA’s claim is ripe\nfor adjudication; and that RILA’s complaint is not barred by the Tax\nInjunction Act.\n\n                                  III\n\n   On the merits of whether ERISA preempts the Fair Share Act, the\nSecretary contends that the district court misunderstood the nature\nand effect of the Fair Share Act, erroneously finding that the Act\nmandates an employer’s provision of healthcare benefits and therefore\n\"relates to\" ERISA plans. The Secretary offers a different character-\nization of the Fair Share Act — one with which ERISA is not con-\ncerned. He describes the Act as \"part of the State’s comprehensive\nscheme for planning, providing, and financing health care for its citi-\nzens.\" In his view, the Act imposes a payroll tax on covered employ-\ners and offers them a credit against that tax for their healthcare\nspending. The revenue from this tax funds a Fair Share Health Care\nFund, which is used to offset the costs of Maryland’s Medical Assis-\ntance Program.\n\n   To resolve the question whether ERISA preempts the Fair Share\nAct, we consider first the scope of ERISA’s preemption provision, 29\nU.S.C. § 1144(a), and then the nature and effect of the Fair Share Act\nto determine whether it falls within the scope of ERISA’s preemption.\n\n                                  A\n\n   ERISA establishes comprehensive federal regulation of employers’\nprovision of benefits to their employees. It does not mandate that\nemployers provide specific employee benefits but leaves them free,\n\"for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare\nplans.\" Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.

See Travelers, 514 U.S. at\n658. In deciding which of these principles is applicable, we assess the\neffect of a state law on the ability of ERISA plans to be administered\nuniformly nationwide. Even if a state law provides a route by which\nERISA plans can avoid the state law’s requirements, taking that route\nmight still be too disruptive of uniform plan administration to avoid\npreemption. See Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at 151.\n\n                                    B\n\n  We now consider the nature and effect of the Fair Share Act to\ndetermine whether it falls within ERISA’s preemption. At its heart,\n  2\n    A state law is preempted also if it contains a \"reference to\" an ERISA\nplan, the alternative characterization referred to in Shaw for finding that\nit \"relates to\" an ERISA plan. Shaw, 463 U.S. at 97. The district court\ndid not reach this issue because it found that preemption through the Fair\nShare Act’s \"connection with\" ERISA plans. Because of our ruling in\nthis opinion, we likewise do not reach the question. But we note that this\nstandard applies more narrowly to preempt state law, examining the text\nof the statute to determine whether its own terms bring ERISA plans\nunder its operation. See Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325 (explaining that a\nstate law contains a \"reference to\" an ERISA plan if it \"acts immediately\nand exclusively upon ERISA plans\" or if \"the existence of ERISA plans\nis essential to the law’s operation\"); see also District of Columbia v.\nGreater Washington Bd. of Trade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112799\"><a href=\"/opinion/112799/district-of-columbia-v-greater-washington-bd-of-trade/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 (1992) (invalidat-\ning a law that required an employer \"who provides health insurance cov-\nerage for an employee\" to provide the equivalent insurance while the\nemployee was receiving workers compensation benefits).\n\f20                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nthe Fair Share Act requires every employer of 10,000 or more Mary-\nland employees to pay to the State an amount that equals the differ-\nence between what the employer spends on \"health insurance costs\"\n(which includes any costs \"to provide health benefits\") and 8% of its\npayroll. Md. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. §§ 8.5-101, 8.5-104. As Wal-\nMart noted by way of affidavit, it would not pay the State a sum of\nmoney that it could instead spend on its employees’ healthcare. This\nwould be the decision of any reasonable employer. Healthcare bene-\nfits are a part of the total package of employee compensation an\nemployer gives in consideration for an employee’s services. An\nemployer would gain from increasing the compensation it offers\nemployees through improved retention and performance of present\nemployees and the ability to attract more and better new employees.\nIn contrast, an employer would gain nothing in consideration of pay-\ning a greater sum of money to the State. Indeed, it might suffer from\nlower employee morale and increased public condemnation.\n\n   In effect, the only rational choice employers have under the Fair\nShare Act is to structure their ERISA healthcare benefit plans so as\nto meet the minimum spending threshold.3 The Act thus falls squarely\nunder Shaw’s prohibition of state mandates on how employers struc-\nture their ERISA plans. See Shaw, 463 U.S. at 96-97. Because the\nFair Share Act effectively mandates that employers structure their\nemployee healthcare plans to provide a certain level of benefits, the\nAct has an obvious \"connection with\" employee benefit plans and so\nis preempted by ERISA.\n\n   This view of the Fair Share Act is reinforced by the position of the\nState of Maryland itself. The Maryland General Assembly intended\nthe Act to have precisely this effect. As we noted in Part I, the context\nfor enactment of the Act, including the Department of Legislative\n  3\n    Theoretically, a covered employer whose healthcare spending for\nemployees falls short of the 8% minimum could, by other steps, avoid\nregulation without restructuring or altering the administration of its\nERISA plans. It could move plants from the State to bring its employee\nnumber under 10,000; it could reduce wages to increase the proportion\nof its payroll devoted to healthcare spending; it could violate the Act and\nincur a civil penalty; or it could leave the State altogether. But not even\nthe Secretary advances these arguments.\n\f                  RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                    21\nServices’ official description of it, shows that legislators and inter-\nested parties uniformly understood the Act as requiring Wal-Mart to\nincrease its healthcare spending. If this is not the Act’s effect, one\nwould have to conclude, which we do not, that the Maryland legisla-\nture misunderstood the nature of the bill that it carefully drafted and\ndebated. For these reasons, the amount that the Act prescribes for\npayment to the State is actually a fee or a penalty that gives the\nemployer an irresistible incentive to provide its employees with a\ngreater level of health benefits.\n\n   It is a stretch to claim, as the Secretary does, that the Fair Share Act\nis a revenue statute of general application. When it was enacted, the\nGeneral Assembly knew that it applied, and indeed intended that it\napply, to one employer in Maryland — Wal-Mart. The General\nAssembly designed the statute to avoid applying the 8% level to\nJohns Hopkins University; it knew that Giant Food was unionized and\nalready was providing more than 8%; and it amended the statute to\navoid including Northrop Grumman. Even as the statute is written, the\ncategory of employers employing 10,000 employees in Maryland\nincludes only four persons in Maryland and therefore could hardly be\nintended to function as a revenue act of general application.\n\n   While the Secretary argues that the Fair Share Act is designed to\ncollect funds for medical care under the Maryland Medical Assistance\nProgram, the core provision of the Act aims at requiring covered\nemployers to provide medical benefits to employees. The effect of\nthis provision will force employers to structure their recordkeeping\nand healthcare benefit spending to comply with the Fair Share Act.\nFunctioning in that manner, the Act would disrupt employers’ uni-\nform administration of employee benefit plans on a nationwide basis.\nAs Wal-Mart officials averred, Wal-Mart does not presently allocate\nits contributions to ERISA plans or other healthcare spending by\nState, and so the Fair Share Act would require it to segregate a sepa-\nrate pool of expenditures for Maryland employees.\n\n  This problem would not likely be confined to Maryland. As a result\nof similar efforts elsewhere to pressure Wal-Mart to increase its\nhealthcare spending, other States and local governments have adopted\nor are considering healthcare spending mandates that would clash\nwith the Fair Share Act. For example, two New York counties\n\f22               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nrecently adopted provisions to require Wal-Mart to spend an amount\non healthcare to be determined annually by an administrative agency.\nSee N.Y.C. Admin. Code § 22-506(c)(2); Suffolk County, N.Y., Reg.\nLocal Laws § 325-3. Similar legislation under consideration in Min-\nnesota calculates total wages, from which an employer’s minimum\nspending level is determined, with reference to Minnesota’s median\nhousehold income. See H.F. 3143, 84th Leg. Sess. (Minn. 2006). If\npermitted to stand, these laws would force Wal-Mart to tailor its\nhealthcare benefit plans to each specific State, and even to specific\ncities and counties. This is precisely the regulatory balkanization that\nCongress sought to avoid by enacting ERISA’s preemption provision.\nSee Shaw, 463 U.S. at 98-100.\n\n   The Secretary argues that the Act is not mandatory and therefore\ndoes not, for preemption purposes, have a \"connection with\"\nemployee benefit plans because it gives employers two options to\navoid increasing benefits to employees. An employer can, under the\nFair Share Act, (1) increase healthcare spending on employees in\nways that do not qualify as ERISA plans; or (2) refuse to increase\nbenefits to employees and pay the State the amount by which the\nemployer’s spending falls short of 8%. Because employers have these\nchoices, the Secretary argues, the Fair Share Act does not preclude\nWal-Mart from continuing its uniform administration of ERISA plans\nnationwide. He maintains that the Fair Share Act is more akin to the\nlaws upheld in Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658-59, and Dillingham, 519\nU.S. at 319, which merely created economic incentives that affected\nemployers’ choices while not effectively dictating their choice. This\nargument fails for several reasons.\n\n   First, the laws involved in Travelers and Dillingham are inapposite\nbecause they dealt with regulations that only indirectly regulated\nERISA plans. In Travelers, a New York law required hospitals to add\na surcharge to the fees they demanded from most insurance compa-\nnies, but the law exempted Blue Cross and Blue Shield from having\nto pay the surcharge. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 658-59. The effect of the\nlaw was to make Blue Cross and Blue Shield a cheaper and more\nattractive option for ERISA-covered healthcare plans to purchase.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the law because it did not act directly\nupon employers or their plans but merely created \"an indirect eco-\nnomic influence\" on plans. Id. at 659. The New York law did not\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   23\n\"bind plan administrators to any particular choice.\" Id. Nor did this\nincentive to choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield \"preclude uniform admin-\nistrative practice\" on a nationwide basis. Id. The Court acknowledged,\nhowever, that a state law could produce such \"acute, albeit indirect,\neconomic effects . . . as to force an ERISA plan to adopt a certain\nscheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of\ninsurers\" and therefore be preempted by ERISA. Id. at 668. In short,\nwhile the state law in Travelers directly regulated hospitals’ charges\nto insurance companies, it only indirectly affected the prices ERISA\nplans would pay for insurance policies.\n\n   Likewise, in Dillingham, a California law directly regulated wages\nthat contractors paid to apprentices on public construction projects,\nwhich only indirectly affected ERISA-covered apprenticeship pro-\ngrams’ incentives to obtain state certification. 519 U.S. at 332-34. The\nlaw permitted contractors to pay apprentices a lower-than-prevailing\nwage if the apprentices participated in a state-certified apprentice pro-\ngram. Id. at 319-20. The effect of the law was to create an indirect\nincentive for ERISA-governed programs to obtain state certification.\nId. at 332-33. This incentive, the Court concluded, was not so strong\nthat it effectively eliminated the programs’ choice as to whether to\nseek state certification. Id. Noncertified apprentice programs were\nstill free to supply apprentices for private projects at no disadvantage\nand to supply apprentices for public projects with just a slight disad-\nvantage. Id. at 332. Accordingly, the Court upheld the prevailing\nwage law as more akin to the law in Travelers than to the law in\nShaw. Id. at 334.\n\n   In contrast, to Travelers and Dillingham, the Fair Share Act\ndirectly regulates employers’ structuring of their employee health\nbenefit plans. This tighter causal link between the regulation and\nemployers’ ERISA plans makes the Fair Share Act much more analo-\ngous to the regulations at issue in Shaw and Egelhoff, both of which\nwere found to be preempted by ERISA.\n\n   Second, the choices given in the Fair Share Act, on which the Sec-\nretary relies to argue that the Act is not a mandate on employers, are\nnot meaningful alternatives by which an employer can increase its\nhealthcare spending to comply with the Fair Share Act without affect-\ning its ERISA plans. It is true that an employer could maintain on-site\n\f24                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nmedical clinics, the expenditures for which would qualify as \"health\ninsurance costs\" under the Fair Share Act because they are deductible\nunder § 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. § 213(d);\nMd. Code Ann., Lab. & Empl. § 8.5-101. At the same time, such\nexpenditures would not amount to the establishment of an \"employee\nwelfare benefit plan\" under ERISA. See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-1(c)(2).\nThe ERISA regulation, however, defines non-ERISA clinics quite\nnarrowly as \"the maintenance on the premises of an employer of facil-\nities for the treatment of minor injuries or illness or rendering first aid\nin case of accidents occurring during working hours.\" Id. And the\nDepartment of Labor strictly interprets the regulation not to cover a\nfacility that treats members of employees’ families or more than\n\"minor injuries.\" See Labor Dep’t Op. No. 83-35A, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22520</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1983). Thus, qualifying clinics could not provide more than simple,\ncircumscribed care that would not involve substantial expenditures.\nThey simply would not be a serious means by which employers could\nincrease healthcare spending to comply with the Fair Share Act.\n\n   In addition to on-site medical clinics, employers could, under the\nFair Share Act, contribute to employees’ Health Savings Accounts as\na means of non-ERISA healthcare spending. Under federal tax law,\neligible individuals may establish and make pretax contributions to a\nHealth Savings Account and then use those monies to pay or reim-\nburse medical expenses. See 26 U.S.C. § 223. Employers’ contribu-\ntions to employees’ Health Savings Accounts qualify as healthcare\nspending for purposes of the Fair Share Act. See Md. Code Ann., Lab.\n& Empl. § 8.5-101(d)(2). This option of contributing to Health Sav-\nings Accounts, however, is available under only limited conditions,\nwhich undermine the impact of this option. For example, only if an\nindividual is covered under a high deductible health plan and no other\nmore comprehensive health plan is he eligible to establish a Health\nSavings Account. See 26 U.S.C. § 223(c)(1). This undoubtedly\nreduces greatly the pool of Wal-Mart employees who would be eligi-\nble to establish Health Savings Accounts. In addition, for an employ-\ner’s contribution to a Health Savings Account to be exempt from\nERISA, the Health Savings Account must be established voluntarily\nby the employee. See U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Employee Benefits Sec.\nAdmin., Field Assistance Bulletin 2004-1. This would likely shrink\nfurther the potential for Health Savings Accounts contributions as\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  25\nmany employees would not undertake to establish Health Savings\nAccounts.\n\n   More importantly, even if on-site medical clinics and contributions\nto Health Savings Accounts were a meaningful avenue by which Wal-\nMart could incur non-ERISA healthcare spending, we would still con-\nclude that the Fair Share Act had an impermissible \"connection with\"\nERISA plans. The undeniable fact is that the vast majority of any\nemployer’s healthcare spending occurs through ERISA plans. Thus,\nthe primary subjects of the Fair Share Act are ERISA plans, and any\nattempt to comply with the Act would have direct effects on the\nemployer’s ERISA plans. If Wal-Mart were to attempt to utilize non-\nERISA health spending options to satisfy the Fair Share Act, it would\nneed to coordinate those spending efforts with its existing ERISA\nplans. For example, an individual would be eligible to establish a\nHealth Savings Account only if he is enrolled in a high deductible\nhealth plan. See 29 U.S.C. § 223(c)(1). In order for Wal-Mart to make\nwidespread contributions to Health Savings Accounts, it would have\nto alter its package of ERISA health insurance plans to encourage its\nemployees to enroll in one of its high deductible health plans. From\nthe employer’s perspective, the categories of ERISA and non-ERISA\nhealthcare spending would not be isolated, unrelated costs. Decisions\nregarding one would affect the other and thereby violate ERISA’s\npreemption provision.\n\n   Further, the Fair Share Act and a proliferation of similar laws in\nother jurisdictions would force Wal-Mart or any employer like it to\nmonitor these varying laws and manipulate its healthcare spending to\ncomply with them, whether by increasing contributions to its ERISA\nplans or navigating the narrow regulatory channel between the Fair\nShare Act’s definition of healthcare spending and ERISA’s definition\nof an employee benefit plan. In this way, the Fair Share Act is directly\nanalogous to the Washington State statute in Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at\n147-48, that revoked a spouse’s beneficiary designation upon divorce.\nEven though the Washington statute included an opt-out provision,\nthe Court held the law to be preempted because it required plan\nadministrators to \"maintain a familiarity with the laws of all 50 States\nso that they can update their plans as necessary to satisfy the opt-out\nrequirements of other, similar statutes.\" Id. at 151. The Fair Share Act\nlikewise would deny Wal-Mart the uniform nationwide administration\n\f26               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nof its healthcare plans by requiring it to keep an eye on conflicting\nstate and local minimum spending requirements and adjust its health-\ncare spending accordingly.\n\n   Perhaps recognizing the insufficiency of a non-ERISA healthcare\nspending option, the Secretary relies most heavily on its argument\nthat the Fair Share Act gives employers the choice of paying the State\nrather than altering their healthcare spending. The Secretary contends\nthat, in certain circumstances, it would be rational for an employer to\nchoose to do so. It conceives that an employer, whose healthcare\nspending comes close to the 8% threshold, may find it more cost-\neffective to pay the State the required amount rather than incur the\ncosts of altering the administration of its healthcare plans. The exis-\ntence of this stylized scenario, however, does nothing to refute the\nfact that in most scenarios, the Act would cause an employer to alter\nthe administration of its healthcare plans. Indeed, identifying the nar-\nrow conditions under which the Act would not force an employer to\nincrease its spending on healthcare plans only reinforces the conclu-\nsion that the overwhelming effect of the Act is to mandate spending\nincreases. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that Wal-\nMart representatives averred that Wal-Mart would in fact increase\nhealthcare spending rather than pay the State.\n\n  In short, the Fair Share Act leaves employers no reasonable choices\nexcept to change how they structure their employee benefit plans.\n\n   Because the Act directly regulates employers’ provision of health-\ncare benefits, it has a \"connection with\" covered employers’ ERISA\nplans and accordingly is preempted by ERISA.\n\n                                  IV\n\n   On its cross-appeal, RILA contends that the district court erred in\nfinding that the Fair Share Act does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause. Because we have concluded that the Fair Share Act is pre-\nempted by ERISA, we need not consider RILA’s equal-protection\nclaim.\n\n                                   V\n\n   The Maryland General Assembly, in furtherance of its effort to\nrequire Wal-Mart to spend more money on employee health benefits\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  27\nand thus reduce Wal-Mart’s employees’ reliance on Medicaid,\nenacted the Fair Share Act. Not disguised was Maryland’s purpose to\nrequire Wal-Mart to change, at least in Maryland, its employee bene-\nfit plans and how they are administered. This goal, however, directly\nclashes with ERISA’s preemption provision and ERISA’s purpose of\nauthorizing Wal-Mart and others like it to provide uniform health\nbenefits to its employees on a nationwide basis.\n\n   Were we to approve Maryland’s enactment solely for its noble pur-\npose, we would be leading a charge against the foundational policy\nof ERISA, and surely other States and local governments would fol-\nlow. As sensitive as we are to the right of Maryland and other States\nto enact laws of their own choosing, we are also bound to enforce\nERISA as the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" U.S. Const. art. VI.\n\n  The judgment of the district court is\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED.\n\nMICHAEL, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   Maryland, like most states, is wrestling with explosive growth in\nthe cost of Medicaid. Innovative ideas for solving the funding crisis\nare required, and the federal government, as the co-sponsor of Medic-\naid, has consistently called upon the states to function as laboratories\nfor developing workable solutions. In response to this call and its own\nfunding predicament, Maryland enacted the Fair Share Health Care\nFund Act (Maryland Act or Act) in 2006 to require very large\nemployers, such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to assume greater responsi-\nbility for employee health insurance costs that are now shunted to\nMedicaid. I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion that the\nMaryland Act is preempted by ERISA. The Act offers a covered\nemployer the option to pay an assessment into a state fund that will\nsupport Maryland’s Medicaid program. Thus, the Act offers a means\nof compliance that does not impact ERISA plans, and it is not pre-\nempted.\n\n                                   I.\n\n   \"Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program financed by the\nstates and federal government\" that provides medical care for about\n\f28               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\n60 million Americans, a number made up of low-income adults and\ntheir dependent children. Nat’l Governors Ass’n & Nat’l Ass’n of\nState Budget Officers, The Fiscal Survey of States 4 (2006). Medicaid\nwas originally intended to provide help to the most vulnerable rather\nthan to a broader population of the working poor and their families.\nIn short, Congress intended for the Medicaid program to serve only\nas the \"payer of last resort.\" See S. Rep. No. 99-146, at 312-13 (1985),\nas reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 42, 279-80. Over time, however,\nMedicaid has become the payer of first resort for a large percentage\nof patients. In 2006 state and federal Medicaid spending totaled an\nestimated $320 billion. Medicaid — the fastest-growing expense for\nmany states — dominates the state budgeting process around the\ncountry. Program expenditures currently make up about twenty-two\npercent of total state spending annually, and these outlays are pro-\njected to grow at a rate of eight percent over the next decade. Already,\nbetween one-quarter and one-third of the states have experienced sig-\nnificant shortfalls in their annual Medicaid appropriations, suggesting\nthat those with lower incomes are being pushed to Medicaid at an\nunexpected (and alarming) rate.\n\n   The increase in Medicaid spending is caused in part by the decline\nin employer-sponsored health insurance. In Maryland’s words, Med-\nicaid \"has been transformed into a corporate subsidy, with taxpayer-\nfunded employee health care an integral component of [many] an\nemployer’s benefits program.\" Reply Br. of Appellant at 4. Wal-Mart,\nwhich is subject to the Maryland Act, is cited as a company that\nabuses the Medicaid program. \"Wal-Mart has more employees and\ndependents on subsidized Medicaid or similar programs than any\nother company nationwide.\" J.A. 321. A Georgia survey \"found that\nmore than 10,000 children of Wal-Mart employees were enrolled in\nthe state’s children’s health insurance program . . . at a cost of nearly\n$10 million annually.\" J.A. 89. Similarly, a study by a North Carolina\nhospital found that thirty-one percent of Wal-Mart employees were\nenrolled in Medicaid and an additional sixteen percent were unin-\nsured. In an internal company memo of fairly recent origin, Wal-Mart\nacknowledged that \"[t]wenty-seven percent of [its employees’] chil-\ndren are on [Medicaid],\" and an additional nineteen percent are unin-\nsured. J.A. 321.\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                 29\n                                  II.\n\n   Maryland has its own Medicaid funding crisis. The state’s Medical\nAssistance (Medicaid and children’s health) Program now consumes\nabout seventeen percent of the state general fund, and it is one of the\nfastest growing components of the budget. Maryland’s 2007 Medical\nAssistance expenditures are expected to total $4.7 billion. Over the\nnext five years the state’s Medicaid costs are projected to grow at a\nrate that exceeds growth in general fund revenues by about three per-\ncent. Increasing enrollment in the program is a contributing factor.\nEnrollment growth is being spurred by the continuing rise in the num-\nber of children qualifying for Medicaid due to low family income. As\nemployers drop or fail to offer affordable family health care coverage,\nmore and more children of low income employees are forced into\nMedicaid or other taxpayer-funded insurance. Rising health care costs\nand the increase in the number of uninsured residents of all ages are\nalso factors that accelerate the growth in Maryland’s Medicaid bud-\nget. Even though many of the uninsured may not qualify for Medic-\naid, they nevertheless drive up Medicaid costs under Maryland’s \"all-\npayor\" system. The all-payor system requires those who pay their\nhospital bills in Maryland to subsidize the cost of hospital care ren-\ndered to uninsured patients. The costs of treating those who cannot\npay are added into the state-approved rates charged to those who can\npay through insurance or other means. See Md. Code Ann. Health-\nGen. §§ 19-211, 214, 219. The all-payor rates rise as the number of\nuninsured persons increases. Medicaid, as a significant purchaser of\nmedical care in Maryland, is thus forced to bear an ever greater bur-\nden as the number of patients without employer-backed health insur-\nance increases.\n\n   Maryland’s annual Medicaid obligations are exceeding legislative\nappropriations by enormous sums. The shortfall in 2006 was esti-\nmated to be around $130 million. The state has made up the deficit\nin part by transferring money from other programs. Such stopgap\nmeasures, however, are becoming less sustainable with each passing\nmonth. To deal with the crisis, Maryland, like many other states, has\nsought new ways to constrain health care costs and generate addi-\ntional revenue for its Medicaid program.\n\n  The Maryland Act is part of the state’s effort to deal with the\nmounting funding pressures. The Act establishes the Fair Share\n\f30                RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nHealth Care Fund to \"support the operations of the [Maryland Medi-\ncal Assistance] Program.\" Md. Code Ann. Health-Gen. § 15-142(c).\nThe fund will receive revenue from assessments on large employers\nthat fail to meet the Act’s spending requirements for health insurance.\nId. § 15-142(e). The Act requires each employer with 10,000 or more\nemployees in Maryland to submit an annual report specifying its\nMaryland employee number, the amount it spent on health insurance\nin Maryland, and the percentage of payroll it spent on health insur-\nance in the state. Md. Code Ann. Lab. & Empl. § 8.5-103. Currently,\nfour employers in Maryland are subject to the Act. A for-profit\nemployer, of which there are three, must spend eight percent or more\nof total wages on health insurance or pay the difference to the Secre-\ntary of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation. Id. § 8.5-104(b). Health\ninsurance costs include all tax deductible spending on employee\nhealth insurance or health care allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.\nId. § 8.5-101(d). Nothing in the Act demonstrates an intent to restrict\nits application solely to Wal-Mart.\n\n   The Act instructs the Secretary to place any revenue collected in\na special fund to defray the costs of Maryland’s Medicaid program.\nMd. Code Ann. Health-Gen. § 15-142. In this way, the Act will sup-\nport the state’s Medical Assistance Program either by directly defray-\ning Medicaid costs or by prompting covered employers to spend more\non employee health insurance.\n\n                                   III.\n\n   I agree with the majority that the claims asserted by the Retail\nIndustry Leaders Association (RILA) are justiciable, but not for all of\nthe same reasons. RILA has associational standing to sue because it\nalleges that one of its members, Wal-Mart, faces the imminent injury\nof being forced to comply with the Act’s reporting requirements and\neither to pay an assessment or to increase its spending on employee\nhealth insurance. This allegation is sufficient to satisfy the injury ele-\nment necessary for standing. There is thus no need to rely on RILA’s\nargument that the Act will injure Wal-Mart by impeding its ability to\nadminister its employee benefit plans in a uniform fashion. The Act\nwill not cause such an injury, as I explain later on.\n\n  My conclusion that this action is not barred by the Tax Injunction\nAct also rests on different reasons. The majority is wrong to charac-\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                  31\nterize the Act’s stated revenue raising purpose as superficial. The Act\nlegitimately anticipates a potential revenue stream, despite making\navailable an alternative mode of compliance that does not generate\nrevenue. The Act’s revenue raising component is directly connected\nto the regulatory purpose of assessing employers that rely dispropor-\ntionately on state-subsidized programs to provide health care for their\nemployees.\n\n   \"To determine whether a particular charge is a ‘fee’ or a ‘tax,’ the\ngeneral inquiry is to assess whether the charge is for revenue raising\npurposes, making it a ‘tax,’ or for regulatory or punitive purposes,\nmaking it a ‘fee.’\" Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Caffrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767851\"><a href=\"/opinion/767851/valero-terrestrial-corporation-lackawanna-transport-company-solid-waste/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n134 (4th Cir. 2000). An assessment is more likely to be a fee than a\ntax if it is imposed by an administrative agency, it is aimed at a small\ngroup rather than the public at large, and any revenue collected is\nplaced in a special fund dedicated to the purposes of the regulation.\nCollins Holding Corp. v. Jasper County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745394\"><a href=\"/opinion/745394/collins-holding-corporation-v-jasper-county-south-carolina-a-political/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (4th Cir.\n1997).\n\n   In this case the Act was passed by the legislature and has revenue\nraising potential. Other indicators suggest, however, that the Act’s\nassessment scheme is more in the nature of a regulatory fee than a tax.\nThe Act applies to a very small group — only four employers. The\nassessment may generate revenue, but its primary purpose is punitive\nin nature. It assesses employers that provide substandard health bene-\nfits or none at all. Any revenue collected serves to recoup costs\nincurred by the state due to such behavior; collections are not depos-\nited in the general fund. The regulatory purpose is further evidenced\nby the Act’s creation of a special fund administered by the Secretary\nof Labor, Licensing, and Regulation and dedicated to defraying the\nstate’s Medicaid costs. These characteristics show the significant dif-\nferences between the assessment imposed by the Act and a typical tax\nimposed on a large segment of the population and used to benefit the\ngeneral public. See Valero, 205 F.3d at 135. Because the assessment\nis not a tax, I therefore agree with the majority’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the Tax Injunction Act does not deprive the federal courts of\njurisdiction to consider this case.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n   I respectfully dissent on the issue of ERISA preemption because\nthe Act does not force a covered employer to make a choice that\n\f32               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nimpacts an employee benefit plan. An employer can comply with the\nAct either by paying assessments into the special fund or by increas-\ning spending on employee health insurance. The Act expresses no\npreference for one method of Medicaid support or the other. As a\nresult, the Act is not preempted by ERISA.\n\n   ERISA supersedes \"any and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate\nto any employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a). State laws \"relate\nto\" ERISA plans if they have a \"connection with\" or make \"reference\nto\" such plans. Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110993\"><a href=\"/opinion/110993/shaw-v-delta-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96-97\n(1983). The Maryland Act does neither.\n\n   A state statute has an impermissible connection with an ERISA\nplan when it requires the establishment of a plan, mandates particular\nemployee benefits, or impacts plan administration. See Fort Halifax\nPacking Co. v. Coyne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111901\"><a href=\"/opinion/111901/fort-halifax-packing-co-v-coyne/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1987) (state can require one-\ntime, lump sum severance payments because they would not require\nthe establishment or maintenance of a plan); Egelhoff v.

Also, the\nAct does not contain an impermissible reference to ERISA plans. It\nallows an employer to maintain a uniform national plan, albeit at a\ncost. It is thus not the sort of law that Congress intended to preempt.\nIndeed, the Act is a legitimate response to congressional expectations\nthat states develop creative ways to deal with the Medicaid funding\nproblem.\n\n                                  A.\n\n   The Act does not compel an employer to establish or maintain an\nERISA plan in order to comply with its provisions. ERISA plan\nexpenditures are considered in the calculation of an employer’s total\nlevel of health insurance spending, but this factor does not create an\nimpermissible connection with an ERISA plan.

A problem would\narise if the Act dictated a plan’s system for processing claims, paying\nbenefits, or determining beneficiaries. See Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at 147,\n150. But the Act does none of those things. The only aspect of the Act\nthat might impact plan administration is the requirement for reporting\ndata about Maryland employee numbers, payroll, and ERISA plan\nspending. However, any burden this requirement puts on plan admin-\nistration is simply too slight to trigger ERISA preemption. See Foley,\n37 F.3d at 963 (requiring employers to record benefits contributions\nwill not influence decisions about the structure of ERISA plans and\nso will not impede the administration of nationwide plans); see also\nMinn.

This choice is\n\f34               RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER\nreal. The assessment does not amount to an exorbitant fee that leaves\na large employer with no choice but to alter its ERISA plan offerings.\nSee id. at 664. According to Wal-Mart estimates, the company faces,\nat most, a potential assessment of one percent of its Maryland payroll.\nPaying the assessment would thus not be a financial burden that\nleaves Wal-Mart with a Hobson’s choice, that is, no real choice but\nto increase health insurance benefits. Wal-Mart contends that it would\nnever choose to pay the assessment when given the option of gaining\nemployee goodwill through increased benefits. To begin with, Wal-\nMart’s bald claim that it would increase benefits appears dubious.\nWal-Mart has not seen fit thus far to use comprehensive health insur-\nance as a means of generating employee goodwill. More important,\nWal-Mart’s claim that it would increase benefits rather than pay the\nfee is irrelevant because the choice to increase benefits is not com-\npelled by the Act. That choice would simply be a business judgment\nthat Wal-Mart is free to make. Indeed, an employer close to the\nrequired statutory percentage, such as Wal-Mart, may find it easier to\npay the assessment than to increase health insurance spending. So\nlong as the assessment is not so high as to make its selection finan-\ncially untenable, an employer may freely evaluate whether the ability\nto maintain current levels of health insurance spending is worth the\nprice of the assessment.\n\n   The majority attempts to distinguish Travelers and Dillingham by\ncontrasting the indirect regulation of ERISA plans in those cases with\nwhat it deems a direct regulation here. I disagree with the majority’s\nassertion that the Maryland Act directly regulates ERISA plans.\n\"Where a legal requirement may be easily satisfied through means\nunconnected to ERISA plans, and only relates to ERISA plans at the\nelection of an employer, it ‘affect[s] employee benefit plans in too\ntenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the\nlaw \"relates to\" the plan.’\" Foley, 37 F.3d at 960 (quoting Shaw, 463\nU.S. at 100 n. 21). Moreover, Travelers and Dillingham focused not\non nebulous distinctions between direct and indirect effects, but on\nestablishing a general rule for ERISA preemption that \"look[s] both\nto the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the\nstate law that Congress understood would survive as well as to the\nnature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\" Dillingham, 519\nU.S. at 325 (emphasis added) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\nThe statutes in Travelers and Dillingham were permissible regulations\n\f                 RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS v. FIELDER                   35\nof ERISA plans primarily because they did not mandate a particular\nlevel of benefits or impact plan administration, not because of the\nnon-ERISA targets of the regulations. See Travelers, 514 U.S. at 664;\nDillingham, 519 U.S. at 332-33.\n\n   We must similarly focus our inquiry on any threat the Maryland\nAct poses to the purposes of the ERISA preemption provision rather\nthan on hazy distinctions between direct and indirect regulations. See\nTravelers, 514 U.S. at 656. Congress generally does not intend to pre-\nempt acts in traditional areas of state regulation, such as health and\nsafety. De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical & Clinical Servs. Fund, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118119\"><a href=\"/opinion/118119/de-buono-v-nysa-ila-medical-and-clinical-services-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813-14 (1997). The purpose of the Act, to relieve state\nMedicaid burdens and improve health care for low income residents,\nfalls into this category. Travelers and Dillingham demonstrate that so\nlong as the regulation impacts a traditional area of state concern, and\nemployers are left with an effective choice that avoids ERISA impli-\ncations, the regulation may stand.\n\n   Rather than fitting within the ERISA preemption target, the Mary-\nland Act is in line with Congress’s intention that states find innova-\ntive ways to solve the Medicaid funding crisis. Congress already\ndirects states to \"take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal\nliability of [and to seek reimbursement from] third parties (including\nhealth insurers . . . or other parties that are, by statute, contract, or\nagreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health\ncare item or service) to pay for care and services available under\n[Medicaid].\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(25)(A) & (B). I recognize, of\ncourse, that the Maryland Act goes beyond this basic directive, but it\nis nevertheless a legitimate response to the consistent encouragement\nCongress has given to the states to find \"novel approaches\" and to\n\"develop innovative and effective solutions\" to deal with the worsen-\ning Medicaid funding problem. S. Rep. No. 99-146, at 462 (1985), as\nreprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 42, 421 (remarks of Sen.
