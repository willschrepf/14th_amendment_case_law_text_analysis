ZWICK,\n       Appellant\n\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania\n(Criminal Action No. 97-cr-00182-1)\n(District Judge: The Honorable William L.

Louis H. Pollak, Senior Judge of the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.\n\f       ROBERT S. CESSAR, ESQUIRE\n       [ARGUED]\n       Office of U.S. Attorney\n       633 U.S. Post Office & Courthouse\n       Pittsburgh, PA 15219\n       Counsel for Appellee\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge.\n\nIn this appeal, we are asked to construe 18 U.S.C.S 666,\na criminal provision entitled \"Theft or bribery concerning\nprograms receiving Federal funds\" (\"the Act\" or \"the\nstatute\"). Appellant James J. Zwick claims that the District\nCourt misinterpreted the statute when it upheld his three-\ncount conviction for bribery under S 666(a)(1)(B) without\nproof of a connection between the offense conduct and\nfederal funds or programming. We conclude that the\nDistrict Court erred in interpreting the statute in this\nrespect and will therefore remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Zwick also challenges the\nDistrict Court's failure to reduce his offense level by an\nadditional point for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(b). Because we find that the District Court\nerred in its application of this Guideline provision, we will\nvacate this aspect of the sentencing order and direct the\nDistrict Court on remand to award the additional one-point\nreduction if it determines that Zwick timely provided\ncomplete information to the government or timely notified\nthe government of his intent to plead guilty to enable the\ngovernment and court to conserve their resources.1\n\nI.\n\nAppellant James J. Zwick was an elected member of the\nRoss Township Board of Commissioners, the governing\nbody of Ross Township, Pennsylvania. Zwick and his fellow\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. We reject Zwick's remaining challenges to the application of the\nstatute to his particular situation, as we discuss more fully below.\n\n                               2\n\fcommissioners made policy decisions for the Township,\nincluding fixing salary levels, executing contracts,\nauthorizing bids, and adopting budgets. In November of\n1997, the government accused Zwick of abusing his\nposition to obtain illegal benefits and filed afive-count\nindictment charging him with three counts of theft or\nbribery concerning federal programs under 18 U.S.C.S 666,\none count of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. SS 2 & 1341, and\none count of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. SS 2 & 1344. The\nDistrict Court had jurisdiction over Zwick's case pursuant\nto 18 U.S.C. S 3231.\n\nInitial efforts at negotiating a guilty plea failed when the\ngovernment declined to accept a conditional plea, which\nwould have preserved Zwick's legal challenge to the\napplication of S 666 when there is no connection between a\ndefendant's conduct and federal funds or programming.\nAfter declining to accept the plea, the governmentfiled a\nsuperseding indictment, which contained all of the charges\nin the original indictment, and added another count of theft\nor bribery under S 666, another count of bank fraud, and\nthree more counts of mail fraud. Again, Zwick was willing\nto plead guilty to the bank fraud and mail fraud counts,\nbut continued to seek a conditional guilty plea on the S 666\ncounts. During a status conference on January 27, 1998,\nZwick informed the District Court of his intention to plead\nguilty to the fraud counts, and the District Court scheduled\nthe plea hearing for February 2, 1998. Further plea\nnegotiations were derailed, however, when articles appeared\nin the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and North Hills News Record\non January 28, 1998 and January 29, 1998, declaring that\nZwick would plead guilty to the fraud charges. Zwickfiled\na motion with the District Court to dismiss the indictment\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct, alleging that, by\nproviding information for the articles, the government had\nviolated its obligation to refrain from making extrajudicial\nstatements regarding the possibility of a guilty plea. The\nDistrict Court denied Zwick's motion. Zwick ultimately\nentered a guilty plea to the fraud counts on March 9, 1998.\n\nThe case against Zwick on the S 666 charges proceeded\nto trial on March 10, 1998, after a brief continuance so that\nZwick could enter treatment for his gambling addiction.\n\n                                3\n\fAlthough Zwick waived his right to a jury trial and\nrequested a bench trial, the government opposed this\nrequest, so the case was tried to a jury. Zwick was\nconvicted on counts one, two, and three of the four S 666\ncharges.\n\nBecause Zwick makes several challenges to the\nsufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction under\nS 666, we will review the relevant facts adduced at trial\nregarding the alleged bribes. In count one, the government\nalleged that Zwick solicited a bribe from Christopher Kaclik,\nthe owner and developer of the Shannopin Square II office\nbuilding located in Ohio Township. Kaclik first became\nassociated with Zwick in 1994, when he applied for sewer\naccess for the predecessor to Shannopin Square II,\nShannopin Square I. At that time, Kaclik testified that\nZwick told him \"anything you need to get done in the\nTownship of Ross, I can help you out.\" In May or June of\n1996, during the building of Shannopin Square II, Zwick\nmet with Kaclik at the development site and offered to\nsecure the necessary votes for approval of the sewer taps in\nexchange for a donation to the \"Men's Summer League for\nRoss Township,\" a basketball league run by Zwick. Kaclik\nwrote a check for $5,000, made out to \"James Zwick,\" with\na notation reading \"Men's Summer League 1996\nBasketball.\" At Zwick's suggestion, Kaclik also provided\nZwick with a blank check for $7,500, which Zwick falsely\nrepresented he would put toward the $17,500 required to\nreserve the sewer taps. When Kaclik discovered that Zwick\nhad personally endorsed and cashed the checks, he asked\nthat Zwick return the money. After repeated phone calls to\nZwick, Kaclik received $2,500 from Zwick.\n\nCount two involved Zwick's dealings with the Fosnights,\nwho had obtained an option on property in Zwick's ward in\nRoss Township to build and operate an assisted living\nfacility there. To complete their project, the Fosnights were\nrequired to obtain approval from the Ross Township Board\nof Commissioners for various permits, including a\nconditional use permit and site plan approval. On\nSeptember 9, 1996, after the Township Planning\nCommission had already recommended approval of the\nconditional use permit, the Board of Commissioners voted\n\n                               4\n\fto table the permit for further investigation. After that\nmeeting, Zwick contacted Tim Fosnight and set up a\nmeeting with him and his brother Aaron at the project site.\nZwick offered to help them obtain the required permits in\nexchange for a $15,000 donation to construct a playground\non the grounds of his \"pet\" project, North Hills Affordable\nHousing (\"NHAH\"). Zwick explained that he could require\nthe Fosnights to pay for a new traffic light and traffic\nstudies, which could involve significant costs of up to\n$100,000 and lead to considerable delay, but he would not\ndo so if such a \"donation\" was made.\n\nThe Fosnights made four payments to Zwick totaling\n$10,500. Zwick directed them to make out the first two\nchecks to \"CSC\"2 and \"Cash\" totaling $4,500. Zwick cashed\nboth, and the funds were never received by NHAH. The next\ntwo checks, totaling $6,000, were made out to NHAH.\nNonetheless, upon receipt of the funds, Judith Eakin,\nDirector of NHAH, wrote Zwick two checks for $6,000 as\npayment for the telephone system Zwick was installing for\nNHAH, the project Zwick told the Fosnights their\ncontribution would fund. Two months later, Zwick informed\nEakin that more money was needed to purchase equipment\nthat would complete the telephone system. When Eakin\ntold Zwick that NHAH had no additional funds available for\nthe telephone system, as no additional funds were in hand,\nZwick assured Eakin that a further donation would be\nforthcoming from the Fosnights, and that, if the anticipated\ndonation were not to be received in timely fashion, Zwick\nwould personally guarantee the sum in question. In\nreliance on Zwick's personal guarantee, Eakin was\nauthorized by her board president to advance Zwick the\nmoney required to purchase the equipment. Accordingly, in\nthe ensuing two weeks, Eakin issued Zwick two checks\ntotaling $7,440 made out to \"Jim Zwick\" as payment for the\nphone system. Shortly thereafter, Eakin agreed to issue\nZwick two \"replacement\" checks for $7,740 when Zwick\ninformed her that his accountant said the earlier checks\nshould have been issued to his company, Jim Zwick\nCommunications Systems, and not to him personally.\nAlthough Zwick provided Eakin with a check for $7,740 to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. CSC is an abbreviation for the name of Zwick's company. App. 427.\n\n                               5\n\freplace the check issued to him personally, when NHAH\nattempted to cash it, it was returned from the bank due to\nan irregular signature. NHAH never received these funds.\n\nZwick provided the Fosnights with a traffic study from\nhis office so they would not have to finance their own, and\nthe Fosnights did not make a contribution to the costs of\nconstructing a traffic light. Zwick voted for the approval of\nthe Fosnights' conditional use permit. He also moved to\napprove the Fosnights' final site permit but abstained from\nvoting on it, explaining that he might put a bid on the\ntelephone work for the project and did not want to create\nthe appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nCount three charged that Zwick had solicited bribes from\nJustin Ruff, the owner of Admiral Lawn Service, when he\nasked Ruff for \"performance bonds\" in exchange for\nensuring that Ruff was awarded landscaping contracts with\nRoss Township. Although bonds were required for contracts\nover $10,000, Ross Township commissioners were not\nauthorized to solicit or accept them, and certainly not\nentitled to cash them. Performance bonds were supposed to\nbe kept in escrow and returned once the project was\ncomplete. In the summer of 1996, Ruff gave Zwick two\nblank checks for $3,500 in connection with a landscaping\ncontract in Denny Park, Ross Township. Although Ruff was\nawarded the contract and performed the work, his checks\nwere never returned to him; Zwick had cashed them and\nkept the proceeds. Zwick eventually repaid Ruff after Ruff\nrepeatedly asked him to do so. Zwick continued to solicit\nbribes from Ruff in connection with various projects,\nincluding $4,500 for a $45,000 project that included\ncutting grass and dragging ball fields in Ross Township.\nRuff repeatedly refused to pay Zwick after becoming aware\nthat Zwick's requests violated Ross Township's policy\nregarding performance bonds.\n\nAfter he was convicted on the three counts, Zwick filed a\nmotion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure 29. The District Court denied the\nmotion on October 5, 1998. The Probation Office prepared\na Presentence Investigation Report recommending that\nZwick be awarded a two-point reduction for acceptance of\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(a). However, the\n\n                                6\n\fProbation Office Report did not recommend awarding the\nextra one-point reduction available under S 3E1.1(b)\nbecause the government had to prepare for trial on the\nbribery counts. The District Court found that the Probation\nOffice's conclusion was a reasonable one \"[b]ased on the\nunusual circumstances and procedural posture of this\ncase.\" The District Court also considered that Zwick raised\nfactual issues at trial, rather than limiting himself to legal\narguments. The District Court sentenced Zwick to\nconcurrent terms of thirty-three months as to each count,\nto be followed by five years of supervised release. Zwick\nfiled the instant appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nII.\n\nZwick contends that the evidence as to all three counts\nof his S 666 conviction is insufficient because the\ngovernment failed to prove the existence of any connection\nbetween his conduct and federal funds or programming.\nSpecifically, he argues that S 666 requires such a\nconnection, or, alternatively, that the statute is\nunconstitutional as applied to him. We exercise plenary\nreview over questions of statutory interpretation. See United\nStates v. Hayden, 64 F.3d 126, 128 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\nThe federal bribery statute at issue, 18 U.S.C.S 666,\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n       S 666. Theft or bribery concerning progr ams\n       receiving Federal funds\n\n       (a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in\n       subsection (b) of this section exists --\n\n       (1) being an agent of an organization, or of a Sta te,\n       local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency\n       thereof --\n\n       . . . .\n\n        (B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of\n       any person, or accepts or agrees to accept,\n       anything of value from any person, intending to be\n       influenced or rewarded in connection with any\n\n                               7\n\f       business, transaction, or series of transactions of\n       such organization, government, or agency involving\n       anything of value of $5,000 or more;\n\n        . . . .\n\n       shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more\n       than 10 years, or both.\n\n       (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of\n       this section is that the organization, government, or\n       agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in\n       excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a\n       grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or\n       other form of Federal assistance.\n\nPrior to the enactment of S 666 in 1984, the limited scope\nof the federal bribery statute and general theft of property\nstatute hampered the federal government's efforts to reach\ncrimes affecting federal interests due to tracing\nrequirements and limitations on application to non-federal\nemployees. See 18 U.S.C. SS 201, 641. By its terms, S 666\nfills these particular voids; it imposes no title or tracing\nrequirements and covers non-federal employees. The\ngovernment only must prove the basic elements of the S 666\noffense. However, as Zwick's challenge reveals, the law is\nunsettled as to what S 666 requires. In Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 118 S. Ct. 469, 475 (1997), the\nSupreme Court resolved one significant issue, namely, that\nthe government need not show federal funds actually were\ninvolved in or affected by an alleged bribery transaction.\nYet, the Court specifically left open the question before us,\nthat is, to what extent the statute \"requires some other\nkind of connection between a bribe and the expenditure of\nfederal funds.\" Id. at 474. We had prior occasion in this\nCircuit to examine the scope of S 666, see United States v.\nCicco, 938 F.2d 441, 444 (3d Cir. 1991), but we have not\naddressed the specific question before us in this case. It is\ninstructive to review the approaches taken by federal courts\nthat have considered the extent to which S 666 requires a\nrelationship between the offense conduct and federal funds\nor programs.\n\n                               8\n\fA. Pre-Salinas\n\nPrior to Salinas, courts evaluated the requisite\nrelationship under S 666 between a corrupt act and federal\nfunds or programming from a number of different\nperspectives. Several courts viewed the statute's\"plain\nlanguage\" as lacking any requirement, either implicitly or\nas an element of the offense, that the government prove\nfederal money was directly involved in, or traceable in some\nway to, the corrupt transaction. Bolstering their view was\nthe rationale that Congress sought to \"cast a broad net\" in\nprotecting the integrity of agencies receiving federal funds\nand thus enacted S 666 with the specific intent to eliminate\nany tracing requirements that previously had obstructed\nprosecution efforts. See United States v. Westmoreland, 841\nF.2d 572, 576-578 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding that direct\ninvolvement of federal funds in transaction is not an\nessential element of bribery charge under S 666); see also\nUnited States v. Pretty, 98 F.3d 1213, 1218-1219 (10th Cir.\n1996) (finding that the defendant was chargeable under\nS 666 even if actual money could not be traced to a federal\nprogram); United States v. Paradies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1288-89\n(11th Cir. 1996) (agreeing with Westmoreland that S 666\ndoes not require that the government trace the flow of\nfederal funds to a particular project); United States v.\nValentine, 63 F.3d 459, 464-65 (6th Cir. 1995) (holding that\ngovernment does not need to prove that the\nmisappropriated funds actually came from a federal\nprogram in a theft case); United States v. Simas, 937 F.2d\n459, 463 (9th Cir. 1991) (concluding that the government\nwas not required to trace federal funds to the project at\nissue to establish a S 666 violation).\n\nInterpreting a different subsection of S 666, others held\nthat the program touched by bribery need not be the direct\nand actual recipient of $10,000 per year in federal funds.\nSee United States v. Coyne, 4 F.3d 100, 109-110 (2d Cir.\n1993) (finding that S 666 lacks any requirement that the\nprogram at issue be the actual recipient of federal funds);\nUnited States v. Little, 889 F.2d 1367, 1369 (5th Cir. 1989)\n(same).\n\nWhen asked to uphold convictions or find defendants\nguilty with no proof of a federal interest in the corrupt act,\n\n                               9\n\fhowever, some courts were reluctant to do so. See United\nStates v. Foley, 73 F.3d 484, 488-493 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(reversing Foley's conviction after government did not prove\nthat corruption in some way touched on federal funds);\nUnited States v. Frega, 933 F. Supp. 1536, 1540-1541 (S.D.\nCal. 1996) (dismissing indictment for failure to allege that\n\"federal funds were corruptly administered, were in danger\nof being corruptly administered, or even could have been\ncorruptly administered.\"). Courts in this camp expressed\nconcern that interpreting S 666 to have no federal interest\nrequirement would make a federal offense out of routine\nlocal bribery, dramatically changing the state-federal\nbalance without an express Congressional directive that it\nintended to do so. See Frega, 933 F. Supp. at 1540.\n\nCourts finding that a federal connection is required were\ncomfortable reaching this result even though they agreed\nthat S 666 does not require tracing of funds or proof of an\neffect on federal funds and programs. For example, the\nNinth Circuit's holding in Simas, that tracing is not\nrequired, did not prevent the District Court for the\nSouthern District of California from concluding in Frega\nthat S 666 requires a federal connection. Likewise, the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit held thatS 666\ndoes not require that the corrupt act actually affected\nfederal funds in United States v. Bonito, 57 F.3d 167, 172-\n173 (2d Cir. 1995), but concluded in a subsequent case\nthat S 666 does require proof that the corruption has some\nconnection with federal funds. See Foley, 73 F.3d at 493. A\ncircuit split was created between the Second and Fifth\nCircuits when the Fifth Circuit held that a defendant's\nconduct fell within S 666 without specifically requiring a\nconnection between the corrupt act and the federal funds,\nother than the fact that the accepters of the bribes were\nlocal government agents with duties relating to a federally-\nfunded program. See United States v. Marmolejo, 89 F.3d\n1185, 1203 (5th Cir. 1996), aff'd, Salinas v. United States,\n118 S. Ct. at 474.3 Neither Foley nor Marmolejo was a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Marmolejo and Foley also parted ways regarding how to determine\nwhether the transactions at issue are equal to or greater than $5,000 in\nvalue.\n\n                               10\n\funanimous decision.4\n\nB. Salinas\n\nOn certiorari from the Fifth Circuit's Marmolejo decision,\nthe Supreme Court did not resolve the broad question\nbefore us of whether defendants can be prosecuted under\nS 666 absent a federal interest in the offense conduct, but\ninstead addressed the narrower question of whether S 666\napplies only when the bribe has a demonstrated effect on\nfederal funds. Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 472. 5 The Court found\nthat the statute's \"expansive, unqualified language, both as\nto the bribes forbidden and the entities covered, does not\nsupport the interpretation that federal funds must be\naffected to violate S 666(a)(1)(B).\" Id. at 473. The Court\nacknowledged that it could depart from a statute's clear\nlanguage upon an extraordinary showing of contrary\nintentions in the legislative history. See United States v.\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680 (1985). However, because the\nstatute was enacted to expand the application of federal\nbribery provisions to non-federal employees, the Court\nfound that it would be \"incongruous\" to restrict S 666 so\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In the Foley dissent, Judge Lumbard argued, in essence, that there is\nno federal connection requirement. Foley 73 F.3d at 494-497 (Lumbard,\nJ., dissenting). Rather, the plain language of S 666 simply outlaws bribes\nto agents of organizations that receive federal funds: \"It is sufficient\nthat\nFoley was an agent of a government that received $10,000 in federal\nfunds and that he took a bribe involving something worth at least\n$5,000.\" Id. at 495. Taking the opposite view in the Marmolejo dissent,\nJudge Jolly endorsed the Second Circuit majority's reasoning in Foley;\nhe argued that the Marmolejo majority misinterpreted its earlier decision\nin Westmoreland, on which it relied, and that S 666 was not intended to\ncriminalize all acts of bribery involving entities that happened to\nreceive\nsome federal funding. Marmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1201-1204 (Jolly, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n5. Salinas, a deputy sheriff for Hidalgo County, Texas, was convicted\nunder S 666 for accepting benefits from a federal prisoner in his custody\nin exchange for allowing the prisoner to have \"contact visits\" with his\nwife and girlfriend. See Marmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1191. Hidalgo County had\nan agreement with the federal government to house federal prisoners in\nexchange for grants for improving its prison as well as payment per day\nfor each federal prisoner housed. Id.\n\n                               11\n\fthat it applies only when a demonstrated effect on federal\nfunds is shown. Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 473. Significantly,\nthe Court found only that the \"text of S 666(a)(1)(B) is\nunambiguous on the point under consideration here.\" Id. at\n475 [emphasis added]. The Court did not reach a holding\non whether another kind of federal connection was required\nunder S 666, believing that the facts of Salinas' case\npresented a sufficient connection:\n\n       We need not consider whether the statute requires\n       some other kind of connection between a bribe and the\n       expenditure of federal funds, for in this case the bribe\n       was related to the housing of a prisoner in facilities\n       paid for in significant part by federal funds themselves.\n       And that relationship is close enough to satisfy\n       whatever connection the statute might require.\n\nId. at 474. The Court accordingly rejected a challenge to the\nconstitutionality of the provision, at least as applied to\nSalinas:\n\n       Furthermore, there is no serious doubt about the\n       constitutionality of S 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts\n       of this case. Beltran was without question a prisoner\n       held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of\n       agreements with the Federal Government. The\n       preferential treatment accorded to him was a threat to\n       the integrity and proper operation of the federal\n       program. Whatever might be said about S 666(a)(1)(B)'s\n       application in other cases, the application of\n       S 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power\n       beyond its proper bounds.\n\nId. at 475.\n\nC. Post-Salinas\n\nCourts clearly have recognized that Salinas left open the\nquestion of whether S 666 requires that a federal interest be\nimplicated by the offense conduct. See United States v.\nDakota, 188 F.3d 663 (6th Cir. 1999) (finding that in\nSalinas, \"the nature of any necessary connection is left\nunanswered\"); United States v. Santopietro, 166 F.3d 88, 93\n(2d Cir. 1999) (finding that the Supreme Court \"was careful\n\n                                12\n\fto note that the statute survived the constitutional as-\napplied challenge because the benefit obtained by means of\nthe bribe -- the preferential treatment -- `was a threat to\nthe integrity and proper operation of the federal\nprogram.' \"). Therefore, Salinas has not prevented courts\nfrom reaching conflicting conclusions on whether S 666\nrequires proof of a federal interest in the offense conduct.\nThe Sixth Circuit held post-Salinas that S 666 does not\nrequire proof of a connection between the offense conduct\nand federal funds or programming. See Dakota, 188 F.3d at\n668 (finding no connection requirement based on its\ndetermination in its pre-Salinas decision in Valentine, a\ntheft case, and providing no additional case cites or\nreasoning). Taking the opposite view, the Second Circuit\nheld that its holding in Foley -- that some federal\nconnection was required -- remained good law post-\nSalinas. See Santopietro, 166 F.2d at 93. The District Court\nof Massachusetts determined post-Salinas that S 666 was\nunconstitutional as applied to the defendant in that case,\nreasoning that the conduct at issue was not related to a\nlegitimate national problem as required by South Dakota v.\nDole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-08 (1987) and thus Congress\nexceeded its bounds under the spending clause. See United\nStates v. McCormack, 31 F. Supp.2d 176 (D. Mass. 1998).6\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Judge Gertner comprehensively evaluated whether \"S 666 give[s]\nfederal authorities a blank check to prosecute ostensibly significant acts\nof corruption involving the Malden Police Department just because the\ndepartment receives a certain level of federal funds.\" Id. at 181. While\nexpressing the view that the relevant language inS 666(a)(1)(B), \"in\nconnection with any business or transaction,\" is ambiguous and requires\nan examination of legislative history, id. at 186 (citing Foley, 73 F.3d\nat\n490 - 492 and Frega, 933 F. Supp. at 1543), Judge Gertner concluded\nthat Salinas foreclosed her from so ruling based on Salinas' holding that\nS 666(a)(1)(B) is clear and unambiguous. McCormack, 31 F. Supp.2d at\n186. Yet, the Court acknowledged that Salinas expressly left open the\npossibility that S 666(a)(1)(B) is unconstitutional as applied to cases\nthat\nlack some connection between the corrupt activity and federal funds or\nprogramming. The Court also found McCormack's prosecution under\nS 666 deficient in another respect relating to the \"$5,000 value\"\nrequirement. Id. at 189.\n\n                               13\n\fIII.\n\nZwick asks us to add our voice to the chorus of opinions\nregarding the need to prove that a federal interest was\nimplicated by corrupt acts in a S 666 prosecution. To reach\nour own determination of whether S 666 requires such\nproof, we begin by examining the statutory language itself.\nSee Collinsgru v. Palmyra Bd. of Educ., 161 F.3d 225, 233\n(3d Cir. 1998) (evaluating the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act) (citing United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc.,\n489 U.S. 235 (1989)).\n\nSection 666(a)(1)(B) requires proof that a bribe was given\n\"in connection with\" any business or transaction of an\nagency described in subsection (b), namely those receiving\nfunds under certain federal assistance programs. The\nlanguage does not state explicitly that the government must\nshow a connection between the bribe and federal interests.\nYet, the title of S 666, \"Theft or bribery concerning\nprograms receiving Federal funds,\" implies that a federal\nconnection is anticipated, as does the statute's reference\nonly to \"agents\" of entities receiving federal funds who\naccept bribes \"in connection with\" the business of the\norganization receiving federal funds.\n\nThe wording of this statute is far from straightforward in\nmany respects. Our reading of the statute, and the struggle\nof other courts to construe its meaning, lead us to conclude\nthat S 666 can hardly be described as \"plain to anyone\nreading the Act.\" Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 467\n(1991) (interpreting Federal Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act).7 The only thing plain about the statute is\nthat it yields two plausible alternative interpretations on\nthe issue raised by Zwick. While noting that the fact\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We find that nothing in Salinas prevents us from determining that\nS 666(a)(1)(B) is ambiguous on the issue of whether there is a federal\nconnection requirement, thus we disagree with the determination on this\npoint reached by the District Court in McCormack. See McCormack, 31\nF. Supp.2d at 186 (finding that \"Salinas has shut off this avenue of\nanalysis.\"). Salinas found S 666(a)(1)(B) clear and unambiguous only on\nthe question of whether the government must prove that the corrupt\nactivity had a demonstrated effect on federal funds or programming.\nSalinas, 118 S. Ct. at 475.\n\n                               14\n\fpattern in Salinas satisfied any federal connection test that\nS 666 might require, the Supreme Court pointedly skirted\nthe issue of whether the statute clearly mandated such a\nconnection, suggesting that the possibility of more than one\ninterpretation is valid. The most literal interpretation --\nthat the statute lacks a federal connection requirement --\nis troubling from an interpretative standpoint in that it\nbroadens the range of activity criminalized by the statute\nand alters the existing balance of federal and state powers\nby encompassing acts already addressed under state law in\nwhich the federal government may have little interest. We\ncannot embrace such a broad reading of this federal\ncriminal law unless that is the clear directive from\nCongress. Given the statute's ambiguity on this question,\nwe will consult the legislative history. See Director, Office of\nWorkers' Compensation Programs v. Sun Ship, Inc., 150\nF.3d 288, 291 (3d Cir. 1998); Collinsgru, 161 F.3d at 233.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it is worth reviewing our prior\nanalysis of S 666, albeit on a different issue, in United\nStates v. Cicco, 938 F.2d at 444. In Cicco , we considered\nwhether S 666 is sufficiently broad to cover the solicitation\nof election day services in exchange for municipal\nemployment.8 On appeal, we recognized that the statutory\nlanguage could be construed literally to cover Cicco's\nconduct, but found that \"the language of the drafters of\nS 666 is also consistent with an intention of focusing solely\non offenses involving theft or bribery\" in a classic sense.\nCicco, 938 F.2d at 444. Thus, we found that the statute\nwas ambiguous and turned to the legislative history. Id.9\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The District Court entered a judgment of acquittal in Cicco after\ndetermining that Congress did not intend S 666 to apply to Cicco's\nactions and that the government's interpretation of the statute was\nunconstitutionally vague and deprived Cicco of fair notice. Id. at 444.\n9. In outlining our approach in Cicco, we stated that examining the reach\nof a federal criminal statute requires close attention to statutory\nlanguage, legislative history, and purpose to strictly determine the scope\nof forbidden conduct. Id. (citing Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207,\n213 (1985)). We learned through our legislative history review in Cicco\nthat Congress enacted S 666 to \"protect federal funds by authorizing\nfederal prosecution of thefts and embezzlement from programs receiving\nsubstantial federal support even if the property no longer belonged to the\nfederal government . . . [and] to enlarge and clarify the class of persons\nsubject to the federal bribery laws\" to go beyond only those who can be\nconsidered federal public officials. Cicco, 938 F.2d at 445 (citations\nomitted).\n\n                               15\n\fAs in Cicco, we now face a choice between a highly literal\ninterpretation -- that no federal interest requirement is\nspecifically set forth in the statute -- and a plausible, albeit\nmore contextual, alternative. Thus, as in Cicco, we will refer\nto the legislative history for assistance in determining what\nCongress intended. See Collinsgru, 161 F.3d at 233.10\n\nThe legislative history of S 666 explains that the statute\nwas enacted to correct deficiencies in existing law by\n\"creat[ing] new offenses to augment the ability of the United\nStates to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and\nbribery involving Federal monies that are disbursed to\nprivate organizations or State and local governments\npursuant to a Federal program.\" S. REP. NO. 98-225, 369-\n370 (1984) (emphasis added), reprinted in 1984\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Examination of and references to the legislative history are not\nuncommon among the decisions that analyze S 666. The Supreme Court\nin Salinas referred to Congress' intentions in enacting S 666, although it\ndid not review or cite Congressional reports directly. See Salinas, 118 S.\nCt. at 474 (recounting Congress's intent in enactingS 666 based on a\n\"chronology [of case law] and the statutory language\" and rejecting\nSalinas' interpretation of the legislative history). See also Bonito, 57\nF.3d\nat 172 (citing legislative history noted by Bonito and ultimately\nrejecting\nBonito's arguments); Valentine, 63 F.3d at 463 (reviewing legislative\nhistory to determine whether it supported Valentine's argument);\nWestmoreland, 841 F.2d at 576-577 (reviewing legislative history \" `as an\nadditional tool of analysis' with the recognition that our inquiry will\nresult in `a limitation on the plain meaning of the statutory language'\nonly under exceptional circumstances\") (quoting Garcia v. United States,\n469 U.S. 70, 75 (1984)); Frega, 933 F. Supp. at 1542-1543 (reviewing\nlegislative history after finding statute ambiguous because interpretation\nnot requiring federal connection would alter federal-state balance absent\na clear Congressional directive). Courts interpreting subsection (b) have\nfollowed a similar course. See United States v. LaHue, 170 F.3d 1026,\n1030 (10th Cir. 1999) (\"Like other courts that have wrestled with an\ninterpretation of section 666(b), we look to the legislative history and\nthe\nunderlying purpose of the statute for guidance\"); United States v.\nCopeland, 143 F.3d 1439, 1442 (11th Cir. 1998) (having reached the\nconclusion on a \"plain reading of S 666(b), we normally would not engage\nin any additional analysis. However, since some circuits have found\nS 666(b) to be ambiguous on its face, it is worth noting that our\nconclusion is consistent with the statute's legislative history.\"); Coyne,\n4\nF.3d at 109 (reviewing legislative history regarding whether program at\nissue must be actual recipient of federal funds).\n\n                               16\n\fU.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3510-11. A similar expectation is\nreflected in the stated purpose of the statute, described as\nprotecting the integrity of vast sums of money distributed\nthrough Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue\ninfluence by bribery. Indeed, the title of the relevant section\nof this portion of the legislative history, \"Program Fraud\nand Bribery,\" suggests that Congress envisioned that a\nfederally funded program would be the target or victim of\nthe corrupt activity punishable under S 666.\n\nThere is no doubt that the legislative history promotes a\nbroad interpretation of the term \"Federal program involving\na grant, a contract, a subsidy, a loan, a guarantee,\ninsurance, or another form of Federal assistance\" to\nsupplement the application of federal bribery and theft\nstatutes. S. REP. NO. 98-225, 369-370. However, those gaps\nto be filled by this statute relate to elements in the federal\nbribery and theft statutes that increased the difficulty of\nreaching crimes in which there was a real federal interest.\nUnder the theft of federal property statute, 18 U.S.C. S 641,\nthe federal government could prosecute only when it could\nestablish that the stolen property was property of the\nUnited States, which often was impossible if title had\npassed before the property was stolen or when federal\nfunds were so commingled with non-federal funds that the\nfederal character of those funds could not be shown.\nPerhaps more relevant for our purposes was the federal\nbribery statute, 18 U.S.C. S 201, which was construed to be\ninapplicable to some or all employees of private\norganizations receiving federal funds, making it more\ndifficult for federal authorities to prosecute bribery even\nwhen federal interests were at stake. The goal was to\novercome impediments to reaching actions in which there\nwas a federal interest, not to federalize crimes in which a\nfederal interest was lacking.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Senate Report notes that the intent\nof the statute is \"to reach thefts and bribery in situations\nof the types involved in the Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley\ncases cited herein,\" three cases in which the corrupt\ntransaction clearly implicated federal interests. S. REP. No.\n98-225, 369-370. In United States v. Del Toro, 513 F.2d 656\n(2d Cir. 1975), the defendants conspired to bribe Pedro\n\n                               17\n\fMorales, the Assistant Administrator of the Harlem-East\nHarlem Model Cities Program, a program that wasfinanced\nand supervised by the United States Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). The federal\ngovernment paid one hundred percent of the cost of the\nprogram, and eighty percent of its salaries, including\nMorales's salary. Id. at 658, 661. The defendants wanted\nMorales to use his position with the program to secure\nModel Cities an office space lease in a building for which\none of the defendants was the rental agent. Id. at 658.\nBecause Morales was a city employee, and not a federal\none, however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Morales was not a \"public official\" for\npurposes of S 201: \"We do not believe that Morales was\nacting `under or by authority of any such department,\nagency, or branch' of the federal government. He was a city\nemployee, carrying out a task delegated to him by his\nsuperior, another city employee.\" Id. at 662. Yet, the federal\ninterest in Morales' corrupt transaction is apparent: the\nbribed official administered a program significantly funded\nby federal monies and the bribe was related to the program\nadministered by the official.\n\nIn the other two decisions cited in the Senate Report, the\nSeventh Circuit determined that non-federal employees\ncould be considered \"public officials\" for purposes of S 201,\nbut this decision turned on the fact that the defendants\nexercised considerable discretion in the administration of\nfederal funds and the bribery related to the defendant's\nadministration of the program, which for our purpose\nsuggests that a federal interest clearly was implicated. See\nUnited States v. Hinton, 683 F.2d 195, 198-200 (7th Cir.\n1982); United States v. Mosley, 659 F.2d 812, 816 (7th Cir.\n1981). In Hinton, the defendants were officials of United\nNeighborhoods, Inc., a non-profit corporation that had\nentered into a contract with the City of Peoria to administer\nfunds that HUD awarded to Peoria. The defendants had\ndiscretion in administering the federal funds, and the\nfederal funds paid the defendants' salaries and the entire\ncost of the program they administered. Significantly, the\nbribery related to rehabilitation contracts that fell within\n\n                               18\n\fthe purview of the program and were paid with federal\nfunds. Hinton, 683 F.2d at 196-99.11\n\nIn Mosley, the defendant, an employee of the State of\nIllinois Bureau of Employment Security (\"IBES\"), was\nconvicted of receiving bribes in exchange for giving\npreferential treatment to Comprehensive Employment and\nTraining Programs Act (\"CETA\") applicants when he\nevaluated and referred applicants for CETA-funded jobs.\nMosley, 659 F.2d at 813. The federal government funded\nthe CETA program, the CETA jobs, and all of IBES's costs,\nincluding Mosley's salary. Id. As in Hinton, the defendants\ncould be considered public officials because the program in\nMosley was funded by the federal government, the\ndefendant exercised discretion in the administration of\nfederal funds, and the bribery related to the defendant's\nadministration of the program. Again, the federal interest is\nclear.\n\nThe Senate Report's examples of intended S 666 offenses\ninvolved situations in which the corrupt acts clearly\nimplicated a federal interest, as the acts were closely tied to\nthe funded programs.12 Another comment in the Senate\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. In affirming Hinton, the Supreme Court determined that individuals\nemployed by private organizations that receive federal funds may be\ncovered by S 201, at least if an individual possesses \"some degree of\nofficial responsibility for carrying out a federal program or policy.\"\nDixson\nv. United States, 465 U.S. 482, 499-500 (1984). In limiting the\nparameters of its holding, however, the Supreme Court cautioned:\n\n       By finding petitioners to be public officials within the meaning of\n       section 201(a), we do not mean to suggest that the mere presence of\n       some federal assistance brings a local jurisdiction and its\nemployees\n       within the jurisdiction of the federal bribery statute or even that\nall\n       employees of local organizations responsible for administering\n       federal grant programs are public officials within the meaning of\n       section 201(a). To be a public official under section 201(a), an\n       individual must possess some degree of responsibility for carrying\n       out a federal program or policy . . . individuals who work for\nblock\n       grant recipients and business people who provide recipients with\n       goods and services can not be said to be public officials under\n       section 201(a) unless they assume some duties of an official\nnature.\n\nId. at 500.\n\f12. See also LaHue, 170 F.3d at 1031 (\"In all three cases [Del Toro,\nHinton, and Mosley], the organization in question received federal\n\n                               19\n\fReport illustrates that an entity's receipt of federal funds\ndoes not automatically establish a federal interest in\ncorrupt activity of employees of that entity:\n\n       For example, if a government agency lawfully\n       purchases more than $10,000 in equipment from a\n       supplier, it is not the intent of this section to make a\n       theft of $5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal\n       crime.\n\nS. REP. NO. 98-225, 370. Thus, nothing in the legislative\nhistory suggests that Congress intended to go well beyond\nthe examples in Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley to make S 666\napplicable when no federal interest is implicated by certain\noffense conduct.\n\nNot only does the legislative history of S 666 lead us to\nconclude that the statute should be read to incorporate a\nfederal interest requirement, but several well-established\nprinciples of statutory construction dictate this result.\nAccording to the Supreme Court, ambiguity in the language\nof a criminal statute should be resolved in favor of the\ndefendant. See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347\n(1971) (\"In various ways over the years, we have stated that\n`when choice has to be made between two readings of what\nconduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate,\nbefore we choose the harsher alternative, to require that\nCongress should have spoken in language that is clear and\ndefinite.' \") (quoting United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit\nCorp., 344 U.S. 218, 221-22 (1952)). Congress has not\n\"clearly and definitely\" instructed thatS 666 should be\napplied even absent some federal interest in the offense\nconduct. We should refuse the broader reading urged by\nthe government and adopt the narrower construction of the\nactivity criminalized by this provision. See also LaHue, 170\nF.3d at 1029 (in evaluating another subsection ofS 666,\n\"we must exercise particular restraint in interpreting federal\ncriminal statutes\") (citing Dowling, 473 U.S. at 214).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nprogram funds as the intended recipient, and each was charged with the\nresponsibility for administering or spending the federal grant monies to\nbenefit the intended beneficiaries.\").\n\n                               20\n\fThe Supreme Court also has instructed us that we\nshould not interpret a statute in a manner that significantly\nalters the federal-state balance unless Congress has clearly\nindicated that it intended to do so. See Bass, 404 U.S. at\n349 (\"In traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation\naffecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear\nstatement assures that the legislature has in fact faced,\nand intended to bring into issue, the critical matters\ninvolved in the judicial decision.\"); see also McCormack, 31\nF. Supp.2d at 186-187; Frega, 933 F. Supp. at 1540 (citing\nBass). If we adopted the government's interpretation that\nS 666 requires no connection between the offense conduct\nand federal funds or programming, S 666 would criminalize\na host of corrupt acts committed by state agents, among\nothers, by virtue of the fact that all states receive at least\n$10,000 in federal funds per year. See McCormack, 31 F.\nSupp.2d at 186. This result raises significant federalism\nconcerns, turning traditionally local conduct into a matter\nfor federal enforcement involving a substantial extension of\nfederal law enforcement resources. See Bass, 404 U.S. at\n350. We will not transform S 666 into a general federal anti-\ncorruption statute when Congress has not clearly expressed\nits intention to do so. See McCormack, 31 F. Supp.2d at\n186 (expressing concern about adopting government's\ninterpretation); Frega, 933 F. Supp. at 1540. As the\nSupreme Court stated in Bass, \"consistent with our regard\nfor the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal\njurisdiction, our reading preserves as an element . . . a\nrequirement suited to federal criminal jurisdiction alone.\"\n404 U.S. at 351.13\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. In interpreting the illegal gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. S\n201(c)(1)(A),\nJustice Scalia stated for an unanimous Court that\"a statute in this field\nthat can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a\nscalpel\nshould reasonably be taken to be the latter. Absent a text that clearly\nrequires it, we ought not expand this one piece of the [illegal gratuity]\nregulatory puzzle so dramatically as to make many other pieces misfits.\"\nUnited States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California, ___ U.S. ___, 119 S.\nCt. 1402, 1410 (1999) (holding that S 201(c)(1)(A) requires that the\ngovernment prove a link between a thing of value conferred upon a\npublic official and a specific official act for or because of which it was\ngiven). We point out, however, that SS 201 and 666 are not necessarily\nparallel in their applications, so these remarks do not dictate a\nsubstantive outcome here. See United States v. Jennings, 160 F.3d 1006,\n1015 fn 4 (4th Cir. 1998) (outlining distinctions between application of\ntwo provisions but not deciding whether S 666, like S 201, prohibits\ngratuities).\n\n                               21\n\fFinally, when a statute is unclear, we will construe it so\nas to avoid constitutional concerns, assuming that such\nconstruction does not amount to a rewriting of the statute.\nSee Albertini, 472 U.S. at 680. InterpretingS 666 to have no\nfederal interest requirement produces serious concerns as\nto whether Congress exceeded its power under the\nSpending Clause in enacting this statute. See McCormack,\n31 F. Supp.2d at 187-89.14 To pass muster under the\nSpending Clause, legislation regulating behavior of entities\nreceiving federal funds must, among other things, be based\nupon a federal interest in the particular conduct. See South\nDakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987). Applying S 666 to\noffense conduct, absent evidence of any federal interest,\nwould appear to be an unconstitutional exercise of power\nunder the Spending Clause.\n\nThus, we hold that S 666 requires that the government\nprove a federal interest is implicated by the defendant's\noffense conduct. In so holding, we part ways with the Sixth\nCircuit's holding in Dakota and agree with the result\nreached by the Second Circuit, as expressed most recently\nin Santopietro, and the District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California in its pre-Salinas Frega decision.\n\nGiven that the Supreme Court found a sufficient federal\nconnection existed in Salinas, we surmise that a highly\nattenuated implication of a federal interest will suffice for\npurposes of S 666.15 We can conceive of several ways in\nwhich the government could prove a federal interest in a\nS 666 in light of this threshold. The amount of federal funds\ncould provide the requisite federal implication, even if the\npurpose of those funds has no explicit relationship to the\nsubject of the bribe. If, for example, in a given year, the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. According to the Second Circuit, \"Salinas may be read to indicate\nthat the `threat to the integrity and proper operation of [a] federal\nprogram' created by the corrupt activity is necessary to assure that the\nstatute is not unconstitutionally applied.\" Santopietro, 166 F3d at 93\n(citing Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 475).\n\n15. In Salinas, the Supreme Court found that the federal government's\ninterest in the housing of federal prisoners in federally-funded local\nfacilities was sufficiently implicated when a prison official accepts\nbribes\nfrom a federal prisoner in exchange for permitting the prisoner to have\nconjugal visits. See Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 474.\n\n                               22\n\fgreater part of a township's budget came from federal\nfunds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might\nbe said to implicate federal interests. Absent that situation,\nthe offense conduct would have to somehow implicate a\nparticular substantive federal interest, as the Supreme\nCourt found it did in Salinas, where federal funds were\nbeing provided to house federal prisoners in local prisons.\n\nExamples from other cases may be illustrative. The\nSecond Circuit found a sufficient federal connection in\nSantopietro when real estate developers made corrupt\npayments to defendants to secure defendants' influence\nwith city agencies overseeing housing and urban\ndevelopment programs that were the beneficiaries of federal\nfunds. See Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 93 - 94. The Second\nCircuit concluded that \"this is not a case where the\ntransactions sought to be influenced concerned one\ndepartment of a city and the requisite $10,000 of federal\nfunds were received by a totally unrelated department.\" Id.\nHowever, the Court noted that the federal interest\nrequirement \"would not permit the Government to use\nsection 666(a)(1)(B) to prosecute a bribe paid to a city's\nmeat inspector in connection with a substantial transaction\njust because the city's parks department had received a\nfederal grant of $10,000.\" Id., at 93.\n\nThe District Court in Frega concluded that bribing state\ncourt judges to influence decisions in certain cases did not\nproduce the requisite federal interest when California\nreceived federal funds for purposes not related to the state\ncourts. See Frega, 933 F.Supp. at 1542 - 1543. The Court\nhypothesized, however, that some circumstances involving\nstate court judges might produce the requisite federal\nconnection, such as if the state court system received\nfederal funding for the purpose of appointing counsel in\ndeath penalty habeas proceedings, and a state court judge\naccepted a bribe in exchange for appointing a particular\nattorney as habeas counsel. See id.\n\nThere was evidence at Zwick's trial revealing that the\nfederal funds were provided to Ross Township for\nreimbursement for emergency snow removal and funding of\na project to prevent stream bank erosion.16 These uses bear\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. The government presented proof that Ross Township received in\nexcess of $10,000 in federal funds in a one-year period from two\n\n                               23\n\fno obvious connection to Zwick's offense conduct, which\ninvolved sewer access, use permits and landscaping\nperformance bonds. However, we will not direct the entry of\na judgment of acquittal because the District Court ruled\nthat S 666 did not require, and thus the government need\nnot present proof, that Zwick's conduct implicated a federal\ninterest.17 Instead, we will vacate Zwick's conviction and\nremand for a new trial.\n\nIV.\n\nZwick raises several other challenges to his S 666\nconviction that we find to be without merit. In connection\nwith the conduct charged in count one, Zwick argues that\nthere was insufficient evidence establishing that he acted\nas an agent of an entity that received the requisite amount\nof federal funds as S 666 requires. Zwick contends that the\nevidence presented at trial shows that Zwick was acting as\nan agent of Lowries Run, not as an agent of Ross Township.\nThe government's theory at trial was that Zwick had offered\nto obtain sewer access for Kaclik in his capacity as an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsources. First, Ross Township applied for federal reimbursement under\na Presidential Declaration of Major Disaster for costs associated with the\nblizzard of 1996 and consequently received $30,587 in June of 1996\nfrom the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\"). The funds\nfirst flowed through the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency\n(\"PEMA\"), but they were segregated from other Commonwealth funds\nprior to distribution to Ross Township. Second, the United States Army\nCorps of Engineers carried out and funded a $326,200 project, to which\nRoss Township contributed $65,300, to prevent the erosion of a stream\nbank in Ross Township.\n\n17. At a pretrial conference, counsel discussed with the District Court\nwhether S 666 requires a showing of a federal interest in Zwick's\nconduct. Counsel for the government informed the District Court that\n\"there are crucial issues as to what would be admissible and arguable at\ntrial that turn on what the jury instructions that you issue will be. For\nexample, we would need a determination on whether there does or does\nnot need, as we maintain, need to be a nexus between the bribe and\nreceipt of federal funds by Ross Township.\" App. 269. In response, the\nDistrict Court stated at least twice that \"there doesn't have to be any\nrelationship.\" App. 270, line 9, App. 271, lines 3-4.\n\n                               24\n\fagent of Ross Township, not of Lowries Run, and the\ngovernment did not offer any proof that Lowries Run\nreceived federal funds. Zwick concludes that his conviction\non count one should be reversed.\n\nUnder S 666(b), the government must establish that at\nleast $10,000 in federal funds within a one-year period\nwere received by the entity for which the defendant was\nacting as an agent. A defendant advancing a claim based on\ninsufficiency of the evidence carries a heavy burden, as we\napply a particularly deferential standard in reviewing this\ntype of claim. United States v. Dent, 149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d\nCir. 1998). We do not weigh the evidence or determine the\ncredibility of the witnesses. Id. Rather, viewing the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the government, we will\nsustain the verdict if any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Id.\n\nThe Lowries Run Sanitary Authority (\"Lowries Run\") is a\njoint venture between Ross Township and the McCandless\nTownship Sanitary Authority; two of the members of its\ngoverning board are appointed by Ross Township, and two\nare appointed by McCandless Township. Lowries Run board\nmembers need not be commissioners from Ross Township.\nZwick was selected as a member of the Lowries Run board,\nbut not in his capacity as a Ross Township commissioner.\nLowries Run operates independently from Ross Township; it\nhas its own bank account that is administered by the\nMcCandless Sanitary Authority, and money that it receives\nbelongs to Lowries Run, not Ross Township.\n\nAt trial, Kaclik testified that he could have applied to\neither Ross Township or Lowries Run for sewer access for\nhis project, Shannopin Square II. Kaclik testified further\nthat he understood that, in exchange for his money, Zwick\nwould influence Ross Township to approve Kaclik's sewer\naccess application; although he had the option of tapping\ninto either the Ross Township or the Lowries Run sewer\nsystem, he preferred the Township option because it was\nless expensive. App. 732, 758-59. Thomas D. Lavorini,\nManager of Ross Township, testified that he believed Kaclik\napproached Ross Township about obtaining access to the\nRoss Township sewer line, and that Lavorini may have had\n\n                               25\n\fa discussion with Zwick about Kaclik's request. App. 658-\n59. Kaclik also testified that Zwick had told him he would\nobtain the necessary Republican and Democratic votes and\nthat Zwick cashed Kaclik's check so that the Township\nwould not know the source of the money. App. 733, 740-\n41. Both of Zwick's comments suggest Zwick was offering to\ndeal with the Township, and not Lowries Run, on Kaclik's\nbehalf.\n\nThe substance of Kaclik's testimony suggests that he had\nsome confusion regarding the difference between the\nTownship and Lowries Run, and there was documentary\nevidence that the only formal application Kaclikfiled was\nwith Lowries Run. App. 751-52, 761-62. However,\nassuming a jury found Kaclik and Lavorini credible, this\nevidence is not so compelling that it could have prevented\na jury from finding, based on the evidence before it, that\nZwick was acting as an agent of Ross Township during the\nsewer access transactions. Thus, we reject Zwick's\nargument.\n\nWith respect to count two, Zwick also argues that the\ngovernment failed to establish that Zwick intended to be\ninfluenced \"in connection with any business, transaction,\nor series of transactions of such organization, government,\nor agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\"\nSee 18 U.S.C. S 666(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). According to\nZwick's interpretation of S 666, the transaction or\ntransactions must be worth at least $5,000 to Ross\nTownship, not to the other entities involved. He also claims\nthat the transactions involved in count two were not worth\n$5,000 or more as S 666 requires, but rather worth only\n$700, the cost of the conditional use permit and thefinal\nsite plan that Zwick offered to help the Fosnights obtain.\n\nFirst, we disagree with Zwick's reading of the statute\nregarding valuation of the $5,000 element. We find that the\nplain language of the statute does not require that value be\nmeasured from the perspective of the organization,\ngovernment, or agency. See 18 U.S.C. S 666(a)(1)(B)\n(prohibiting bribery \"in connection with any business,\ntransaction, or series of transactions of such organization,\ngovernment, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000\nor more\" (emphasis added)); see also Santopietro, 166 F.3d\n\n                                26\n\fat 93 (\"there is no requirement that the corrupt\ntransactions are worth $5,000 or more to the entity\nreceiving the federal funds\"); United States v. Marmolejo, 89\nF.3d 1185 (5th Cir. 1996)18 (finding that the $5,000 value\nelement was designed to limit application of S 666 to\nsignificant corrupt transactions, not to restrict the manner\nin which or the perspective from which that value is to be\ncalculated). See also United States v. Apple, 927 F. Supp.\n1119, 1126 (N.D. Ind. 1996) (concluding that the\ngovernment is not required \"to show that the thing that\nheld value of over $5,000 held that value for\" the entity);\nUnited States v. Vona, 842 F. Supp. 1534, 1536 (W.D.N.Y.\n1994) (finding that the Act does not require that the\ndefendant gain $5,000 or that the victim lose $5,000, but\nthat \"as long as the overall transaction or the target of the\nbribe is valued at $5,000 or more, the element of the crime\nis satisfied\"); United States v. Mongelli, 794 F. Supp. 529,\n530 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (\"The $5,000 triggering provision\nshould thus be interpreted as intended to require that\nsubstantial matters of that actual value be involved, not\nthat the agency be at risk of losing that amount.\").19\n\nSecond, we reject Zwick's argument that the transactions\nat issue were worth less than $5,000. Significantly, the\nFosnights agreed to pay Zwick $15,000 for his assistance,\nwhich indicates that the value of the transactions was well\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n18. In Marmolejo, defendant local officials agreed to provide a prisoner\nwith conjugal visits in exchange for $6,000 a month and $1,000 for each\nvisit. Id. at 1191. To value the transactions at issue, the Court looked\nto\n\"traditional valuation methods,\" specifically, what a person in the\nmarketplace would be willing to pay for the transaction. Id. at 1193.\n\n19. We also reject Zwick's argument that we should follow the Second\nCircuit in requiring that the value be determined from Ross Township's\nperspective. For this argument, Zwick relies on the Second Circuit's\nruling in Foley that the transaction must be valued from the perspective\nof the entity receiving the funds. Foley, 73 F.3d at 493. Regardless of\nthe\nmerits of Zwick's claim, the Second Circuit has since abandoned that\nconstruction. See Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 93 (\"[T]o the extent that Foley\nrequired the Government to plead and prove that the transaction\ninvolved something of value to the governmental entity that received the\nrequisite amount of federal funds, that narrowing construction of the\nstatute must . . . be discarded.\"). Thus, Zwick's reliance on Foley is\nmisplaced.\n\n                               27\n\fabove $700 and the $5,000 minimum. App. 424 - 425. See\nMarmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1194 (finding that the value of the\nconjugal visits was more than $5,000, because the prisoner\nwas willing to pay $6,000 a month plus $1,000 per visit for\nthem). There was evidence at trial that the Fosnights would\nhave lost the $10,000 they paid to the owners of the\nproperty had their conditional use permit not been\napproved. App. 420-21, 465. The overall value of the\nFosnight project was $4.6 million, and Ross Township\nwould receive $90,000 in tax benefits from the project on a\nyearly basis, as well as $6,939 in permit fees before the\nproject could go forward. App. 439, 442. The Fosnight\nproject was clearly a significant transaction within the\nintended reach of the statute. Because we believe that there\nwas substantial evidence from which the jury could have\nfound that the $5,000 element was satisfied, we reject\nZwick's challenge to the calculation of value underS 666\nwith respect to count two.\n\nWe also are not persuaded by Zwick's argument,\napplicable to all counts, that the District Court improperly\ninstructed the jury that the future value of the transaction\ncan be taken into account. Zwick cites the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision in Valentine that the government could not\naggregate the values of numerous thefts that occurred over\na three-year period in order to meet the $5,000 threshold\nunder S 666(a)(1)(A), the theft provision. See Valentine, 63\nF.3d at 464. Valentine is simply inapposite. Under the theft\nprovision, the stolen property must be worth $5,000, while\nthe bribery provision looks to the value of the underlying\nbusiness or transaction. Compare 18 U.S.C.S 666(a)(1)(A)\n(prohibiting theft of \"property that . . . is valued at $5,000\nor more\") with 18 U.S.C. S 666(a)(1)(B) (prohibiting bribery\n\"in connection with any business, transaction, or series of\ntransactions of such organization, government, or agency\ninvolving anything of value of $5,000 or more\"). Further,\nunlike in Valentine, the government in this case did not\nattempt to proffer evidence of the value of transactions or\nbusiness outside of the statutory period in order to satisfy\nthe $5,000 threshold. Here, the references to Ross\nTownship's future revenues from the transactions were\nactually evidence of their current value. Even without\nreference to future revenues, there is substantial evidence\n\n                               28\n\festablishing that the present value of the transactions and\nbusiness involved in each of counts one, two, and three was\nat least $5,000. The sewer taps that Zwick offered to obtain\nfor Kaclik were clearly worth more than $5,000, as Kaclik\nwas willing to pay $17,500 to ensure that he received them;\nthe contracts that were the subject of the bribery at count\nthree were worth $45,000; and the permits in count two\nwere worth more than $5,000 to the Fosnights, because, as\ndetailed above, they were willing to pay Zwick $15,000 to\nensure that they received them and would have lost\n$10,000 if they did not receive them in a timely manner.\n\nV.\n\nZwick's final contention is that the District Court erred in\nfailing to award him an additional point reduction in his\noffense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(b). We give great deference to the District\nCourt's evaluation of the defendant's acceptance of\nresponsibility, but exercise plenary review of the Court's\nconstruction of S 3E1.1. See United States v. Ceccarani, 98\nF.3d 126, 129 (3d Cir. 1996). We review the District Court's\ndeterminations of fact for clear error. Id.\n\nSection 3E1.1 provides:\n\n       (a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptan ce of\n       responsibility for this offense, decrease the offense level\n       by 2 levels.\n\n       (b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease un der\n       subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the\n       operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, and\n       the defendant has assisted authorities in the\n       investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by\n       taking one or more the following steps:\n\n       (1) timely providing complete information to the\n       government concerning his own involvement in the\n       offense; or\n\n       (2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to\n       enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the\n       government to avoid preparing for trial and\n\n                               29\n\f       permitting the court to allocate its resources\n       efficiently,\n\n       decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.\n\nThe District Court awarded Zwick the two-point\nreduction provided in S 3E1.1(a). At issue here is the\nCourt's rejection of the one-point reduction under\nS 3E1.1(b). Section 3E1.1(b) focuses on the timeliness of a\ndefendant's offer of information or notice of intent to plead\nsuch that the defendant provides an opportunity to the\ngovernment and court to conserve resources. See U.S.S.G.\nS 3E1.1, App. Note 6 (\"For example, to qualify under\nsubsection (b)(2), the defendant must have notified\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty at a\nsufficiently early point in the process . . . .\"); United States\nv. Narramore, 36 F.3d 845, 847 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"The\nadditional reduction in section (b) with which we are\nconcerned, is unlike the initial reduction in section (a), for\nit does not rest upon the demonstration of contrition.\nSection (b) allows the defendant to earn an additional\nreduction by providing timely notice of his intention to\nplead guilty, and it thus creates an incentive for an early\nplea\").\n\nParsing section 3E1.1(b), it directs the sentencing judge\nto decrease the offense level by one additional level if 1) the\ndefendant is entitled to the two-point reduction under\nS 3E1.1(a); 2) the defendant's offense level is 16 or greater;\nand 3) the defendant satisfies either of the two\nrequirements provided in subparagraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2).\nSee United States v. Paster, 173 F.3d 206, 214-15 (3d Cir.\n1999).\n\nZwick clearly satisfied the first two conditions under\nsubsection (b), in that he was awarded the two-point\nreduction under S 3E1.1(a), and had an offense level of 22.20\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20. Although the government argues in its brief that \"it is difficult if\nnot\nimpossible, to find acceptance of responsibility in Zwick's pretrial and\ntrial conduct,\" see Brief for Appellee at 53, we limit our discussion to\nwhether Zwick satisfied either subparagraph (1) or (2) of S 3E1.1(b)\nbecause acceptance of responsibility is not the element at issue in this\nappeal and we assume it will be satisfied even after remand. In addition,\n\n                               30\n\fHowever, the District Court adopted the Probation Office's\nconclusion that Zwick was not entitled to the extra point\nunder subsection (b) because the government was required\nto prepare for trial,21 noting also that defendant made\nfactual arguments at trial.22\n\nWe believe that the District Court did not fully consider\nthe elements of subsection (b). To receive an additional\nreduction for timely providing complete information to the\ngovernment, subparagraph one of S 3E1.1(b) requires that\nthe defendant timely provide complete information; it does\nnot require, either expressly or impliedly, that the\ndefendant actually forego his trial. See S 3E1.1(b)(1)\n(providing for a reduction for a defendant for \"timely\nproviding complete information to the government\nconcerning his own involvement in the offense\"). Instead of\nconcluding that the one-point deduction was foreclosed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwe also assume that, even after remand, Zwick's offense level will be at\nlevel 16 or greater as subsection (b) requires. Although Zwick's offense\nlevel may change if the District Court determines on remand that the\njudgment on the S 666 counts is to be vacated, the offense level for the\nfraud counts alone is 17, which satisfies the second requirement of\nS 3E1.1(b) that Zwick's offense level be 16 or higher.\n\n21. The Probation Office, in its Presentence Investigative Report (\"PSR\")\nfound:\n\n        The defendant entered a guilty plea to Counts 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10\n        of the indictment. Ostensibly, he chose to go to trial over the\n        remaining counts of the indictment, believing he should not have\n        been charged with those offenses in federal court, instead that he\n        should have been charged in state court. During the presentence\n        interview, he admitted his conduct in all of the charged counts was\n        illegal. The government was, therefore, required to prepare for\ntrial\n        in this matter. In view of this, only a two-point reduction for\n        acceptance of responsibility is warranted.\n\nPSR P 75.\n\n22. Specifically, the District Court noted that the defendant's opening\nstatement informed the jury that the government had to prove\ndefendant's intent, and that defendant cross-examined Tim Fosnight as\nto the defendant's voting activities at a Ross Township Planning\nCommission hearing on the approval of a conditional use permit for the\nFosnights' project in an effort to require the government to prove intent.\n\n                                31\n\fsimply because the government prepared for trial, the\nDistrict Court should have considered whether Zwick timely\nprovided complete information as the Guideline requires.\n\nLikewise, subparagraph two of S 3E1.1(b) requires that\nthe defendant express his notice of intent to plead guilty\nearly enough to permit the court and government to\nconserve resources, not that a guilty plea be entered in a\ntimely fashion or that the reduction is unavailable if the\ncase proceeds to trial. See S 3E1.1(b)(2). Permitting the\ngovernment and court to conserve resources, see WEBSTER'S\nII NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY DICTIONARY 876 (defining \"permit\"\nas \"[t]o afford opportunity\"), is not synonymous with the\nactual conservation of resources. We recognize that other\ncourts, such as the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,\nrequire actual conservation of resources as a condition to\nreceiving the point deduction under subsection (b)(2). See\nUnited States v. Wilson, 134 F.3d 855, 872 (7th Cir. 1998)\n(\"courts are still required to consider whether this\nexpressed intent actually resulted in conserving\nGovernment and court resources.\"). However, we believe\nthat our reading is true to the plain language of the\nGuideline and comports with the underlying purpose the\nGuideline serves. This Guideline rewards the defendant's\nwillingness to acknowledge responsibility for criminal\nwrongdoing in lieu of requiring all allegations to be proved\nin a trial. As such, the Guideline is triggered by the\ndefendant's behavior, not by whether other factors out of\nthe defendant's control prevent the acceptance of the\ndefendant's plea. Surely the possibility of an extra point\nreduction is not necessarily foreclosed, for instance, by the\ngovernment's rejection of a plea, for whatever reason. The\ngovernment's refusal to accept the plea and to avail itself of\nthe opportunity to conserve resources is not a per se\nbarrier to the one-point deduction. If the drafters of the\nGuideline intended to limit the award of the point to\nsituations in which a plea was entered, or resources were\nactually conserved, they could have crafted the language to\nreflect this intention.\n\nWe recognize that conditional pleas raise unique issues,\nwhich need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 23 We\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23. See United States v. Rogers, 129 F.3d 76, 80-81 (2d Cir. 1997)\n(finding that conditional offer to plead guilty did not come early enough\n\n                                32\n\falso acknowledge that it may be a rare case in which\nanything short of a timely entry of a guilty plea suffices for\npurposes of S 3E1.1(b).24 However, because the District\n\nCourt did not fully address, let alone resolve, whether\nZwick's pre-trial activity entitled him to a reduction under\nthe specific terms of S 3E1.1(b), we will remand to the\nDistrict Court for consideration of whether Zwick timely\nprovided complete information to the government under\nS 3E1.1(b)(1), or if his expression of his intent to plead\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nin the proceedings to satisfy S 3E1.1(b)(2) because it came after the case\nwas \"effectively tried\" with the motion to suppress); United States v.\nGonzales, 19 F.3d 982, 983-84 (5th Cir. 1994) (refusing to award an\nadditional point because Gonzales never entered an actual guilty plea;\nthe suppression hearing to which Gonzales wished to preserve a\nchallenge in his guilty plea was the equivalent of a full trial, requiring\nfull preparation and expenditure of resources by the government and the\ncourt).\n\n24. See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"A\ndefendant who withholds a guilty plea until he stands poised on the\nbrink of trial has no entitlement to the soothing unguent of section\n3E1.1(b)(2).

We also find that the fact that Zwick made legal arguments at trial\nis inapposite with respect to S 3E1.1(b). Application Note two provides\nthat a defendant may be entitled to a reduction even if he goes to trial,\nif he does so to \"assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual\nguilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a\nchallenge\nto the applicability of a statute to his conduct).\" Although the note does\nnot explicitly provide that it applies only to S 3E1.1(a), a logical\nreading\nof the note compels this conclusion. The note espouses the principle that\na defendant may in some circumstances show contrition even if he\nproceeds to trial; this has little to do with the timeliness of a\ndefendant's\noffer of information or expression of intent to plead guilty, the focus of\nS 3E1.1(b). See Villasenor-Cesar, 114 F.3d at 974. In addition, the note\nis essentially a continuation of Application Note 1, which applies to\nsubsection (a).\n\n                               34\n\f",

CESSAR, ESQUIRE\n       [ARGUED]\n       Office of U.S. Attorney\n       633 U.S. Post Office & Courthouse\n       Pittsburgh, PA 15219\n       Counsel for Appellee\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge.\n\nIn this appeal, we are asked to construe 18 U.S.C.S 666,\na criminal provision entitled \"Theft or bribery concerning\nprograms receiving Federal funds\" (\"the Act\" or \"the\nstatute\"). Appellant James J. Zwick claims that the District\nCourt misinterpreted the statute when it upheld his three-\ncount conviction for bribery under S 666(a)(1)(B) without\nproof of a connection between the offense conduct and\nfederal funds or programming. We conclude that the\nDistrict Court erred in interpreting the statute in this\nrespect and will therefore remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. Zwick also challenges the\nDistrict Court's failure to reduce his offense level by an\nadditional point for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(b). Because we find that the District Court\nerred in its application of this Guideline provision, we will\nvacate this aspect of the sentencing order and direct the\nDistrict Court on remand to award the additional one-point\nreduction if it determines that Zwick timely provided\ncomplete information to the government or timely notified\nthe government of his intent to plead guilty to enable the\ngovernment and court to conserve their resources.1\n\nI.\n\nAppellant James J. Zwick was an elected member of the\nRoss Township Board of Commissioners, the governing\nbody of Ross Township, Pennsylvania. Zwick and his fellow\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. We reject Zwick's remaining challenges to the application of the\nstatute to his particular situation, as we discuss more fully below.\n\n                               2\n\fcommissioners made policy decisions for the Township,\nincluding fixing salary levels, executing contracts,\nauthorizing bids, and adopting budgets. In November of\n1997, the government accused Zwick of abusing his\nposition to obtain illegal benefits and filed afive-count\nindictment charging him with three counts of theft or\nbribery concerning federal programs under 18 U.S.C.S 666,\none count of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. SS 2 & 1341, and\none count of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. SS 2 & 1344. The\nDistrict Court had jurisdiction over Zwick's case pursuant\nto 18 U.S.C. S 3231.\n\nInitial efforts at negotiating a guilty plea failed when the\ngovernment declined to accept a conditional plea, which\nwould have preserved Zwick's legal challenge to the\napplication of S 666 when there is no connection between a\ndefendant's conduct and federal funds or programming.\nAfter declining to accept the plea, the governmentfiled a\nsuperseding indictment, which contained all of the charges\nin the original indictment, and added another count of theft\nor bribery under S 666, another count of bank fraud, and\nthree more counts of mail fraud. Again, Zwick was willing\nto plead guilty to the bank fraud and mail fraud counts,\nbut continued to seek a conditional guilty plea on the S 666\ncounts. During a status conference on January 27, 1998,\nZwick informed the District Court of his intention to plead\nguilty to the fraud counts, and the District Court scheduled\nthe plea hearing for February 2, 1998. Further plea\nnegotiations were derailed, however, when articles appeared\nin the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and North Hills News Record\non January 28, 1998 and January 29, 1998, declaring that\nZwick would plead guilty to the fraud charges. Zwickfiled\na motion with the District Court to dismiss the indictment\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct, alleging that, by\nproviding information for the articles, the government had\nviolated its obligation to refrain from making extrajudicial\nstatements regarding the possibility of a guilty plea. The\nDistrict Court denied Zwick's motion. Zwick ultimately\nentered a guilty plea to the fraud counts on March 9, 1998.\n\nThe case against Zwick on the S 666 charges proceeded\nto trial on March 10, 1998, after a brief continuance so that\nZwick could enter treatment for his gambling addiction.\n\n                                3\n\fAlthough Zwick waived his right to a jury trial and\nrequested a bench trial, the government opposed this\nrequest, so the case was tried to a jury. Zwick was\nconvicted on counts one, two, and three of the four S 666\ncharges.\n\nBecause Zwick makes several challenges to the\nsufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction under\nS 666, we will review the relevant facts adduced at trial\nregarding the alleged bribes. In count one, the government\nalleged that Zwick solicited a bribe from Christopher Kaclik,\nthe owner and developer of the Shannopin Square II office\nbuilding located in Ohio Township. Kaclik first became\nassociated with Zwick in 1994, when he applied for sewer\naccess for the predecessor to Shannopin Square II,\nShannopin Square I. At that time, Kaclik testified that\nZwick told him \"anything you need to get done in the\nTownship of Ross, I can help you out.\" In May or June of\n1996, during the building of Shannopin Square II, Zwick\nmet with Kaclik at the development site and offered to\nsecure the necessary votes for approval of the sewer taps in\nexchange for a donation to the \"Men's Summer League for\nRoss Township,\" a basketball league run by Zwick. Kaclik\nwrote a check for $5,000, made out to \"James Zwick,\" with\na notation reading \"Men's Summer League 1996\nBasketball.\" At Zwick's suggestion, Kaclik also provided\nZwick with a blank check for $7,500, which Zwick falsely\nrepresented he would put toward the $17,500 required to\nreserve the sewer taps. When Kaclik discovered that Zwick\nhad personally endorsed and cashed the checks, he asked\nthat Zwick return the money. After repeated phone calls to\nZwick, Kaclik received $2,500 from Zwick.\n\nCount two involved Zwick's dealings with the Fosnights,\nwho had obtained an option on property in Zwick's ward in\nRoss Township to build and operate an assisted living\nfacility there. To complete their project, the Fosnights were\nrequired to obtain approval from the Ross Township Board\nof Commissioners for various permits, including a\nconditional use permit and site plan approval. On\nSeptember 9, 1996, after the Township Planning\nCommission had already recommended approval of the\nconditional use permit, the Board of Commissioners voted\n\n                               4\n\fto table the permit for further investigation. After that\nmeeting, Zwick contacted Tim Fosnight and set up a\nmeeting with him and his brother Aaron at the project site.\nZwick offered to help them obtain the required permits in\nexchange for a $15,000 donation to construct a playground\non the grounds of his \"pet\" project, North Hills Affordable\nHousing (\"NHAH\"). Zwick explained that he could require\nthe Fosnights to pay for a new traffic light and traffic\nstudies, which could involve significant costs of up to\n$100,000 and lead to considerable delay, but he would not\ndo so if such a \"donation\" was made.\n\nThe Fosnights made four payments to Zwick totaling\n$10,500. Zwick directed them to make out the first two\nchecks to \"CSC\"2 and \"Cash\" totaling $4,500. Zwick cashed\nboth, and the funds were never received by NHAH. The next\ntwo checks, totaling $6,000, were made out to NHAH.\nNonetheless, upon receipt of the funds, Judith Eakin,\nDirector of NHAH, wrote Zwick two checks for $6,000 as\npayment for the telephone system Zwick was installing for\nNHAH, the project Zwick told the Fosnights their\ncontribution would fund. Two months later, Zwick informed\nEakin that more money was needed to purchase equipment\nthat would complete the telephone system. When Eakin\ntold Zwick that NHAH had no additional funds available for\nthe telephone system, as no additional funds were in hand,\nZwick assured Eakin that a further donation would be\nforthcoming from the Fosnights, and that, if the anticipated\ndonation were not to be received in timely fashion, Zwick\nwould personally guarantee the sum in question. In\nreliance on Zwick's personal guarantee, Eakin was\nauthorized by her board president to advance Zwick the\nmoney required to purchase the equipment. Accordingly, in\nthe ensuing two weeks, Eakin issued Zwick two checks\ntotaling $7,440 made out to \"Jim Zwick\" as payment for the\nphone system. Shortly thereafter, Eakin agreed to issue\nZwick two \"replacement\" checks for $7,740 when Zwick\ninformed her that his accountant said the earlier checks\nshould have been issued to his company, Jim Zwick\nCommunications Systems, and not to him personally.\nAlthough Zwick provided Eakin with a check for $7,740 to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. CSC is an abbreviation for the name of Zwick's company. App. 427.\n\n                               5\n\freplace the check issued to him personally, when NHAH\nattempted to cash it, it was returned from the bank due to\nan irregular signature. NHAH never received these funds.\n\nZwick provided the Fosnights with a traffic study from\nhis office so they would not have to finance their own, and\nthe Fosnights did not make a contribution to the costs of\nconstructing a traffic light. Zwick voted for the approval of\nthe Fosnights' conditional use permit. He also moved to\napprove the Fosnights' final site permit but abstained from\nvoting on it, explaining that he might put a bid on the\ntelephone work for the project and did not want to create\nthe appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nCount three charged that Zwick had solicited bribes from\nJustin Ruff, the owner of Admiral Lawn Service, when he\nasked Ruff for \"performance bonds\" in exchange for\nensuring that Ruff was awarded landscaping contracts with\nRoss Township. Although bonds were required for contracts\nover $10,000, Ross Township commissioners were not\nauthorized to solicit or accept them, and certainly not\nentitled to cash them. Performance bonds were supposed to\nbe kept in escrow and returned once the project was\ncomplete. In the summer of 1996, Ruff gave Zwick two\nblank checks for $3,500 in connection with a landscaping\ncontract in Denny Park, Ross Township. Although Ruff was\nawarded the contract and performed the work, his checks\nwere never returned to him; Zwick had cashed them and\nkept the proceeds. Zwick eventually repaid Ruff after Ruff\nrepeatedly asked him to do so. Zwick continued to solicit\nbribes from Ruff in connection with various projects,\nincluding $4,500 for a $45,000 project that included\ncutting grass and dragging ball fields in Ross Township.\nRuff repeatedly refused to pay Zwick after becoming aware\nthat Zwick's requests violated Ross Township's policy\nregarding performance bonds.\n\nAfter he was convicted on the three counts, Zwick filed a\nmotion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure 29. The District Court denied the\nmotion on October 5, 1998. The Probation Office prepared\na Presentence Investigation Report recommending that\nZwick be awarded a two-point reduction for acceptance of\nresponsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(a). However, the\n\n                                6\n\fProbation Office Report did not recommend awarding the\nextra one-point reduction available under S 3E1.1(b)\nbecause the government had to prepare for trial on the\nbribery counts. The District Court found that the Probation\nOffice's conclusion was a reasonable one \"[b]ased on the\nunusual circumstances and procedural posture of this\ncase.\" The District Court also considered that Zwick raised\nfactual issues at trial, rather than limiting himself to legal\narguments. The District Court sentenced Zwick to\nconcurrent terms of thirty-three months as to each count,\nto be followed by five years of supervised release. Zwick\nfiled the instant appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. S 1291.\n\nII.\n\nZwick contends that the evidence as to all three counts\nof his S 666 conviction is insufficient because the\ngovernment failed to prove the existence of any connection\nbetween his conduct and federal funds or programming.\nSpecifically, he argues that S 666 requires such a\nconnection, or, alternatively, that the statute is\nunconstitutional as applied to him. We exercise plenary\nreview over questions of statutory interpretation. See United\nStates v. Hayden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702536\"><a href=\"/opinion/702536/united-states-v-william-o-hayden/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\nThe federal bribery statute at issue, 18 U.S.C.S 666,\nprovides in pertinent part:\n\n       S 666.

See 18 U.S.C. SS 201, 641. By its terms, S 666\nfills these particular voids; it imposes no title or tracing\nrequirements and covers non-federal employees. The\ngovernment only must prove the basic elements of the S 666\noffense. However, as Zwick's challenge reveals, the law is\nunsettled as to what S 666 requires. In Salinas v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We had prior occasion in this\nCircuit to examine the scope of S 666, see United States v.\nCicco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564791\"><a href=\"/opinion/564791/united-states-v-nicholas-j-cicco-vincent-tabbachino/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (3d Cir. 1991), but we have not\naddressed the specific question before us in this case. It is\ninstructive to review the approaches taken by federal courts\nthat have considered the extent to which S 666 requires a\nrelationship between the offense conduct and federal funds\nor programs.\n\n                               8\n\fA. Pre-Salinas\n\nPrior to Salinas, courts evaluated the requisite\nrelationship under S 666 between a corrupt act and federal\nfunds or programming from a number of different\nperspectives. Several courts viewed the statute's\"plain\nlanguage\" as lacking any requirement, either implicitly or\nas an element of the offense, that the government prove\nfederal money was directly involved in, or traceable in some\nway to, the corrupt transaction. Bolstering their view was\nthe rationale that Congress sought to \"cast a broad net\" in\nprotecting the integrity of agencies receiving federal funds\nand thus enacted S 666 with the specific intent to eliminate\nany tracing requirements that previously had obstructed\nprosecution efforts.

Courts in this camp expressed\nconcern that interpreting S 666 to have no federal interest\nrequirement would make a federal offense out of routine\nlocal bribery, dramatically changing the state-federal\nbalance without an express Congressional directive that it\nintended to do so.

For example, the\nNinth Circuit's holding in Simas, that tracing is not\nrequired, did not prevent the District Court for the\nSouthern District of California from concluding in Frega\nthat S 666 requires a federal connection.

However, because the\nstatute was enacted to expand the application of federal\nbribery provisions to non-federal employees, the Court\nfound that it would be \"incongruous\" to restrict S 666 so\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In the Foley dissent, Judge Lumbard argued, in essence, that there is\nno federal connection requirement. Foley 73 F.3d at 494-497 (Lumbard,\nJ., dissenting). Rather, the plain language of S 666 simply outlaws bribes\nto agents of organizations that receive federal funds: \"It is sufficient\nthat\nFoley was an agent of a government that received $10,000 in federal\nfunds and that he took a bribe involving something worth at least\n$5,000.\" Id. at 495. Taking the opposite view in the Marmolejo dissent,\nJudge Jolly endorsed the Second Circuit majority's reasoning in Foley;\nhe argued that the Marmolejo majority misinterpreted its earlier decision\nin Westmoreland, on which it relied, and that S 666 was not intended to\ncriminalize all acts of bribery involving entities that happened to\nreceive\nsome federal funding. Marmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1201-1204 (Jolly, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n5. Salinas, a deputy sheriff for Hidalgo County, Texas, was convicted\nunder S 666 for accepting benefits from a federal prisoner in his custody\nin exchange for allowing the prisoner to have \"contact visits\" with his\nwife and girlfriend. See Marmolejo, 89 F.3d at 1191. Hidalgo County had\nan agreement with the federal government to house federal prisoners in\nexchange for grants for improving its prison as well as payment per day\nfor each federal prisoner housed. Id.\n\n                               11\n\fthat it applies only when a demonstrated effect on federal\nfunds is shown. Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 473. Significantly,\nthe Court found only that the \"text of S 666(a)(1)(B) is\nunambiguous on the point under consideration here.\" Id. at\n475 [emphasis added]. The Court did not reach a holding\non whether another kind of federal connection was required\nunder S 666, believing that the facts of Salinas' case\npresented a sufficient connection:\n\n       We need not consider whether the statute requires\n       some other kind of connection between a bribe and the\n       expenditure of federal funds, for in this case the bribe\n       was related to the housing of a prisoner in facilities\n       paid for in significant part by federal funds themselves.\n       And that relationship is close enough to satisfy\n       whatever connection the statute might require.\n\nId. at 474. The Court accordingly rejected a challenge to the\nconstitutionality of the provision, at least as applied to\nSalinas:\n\n       Furthermore, there is no serious doubt about the\n       constitutionality of S 666(a)(1)(B) as applied to the facts\n       of this case. Beltran was without question a prisoner\n       held in a jail managed pursuant to a series of\n       agreements with the Federal Government. The\n       preferential treatment accorded to him was a threat to\n       the integrity and proper operation of the federal\n       program. Whatever might be said about S 666(a)(1)(B)'s\n       application in other cases, the application of\n       S 666(a)(1)(B) to Salinas did not extend federal power\n       beyond its proper bounds.\n\nId. at 475.\n\nC.

Therefore, Salinas has not prevented courts\nfrom reaching conflicting conclusions on whether S 666\nrequires proof of a federal interest in the offense conduct.\nThe Sixth Circuit held post-Salinas that S 666 does not\nrequire proof of a connection between the offense conduct\nand federal funds or programming. See Dakota, 188 F.3d at\n668 (finding no connection requirement based on its\ndetermination in its pre-Salinas decision in Valentine, a\ntheft case, and providing no additional case cites or\nreasoning).

Yet, the Court acknowledged that Salinas expressly left open the\npossibility that S 666(a)(1)(B) is unconstitutional as applied to cases\nthat\nlack some connection between the corrupt activity and federal funds or\nprogramming.

The\nlanguage does not state explicitly that the government must\nshow a connection between the bribe and federal interests.\nYet, the title of S 666, \"Theft or bribery concerning\nprograms receiving Federal funds,\" implies that a federal\nconnection is anticipated, as does the statute's reference\nonly to \"agents\" of entities receiving federal funds who\naccept bribes \"in connection with\" the business of the\norganization receiving federal funds.\n\nThe wording of this statute is far from straightforward in\nmany respects.

While noting that the fact\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We find that nothing in Salinas prevents us from determining that\nS 666(a)(1)(B) is ambiguous on the issue of whether there is a federal\nconnection requirement, thus we disagree with the determination on this\npoint reached by the District Court in McCormack. See McCormack, 31\nF. Supp.2d at 186 (finding that \"Salinas has shut off this avenue of\nanalysis.\"). Salinas found S 666(a)(1)(B) clear and unambiguous only on\nthe question of whether the government must prove that the corrupt\nactivity had a demonstrated effect on federal funds or programming.\nSalinas, 118 S. Ct. at 475.\n\n                               14\n\fpattern in Salinas satisfied any federal connection test that\nS 666 might require, the Supreme Court pointedly skirted\nthe issue of whether the statute clearly mandated such a\nconnection, suggesting that the possibility of more than one\ninterpretation is valid. The most literal interpretation --\nthat the statute lacks a federal connection requirement --\nis troubling from an interpretative standpoint in that it\nbroadens the range of activity criminalized by the statute\nand alters the existing balance of federal and state powers\nby encompassing acts already addressed under state law in\nwhich the federal government may have little interest. We\ncannot embrace such a broad reading of this federal\ncriminal law unless that is the clear directive from\nCongress. Given the statute's ambiguity on this question,\nwe will consult the legislative history. See Director, Office of\nWorkers' Compensation Programs v. Sun Ship, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756450\"><a href=\"/opinion/756450/director-office-of-workers-compensation-programs-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (3d Cir. 1998); Collinsgru, 161 F.3d at 233.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it is worth reviewing our prior\nanalysis of S 666, albeit on a different issue, in United\nStates v. Cicco, 938 F.2d at 444. In Cicco , we considered\nwhether S 666 is sufficiently broad to cover the solicitation\nof election day services in exchange for municipal\nemployment.8 On appeal, we recognized that the statutory\nlanguage could be construed literally to cover Cicco's\nconduct, but found that \"the language of the drafters of\nS 666 is also consistent with an intention of focusing solely\non offenses involving theft or bribery\" in a classic sense.\nCicco, 938 F.2d at 444. Thus, we found that the statute\nwas ambiguous and turned to the legislative history. Id.9\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. The District Court entered a judgment of acquittal in Cicco after\ndetermining that Congress did not intend S 666 to apply to Cicco's\nactions and that the government's interpretation of the statute was\nunconstitutionally vague and deprived Cicco of fair notice. Id. at 444.\n9. In outlining our approach in Cicco, we stated that examining the reach\nof a federal criminal statute requires close attention to statutory\nlanguage, legislative history, and purpose to strictly determine the scope\nof forbidden conduct. Id. (citing Dowling v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111502\"><a href=\"/opinion/111502/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n213 (1985)). We learned through our legislative history review in Cicco\nthat Congress enacted S 666 to \"protect federal funds by authorizing\nfederal prosecution of thefts and embezzlement from programs receiving\nsubstantial federal support even if the property no longer belonged to the\nfederal government . . . [and] to enlarge and clarify the class of persons\nsubject to the federal bribery laws\" to go beyond only those who can be\nconsidered federal public officials. Cicco, 938 F.2d at 445 (citations\nomitted).\n\n                               15\n\fAs in Cicco, we now face a choice between a highly literal\ninterpretation -- that no federal interest requirement is\nspecifically set forth in the statute -- and a plausible, albeit\nmore contextual, alternative. Thus, as in Cicco, we will refer\nto the legislative history for assistance in determining what\nCongress intended. See Collinsgru, 161 F.3d at 233.10\n\nThe legislative history of S 666 explains that the statute\nwas enacted to correct deficiencies in existing law by\n\"creat[ing] new offenses to augment the ability of the United\nStates to vindicate significant acts of theft, fraud, and\nbribery involving Federal monies that are disbursed to\nprivate organizations or State and local governments\npursuant to a Federal program.\" S.

Examination of and references to the legislative history are not\nuncommon among the decisions that analyze S 666.

A similar expectation is\nreflected in the stated purpose of the statute, described as\nprotecting the integrity of vast sums of money distributed\nthrough Federal programs from theft, fraud, and undue\ninfluence by bribery. Indeed, the title of the relevant section\nof this portion of the legislative history, \"Program Fraud\nand Bribery,\" suggests that Congress envisioned that a\nfederally funded program would be the target or victim of\nthe corrupt activity punishable under S 666.\n\nThere is no doubt that the legislative history promotes a\nbroad interpretation of the term \"Federal program involving\na grant, a contract, a subsidy, a loan, a guarantee,\ninsurance, or another form of Federal assistance\" to\nsupplement the application of federal bribery and theft\nstatutes. S. REP. NO. 98-225, 369-370. However, those gaps\nto be filled by this statute relate to elements in the federal\nbribery and theft statutes that increased the difficulty of\nreaching crimes in which there was a real federal interest.\nUnder the theft of federal property statute, 18 U.S.C. S 641,\nthe federal government could prosecute only when it could\nestablish that the stolen property was property of the\nUnited States, which often was impossible if title had\npassed before the property was stolen or when federal\nfunds were so commingled with non-federal funds that the\nfederal character of those funds could not be shown.\nPerhaps more relevant for our purposes was the federal\nbribery statute, 18 U.S.C. S 201, which was construed to be\ninapplicable to some or all employees of private\norganizations receiving federal funds, making it more\ndifficult for federal authorities to prosecute bribery even\nwhen federal interests were at stake. The goal was to\novercome impediments to reaching actions in which there\nwas a federal interest, not to federalize crimes in which a\nfederal interest was lacking.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Senate Report notes that the intent\nof the statute is \"to reach thefts and bribery in situations\nof the types involved in the Del Toro, Hinton, and Mosley\ncases cited herein,\" three cases in which the corrupt\ntransaction clearly implicated federal interests.

Significantly, the\nbribery related to rehabilitation contracts that fell within\n\n                               18\n\fthe purview of the program and were paid with federal\nfunds. Hinton, 683 F.2d at 196-99.11\n\nIn Mosley, the defendant, an employee of the State of\nIllinois Bureau of Employment Security (\"IBES\"), was\nconvicted of receiving bribes in exchange for giving\npreferential treatment to Comprehensive Employment and\nTraining Programs Act (\"CETA\") applicants when he\nevaluated and referred applicants for CETA-funded jobs.\nMosley, 659 F.2d at 813. The federal government funded\nthe CETA program, the CETA jobs, and all of IBES's costs,\nincluding Mosley's salary. Id. As in Hinton, the defendants\ncould be considered public officials because the program in\nMosley was funded by the federal government, the\ndefendant exercised discretion in the administration of\nfederal funds, and the bribery related to the defendant's\nadministration of the program. Again, the federal interest is\nclear.\n\nThe Senate Report's examples of intended S 666 offenses\ninvolved situations in which the corrupt acts clearly\nimplicated a federal interest, as the acts were closely tied to\nthe funded programs.12 Another comment in the Senate\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11.

See Bass, 404 U.S. at\n349 (\"In traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation\naffecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear\nstatement assures that the legislature has in fact faced,\nand intended to bring into issue, the critical matters\ninvolved in the judicial decision.\"); see also McCormack, 31\nF.

If we adopted the government's interpretation that\nS 666 requires no connection between the offense conduct\nand federal funds or programming, S 666 would criminalize\na host of corrupt acts committed by state agents, among\nothers, by virtue of the fact that all states receive at least\n$10,000 in federal funds per year. See McCormack, 31 F.\nSupp.2d at 186. This result raises significant federalism\nconcerns, turning traditionally local conduct into a matter\nfor federal enforcement involving a substantial extension of\nfederal law enforcement resources. See Bass, 404 U.S. at\n350. We will not transform S 666 into a general federal anti-\ncorruption statute when Congress has not clearly expressed\nits intention to do so. See McCormack, 31 F.

InterpretingS 666 to have no\nfederal interest requirement produces serious concerns as\nto whether Congress exceeded its power under the\nSpending Clause in enacting this statute. See McCormack,\n31 F. Supp.2d at 187-89.14 To pass muster under the\nSpending Clause, legislation regulating behavior of entities\nreceiving federal funds must, among other things, be based\nupon a federal interest in the particular conduct.

Applying S 666 to\noffense conduct, absent evidence of any federal interest,\nwould appear to be an unconstitutional exercise of power\nunder the Spending Clause.\n\nThus, we hold that S 666 requires that the government\nprove a federal interest is implicated by the defendant's\noffense conduct. In so holding, we part ways with the Sixth\nCircuit's holding in Dakota and agree with the result\nreached by the Second Circuit, as expressed most recently\nin Santopietro, and the District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California in its pre-Salinas Frega decision.\n\nGiven that the Supreme Court found a sufficient federal\nconnection existed in Salinas, we surmise that a highly\nattenuated implication of a federal interest will suffice for\npurposes of S 666.15 We can conceive of several ways in\nwhich the government could prove a federal interest in a\nS 666 in light of this threshold. The amount of federal funds\ncould provide the requisite federal implication, even if the\npurpose of those funds has no explicit relationship to the\nsubject of the bribe. If, for example, in a given year, the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. According to the Second Circuit, \"Salinas may be read to indicate\nthat the `threat to the integrity and proper operation of [a] federal\nprogram' created by the corrupt activity is necessary to assure that the\nstatute is not unconstitutionally applied.\" Santopietro, 166 F3d at 93\n(citing Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 475).\n\n15. In Salinas, the Supreme Court found that the federal government's\ninterest in the housing of federal prisoners in federally-funded local\nfacilities was sufficiently implicated when a prison official accepts\nbribes\nfrom a federal prisoner in exchange for permitting the prisoner to have\nconjugal visits. See Salinas, 118 S. Ct. at 474.\n\n                               22\n\fgreater part of a township's budget came from federal\nfunds, bribery of a township agent for any purpose might\nbe said to implicate federal interests. Absent that situation,\nthe offense conduct would have to somehow implicate a\nparticular substantive federal interest, as the Supreme\nCourt found it did in Salinas, where federal funds were\nbeing provided to house federal prisoners in local prisons.\n\nExamples from other cases may be illustrative. The\nSecond Circuit found a sufficient federal connection in\nSantopietro when real estate developers made corrupt\npayments to defendants to secure defendants' influence\nwith city agencies overseeing housing and urban\ndevelopment programs that were the beneficiaries of federal\nfunds. See Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 93 - 94. The Second\nCircuit concluded that \"this is not a case where the\ntransactions sought to be influenced concerned one\ndepartment of a city and the requisite $10,000 of federal\nfunds were received by a totally unrelated department.\" Id.\nHowever, the Court noted that the federal interest\nrequirement \"would not permit the Government to use\nsection 666(a)(1)(B) to prosecute a bribe paid to a city's\nmeat inspector in connection with a substantial transaction\njust because the city's parks department had received a\nfederal grant of $10,000.\" Id., at 93.\n\nThe District Court in Frega concluded that bribing state\ncourt judges to influence decisions in certain cases did not\nproduce the requisite federal interest when California\nreceived federal funds for purposes not related to the state\ncourts. See Frega, 933 F.Supp. at 1542 - 1543. The Court\nhypothesized, however, that some circumstances involving\nstate court judges might produce the requisite federal\nconnection, such as if the state court system received\nfederal funding for the purpose of appointing counsel in\ndeath penalty habeas proceedings, and a state court judge\naccepted a bribe in exchange for appointing a particular\nattorney as habeas counsel. See id.\n\nThere was evidence at Zwick's trial revealing that the\nfederal funds were provided to Ross Township for\nreimbursement for emergency snow removal and funding of\na project to prevent stream bank erosion.16 These uses bear\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16.

However, we will not direct the entry of\na judgment of acquittal because the District Court ruled\nthat S 666 did not require, and thus the government need\nnot present proof, that Zwick's conduct implicated a federal\ninterest.17 Instead, we will vacate Zwick's conviction and\nremand for a new trial.\n\nIV.\n\nZwick raises several other challenges to his S 666\nconviction that we find to be without merit. In connection\nwith the conduct charged in count one, Zwick argues that\nthere was insufficient evidence establishing that he acted\nas an agent of an entity that received the requisite amount\nof federal funds as S 666 requires. Zwick contends that the\nevidence presented at trial shows that Zwick was acting as\nan agent of Lowries Run, not as an agent of Ross Township.\nThe government's theory at trial was that Zwick had offered\nto obtain sewer access for Kaclik in his capacity as an\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsources. First, Ross Township applied for federal reimbursement under\na Presidential Declaration of Major Disaster for costs associated with the\nblizzard of 1996 and consequently received $30,587 in June of 1996\nfrom the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\"). The funds\nfirst flowed through the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency\n(\"PEMA\"), but they were segregated from other Commonwealth funds\nprior to distribution to Ross Township. Second, the United States Army\nCorps of Engineers carried out and funded a $326,200 project, to which\nRoss Township contributed $65,300, to prevent the erosion of a stream\nbank in Ross Township.\n\n17. At a pretrial conference, counsel discussed with the District Court\nwhether S 666 requires a showing of a federal interest in Zwick's\nconduct. Counsel for the government informed the District Court that\n\"there are crucial issues as to what would be admissible and arguable at\ntrial that turn on what the jury instructions that you issue will be. For\nexample, we would need a determination on whether there does or does\nnot need, as we maintain, need to be a nexus between the bribe and\nreceipt of federal funds by Ross Township.\" App. 269. In response, the\nDistrict Court stated at least twice that \"there doesn't have to be any\nrelationship.\" App. 270, line 9, App. 271, lines 3-4.\n\n                               24\n\fagent of Ross Township, not of Lowries Run, and the\ngovernment did not offer any proof that Lowries Run\nreceived federal funds. Zwick concludes that his conviction\non count one should be reversed.\n\nUnder S 666(b), the government must establish that at\nleast $10,000 in federal funds within a one-year period\nwere received by the entity for which the defendant was\nacting as an agent. A defendant advancing a claim based on\ninsufficiency of the evidence carries a heavy burden, as we\napply a particularly deferential standard in reviewing this\ntype of claim. United States v. Dent, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755773\"><a href=\"/opinion/755773/united-states-v-michael-dent/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187 (3d\nCir. 1998). We do not weigh the evidence or determine the\ncredibility of the witnesses. Id. Rather, viewing the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the government, we will\nsustain the verdict if any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Id.\n\nThe Lowries Run Sanitary Authority (\"Lowries Run\") is a\njoint venture between Ross Township and the McCandless\nTownship Sanitary Authority; two of the members of its\ngoverning board are appointed by Ross Township, and two\nare appointed by McCandless Township. Lowries Run board\nmembers need not be commissioners from Ross Township.\nZwick was selected as a member of the Lowries Run board,\nbut not in his capacity as a Ross Township commissioner.\nLowries Run operates independently from Ross Township; it\nhas its own bank account that is administered by the\nMcCandless Sanitary Authority, and money that it receives\nbelongs to Lowries Run, not Ross Township.\n\nAt trial, Kaclik testified that he could have applied to\neither Ross Township or Lowries Run for sewer access for\nhis project, Shannopin Square II. Kaclik testified further\nthat he understood that, in exchange for his money, Zwick\nwould influence Ross Township to approve Kaclik's sewer\naccess application; although he had the option of tapping\ninto either the Ross Township or the Lowries Run sewer\nsystem, he preferred the Township option because it was\nless expensive. App. 732, 758-59. Thomas D. Lavorini,\nManager of Ross Township, testified that he believed Kaclik\napproached Ross Township about obtaining access to the\nRoss Township sewer line, and that Lavorini may have had\n\n                               25\n\fa discussion with Zwick about Kaclik's request. App. 658-\n59. Kaclik also testified that Zwick had told him he would\nobtain the necessary Republican and Democratic votes and\nthat Zwick cashed Kaclik's check so that the Township\nwould not know the source of the money. App. 733, 740-\n41. Both of Zwick's comments suggest Zwick was offering to\ndeal with the Township, and not Lowries Run, on Kaclik's\nbehalf.\n\nThe substance of Kaclik's testimony suggests that he had\nsome confusion regarding the difference between the\nTownship and Lowries Run, and there was documentary\nevidence that the only formal application Kaclikfiled was\nwith Lowries Run. App. 751-52, 761-62. However,\nassuming a jury found Kaclik and Lavorini credible, this\nevidence is not so compelling that it could have prevented\na jury from finding, based on the evidence before it, that\nZwick was acting as an agent of Ross Township during the\nsewer access transactions. Thus, we reject Zwick's\nargument.\n\nWith respect to count two, Zwick also argues that the\ngovernment failed to establish that Zwick intended to be\ninfluenced \"in connection with any business, transaction,\nor series of transactions of such organization, government,\nor agency involving anything of value of $5,000 or more.\"\nSee 18 U.S.C. S 666(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). According to\nZwick's interpretation of S 666, the transaction or\ntransactions must be worth at least $5,000 to Ross\nTownship, not to the other entities involved. He also claims\nthat the transactions involved in count two were not worth\n$5,000 or more as S 666 requires, but rather worth only\n$700, the cost of the conditional use permit and thefinal\nsite plan that Zwick offered to help the Fosnights obtain.\n\nFirst, we disagree with Zwick's reading of the statute\nregarding valuation of the $5,000 element. We find that the\nplain language of the statute does not require that value be\nmeasured from the perspective of the organization,\ngovernment, or agency. See 18 U.S.C. S 666(a)(1)(B)\n(prohibiting bribery \"in connection with any business,\ntransaction, or series of transactions of such organization,\ngovernment, or agency involving anything of value of $5,000\nor more\" (emphasis added)); see also Santopietro, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n                                <span class=\"page\">26</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fat 93 (\"there is no requirement that the corrupt\ntransactions are worth $5,000 or more to the entity\nreceiving the federal funds\"); United States v.

For this argument, Zwick relies on the Second Circuit's\nruling in Foley that the transaction must be valued from the perspective\nof the entity receiving the funds. Foley, 73 F.3d at 493. Regardless of\nthe\nmerits of Zwick's claim, the Second Circuit has since abandoned that\nconstruction. See Santopietro, 166 F.3d at 93 (\"[T]o the extent that Foley\nrequired the Government to plead and prove that the transaction\ninvolved something of value to the governmental entity that received the\nrequisite amount of federal funds, that narrowing construction of the\nstatute must . . . be discarded.\").

There was evidence at trial that the Fosnights would\nhave lost the $10,000 they paid to the owners of the\nproperty had their conditional use permit not been\napproved. App. 420-21, 465. The overall value of the\nFosnight project was $4.6 million, and Ross Township\nwould receive $90,000 in tax benefits from the project on a\nyearly basis, as well as $6,939 in permit fees before the\nproject could go forward. App. 439, 442. The Fosnight\nproject was clearly a significant transaction within the\nintended reach of the statute. Because we believe that there\nwas substantial evidence from which the jury could have\nfound that the $5,000 element was satisfied, we reject\nZwick's challenge to the calculation of value underS 666\nwith respect to count two.\n\nWe also are not persuaded by Zwick's argument,\napplicable to all counts, that the District Court improperly\ninstructed the jury that the future value of the transaction\ncan be taken into account. Zwick cites the Sixth Circuit's\ndecision in Valentine that the government could not\naggregate the values of numerous thefts that occurred over\na three-year period in order to meet the $5,000 threshold\nunder S 666(a)(1)(A), the theft provision. See Valentine, 63\nF.3d at 464. Valentine is simply inapposite. Under the theft\nprovision, the stolen property must be worth $5,000, while\nthe bribery provision looks to the value of the underlying\nbusiness or transaction. Compare 18 U.S.C.S 666(a)(1)(A)\n(prohibiting theft of \"property that . . . is valued at $5,000\nor more\") with 18 U.S.C. S 666(a)(1)(B) (prohibiting bribery\n\"in connection with any business, transaction, or series of\ntransactions of such organization, government, or agency\ninvolving anything of value of $5,000 or more\"). Further,\nunlike in Valentine, the government in this case did not\nattempt to proffer evidence of the value of transactions or\nbusiness outside of the statutory period in order to satisfy\nthe $5,000 threshold. Here, the references to Ross\nTownship's future revenues from the transactions were\nactually evidence of their current value. Even without\nreference to future revenues, there is substantial evidence\n\n                               28\n\festablishing that the present value of the transactions and\nbusiness involved in each of counts one, two, and three was\nat least $5,000. The sewer taps that Zwick offered to obtain\nfor Kaclik were clearly worth more than $5,000, as Kaclik\nwas willing to pay $17,500 to ensure that he received them;\nthe contracts that were the subject of the bribery at count\nthree were worth $45,000; and the permits in count two\nwere worth more than $5,000 to the Fosnights, because, as\ndetailed above, they were willing to pay Zwick $15,000 to\nensure that they received them and would have lost\n$10,000 if they did not receive them in a timely manner.\n\nV.\n\nZwick's final contention is that the District Court erred in\nfailing to award him an additional point reduction in his\noffense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. S 3E1.1(b). We give great deference to the District\nCourt's evaluation of the defendant's acceptance of\nresponsibility, but exercise plenary review of the Court's\nconstruction of S 3E1.1. See United States v. Ceccarani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728010\"><a href=\"/opinion/728010/united-states-v-angelo-p-ceccarani/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (3d Cir. 1996). We review the District Court's\ndeterminations of fact for clear error. Id.\n\nSection 3E1.1 provides:\n\n       (a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptan ce of\n       responsibility for this offense, decrease the offense level\n       by 2 levels.\n\n       (b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease un der\n       subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the\n       operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, and\n       the defendant has assisted authorities in the\n       investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by\n       taking one or more the following steps:\n\n       (1) timely providing complete information to the\n       government concerning his own involvement in the\n       offense; or\n\n       (2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to\n       enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the\n       government to avoid preparing for trial and\n\n                               29\n\f       permitting the court to allocate its resources\n       efficiently,\n\n       decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.\n\nThe District Court awarded Zwick the two-point\nreduction provided in S 3E1.1(a). At issue here is the\nCourt's rejection of the one-point reduction under\nS 3E1.1(b). Section 3E1.1(b) focuses on the timeliness of a\ndefendant's offer of information or notice of intent to plead\nsuch that the defendant provides an opportunity to the\ngovernment and court to conserve resources. See U.S.S.G.\nS 3E1.1, App. Note 6 (\"For example, to qualify under\nsubsection (b)(2), the defendant must have notified\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty at a\nsufficiently early point in the process . . . .\"); United States\nv.

Paster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763110\"><a href=\"/opinion/763110/united-states-v-mitchell-frederick-paster/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214-15 (3d Cir.\n1999).\n\nZwick clearly satisfied the first two conditions under\nsubsection (b), in that he was awarded the two-point\nreduction under S 3E1.1(a), and had an offense level of 22.20\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20. Although the government argues in its brief that \"it is difficult if\nnot\nimpossible, to find acceptance of responsibility in Zwick's pretrial and\ntrial conduct,\" see Brief for Appellee at 53, we limit our discussion to\nwhether Zwick satisfied either subparagraph (1) or (2) of S 3E1.1(b)\nbecause acceptance of responsibility is not the element at issue in this\nappeal and we assume it will be satisfied even after remand. In addition,\n\n                               30\n\fHowever, the District Court adopted the Probation Office's\nconclusion that Zwick was not entitled to the extra point\nunder subsection (b) because the government was required\nto prepare for trial,21 noting also that defendant made\nfactual arguments at trial.22\n\nWe believe that the District Court did not fully consider\nthe elements of subsection (b). To receive an additional\nreduction for timely providing complete information to the\ngovernment, subparagraph one of S 3E1.1(b) requires that\nthe defendant timely provide complete information; it does\nnot require, either expressly or impliedly, that the\ndefendant actually forego his trial. See S 3E1.1(b)(1)\n(providing for a reduction for a defendant for \"timely\nproviding complete information to the government\nconcerning his own involvement in the offense\"). Instead of\nconcluding that the one-point deduction was foreclosed\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwe also assume that, even after remand, Zwick's offense level will be at\nlevel 16 or greater as subsection (b) requires. Although Zwick's offense\nlevel may change if the District Court determines on remand that the\njudgment on the S 666 counts is to be vacated, the offense level for the\nfraud counts alone is 17, which satisfies the second requirement of\nS 3E1.1(b) that Zwick's offense level be 16 or higher.\n\n21. The Probation Office, in its Presentence Investigative Report (\"PSR\")\nfound:\n\n        The defendant entered a guilty plea to Counts 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10\n        of the indictment. Ostensibly, he chose to go to trial over the\n        remaining counts of the indictment, believing he should not have\n        been charged with those offenses in federal court, instead that he\n        should have been charged in state court. During the presentence\n        interview, he admitted his conduct in all of the charged counts was\n        illegal. The government was, therefore, required to prepare for\ntrial\n        in this matter. In view of this, only a two-point reduction for\n        acceptance of responsibility is warranted.\n\nPSR P 75.\n\n22. Specifically, the District Court noted that the defendant's opening\nstatement informed the jury that the government had to prove\ndefendant's intent, and that defendant cross-examined Tim Fosnight as\nto the defendant's voting activities at a Ross Township Planning\nCommission hearing on the approval of a conditional use permit for the\nFosnights' project in an effort to require the government to prove intent.\n\n                                31\n\fsimply because the government prepared for trial, the\nDistrict Court should have considered whether Zwick timely\nprovided complete information as the Guideline requires.\n\nLikewise, subparagraph two of S 3E1.1(b) requires that\nthe defendant express his notice of intent to plead guilty\nearly enough to permit the court and government to\nconserve resources, not that a guilty plea be entered in a\ntimely fashion or that the reduction is unavailable if the\ncase proceeds to trial. See S 3E1.1(b)(2). Permitting the\ngovernment and court to conserve resources, see WEBSTER'S\nII NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITY DICTIONARY 876 (defining \"permit\"\nas \"[t]o afford opportunity\"), is not synonymous with the\nactual conservation of resources. We recognize that other\ncourts, such as the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,\nrequire actual conservation of resources as a condition to\nreceiving the point deduction under subsection (b)(2). See\nUnited States v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751138\"><a href=\"/opinion/751138/united-states-v-bernard-wilson-luis-luna-and-manuel-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872 (7th Cir. 1998)\n(\"courts are still required to consider whether this\nexpressed intent actually resulted in conserving\nGovernment and court resources.\"). However, we believe\nthat our reading is true to the plain language of the\nGuideline and comports with the underlying purpose the\nGuideline serves. This Guideline rewards the defendant's\nwillingness to acknowledge responsibility for criminal\nwrongdoing in lieu of requiring all allegations to be proved\nin a trial. As such, the Guideline is triggered by the\ndefendant's behavior, not by whether other factors out of\nthe defendant's control prevent the acceptance of the\ndefendant's plea. Surely the possibility of an extra point\nreduction is not necessarily foreclosed, for instance, by the\ngovernment's rejection of a plea, for whatever reason. The\ngovernment's refusal to accept the plea and to avail itself of\nthe opportunity to conserve resources is not a per se\nbarrier to the one-point deduction. If the drafters of the\nGuideline intended to limit the award of the point to\nsituations in which a plea was entered, or resources were\nactually conserved, they could have crafted the language to\nreflect this intention.\n\nWe recognize that conditional pleas raise unique issues,\nwhich need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 23 We\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23.
