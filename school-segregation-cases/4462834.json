[5RR85-86; PX38]\n\n(hereafter “Lyon Construction” or “Mr. Lyon’s company”). CR243-48, 266-270,\n\n271-76, 277-78, 308-314; 1SuppCR98-103.1 Lyon Construction was the original\n\nplaintiff but Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction eventually became named\n\ndefendants pursuant to the trial court’s order of realignment. CR6-9, 29-32, 96.\n\nMr. Lyon and his company are also cross-appellees in this Court. Mr. Lyon’s and\n\nhis company’s trial and appellate counsel are listed on the cover of this brief. 2\n\n\n1\n     The last-in-time judgment rendered by the trial court (second “nunc pro tunc” signed\nOctober 13, 2015) denied all relief requested against Lyon Construction; however,\nLyon Construction has joined this opening brief (in an abundance of caution) because: (a) the\nfirst “nunc pro tunc” (signed July 31, 2015) judgment mistakenly inserted unspecified “findings\nof fact as requested by” plaintiff Building Galveston, Inc. and mistakenly awarded Building\nGalveston, Inc. “$15,889.84” against Lyon Construction (see CR273, 276; 1SuppCR6-7, 27);\nand (b) no subsequent order or judgment signed by the trial court expressly vacated, modified or\ncorrected the first “nunc pro tunc” judgment signed on July 31, 2015. See 1SuppCR37, 93-94,\n96 (10/12/2015 judgment abstract form requested by Building Galveston, Inc.’s counsel naming\n“Lyon Construction Services” as a “Judgment Debtor” with reference to “Nunc Pro Tunc Order\nof 7/31/2015”), 103 (last-in-time “nunc pro tunc” judgment signed October 13, 2015, ordering:\n“This judgment corrects the Judgment of May 19, 2015 . . .”). Cf. Mullins v. Thomas, 136\nTex. 215, 217, 150 S.W.2d 83, 84 (1941) (reaffirming “well settled” rule “that the entry of a\nsecond judgment in the same case is not a vacation of the first, and that if there is nothing to\nshow the first was vacated, the second is a nullity”), Lane Bank Equip.

BGI’s trial and appellate counsel is:\n\n       Scott Lyford (127153200)\n       (slyford@millsshirley.com)\n       Mills Shirley L.L.P.\n       P.O.

Barmore\n(24073076). E.g., 1RR2. (Mr. Barmore departed Ted B. Lyon & Associates, P.C., in\nDecember 2013 and on information and belief is now with Rad Law Firm, P.C.,\n2777 Allen Parkway, Suite 1000, Houston, Texas 77019.)\n3\n     See CR292-93, 299 (Building Galveston, Inc. announcing its intention to appeal the\ntrial court’s failure “to enter [sic] judgment against the corporate [sic] defendant and the failure\nto award attorney’s fees related to the breach of contract damages awarded”).\n4\n  BGI’s counsel in the trial court also included Christopher C. Garcia (24007221). E.g., CR113.\n(On information and belief, Mr. Garcia departed Mills Shirley L.L.P. in about July 2015 and is\nnow with Chris Garcia Law Group, P.C., 1207 S. Shepherd, Houston, Texas 77019.) Andy Soto\n(24071128) from the Mills Shirley firm also appeared in the trial court for BGI during the post-\nverdict evidentiary hearing on attorney’s fees. 11RR2, 5, 22-24, 30, 49-50, 80-82, 94-95.\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fclaims against Patty Cake Bakery and the Rennicks                       CR78, 80-81, 333.5\n\nChris Arneson, Patty Cake Bakery, and the Rennicks: (1) did not appear as parties\n\nduring the November 2013 jury trial (CR96, 339-340; 1RR1-6RR10; 1SuppCR98);\n\n(2) are not named as parties in the the trial court’s final judgment (1SuppCR98-\n\n103); and (3) are not parties to the appeal or cross-appeal now before this Court\n\n(CR277-78, 292-93, 299, 312-13). Neither Mr. Lyon (or Lyon Construction) nor\n\nBuilding Galveston is challenging the trial court’s January 2012 orders granting\n\nsummary judgment and/or dismissal in favor of Chris Arneson, Patty Cake\n\nBakeries, and the Rennicks; consequently, those rulings should be affirmed. 6\n\n\n\n\n5\n   The record reveals Lyon Construction’s claims against Chris Arneson, Patty Cake Bakery, and\nthe Rennicks were never severed from this action; consequently, the January 2012 interlocutory\norders in favor of Chris Arneson, Patty Cake Bakery, and the Rennicks became final when the\ntrial court subsequently signed its original final judgment disposing of all parties and claims on\nMay 19, 2015. CR4, 243-48, 271-76. See Webb v. Jorns, 488 S.W.2d 407, 408-09 (Tex. 1972);\nH.B. Zachry Co. v. Thibodeaux, 364 S.W.2d 192, 193 (Tex. 1963) (per curiam). The last-in-time\njudgment signed by the trial court — purportedly nunc pro tunc “AS of 5-19-2015” but before\nthe trial court’s period of Rule 329b plenary power ended — included the following order to\nremove any doubt about finality: “This judgment corrects the Judgment of May 19, 2015, finally\ndisposes of all parties and all claims, and is appealable. Any relief requested by any party not\ngranted herein is hereby DENIED.” 1SuppCR103, 98. See In re Burlington Coat Factory\nWarehouse, Inc., 167 S.W.3d 827, 829-830 (Tex. 2005) (orig. pro.)

Michelle Slaughter, presiding over the\n\n405th District Court of Galveston County, and respectfully shows:\n\n                          Mr. Lyon’s Statement of the Case\n       Lyon Construction (a subcontractor) commenced this action in August 2010\n\nagainst Patty Cakes Bakery and the Rennicks (owners of the Patty Cakes Bakery\n\nproject) seeking to foreclose a claimed $35,697.00 mechanic’s and materialman’s\n\nlien. CR6-9. Building Galveston, Inc. (general contractor for the Patty Cakes\n\nBakery project) (BGI) intervened in April 2011. CR12-19. In November 2013,\n\nBGI became designated as the plaintiff, with Lyon Construction and Mr. Lyon\n\nbeing designated as the defendants. CR96; 2RR8.\n\n       BGI’s third amended petition included (among others) the following alleged\n\ncauses of action against Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction: (a) breach of contract;\n\n(b) filing of an invalid lien; and (c) filing of a fraudulent lien. CR102, 108-11.\n\nBGI’s third amended petition also expressly requested a judgment against\n\nMr. Lyon and Lyon Construction for “[e]xemplary damages as awarded by the trier\n\nof fact . . . .” CR112.7 Because BGI wanted to open and conclude both the\n\n\n7\n   Appropriately on this record, BGI did not (1) request submission of jury questions on\nexemplary damages against Mr. Lyon or Lyon Construction, nor (2) ask the trial court to award\nany exemplary damages to BGI in its final judgment.\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fpresentation of evidence and arguments to the jury, BGI admitted to the trial court\n\nthat BGI bore “the burden of proof at trial.” CR93, 96. The trial court later\n\nconfirmed on the record an agreement and stipulation between the parties “that\n\nattorney’s fees would be taken up by a separate motion with the Court and not put\n\nto the jury . . . so that will be taken up after the verdict is rendered by the jury.”\n\n5RR5-6; 11RR89-90.\n\n      After a week-long trial in November 2013, twelve Galveston County jurors\n\nunanimously found: (1) Mr. Lyon, individually, and Building Galveston agreed to\n\nenter into a subcontract for the construction of the Patty Cakes Bakery;\n\n(2) Mr. Lyon failed to comply with his subcontract with Building Galveston;\n\n(3) amounts to fairly and reasonably compensate Building Galveston for any\n\ndamages that resulted from Mr. Lyon’s failure to comply; (4) Mr. Lyon made,\n\npresented or used a fraudulent lien or claim against real property; and (5) an\n\namount to fairly and reasonably compensate Building Galveston for any damages\n\nthat resulted from Mr. Lyon presenting or using a fraudulent lien or claim against\n\nreal property. CR127-131, 138-39.\n\n      Mr. Lyon’s motion to disregard the jury’s answer to Question No. 4 was\n\nheard in December 2014 and later “DENIED” on the first page of the trial court’s\n\nsigned final judgment, which went on award BGI: $47,820.59 for actual damages;\n\n$9,806.50 in pre-judgment interest; $162,556.42 for attorney’s fees through trial\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fand any unsuccessful appeal by Mr. Lyon to this Court; and additional amounts for\n\nany unsuccessful appeal by Mr. Lyon to the Texas Supreme Court. CR141-47,\n\n169-172; 10RR4-21; CR243, 271; 1SuppCR98, 101-03.8 Mr. Lyon’s (and his\n\ncompany’s) timely-filed motions for new trial were overruled by operation of law.\n\nCR266-270, 308-314; 1SuppCR50-57. Mr. Lyon (and his company) filed timely\n\nnotice(s) of appeal and made an appropriate cash deposit in lieu of supersedeas\n\nbond. CR277-78, 312-13, 315-323, 347; 1SuppCR5. BGI filed its own timely\n\nnotice of appeal (CR292) and has insisted on parallel briefing tracks.\n\n                             Mr. Lyon’s Issues Presented\n       1.     Whether the trial court erred by (a) denying Mr. Lyon’s motion to\n\ndisregard the jury’s answer to Question No. 4, (b) rendering judgment awarding\n\nBGI statutory damages, interest and attorney’s fees for fraudulent lien, and\n\n(c) denying Mr. Lyon’s motions for new trial.\n\n       2.     Whether the trial court abused its discretion and committed reversible\n\nerror by overruling defendants’ hearsay objections and admitting PX45 during the\n\nbench trial on attorney’s fees.\n\n\n8\n   The first page of all three judgments BGI persuaded the trial court to sign contained an\nuntrue statement that BGI “moved for judgment based on the jury’s verdict.” 10RR23-24.\nBGI’s September 29, 2014 “motion for judgment” (CR175-76) was not a motion for judgment\nbased on the verdict; it also requested breach of subcontract damages not even arguably\nsupported by the jury’s answer to Question No. 3. See 10RR5-6, 23-29; see also CR242 (BGI’s\n“judgment worksheet” filed May 1, 2015); cf. CR129 (jury’s actual verdict regarding breach of\nsubcontract damages).\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f       3.      Whether the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motions for new\n\ntrial asserting no legally and factually sufficient evidence (or sustainable legal\n\npredicate) supports the trial court’s excessive findings and awards for trial and\n\nappellate attorney’s fees.\n\n       4.      Whether the trial court erred by rendering judgment for breach of\n\nsubcontract damages not lawfully supported by the jury’s answer to Question No. 3\n\nand by denying defendants’ motions for new trial.\n\n              Mr. Lyon’s Statement of Undisputed Facts in the Record\n       BGI (through its owner, Chris Arneson) entered into a December 2009\n\nagreement with the owners of Patty Cake Bakery (the Rennicks) to serve as general\n\ncontractor for that project with various plans and specifications. 2RR93-95; PX1,\n\n6, 7. BGI entered into (what the trial court ruled was an ambiguous) subcontract\n\nagreement signed by Mr. Lyon as “Owner” of Lyon Construction. 2RR70-71, 100;\n\nPX2.        Later various disputes arose over the completeness and quality of\n\nsubcontract work performed by (and the remaining amount due) Mr. Lyon;\n\ndissatisfied with his efforts, BGI told Mr. Lyon not to come back to the job site and\n\nterminated him from the project. 2RR162; 3RR135.\n\n       Mr. Lyon proceeded to fax Mr. Arneson and BGI a letter asserting a\n\nremaining balance due of $35,697 and explaining how Mr. Lyon calculated that\n\namount. PX14; 2RR164-65. Mr. Arneson testified at trial he thought the $35,697\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fclaimed in Mr. Lyon’s demand letter (PX14) was “ridiculously high” but he “really\n\ndidn’t know.” 2RR183. In Mr. Arneson’s words: “I didn’t argue with the fact that\n\nhe [Mr. Lyon] was demanding money. I argued with the amounts. In fact, I think\n\nwe [BGI] actually made them [Mr. Lyon / Lyon Construction] a settlement offer\n\nthey turned down.”      2RR183.     See also 3RR60-61 (on cross-examination,\n\nMr. Arneson stood by his testimony the day before that when he and BGI\n\nterminated Lyon Construction, he owed them some money / wasn’t sure if BGI\n\nwas going to owe them money or not).\n\n      Mr. Lyon later filed an affidavit claim of lien against the Patty Cakes Bakery\n\nproject for the same amount ($35,697), and Lyon Construction commenced this\n\nlawsuit in August 2010 against the owners of the property to try to collect that\n\nmoney.   PX16; 3RR11-12, 135-38; CR6-9.          The Rennicks later settled with\n\nLyon Construction (for a payment of $25,000) after Mr. Arneson “encouraged\n\nthem to” do so. 3RR14-15, 66. A predecessor presiding judge signed an order\n\ndismissing with prejudice all claims that had been filed by Lyon Construction\n\nagainst Patty Cakes Bakery and the Rennicks (with each of these parties bearing\n\ntheir own attorney’s fees and costs) in January 2012. CR80-81, 324.\n\n      In November 2013, all remaining claims between and among BGI, Mr. Lyon\n\nand Lyon Construction proceeded to a trial by jury, except attorney’s fees, which\n\nboth sides agreed would be taken up after verdict by a separate motion with the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\ftrial court. 5RR5-6. Both liability and damages were disputed in the trial court by\n\nboth sides, resulting in the voluminous reporter’s record now before this Court.\n\nThe trial court determined questions of subcontract breach (by Mr. Lyon,\n\nMr. Lyon’s company, and BGI) were raised by the evidence for submission to the\n\njury. See CR128-29, 132, 135.\n\n      The jury’s verdict was mostly favorable to BGI and unfavorable to\n\nMr. Lyon. CR123-139. 9 The last-in-time final judgment obtained by BGI below is\n\nthe second “Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc” signed by the trial court on October 13,\n\n2015. 1SuppCR98-103, 43-57. Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction have filed timely\n\nnotice(s) of appeal. CR277-78, 308, 312-13. BGI also filed its own timely notice\n\nof appeal. CR292-93.\n\n                       Mr. Lyon’s Summary of Argument\n      The trial court’s awards for attorney’s fees far exceed actual damages\n\nawarded in the trial court’s final judgment; however, Mr. Lyon has been most\n\nsignificantly harmed (as a businessman and building contractor) by the\n\n“fraudulent lien” theory erroneously found by the jury against him in answer to\n\nQuestion No. 4 (CR130) and the resulting trial court judgment under that theory.\n\nMr. Lyon urgently needs relief from that insupportable jury finding and judgment\n\nand consequently will brief that issue first and most emphatically.\n9\n  The jury answered “No” to Question No. 6 inquiring whether Lyon Properties & Custom\nHomes, LLC failed to comply with its subcontract with BGI. CR132.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f       Mr. Lyon’s remaining issues demonstrate additional reversible errors by the\n\ntrial court in admitting hearsay evidence in support of BGI’s claims for high dollar\n\nattorney’s fees, awarding excessive (and inadequately segregated) attorney’s fees\n\nbased on insufficient evidence (and predicate), and rendering judgment on an\n\ninadequate subcontract damages question.\n\n                        Mr. Lyon’s Arguments and Authorities\n\nI.     The Jury’s Fraudulent Lien Findings, in Answer To Question No. 4,\n       Lack the Required Support of Legally and Factually Sufficient\n       Evidence\n       Mr. Lyon preserved his legal sufficiency challenges by presenting a timely\n\nand proper motion to disregard the jury’s answer to Question No. 4, which the trial\n\ncourt denied. CR141-47, 169-172; 243, 271; 1SuppCR53, CR98. 10 Mr. Lyon\n\npreserved his factual sufficiency challenges regarding Question No. 4 by filing\n\ntimely motions for new trial, which the trial court overruled by operation of law.\n\nCR266, 268, 308, 310; 1SuppCR53n.8; Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(c); see Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 33.1(b); Cecil v. Smith, 804 S.W.2d 509, 511-12 (Tex. 1991). 11 As the plaintiff\n\n\n10\n    See Tex. R. Civ. P. 301 (the court may, upon motion and reasonable notice, “disregard any\njury finding on a question that has no support in the evidence”); Tex. R. Civ. P. 279 (last\nsentence) (“A claim that the evidence was legally or factually insufficient to warrant the\nsubmission of any question may be made for the first time after verdict . . .”). Jury findings\nshould be disregarded (on a proper motion to disregard) when no legally sufficient evidence\nsupports them or when they are immaterial. Spencer v. Eagle Star Ins. Co. of Am., 876\nS.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex. 1994).\n11\n   Factual insufficiency of the evidence to support necessary jury findings supports the granting\nof a new trial. Tex. R. Civ.

Rey Rodriguez,\nRosemarie Kanusky & Mark Emery, Hall’s Standards of Review in Texas, 42 St. Mary’s L.J. 3,\n\n                                              -19-\n\fasserting a cause of action under section 12.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code, it was BGI’s burden to prove all the elements required by the\n\nstatute and the submitted jury charge.12\n\n       In determining whether legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the\n\njury’s fraudulent lien finding in answer to Question No. 4, this Court must construe\n\nsufficiency of the evidence in light of the literal wording of the trial court’s charge\n\nand the unobjected-to instructions submitted with Question No. 4 in the trial\n\ncourt’s charge. See, e.g., Larson v. Cook Consultants, Inc., 690 S.W.2d 567, 568\n\n(Tex. 1985); see also Mancorp, Inc. v. Culpepper, 802 S.W.2d 226, 228\n\n(Tex. 1990) (“appellate courts must consider the evidence and inferences as they\n\ntend to support the verdict and not with a view towards supporting the judgment”)\n\n(italics original); Saenz v. Fidelity & Guaranty Ins. Underwriters, 925 S.W.2d 607,\n\n615-16 (Tex. 1996) (Phillips, C.J., concurring in part, joined by Cornyn & Owen,\n\nJJ.) (acknowledging sufficiency of the evidence to support jury’s finding must be\n\nconstrued in light of “the literal wording of the trial court’s charge . . .”).\n\n\n\n40-42 (2010). The question under existing law is whether evidence said to support a particular\nfinding is so weak, or the evidence contrary to the finding is so overwhelming, that the finding is\nmanifestly unjust and a new trial should be ordered. Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629,\n635 (Tex. 1986).\n12\n    See, e.g., Salomon v. Lesay, 369 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2012,\nno pet.) (also aptly observing: “One of the essential elements of a Section 12.002 claim is that\nthe defendant used a document or record despite knowing that it reflected a fraudulent lien or\nclaim against real property”) (emphases supplied).\n\n\n                                               -20-\n\f      The jury necessarily made several independent, affirmative findings when it\n\nanswered “yes” to Question No. 4, including that Mr. Lyon made, presented or\n\nused his affidavit claim of lien [PX16] with knowledge that it was a fraudulent lien\n\nor claim against real property, with the intent to defraud, and with the intent to\n\ncause BGI to suffer financial injury. CR130. Constructive or imputed knowledge\n\nwas not the question. CR130. Under the trial court’s instructions submitted with\n\nQuestion No. 4, a “yes” answer required that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge that\n\nhis claimed lien was not valid at the time it was filed. CR130. The instructions\n\nunder Question No. 4 went on to state the lien was invalid if the amount claimed\n\nexceeded a formula that was taken from section 53.024 of the Texas Property\n\nCode. See Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 53.024 (Vernon 2014). Exceeded-the-formula\n\nis yet another affirmative finding the jury had to make to answer Question No. 4\n\n“yes” and on which BGI also bore the burden of proof. CR130, 124.\n\n      The reporter’s record from the jury trial contains a few critical exhibits, and\n\nsworn testimony by Mr. Lyon, bearing on whether BGI met its burden of proving\n\nall the elements under Question No. 4 and section 12.002 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code. The first is PX14, Mr. Lyon’s 5-7-2010 two page\n\nletter to Mr. Arneson and BGI explaining Mr. Lyon’s calculation of the $35,697\n\nMr. Lyon claimed was due for work completed. The fax legend at the top of PX14\n\nshows the letter was part of a seven (7) page fax Mr. Lyon sent Mr. Arneson and\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fBGI; however, PX14 as introduced by BGI consists of only two pages. Page 2 of\n\nthat letter explains the financial backup Mr. Lyon was relying on (and faxed to\n\nMr. Arneson and BGI): “Attached are the materials and cost needed through\n\ncompletion per the original plans and contract.” BGI chose to redact from its\n\nExhibit 14 the financial backup Mr. Lyon was relying on for his lien calculation.\n\n      PX14, like PX15 (Mr. Lyon’s 5-25-2014 invoice to BGI for $35,697) and\n\nPX16 (affidavit claim of lien for $35,697 Mr. Lyon filed 6-4-2010), was admitted\n\ninto evidence without objection. 2RR164, 163; 3RR6. All three are probative of\n\n(if anything) Mr. Lyon’s actual subjective belief in May and June 2010 that the\n\namount then due him was $35,697. And Mr. Lyon consistently testified under oath\n\nthat when he filed his affidavit claim of lien, he believed he was owed the amount\n\nthat was stated on the lien at that time, which was $35,697. 5RR44-45.\n\n      It was undisputed in the evidence that when Mr. Arneson first received\n\nPX14, he didn’t really know for sure whether there was any possibility BGI might\n\nowe Mr. Lyon some money for the work he had done because BGI hadn’t\n\ncompleted or hadn’t gotten the chance to complete the work BGI felt was needed\n\nfor repairs; Mr. Arneson testified as follows before the jury: “I didn’t argue with\n\nthe fact that [Mr. Lyon] was demanding money. I argued with the amounts. In\n\nfact, I think we actually made them a settlement offer [Mr. Lyon and\n\nLyon Construction] turned down.” 2RR183. The reporter’s record contains no\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fcorrespondence documenting any such argument between Mr. Arneson and\n\nMr. Lyon, but be that as it may, these testimonial admissions by Mr. Arneson for\n\nBGI (and BGI’s settlement offer to Mr. Lyon) are consistent with Mr. Lyon’s\n\nactual subjective belief in May and June of 2010 that the remaining amount due\n\nMr. Lyon was $35,697. Granted, that amount later become the subject of dispute\n\nand disagreement; however, subsequent disagreement over the proper amount of\n\nMr. Lyon’s clamed lien is zero evidence Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge in May\n\nand June of 2010 that his claimed lien was invalid.\n\n      The fraudulent lien finding in this case is extremely serious to Mr. Lyon and\n\nhis ability to do business in the future.       It’s just as harmful to Mr. Lyon’s\n\nconstruction business and professional reputation (indeed, probably more harmful)\n\nthan the erroneous written decision admonishing Hon. Michelle Slaughter for\n\n“willfully” violating the Code of Judicial Conduct by certain actions as a judge.\n\nSee In re Hon. Michelle Slaughter, Presiding Judge of the 405th Judicial District\n\nCourt, Galveston County, Texas, Docket No. 15-0001 (Special Court of Review of\n\nTexas Sep. 30, 2015) (per curiam); http://judgemichelleslaughter.com/justice-\n\nprevails/.   Willfully is lower on the scienter continuum than knowingly;\n\nnevertheless, the Special Court of Review of Texas correctly dismissed all charges\n\nagainst Hon. Michelle Slaughter because the evidence against her showed she\n\ncommitted (at most) an “error in judgment . . .” (Slip op. at 18).\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f       Likewise, the jury’s findings in answer to Question No. 4 against Mr. Lyon\n\nare unsupported by the evidence under governing Texas substantive law. By stark\n\n(and informative) contrast, Florida’s statute permits liability when a claimed lien\n\namount is “willfully exaggerated” through “gross negligence.” See Fraudulent\n\nConstruction Liens: Willful Exaggeration or Good Faith Dispute, 75 Fla. B.J. 34\n\n(Mar. 2001).13 Mr. Lyon believes the evidence in the reporter’s record would not\n\nsupport liability even under Florida’s lower willful exaggeration / gross negligence\n\nstandard (just like the evidence did not support admonishing Judge Slaughter for\n\nweb posting facts from a pending case in her court),14 but that kind of question was\n\n\n13\n      Florida’s “fraudulent” lien statute authorizes liability when “the lienor has willfully\nexaggerated the amount for which such lien is claimed” or “has compiled his or her claim with\nsuch willful and gross negligence as to amount to a willful exaggeration . . . .” Fla. Stat. Ann.\n§ 713.31(2)(a) (emphases supplied). See, e.g., Casa Linda Tile & Marble Installers, Inc. v.\nHighlands Place 1981, Ltd., 642 So. 2d 766, 768-69 (Fla. 4th DCA 1994) (reversing because\n“the record does not support a conclusion that this was not a good faith dispute over\nworkmanship concerning the balance owed for work performed”) (appeals court also reversed\n“all awards of costs and attorney’s fees, subject to resolution of all other issues on remand”); see\ngenerally Vinci Dev. Co. v. Connell, 509 So. 2d 1128, 1132 (Fla. 2d DCA 1987) (per curiam)\n(“[a] subsequent dispute between the parties as to the amount of compensation due according to\nthe contract plan of compensation or even a dispute as to the method of compensation provided\nin the contract does not convert such a good faith dispute into a fraudulent lien . . .”).\n14\n    Cf. Luna v. North Star Dodge Sales, Inc., 667 S.W.2d 115, 118 (Tex. 1984) (“If a person\ncommits a wrongful act with actual awareness of the falsity, deception or unfairness of the act,\nthen this is a more culpable mental state than one who is grossly negligent. We are not\nattempting to equate the terms gross negligence, ‘knowingly,’ ‘willful’ and intentional. These\nterms lie on a continuum with gross negligence being the lowest mental state and intentional\nbeing the highest”); St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Dal-Worth Tank Co., 974 S.W.2d 51, 53-\n54 (Tex. 1998) (per curiam) (finding that a party “acted knowingly” does not require evidence\nmerely that the person knew what he was doing; rather, it requires evidence that the person knew\nwhat he was doing was false, deceptive, or unfair. In other words, a person must think to\nhimself at some point, “Yes, I know this is false, deceptive, or unfair to him, but I’m going to do\nit anyway”) (bold emphasis supplied). The reporter’s record contains not even a scintilla of\n\n                                               -24-\n\fnot before the jury nor is it before the Court in this case. Texas’s lawmakers chose\n\nnot to promulgate the lower scienter standard previously promulgated by Florida’s\n\nlawmakers. Instead, under governing Texas substantive law (and the trial court’s\n\nsubmitted Question No. 4), legally and factually sufficient evidence had to\n\nestablish Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge his claimed lien was invalid in May and\n\nJune of 2010. There is no such evidence in the reporter’s record whatsoever.\n\n         Mr. Lyon testified live before the jury that he was trying to be as fair as he\n\ncould when he calculated the $35,697 set out in his May 2010 letter, the same\n\ncalculation he used when he filed his affidavit claim of lien against the Rennicks’\n\nproperty in June 2010. 3RR135-38; PX16. The jury of course had a right to\n\ndisbelieve Mr. Lyon’s testimony, but that does not supply evidence to the contrary,\n\ni.e., that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge his claimed $35,697 lien amount was\n\ninvalid.15 The Court should ask itself (and BGI during oral arguments, if needed):\n\n\n\nevidence that Mr. Lyon actually knew (i.e., thought to himself) his affidavit claim was false and\nfraudulent. The court’s charge in this case (like section 12.002 of the Texas Civil Practice and\nRemedies Code) did not authorize punishing liability under some lesser scienter standard. There\nis no legally (nor factually) sufficient evidence in the reporter’s record that Mr. Lyon filed his\naffidavit claim of lien with knowledge that it was fraudulent, with the intent to defraud, and with\nthe intent to cause BGI to suffer financial injury. CR130. Cf. Centurion Planning Corp. v.\nSeabrook Venture II, 176 S.W.3d 498, 507 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.)\n(concluding record contained “more than a scintilla of evidence establishing that Knickerbocker\nhad violated section 12.002 when he ‘made, presented, or used the lien’ knowing, based on the\nlack of a written contract, that the lien was invalid and intending that it be given the same legal\neffect as a valid lien”) (emphasis supplied). There is no evidence (and should be no contention)\nthat Mr. Lyon’s claimed lien was invalid based on lack of a written contract. See PX2.\n15\n     See Missouri-K.T. R.R. v. McFerrin, 156 Tex. 69, 90, 291 S.W.2d 931, 945 (1956).\n\n\n                                               -25-\n\fwhy did BGI deliberately redact from PX14 all the pages of financial backup\n\nMr. Lyon was expressly relying on when he sent Mr. Arneson and BGI his seven\n\npage fax in May 2010. 16 The reason is BGI knew those pages would have shown\n\nthe fairness and reasonableness of Mr. Lyon’s $35,697 lien calculation. And they\n\nwould have conclusively and overwhelmingly disproved the required element BGI\n\nbore the burden of proving: that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge his claimed lien\n\nwas invalid and fraudulent. CR130. The reporter’s record is devoid of such\n\nevidence; Mr. Lyon’s professional reputation and livelihood will unjustly be\n\neviscerated by this verdict and judgment (if affirmed); and this Court ought not\n\n“pass[] by on the other side.” Luke 10:31-32 (King James).\n\n       Simply put, no “evidence” proves it is “more likely true than not true”\n\n(CR124) that Mr. Lyon actually knew his claimed lien amount was invalid.\n\n16\n   The trial court apparently believed that the admission of PX14 “without objection” during the\njury trial was important in determining the legal sufficiency (or insufficiency) of BGI’s evidence\nconcerning fraudulent lien. 10RR16-18. Again, PX14 (if anything) was probative of\nMr. Lyon’s belief at the time that the $35,697 he was claiming was appropriate. But even\nignoring the probative value of PX14 in Mr. Lyon’s favor as the exhibit was admitted without\nobjection, BGI still needed (and lacks) evidence that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge his claimed\namount due was invalid. See generally Coalition of Cities v. Public Util. Comm’n, 798\nS.W.2d 560, 563-64 (Tex. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 983 (1991) (a party who fails to meet its\nburden of proof “loses” and it “is not entitled to a second trial to present more evidence”); Texas\nReal Estate Comm’n v. Nagle, 767 S.W.2d 691, 695 (Tex. 1989) (“In an ordinary adversarial\nproceeding the failure of a party bearing the burden of proof would ordinarily result in rendition\nof judgment against that party”); Vista Chevrolet, Inc. v. Lewis, 709 S.W.2d 176, 176-77\n(Tex. 1986) (per curiam) (emphasizing that rendition in such circumstances is “a basic rule of\nlaw”); Jelinek v. Casas, 328 S.W.3d 526, 538 (Tex. 2010) (despite recognizing “the difficulty of\nproving” one fact essential to plaintiffs’ claims — and sympathizing with the plaintiffs’\nfrustration over the defendant’s conduct — supreme court rendered a take-nothing judgment\nbecause the plaintiffs “shouldered that burden” in their “quest” to hold the defendant liable).\n\n\n                                               -26-\n\fCR130.     With utmost respect, if this Court applies the same standards to\n\nMr. Lyon’s conduct that the Special Court of Review of Texas applied to exonerate\n\nHon. Michelle Slaughter, this Court could never conclude there was evidence that\n\nMr. Lyon knowingly filed a fraudulent affidavit claim of lien (much less did so\n\nwith the required “intent to defraud” and the required “intent to cause\n\nBuilding Galveston to suffer financial injury”).        CR130.      Cf. U.S. Const.\n\namend. XIV, § 1 (“No State . . . shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\n\nequal protection of the laws”). The evidence in the reporter’s record does not even\n\ncome close to proving Mr. Lyon knowingly filed a fraudulent affidavit claim of\n\nlien (CR130); in the words of the Special Court of Review of Texas vindicating\n\nHon. Michelle Slaughter, Mr. Lyon’s claimed lien amount was (at most) an “error\n\nin judgment” (even if BGI had met its burden of proving the statutory formula\n\nsubmitted with Question No. 4 would have yielded a lesser permissible lien\n\namount, which BGI did not do).\n\n      Mr. Lyon should never have been found guilty of knowingly filing a\n\nfraudulent affidavit claim of lien. He should never have been ordered to pay\n\nstatutory damages (and three-fold statutory attorney’s fees) on BGI’s meritless\n\nstatutory fraudulent lien claim. And he should never have his business and all-\n\nimportant reputation as a building contractor eviscerated by this unsupported\n\nverdict resulting from skillful lawyering of the (Mills Shirley litigation partner\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fChris Garcia’s words) “[t]oo many” (11RR56) Mills Shirley L.L.P. attorneys\n\nrepresenting Building Galveston in this case against an out-of-town litigant. On\n\nthis record, the actual knowledge inference BGI would have this Court draw is\n\ninappropriate as a matter of law and fact. 17\n\n       But before the Court even gets to the question of actual knowledge of\n\ninvalidity, there is a threshold evidentiary deficit:               where is BGI’s required\n\nevidence that Mr. Lyon’s claimed $35,697 lien amount “exceeds” the amount\n\npermitted by the formula set out in Property Code section 53.024?

CR16, 38, 50, 53, 109. BGI’s unsworn\n\npetitions, however, were neither offered nor admitted into evidence for the jury’s\n\nconsideration on this additional element BGI also bore the burden of proving.\n\n       The reporter’s record shows that BGI’s lead trial counsel wished to display\n\nsection 53.024 of the Property Code in front of the jury and criticize Mr. Lyon\n\nbecause he did not perform his lien calculations based on the somewhat confusing\n\nformula set forth in that statute. 3RR152-55. There is evidence that Mr. Lyon\n\ncalculated his claimed lien amount based on what he considered fair, relying on a\n\nstate website he had found on the Internet (3RR151-52), rather than utilizing the\n\nformula set out in the instructions the trial court submitted under Question No. 4\n\nbased on the statute. Regardless, neither Mr. Lyon, Mr. Arneson, nor any other\n\nwitness testified before the jury that Mr. Lyon’s claimed $35,697 “exceeds” the\n\namount that would be yielded by applying by the statutory formula. There’s just\n\nno evidence on this issue.\n\n       Significantly, during a bench conference, outside the hearing of the jury,\n\nBGI’s lead trial counsel, Mr. Lyford, argued to the trial court that Mr. Lyon’s\n\n$35,697 calculation “exceeds” the maximum amount section 53.024 of the\n\n18\n    Cf. Nathan L. Hecht, Foreword: W. Wendell Hall, Revisiting Standards of Review in Civil\nAppeals, 24 St. Mary’s L.J. 1041, 1043 (1993) (“I have learned in more than a decade of judging\nthat what is claimed to be clear seldom is”).\n\n\n                                             -29-\n\fProperty Code would have permitted. 3RR154 (152, 155). But even if the jurors\n\ncould have heard Mr. Lyford’s ipse dixit, the reporter’s record of this jury trial\n\nreflects without dispute that attorney Lyford: (1) was not sworn in as a witness;\n\n(2) was arguing to the court outside the hearing of the jury; (3) was not testifying\n\nfrom the witness stand; and (4) gave no testimony the jurors heard (or could have\n\nlawfully considered) in reaching their answer to Question No. 4. 19\n\n       Mr. Lyford also emphasized the following point during BGI’s closing\n\narguments to the jury: “The trial has been unusual in that we have not had any\n\npaid expert witnesses.” 5RR120. Mr. Lyford was correct on that one point. The\n\nreporter’s record shows that no paid expert, no fact witness, and no other witness\n\ntestified before the jury that Mr. Lyon’s $35,697 calculation “exceeds” the\n\nstatutory limit in Property Code section 53.024.                 BGI might have hired a\n\nconstruction lien or accounting expert to try and prove Mr. Lyon’s claimed\n\n$35,697 exceeded the amount permitted by statute and the instructions submitted\n\nunder Question No. 4 in the Court’s charge, but BGI chose not to do so.\n\n       Under the submitted charge and as a matter of law, it was BGI’s burden to\n\nprove, as a threshold matter, that Mr. Lyon’s $35,697 lien calculation exceeded the\n\nstatutory limit in Property Code section 53.024.

The jury had no evidence before it\n\nestablishing proportionate value and proportionate profit margin in relation to the\n\ntotal subcontract price. The fact that Mr. Lyon unwisely relied on a state website\n\nhe found on the Internet and his own views of fairness — instead of the statutory\n\nformula — is at most an “error in judgment”; however, it is zero evidence that his\n\nclaimed $35,697 lien amount actually “exceeds” the statutory limit in Property\n\nCode section 53.024. On that basis alone, the jury’s answer to Question No. 4\n\nshould have been disregarded, or a new trial should have been granted.\n\n      But even if this Court assumed Mr. Lyon’s claimed lien amount was not\n\nvalid (i.e., exceeded what would be permitted under the statute), Question No. 4\n\nadditionally and independently required BGI to prove Mr. Lyon had actual\n\nknowledge that the amount claimed was invalid and therefore fraudulent. CR130.\n\nBGI’s written response in the trial court cited irrelevant common-law fraud and\n\npremises liability case law, erroneously arguing circumstantial evidence supports a\n\ninference of actual knowledge by Mr. Lyon. CR180. Common-law fraud does not\n\nrequire actual knowledge of falsity; a “recklessly” false representation is enough\n\nunder Texas law. See, e.g., Superior Trucks, Inc. v. Allen, 664 S.W.2d 136, 142\n\n(Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1983, writ ref’d n.r.e.); Christus Health Gulf Coast\n\nv. Carswell, 433 S.W.3d 585, 602, 604-05 (Tex.

J. 1067 (June 12, 2015) (cause no. 14-0362) (oral\n\narguments heard Nov. 13, 2015).\n\n      Moreover, if Texas premises liability law were relevant, Texas premises\n\nliability law teaches that actual knowledge means “what a person actually knows\n\nas distinguished from constructive or imputed knowledge; that is, what a person\n\ndoes not actually know, but should know or have reason to know. . . . Even when\n\nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding of actual knowledge by Price.” Price\n\nConstr., Inc. v. Castillo, 147 S.W.3d 431, 437 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 2004),\n\npet. denied, 209 S.W.3d 90 (Tex. 2005). Equally, the evidence in the reporter’s\n\nrecord is legally (and factually) insufficient to support the jury’s finding of actual\n\nknowledge by Mr. Lyon. CR130.\n\n      Again, the Court should recall that (as a matter of trial strategy) BGI\n\ndeliberately redacted from BGI’s Exhibit 14 the financial backup Mr. Lyon\n\nexpressly and openly relied upon when he sent Mr. Arneson and Building\n\nGalveston his seven page fax explaining his $35,697 balance due calculation in\n\nMay 2010. PX14. Without those pages in the reporter’s record, the jurors (1) had\n\nno idea what was in Mr. Lyon’s mind (see 10RR16-18), and (2) had no legally (nor\n\nfactually) sufficient evidentiary basis on which they could find Mr. Lyon had\n\nactual knowledge that his claimed lien amount was invalid in May or June 2010.\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fThe jury’s answer to Question No. 4 should have been disregarded (or a new trial\n\ngranted) for this independent reason as well.\n\n       The reporter’s record contains no evidence whatsoever, direct or\n\ncircumstantial, that Mr. Lyon ever thought to himself: “Yes, I know my claimed\n\n$35,697 lien is invalid or fraudulent, but I’m going to file it anyway.” BGI has\n\nargued legitimate inferences arise from the facts that Mr. Lyon did not calculate his\n\nclaimed lien amount in the way required by the Property Code, that Mr. Lyon\n\nshared office space with his father’s office (Law Offices of Ted B. Lyon &\n\nAssociates),20 and that Mr. Lyon purportedly tried to mislead or “defraud” the jury\n\nwith a liability insurance certificate dated after 2010. CR170; 1SuppCR94.21 But\n\nnone of that evidence — even as misleadingly characterized below by BGI —\n\n20\n     This fact would would have zero tendency to support the jury’s findings in answer to\nQuestion No. 4, even if this Court did not know (or could not take judicial notice) that\nMr. Lyon’s father, Ted B. Lyon, Jr. (with whom Mr. Lyon shared office space) was — before\nbecoming a trial lawyer — a respected police officer, Texas state representative, and later Texas\nstate senator. See generally Crim Truck & Tractor Co. v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 823\nS.W.2d 591, 592-93 n.l (Tex. 1992) (first inquiry on “no evidence” review addresses “the quality\nof the evidence offered,” inquiring whether the evidence actually “has a tendency to prove the\nexistence of a material fact”) (emphasis supplied).\n21\n   BGI persuaded the trial court to sustain its “predicate” objections and exclude evidence that\nwould have let lay jurors understand that an ACORD certificate of liability insurance is\ninformational only and would reflect the date such a certificate was issued by Mr. Lyon’s\ninsurance agent — in this case apparently 10/28/2013, shortly before the jury trial commenced\n— as opposed to when the original liability insurance policy was issued. See 5RR28-30\n(Mr. Lyford successfully asserting “[t]he predicate’s not laid . . . and I object” to which the trial\ncourt responded: “Sustained”). Mr. Lyon is not challenging that trial court ruling in this appeal;\nhowever, Mr. Lyon’s issue 2 (argued at pages 37-45, below) will likewise ask this Court to\nenforce the rules excluding hearsay evidence because BGI did not meet BGI’s burden of proving\na proper predicate for admitting PX45 (detailed Mills Shirley billing records admitted to support\nBGI’s claims for high dollar attorney’s fees) over Mr. Lyon’s hearsay objections. 11RR33-36.\n\n\n                                               -33-\n\fsupports a legitimate inference that Mr. Lyon thought to himself at some point:\n\n“Yes, I know my claimed $35,697 lien is invalid or fraudulent, but I’m going to\n\nfile it anyway.” See and compare St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Dal-Worth\n\nTank Co., 974 S.W.2d 51, 53-54 (Tex. 1998) (per curiam).\n\n      The jury’s “yes” answer to Question No. 4 lacks the required support of\n\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence, and the jury’s answer should have been\n\ndisregarded or a new trial should have been granted.\n\n      As yet another stand-alone, additional element, the jury’s “yes” answer\n\nQuestion No. 4 also required a finding that Mr. Lyon made, presented, or used his\n\naffidavit claim of lien “with the intent to defraud . . . .” CR130. The trial court’s\n\ncharge did not define “intent to defraud” so instead of the common-law definition,\n\nthe jurors were required to apply the “commonly understood” meaning of fraud.\n\nCR125. Black’s Law Dictionary teaches “Intent to defraud means an intention to\n\ndeceive another person and to induce such other person, in reliance upon such\n\ndeception, to assume, create, transfer, alter or terminate a right, obligation or power\n\nwith reference to property.”     Black’s Law Dict. 381 (5th ed. 1979) (emphases\n\nsupplied). The American Heritage Dictionary gives this definition: “de-fraud . . .\n\nTo take from or deprive by fraud, swindle.”            American Heritage Dict. 376\n\n(2nd college ed. 1985) (emphases supplied). See also id. at 668 (“in-tent . . . That\n\nwhich is intended; purpose”) (emphases supplied).\n\n\n                                         -34-\n\f      The reporter’s record contains zero testimony (and supports no legitimate\n\ninference) that Mr. Lyon intended to deceive or had a purpose to swindle anyone.\n\nPX14, even as redacted by BGI’s trial counsel, shows Mr. Lyon was above-board,\n\nforthcoming and transparent with how he calculated his $35,697 claim for funds\n\ndue for the work completed. Again, page 2 of that faxed letter shows BGI did not\n\nwant the jurors to see (like BGI saw) the attachment pages that were the financial\n\nbackup Mr. Lyon openly relied upon and faxed to Mr. Arneson and BGI in\n\nMay 2010. PX16, the affidavit claim of lien filed the following month, claimed the\n\nidentical $35,697 lien amount and relied on the same calculations and redacted\n\nfinancial backup BGI had received by fax the month before but did not want the\n\njurors to see. Because there is no legally (nor factually) sufficient evidence that\n\nMr. Lyon made, presented, or used his affidavit claim of lien with the intent to\n\ndefraud, the jury’s “yes” answer to Question No. 4 should have been disregarded\n\n(or a new trial should have been granted) for this independent reason as well.\n\n      Finally, as yet one additional, stand-alone independent no-evidence ground,\n\nthe “yes” answer to Question No. 4 also required the jury to find that Mr. Lyon\n\nmade, presented or used his affidavit claim of lien “with the intent to cause\n\nBuilding Galveston, Inc. to suffer financial injury.” CR130. If this Court assumed\n\n(for sake of argument) that all the other elements were somehow supported by\n\nevidence in the reporter’s record, the Court should still reverse because no legally\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\f(and no factually) sufficient evidence established that Mr. Lyon made, presented or\n\nused his lien with intent to cause BGI to suffer financial injury. 22\n\n       PX16 shows Mr. Lyon’s affidavit claim of lien was filed against the Patty\n\nCakes Bakery property owned by the Rennicks (accord CR6-9); however, the\n\nreporter’s record contains no evidence indicating Mr. Lyon’s affidavit claim of lien\n\nwas ever asserted against BGI. Although BGI presented some evidence that, by\n\nagreement between BGI and the Rennicks, the $25,000 paid by the Rennicks to\n\nsettle Mr. Lyon’s lien claim was withheld from BGI’s retainage (3RR14-15), there\n\nwas no evidence this was the intent or purpose of Mr. Lyon. Instead, the only\n\nevidence is that Mr. Lyon’s intent in making, presenting or using the lien was to\n\nreceive payment from the Rennicks. PX16; 3RR11-12, 135-38; CR6-9.23\n\n\n\n\n22\n    The (Bexar County) jury refused to find make a “fraudulent lien” finding in Alanis v.\nUS Bank N.A., No. 01-14-00559-CV (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] Nov. 03, 2015, n.p.h.), so\nthat recent decision is not on point procedurally; however, this Court did correctly observe:\n“Alanis provided no evidence that either US Bank or BAC intended to cause her physical injury,\nfinancial injury, or mental anguish.” See id. (Slip op. at 37). Similarly, Building Galveston\nintroduced no evidence from which Building Galveston’s (Galveston County) jury could have\nlawfully found Mr. Lyon “intend[ed] to cause Building Galveston, Inc. to suffer financial\ninjury.” CR130.\n23\n     Cf. Gray v. Entis Mechanical Servs., LLC, No. 01-11-00129-CV (Tex. App.--Houston\n[1st Dist.] Apr. 26, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.) (Slip op. at 13) (upholding trial court fraudulent-\nlien finding in that bench-tried case because (unlike Mr. Lyon) appellant Gray — among other\nthings — (1) “attempt[ed] to create tax problems for Entis by asking a third person to withhold\nneeded tax information from Entis until Entis would agree to add Gray’s names to its liens” and\n(2) “sought criminal charges against Entis for theft of services despite Gray’s bill not yet being\ndue” and (3) “did not file and maintain the liens to secure payment” and thus: “[T]he evidence\nas a whole supports the trial court’s finding that Gray intended to cause Entis financial harm”).\n\n\n                                              -36-\n\f       The reporter’s record contains evidence that Mr. Arneson and BGI\n\nencouraged the Rennicks to pay Mr. Lyon $25,000 — 70 cents on the dollar — in\n\nsettlement of his claimed $35,697 lien (3RR63-66); however, the reporter’s record\n\ncontains no shred of evidence, as required for the jury’s “yes” answer to\n\nQuestion No. 4, that Mr. Lyon made, presented or used the lien with intent to cause\n\nBGI to suffer financial injury.          CR130.24      That additional element was not\n\naddressed by BGI’s evidence (at all), and Question No. 4 should have been be\n\ndisregarded (or new trial granted) for this independent reason as well.\n\n       With respect, the trial court’s judgment awarding damages and attorney’s\n\nfees for filing a fraudulent lien is erroneous as a matter of law and fact, will cause\n\nimmense additional harm if not corrected, and should accordingly be reversed.\n\nII.    The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion and Committed Reversible Error\n       by Overruling Hearsay Objections and Admitting PX45 into Evidence\n       The trial court’s final judgment orders that BGI shall recover from Mr. Lyon\n\nattorney’s fees in the amount of $142,556.42, plus $20,000 for any unsuccessful\n\nappeal to this Court, plus additional amounts for any unsuccessful appeal to the\n\nTexas Supreme Court. 1SuppCR101-03. As the party applying for these lodestar\n\n\n\n\n24\n    During the December 2014 motion to disregard hearing, BGI’s lead trial counsel argued to the\ntrial court that Mr. Lyon “knew” BGI had a statutory duty to defend Patty Cakes Bakery\n(10RR21); however, the reporter’s record includes no witness’s testimony supporting that\nargument by BGI’s lead trial counsel.\n\n\n                                             -37-\n\fawards (11RR37), BGI bore the burden of proof in the trial court. See El Apple I,\n\nLtd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 762-63 (Tex. 2012).\n\n       El Apple I was decided in June 2012, more than one year before BGI’s\n\nliability claims against Mr. Lyon (and Lyon Construction) were tried to the jury in\n\nNovember 2013, and nearly three years before BGI’s claims for attorney’s fees\n\nwere tried to the court in April 2015. 1SuppCR98-99. Our supreme court’s\n\nJune 2012 El Apple I decision authoritatively established that, except in the\n\nsimplest cases, detailed billing records or other documentary evidence should be\n\nrequired to substantiate a claim for attorney’s fees, such evidence permitting the\n\ncourt to see “(1) the nature of the work, (2) who performed the services and their\n\nrate, (3) approximately when the services were performed, and (4) the number of\n\nhours worked.” 370 S.W.3d at 762-63. 25\n\n       No doubt aware of its heightened substantive burden of proof under\n\nEl Apple I, BGI sought to introduce its Galveston law firm’s lengthy, detailed\n\nbilling records [PX45] into evidence (in April 2015), with the reporter’s record\n\n\n\n25\n    Cf. id at 764 (remanding for a redetermination of attorney’s fees, rather than rendering,\nbecause “the attorneys in this [i.e., the El Apple I] case may not have contemporaneous billing\nrecords that document their time as we have not heretofore explained the proof necessary to\nsupport a fee application under the lodestar method”) (emphasis supplied); accord D&M Marine,\nInc. v.

TAYLOR: I misspoke then. No. The predicate has not\n      been laid to show that these are business records, that they were\n      contemporaneously made; and I add, too, that a supplement was sent\n      to us while we were driving down to Galveston yesterday. So I make\n      all those objections respectfully.\n\n             MR. LYFORD: First of all, he’s testifying as an expert. So\n      he’s allowed to testify about the things that he’s reviewed. I can take\n      the time to qualify these as business records. If counsel really wants\n      us to do that, I’ll be happy to.\n             THE COURT: All right. Go right ahead.\n\n            Q.

Neither did BGI attorney’s fee\nexpert Jack Brock give any such testimony. Cf. 11RR70-71, 80 (Mr. Brock testifying that\ncertain “percentages were reached in combination with discussions with Mr. Garcia in relying, to\na large extent, on [Mr. Garcia’s] personal knowledge of what was involved” and, further,\nMr. Brock thinks Mr. Garcia is “a credible witness”).\n\n\n                                               -40-\n\f            Q.

Without custodian “testimony” supporting “all”\n\nthe conditions required by Rule 803(6), it was a violation of Rules 801 and 802, an\n\nabuse of discretion under this Court’s precedent, and reversible error to overrule\n\nMr. Lyon’s hearsay objections and to admit PX45 into evidence.

CR268-69, 311.\n\n      Mr. Lyon’s timely-filed motions for new trial also asserted the amounts\n\nawarded are excessive; manifestly too large; unsupported by legally or factually\n\nsufficient evidence appropriately segregating fees (a) among claims for which\n\nattorney’s fees may and may not be recovered, and (b) between defendants against\n\nwhom (or which) attorney’s fees may and may not be recovered; and (with respect)\n\nan abuse of discretion.

Those rulings\n\nwere also in error.    See generally Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212\n\nS.W.3d 299, 313-14 (Tex. 2006) (“if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for\n\nwhich such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from\n\nunrecoverable fees.     Intertwined facts do not make [unrecoverable] fees\n\nrecoverable; it is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\nunrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated”).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -46-\n\f      In this case, it is undisputed that BGI incurred considerably more in\n\nattorney’s fees pursuing BGI’s breach of subcontract action (for which the trial\n\ncourt ruled attorney’s fees are not recoverable under chapter 38) than BGI incurred\n\npursuing its claims for invalid lien and fraudulent lien. PX46. The record shows\n\nthe trial court sustained defendants’ no-pleading objection regarding the required\n\npresentment, denied BGI’s claim for attorney’s fees under section 38.001 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and granted BGI’s motion for attorney’s\n\nfees only under Tex. Prop. Code section 53.156 and Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\nsection 12.002. 11RR11, 85, 87; 1SuppCR98-99.\n\n      BGI’s total requested attorney’s fees through the trial were $158,396.02,\n\nreduced by only 10% (to $142,556.42) if (as the trial court later ruled) fees for\n\nbreach of contract were disallowed and recovery of fees was allowed only for\n\ninvalid lien and fraudulent lien. PX46. BGI’s exhibit asserts there should be only\n\na 12% reduction (down to $139,388.50) if both breach of contract and fraudulent\n\nlien are disregarded, and there were a recovery only for invalid lien. PX46.\n\n      As already demonstrated, the judgment for fraudulent lien lacks the required\n\nsupport of legally and factually sufficient evidence.      Once that judgment is\n\nproperly reversed, BGI will have no recovery for invalid lien as a matter of law\n\nbecause this Court’s duty, upon reversing, will be to render the judgment the trial\n\ncourt should rendered (i.e., render judgment ordering that BGI take nothing from\n\n\n                                       -47-\n\fMr. Lyon on BGI’s claim for fraudulent lien under section 12.002 of the Texas\n\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code) (or alternatively order a general remand for\n\nfurther proceedings). See Tex. R.

For instance, if the Court -- even\n\nthough the Court awarded fraudulent lien, it would be appropriate for the Court in\n\na judgment to suggest that if the fraudulent lien were set aside, then here’s what the\n\nfees would be.” 11RR73. Mr. Brock continued: “In the event this case were\n\nappealed, then that gives the appellate court the ability to modify the judgment, as\n\nopposed to remanding for the determination.”                    11RR73.        Again correctly\n\nforeseeing this Court’s judgment of reversal, Mr. Brock further continued: “[N]ow\n\nthat the appellate court, for instance, has said fraudulent lien was improper, that\n\nthere wasn’t adequate or sufficient evidence, then the Court could modify its [sic]\n\njudgment as it relates to the attorneys’ fees without having to remand it [sic] back\n\nto the trial court.” 11RR73 (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n\n31\n   Apart from the jury’s answer to Question No. 4 (and the trial court’s final judgment awarding\nBGI damages on its “fraudulent lien” claim), the record in this case contains no trial court order,\nadjudication or decree declaring Mr. Lyon’s earlier claim of lien is valid or invalid or,\nalternatively, inferior to the claim of any other creditor.\n\n\n                                               -50-\n\f       Despite these entreaties by Mr. Brock, the trial court chose not to make\n\nadditional or alternative findings segregating fees among the various causes of\n\naction, and thus a new trial on attorney’s fees is required at a minimum. Nor has\n\nBGI at any time (even in BGI’s Exhibit 46) segregated fees for making claims\n\nagainst Mr. Lyon (against whom the trial court did award attorney’s fees) as\n\nopposed to Lyon Construction (against which the trial court held neither damages\n\nnor attorney’s fees were recoverable). Consequently, even if some portion of the\n\nattorney’s fees might arguably be recoverable under section 53.156 of the Property\n\nCode (which Mr. Lyon respectfully denies), this Court cannot make original fact\n\nfindings on attorney’s fees. 32           Instead, as BGI’s attorney’s fee expert\n\nacknowledged, a remand for further trial court proceedings on attorney’s fees\n\nwould be necessary.\n\n       On this record, the trial court’s awards of trial and appellate attorney’s fees\n\nto BGI are legally unsupported, factually excessive, not adequately segregated\n\namong parties and claims, and (with respect) were an abuse of discretion.\n\nMr. Lyon’s issue 3 should accordingly be sustained, the trial court’s excessive (and\n\ninadequately segregated) awards for trial and appellate attorney’s fees should be\n\nreversed, and the case should be remanded for a new trial.\n\n\n32\n    See Trevino v.

When writing its judgment, however, this Court should\n\nremember that questions of subcontract compliance were hotly disputed (on both\n\nsides) below, and the trial court determined questions of subcontract breach (by\n\nboth sides) were raised for submission to the jury.

During the December 2014 motion to disregard\n\nhearing, Mr. Lyon’s counsel pointed out the damages portion of BGI’s motion was\n\ninappropriate and the most Question 3 even arguably supported was a judgment\n\nfor principal damages of about $15,800 (instead of $40,000). 10RR23-25, 27-29.\n\n      Later BGI’s trial counsel admitted in correspondence to the trial court (with\n\nan enclosed “JUDGMENT WORKSHEET”) that Question No. 3 did not support\n\n$40,889.84 in principal damages (as BGI had previously requested) but instead\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f(according to counsel’s post-verdict calculations) a “Recoverable Difference” of\n\njust $15,889.84. CR240, 242. After the trial court rendered judgment awarding\n\nBGI $15,889.84 for breach of contract (CR245, 273) — based on BGI’s judgment\n\nworksheet calculations (CR242), instead of the the jury’s answers to Question\n\nNo. 3 (CR129) — defendants timely filed motions for new trial asserting the jury’s\n\nanswers to Question No. 3 were not only “excessive” and “manifestly too large”\n\nbut also asserting:\n\n            Question No. 3 as submitted to the jury is also too vague and\n      confusing to support the Court’s awarding $15,889.84 (or any\n      amount) for BGI’s breach of contract damages. There is no express\n      finding by the jury supporting the Court’s $15,889.84 award for BGI’s\n      breach of contract claims, and Question No. 3 cannot salvage the\n      Court’s 5-19-2015 (7-31-2015) judgment on appeal. See generally\n      Lovelace v. Sabine Consolidated, Inc., 733 S.W.2d 648, 655\n      (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, writ denied) (“[The appellee]\n      mistakes where the duty to submit separate jury findings on damages\n      lies. An appellant cannot be held accountable for the failure of an\n      appellee to secure separate jury findings upon which an accurate\n      judgment could be based”).\n\nCR267-68 (309). The trial court overruled defendants’ motions for new trial by\n\noperation of law. Tex. R. Civ. P. 329b(c); Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(b). Those rulings\n\nwere also reversible errors.\n\n      “When a special verdict is rendered . . . , the court shall render judgment\n\nthereon unless a new trial is granted or judgment is rendered notwithstanding the\n\nverdict or jury finding under these rules.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 300. Our rules also\n\nprovide “that upon motion and reasonable notice the court may render judgment\n\n                                      -55-\n\fnon obstante veredicto if a directed verdict would have been proper, and provided\n\nfurther that the court may upon like motion and notice, disregard any jury finding\n\nthat has no support in the evidence.” Tex. R. Civ. P. 301.\n\n       BGI never sought judgment on the jury’s actual answers to Question No. 3\n\nbecause BGI’s damages question and answer blanks did not call for an actual\n\nverdict on recoverable subcontract damages, but rather (at most) elements of a\n\nformula for BGI (and later the Court) to work out later in determining what\n\nprincipal amount of damages should be awarded in the Court’s judgment.\n\n       That’s not the way our system of trial by jury works. In a jury trial, as here,\n\nthe plaintiff must obtain findings the Court can incorporate into its judgment (if the\n\nevidence supports the amounts found by the jury). Otherwise, defendants are\n\ndenied their constitutional right (like the plaintiff’s right) to have the jury decide\n\nevery material fact that is disputed in the evidence (in this case, what amount of\n\nactual damages, if any, would fairly and reasonably compensate BGI for\n\nMr. Lyon’s supposed failure to comply with his subcontract). 34\n\n\n\n\n34\n     See generally Haygood v. De Escabedo, 356 S.W.3d 390, 399 (Tex. 2012) (rejecting\ndissenters’ argument for “post-verdict” proceedings to finalize actual damage awards in personal\ninjury lawsuits because “a requirement that the trial court resolve disputed facts in determining\nthe damages to be awarded violates the constitutional right to trial by jury”); Texas & Pac. Ry.\nCo. v. Van Zandt, 159 Tex. 178, 182-83, 317 S.W.2d 528, 531-32 (1958) (opinion overruling\nplaintiff’s motion for rehearing) (usual harmless error rule cannot be applied when, as here, to\ndo so would deny a party’s constitutional right of trial by jury).\n\n\n                                              -56-\n\f      The best BGI will muster is an argument that BGI and the trial court cobbled\n\ntogether bits and piece of evidence (after BGI backed down and no longer\n\ninappropriately requested $25,000 for loss of retainage damages for breach of\n\ncontract), and the $15,889.84 awarded for subcontract damages can be teased out\n\nof the reporter’s record. But, with respect, BGI failed to secure accurate jury\n\nfindings on which any judgment for breach of subcontract damages could properly\n\nbe awarded. BGI also failed to request or obtain any order disregarding the jurors’\n\nexcessive and confusing answers to Question No. 3, none of which supports the\n\ntrial court’s $15,889.84 award for breach of subcontract damages.\n\n      As a result, Mr. Lyon’s issue 4 should be sustained, the trial court’s\n\njudgment should be reversed, and this cause should be remanded for a new trial.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n      Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction primarily request that:         (1) the jury’s\n\nanswer to Question No. 4 be set aside; (2) the trial court’s final judgment be\n\nreversed; (3) this Court render judgment ordering that BGI shall take nothing from\n\nMr. Lyon on BGI’s claim for fraudulent lien claim under section 12.002 of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code; and (4) this Court remand the cause to\n\nthe trial court for a new trial on the breach of subcontract, actual damages and\n\nattorney’s fees issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -57-\n\f      Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction also request that this Court: (5) order the\n\nGalveston County    district   clerk’s     office   to   refund   to   Mr. Lyon     and\n\nLyon Construction their $65,972.00 cash deposit in lieu of supersedeas bond\n\n(CR315-323, 347; 1SuppCR5, 96-97); (5) tax costs of the appeal(s) against BGI;\n\nand (6) grant Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction all other appropriate relief to which\n\nthey may be entitled (including a general remand if the Court were to sustain only\n\nthe factual sufficiency challenge concerning Question No. 4).\n\n                               Respectfully submitted,\n                               TED B.

Do not do any i ndcpendent investigation about the case or conduct\n\nany research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post\n\ninformation about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences\n\nwith the other jurors. Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your\n\ndeliberations for any reason. I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of\n\n\n\n       Here are the instructions for answering the questions.\n\n       I. Do not let bias, prejudice or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n       2. Base yom answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the lav. that is in\n\nthese instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted\n\nin the courtroom.\n                                                                         DCJucv~\n                                                                         Ju ry Charge &nd Verd1ct\n\n                                                 1                      f47                                 123\n\f        3. You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of law, you\n\nmust follow all of my instructions.\n\n       4. Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your notes\n\nback into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show or read your\n\nnotes to your fellow jurors during deliberations. Your notes are not evidence. Each of you\n\nshould rely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact\n\nthat another juror has or has not taken notes.\n\n       5 If my jnstnwtjons   lJSP   a word in a nray that is different from its ordinary tneaning, vse\n\nthe meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n       6. All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question or\n\nanswer is not im ortant.\n\n       7. Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"yes\" answer\n\nmust be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told otherwise. Whenever a\n\nquestiOn requrres an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your answer must be based on a\n\npreponderance of the evidence unless you are told otherwise.\n\n       The term \"preponderanee of the evidenee\" means the greater v:eight of eredible evidenee\n\n       presented in this case. If you do not find that a preponderance of the evidence supports a\n\n       \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the\n\n       rmrnber of witnesses or by the illlmber of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to\n\n       be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely\n\n       true than not true.\n\n\n                                                   2\n                                                                                                124\n\f        8. Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then just\n\nanswer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question carefully without\n\nconsidering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers will have.\n\n        9. Do not answer questwns by drawmg straws or by any method of chance.\n\n        10. Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to decide\n\non a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the average.\n\n        I I. Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"! will answer th1s question your\n\nway if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n        12. The answers to the questions must be based on the deeision of at least ten of the\n\ntwelve jurors. The same ten jurors must agree on every answer. Do not agree to be bound by a\n\nvote of anything less than ten jurors, even if it would be a majority.\n\n        As I have said before, jf you do not foJJo,rv these instnJctions, yo11 wjll he guilty ofjvror\n\nmisconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would\n\nwaste your time and the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for\n\nanother trial. If a juror breaks any of these rules, tell that person to stop and report it to me\n\nimmediately.\n\n       1vTilren wotds me used in this charge in a sense that varies flout the rneaning connnonly\n\nunderstood, you are given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept in place of any\n\nother meaning.\n\n       A faet may be established by direct e' idence or by circumstantial c v·idence or both. A faet\n\nis established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses who saw\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n                                                                                               125\n\fthe act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence when it\n\nmay be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts proved.\n\n         The Rules of Evidence ordinarily do not permit witnesses to testify as to their opinions or\n\nconcluswns. Two exceptwns to this rule ex1st. The first exceptiOn allows an ordmary c1t1zen to\n\ngive his or her opinion as to matters that he or she observed or of which he or she has first-hand\n\nknowledge. The second exception allows witnesses who, by education, training and experience,\n\nhave acq Ulred a certam specwhzed kliowledge m some art, sc1ence, professiOn or callmg, to state\n\nan opinion as to relevant and material matters.\n\n        The purpose of opinion witmlss testimony is to assist you in understanding the evidence\n\nand deciding the facts in this case. You are not bound by this testimony and, in weighing it, you\n\nmay consider his or her qualifications, opinions and reasons for testifying, as well as all other\n\nconsiderations that apply ¥/hen you evaluate the credibility of any witness In other words, yon\n\nshould give it such weight as you think it fairly deserves and consider it in light of all the evidence\n\nin this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n                                                                                                 126\n\f                                         QUESTION NO. 1\n\n        Did Ted Lyon III, individually, and Building Galveston, Inc. agree to enter into a\n\nsubcontract agreement for the construction of the Patty Cakes Bakery?\n\n        You are instructed that Ted Lyon III is presumed to have individually agreed to enter into a\n\nsubcontract agreement for the construction of the Patty Cakes Bakery unless, prior to making the\n\nsubcontract agreement, Ted Lyon III disclosed to Building Galveston, htc., or Building Galveston\n\nhad aetna! knowledge, that Ted Lyon III was signing the subcontract as an agent for Lyon\n\nProperties & Custom Homes, LLC.\n\n       You are iflslrueted that an age!lt is defined as a person who aets for another person or legal\n\nentity with that person or entity's authority.

The Court conducted a hearing\n\n        on those motions on December 16, 2014. The Court, having heard and considered all of the\n\n        above, is of the opinion that defendant's Motion to Disregard should he DENTED\n\n               Thereafter, on February 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed its Application for Attorney's Fees. On\n\n        April 9, 20 I 5, Plaintiff filed its First Supplemental Petition.

On request for reconsideration urged by\n\nPlaintiff in its post-hearing briefing and in consideration ofthe briefing supplied by both parties\n\nfollowing the heating, the Comt hereby DENIES the Plaintiffs oral motion fm leave to file its\n\nFirst Supplemental Petition.\n\n        At the hearing, Defendants made objections to the evidence which the Court took under\n\nadvisement. The Court makes the following rulings on the objections:\n\n            I. Defendants objected to Plaintiffs presentation of evidence on presentment\n               claiming that Plaintiff' failed to plead presentment.

Defendants objected to Plaintiffs presentation of evidence on attorney's fees to\n              the Court arguing that Plaintiff's application for attorney's fees requested fees\n              solely under TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE$ 38 001 The Court OVERRULES\n              that objection because the pleadings properly allege attorney's fees under more\n              than one statute, and Defendants had fair notice of Plaintiffs. pleadings on\n              attorney's fees. Moreover, before Plaintiffs filed the Application for Attorney's\n              Fees, the parties agreed in open court that they would submit the issue of\n              attorney's fees to the Court after the jury verdict.\n\n        The Court, havmg heard and constdered all of the above,     IS   of the opm10n that Plamtlff's\n\nMotion for Judgment should be GRANTED and attorney's fees should be awarded to Plaintiff\n\nunder TEX.

Michelle Slaughter, presiding over the\n\n405th District Court of Galveston County, and respectfully shows:\n\n                          Mr. Lyon’s Statement of the Case\n       Lyon Construction (a subcontractor) commenced this action in August 2010\n\nagainst Patty Cakes Bakery and the Rennicks (owners of the Patty Cakes Bakery\n\nproject) seeking to foreclose a claimed $35,697.00 mechanic’s and materialman’s\n\nlien. CR6-9. Building Galveston, Inc. (general contractor for the Patty Cakes\n\nBakery project) (BGI) intervened in April 2011. CR12-19. In November 2013,\n\nBGI became designated as the plaintiff, with Lyon Construction and Mr. Lyon\n\nbeing designated as the defendants. CR96; 2RR8.\n\n       BGI’s third amended petition included (among others) the following alleged\n\ncauses of action against Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction: (a) breach of contract;\n\n(b) filing of an invalid lien; and (c) filing of a fraudulent lien. CR102, 108-11.\n\nBGI’s third amended petition also expressly requested a judgment against\n\nMr. Lyon and Lyon Construction for “[e]xemplary damages as awarded by the trier\n\nof fact . . . .” CR112.7 Because BGI wanted to open and conclude both the\n\n\n7\n   Appropriately on this record, BGI did not (1) request submission of jury questions on\nexemplary damages against Mr. Lyon or Lyon Construction, nor (2) ask the trial court to award\nany exemplary damages to BGI in its final judgment.\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fpresentation of evidence and arguments to the jury, BGI admitted to the trial court\n\nthat BGI bore “the burden of proof at trial.” CR93, 96. The trial court later\n\nconfirmed on the record an agreement and stipulation between the parties “that\n\nattorney’s fees would be taken up by a separate motion with the Court and not put\n\nto the jury . . . so that will be taken up after the verdict is rendered by the jury.”\n\n5RR5-6; 11RR89-90.\n\n      After a week-long trial in November 2013, twelve Galveston County jurors\n\nunanimously found: (1) Mr. Lyon, individually, and Building Galveston agreed to\n\nenter into a subcontract for the construction of the Patty Cakes Bakery;\n\n(2) Mr. Lyon failed to comply with his subcontract with Building Galveston;\n\n(3) amounts to fairly and reasonably compensate Building Galveston for any\n\ndamages that resulted from Mr. Lyon’s failure to comply; (4) Mr. Lyon made,\n\npresented or used a fraudulent lien or claim against real property; and (5) an\n\namount to fairly and reasonably compensate Building Galveston for any damages\n\nthat resulted from Mr. Lyon presenting or using a fraudulent lien or claim against\n\nreal property. CR127-131, 138-39.\n\n      Mr. Lyon’s motion to disregard the jury’s answer to Question No. 4 was\n\nheard in December 2014 and later “DENIED” on the first page of the trial court’s\n\nsigned final judgment, which went on award BGI: $47,820.59 for actual damages;\n\n$9,806.50 in pre-judgment interest; $162,556.42 for attorney’s fees through trial\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fand any unsuccessful appeal by Mr. Lyon to this Court; and additional amounts for\n\nany unsuccessful appeal by Mr. Lyon to the Texas Supreme Court. CR141-47,\n\n169-172; 10RR4-21; CR243, 271; 1SuppCR98, 101-03.8 Mr. Lyon’s (and his\n\ncompany’s) timely-filed motions for new trial were overruled by operation of law.\n\nCR266-270, 308-314; 1SuppCR50-57. Mr. Lyon (and his company) filed timely\n\nnotice(s) of appeal and made an appropriate cash deposit in lieu of supersedeas\n\nbond. CR277-78, 312-13, 315-323, 347; 1SuppCR5. BGI filed its own timely\n\nnotice of appeal (CR292) and has insisted on parallel briefing tracks.\n\n                             Mr. Lyon’s Issues Presented\n       1.     Whether the trial court erred by (a) denying Mr. Lyon’s motion to\n\ndisregard the jury’s answer to Question No. 4, (b) rendering judgment awarding\n\nBGI statutory damages, interest and attorney’s fees for fraudulent lien, and\n\n(c) denying Mr. Lyon’s motions for new trial.\n\n       2.     Whether the trial court abused its discretion and committed reversible\n\nerror by overruling defendants’ hearsay objections and admitting PX45 during the\n\nbench trial on attorney’s fees.\n\n\n8\n   The first page of all three judgments BGI persuaded the trial court to sign contained an\nuntrue statement that BGI “moved for judgment based on the jury’s verdict.” 10RR23-24.\nBGI’s September 29, 2014 “motion for judgment” (CR175-76) was not a motion for judgment\nbased on the verdict; it also requested breach of subcontract damages not even arguably\nsupported by the jury’s answer to Question No. 3. See 10RR5-6, 23-29; see also CR242 (BGI’s\n“judgment worksheet” filed May 1, 2015); cf. CR129 (jury’s actual verdict regarding breach of\nsubcontract damages).\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f       3.      Whether the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motions for new\n\ntrial asserting no legally and factually sufficient evidence (or sustainable legal\n\npredicate) supports the trial court’s excessive findings and awards for trial and\n\nappellate attorney’s fees.\n\n       4.      Whether the trial court erred by rendering judgment for breach of\n\nsubcontract damages not lawfully supported by the jury’s answer to Question No. 3\n\nand by denying defendants’ motions for new trial.\n\n              Mr. Lyon’s Statement of Undisputed Facts in the Record\n       BGI (through its owner, Chris Arneson) entered into a December 2009\n\nagreement with the owners of Patty Cake Bakery (the Rennicks) to serve as general\n\ncontractor for that project with various plans and specifications. 2RR93-95; PX1,\n\n6, 7. BGI entered into (what the trial court ruled was an ambiguous) subcontract\n\nagreement signed by Mr. Lyon as “Owner” of Lyon Construction. 2RR70-71, 100;\n\nPX2.        Later various disputes arose over the completeness and quality of\n\nsubcontract work performed by (and the remaining amount due) Mr. Lyon;\n\ndissatisfied with his efforts, BGI told Mr. Lyon not to come back to the job site and\n\nterminated him from the project. 2RR162; 3RR135.\n\n       Mr. Lyon proceeded to fax Mr. Arneson and BGI a letter asserting a\n\nremaining balance due of $35,697 and explaining how Mr. Lyon calculated that\n\namount. PX14; 2RR164-65. Mr. Arneson testified at trial he thought the $35,697\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fclaimed in Mr. Lyon’s demand letter (PX14) was “ridiculously high” but he “really\n\ndidn’t know.” 2RR183. In Mr. Arneson’s words: “I didn’t argue with the fact that\n\nhe [Mr. Lyon] was demanding money. I argued with the amounts. In fact, I think\n\nwe [BGI] actually made them [Mr. Lyon / Lyon Construction] a settlement offer\n\nthey turned down.”      2RR183.     See also 3RR60-61 (on cross-examination,\n\nMr. Arneson stood by his testimony the day before that when he and BGI\n\nterminated Lyon Construction, he owed them some money / wasn’t sure if BGI\n\nwas going to owe them money or not).\n\n      Mr. Lyon later filed an affidavit claim of lien against the Patty Cakes Bakery\n\nproject for the same amount ($35,697), and Lyon Construction commenced this\n\nlawsuit in August 2010 against the owners of the property to try to collect that\n\nmoney.   PX16; 3RR11-12, 135-38; CR6-9.          The Rennicks later settled with\n\nLyon Construction (for a payment of $25,000) after Mr. Arneson “encouraged\n\nthem to” do so. 3RR14-15, 66. A predecessor presiding judge signed an order\n\ndismissing with prejudice all claims that had been filed by Lyon Construction\n\nagainst Patty Cakes Bakery and the Rennicks (with each of these parties bearing\n\ntheir own attorney’s fees and costs) in January 2012. CR80-81, 324.\n\n      In November 2013, all remaining claims between and among BGI, Mr. Lyon\n\nand Lyon Construction proceeded to a trial by jury, except attorney’s fees, which\n\nboth sides agreed would be taken up after verdict by a separate motion with the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\ftrial court. 5RR5-6. Both liability and damages were disputed in the trial court by\n\nboth sides, resulting in the voluminous reporter’s record now before this Court.\n\nThe trial court determined questions of subcontract breach (by Mr. Lyon,\n\nMr. Lyon’s company, and BGI) were raised by the evidence for submission to the\n\njury. See CR128-29, 132, 135.\n\n      The jury’s verdict was mostly favorable to BGI and unfavorable to\n\nMr. Lyon. CR123-139. 9 The last-in-time final judgment obtained by BGI below is\n\nthe second “Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc” signed by the trial court on October 13,\n\n2015. 1SuppCR98-103, 43-57. Mr. Lyon and Lyon Construction have filed timely\n\nnotice(s) of appeal. CR277-78, 308, 312-13. BGI also filed its own timely notice\n\nof appeal. CR292-93.\n\n                       Mr. Lyon’s Summary of Argument\n      The trial court’s awards for attorney’s fees far exceed actual damages\n\nawarded in the trial court’s final judgment; however, Mr. Lyon has been most\n\nsignificantly harmed (as a businessman and building contractor) by the\n\n“fraudulent lien” theory erroneously found by the jury against him in answer to\n\nQuestion No. 4 (CR130) and the resulting trial court judgment under that theory.\n\nMr. Lyon urgently needs relief from that insupportable jury finding and judgment\n\nand consequently will brief that issue first and most emphatically.\n9\n  The jury answered “No” to Question No. 6 inquiring whether Lyon Properties & Custom\nHomes, LLC failed to comply with its subcontract with BGI. CR132.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f       Mr. Lyon’s remaining issues demonstrate additional reversible errors by the\n\ntrial court in admitting hearsay evidence in support of BGI’s claims for high dollar\n\nattorney’s fees, awarding excessive (and inadequately segregated) attorney’s fees\n\nbased on insufficient evidence (and predicate), and rendering judgment on an\n\ninadequate subcontract damages question.\n\n                        Mr. Lyon’s Arguments and Authorities\n\nI.     The Jury’s Fraudulent Lien Findings, in Answer To Question No. 4,\n       Lack the Required Support of Legally and Factually Sufficient\n       Evidence\n       Mr. Lyon preserved his legal sufficiency challenges by presenting a timely\n\nand proper motion to disregard the jury’s answer to Question No. 4, which the trial\n\ncourt denied. CR141-47, 169-172; 243, 271; 1SuppCR53, CR98. 10 Mr. Lyon\n\npreserved his factual sufficiency challenges regarding Question No. 4 by filing\n\ntimely motions for new trial, which the trial court overruled by operation of law.\n\nCR266, 268, 308, 310; 1SuppCR53n.8; Tex.

App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2012,\nno pet.) (also aptly observing: “One of the essential elements of a Section 12.002 claim is that\nthe defendant used a document or record despite knowing that it reflected a fraudulent lien or\nclaim against real property”) (emphases supplied).\n\n\n                                               -20-\n\f      The jury necessarily made several independent, affirmative findings when it\n\nanswered “yes” to Question No. 4, including that Mr. Lyon made, presented or\n\nused his affidavit claim of lien [PX16] with knowledge that it was a fraudulent lien\n\nor claim against real property, with the intent to defraud, and with the intent to\n\ncause BGI to suffer financial injury. CR130. Constructive or imputed knowledge\n\nwas not the question. CR130. Under the trial court’s instructions submitted with\n\nQuestion No. 4, a “yes” answer required that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge that\n\nhis claimed lien was not valid at the time it was filed. CR130. The instructions\n\nunder Question No. 4 went on to state the lien was invalid if the amount claimed\n\nexceeded a formula that was taken from section 53.024 of the Texas Property\n\nCode. See Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 53.024 (Vernon 2014). Exceeded-the-formula\n\nis yet another affirmative finding the jury had to make to answer Question No. 4\n\n“yes” and on which BGI also bore the burden of proof. CR130, 124.\n\n      The reporter’s record from the jury trial contains a few critical exhibits, and\n\nsworn testimony by Mr. Lyon, bearing on whether BGI met its burden of proving\n\nall the elements under Question No. 4 and section 12.002 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code. The first is PX14, Mr. Lyon’s 5-7-2010 two page\n\nletter to Mr. Arneson and BGI explaining Mr. Lyon’s calculation of the $35,697\n\nMr. Lyon claimed was due for work completed. The fax legend at the top of PX14\n\nshows the letter was part of a seven (7) page fax Mr. Lyon sent Mr. Arneson and\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fBGI; however, PX14 as introduced by BGI consists of only two pages. Page 2 of\n\nthat letter explains the financial backup Mr. Lyon was relying on (and faxed to\n\nMr. Arneson and BGI): “Attached are the materials and cost needed through\n\ncompletion per the original plans and contract.” BGI chose to redact from its\n\nExhibit 14 the financial backup Mr. Lyon was relying on for his lien calculation.\n\n      PX14, like PX15 (Mr. Lyon’s 5-25-2014 invoice to BGI for $35,697) and\n\nPX16 (affidavit claim of lien for $35,697 Mr. Lyon filed 6-4-2010), was admitted\n\ninto evidence without objection. 2RR164, 163; 3RR6. All three are probative of\n\n(if anything) Mr. Lyon’s actual subjective belief in May and June 2010 that the\n\namount then due him was $35,697. And Mr. Lyon consistently testified under oath\n\nthat when he filed his affidavit claim of lien, he believed he was owed the amount\n\nthat was stated on the lien at that time, which was $35,697. 5RR44-45.\n\n      It was undisputed in the evidence that when Mr. Arneson first received\n\nPX14, he didn’t really know for sure whether there was any possibility BGI might\n\nowe Mr. Lyon some money for the work he had done because BGI hadn’t\n\ncompleted or hadn’t gotten the chance to complete the work BGI felt was needed\n\nfor repairs; Mr. Arneson testified as follows before the jury: “I didn’t argue with\n\nthe fact that [Mr. Lyon] was demanding money. I argued with the amounts. In\n\nfact, I think we actually made them a settlement offer [Mr. Lyon and\n\nLyon Construction] turned down.” 2RR183. The reporter’s record contains no\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fcorrespondence documenting any such argument between Mr. Arneson and\n\nMr. Lyon, but be that as it may, these testimonial admissions by Mr. Arneson for\n\nBGI (and BGI’s settlement offer to Mr. Lyon) are consistent with Mr. Lyon’s\n\nactual subjective belief in May and June of 2010 that the remaining amount due\n\nMr. Lyon was $35,697. Granted, that amount later become the subject of dispute\n\nand disagreement; however, subsequent disagreement over the proper amount of\n\nMr. Lyon’s clamed lien is zero evidence Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge in May\n\nand June of 2010 that his claimed lien was invalid.\n\n      The fraudulent lien finding in this case is extremely serious to Mr. Lyon and\n\nhis ability to do business in the future.       It’s just as harmful to Mr. Lyon’s\n\nconstruction business and professional reputation (indeed, probably more harmful)\n\nthan the erroneous written decision admonishing Hon. Michelle Slaughter for\n\n“willfully” violating the Code of Judicial Conduct by certain actions as a judge.\n\nSee In re Hon. Michelle Slaughter, Presiding Judge of the 405th Judicial District\n\nCourt, Galveston County, Texas, Docket No. 15-0001 (Special Court of Review of\n\nTexas Sep. 30, 2015) (per curiam); http://judgemichelleslaughter.com/justice-\n\nprevails/.   Willfully is lower on the scienter continuum than knowingly;\n\nnevertheless, the Special Court of Review of Texas correctly dismissed all charges\n\nagainst Hon. Michelle Slaughter because the evidence against her showed she\n\ncommitted (at most) an “error in judgment . . .” (Slip op. at 18).\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\f       Likewise, the jury’s findings in answer to Question No. 4 against Mr. Lyon\n\nare unsupported by the evidence under governing Texas substantive law. By stark\n\n(and informative) contrast, Florida’s statute permits liability when a claimed lien\n\namount is “willfully exaggerated” through “gross negligence.” See Fraudulent\n\nConstruction Liens: Willful Exaggeration or Good Faith Dispute, 75 Fla. B.J. 34\n\n(Mar. 2001).13 Mr. Lyon believes the evidence in the reporter’s record would not\n\nsupport liability even under Florida’s lower willful exaggeration / gross negligence\n\nstandard (just like the evidence did not support admonishing Judge Slaughter for\n\nweb posting facts from a pending case in her court),14 but that kind of question was\n\n\n13\n      Florida’s “fraudulent” lien statute authorizes liability when “the lienor has willfully\nexaggerated the amount for which such lien is claimed” or “has compiled his or her claim with\nsuch willful and gross negligence as to amount to a willful exaggeration . . . .” Fla.

And they\n\nwould have conclusively and overwhelmingly disproved the required element BGI\n\nbore the burden of proving: that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge his claimed lien\n\nwas invalid and fraudulent. CR130. The reporter’s record is devoid of such\n\nevidence; Mr. Lyon’s professional reputation and livelihood will unjustly be\n\neviscerated by this verdict and judgment (if affirmed); and this Court ought not\n\n“pass[] by on the other side.” Luke 10:31-32 (King James).\n\n       Simply put, no “evidence” proves it is “more likely true than not true”\n\n(CR124) that Mr. Lyon actually knew his claimed lien amount was invalid.\n\n16\n   The trial court apparently believed that the admission of PX14 “without objection” during the\njury trial was important in determining the legal sufficiency (or insufficiency) of BGI’s evidence\nconcerning fraudulent lien. 10RR16-18.

But even\nignoring the probative value of PX14 in Mr. Lyon’s favor as the exhibit was admitted without\nobjection, BGI still needed (and lacks) evidence that Mr. Lyon had actual knowledge his claimed\namount due was invalid.

But even if the jurors\n\ncould have heard Mr. Lyford’s ipse dixit, the reporter’s record of this jury trial\n\nreflects without dispute that attorney Lyford: (1) was not sworn in as a witness;\n\n(2) was arguing to the court outside the hearing of the jury; (3) was not testifying\n\nfrom the witness stand; and (4) gave no testimony the jurors heard (or could have\n\nlawfully considered) in reaching their answer to Question No. 4. 19\n\n       Mr. Lyford also emphasized the following point during BGI’s closing\n\narguments to the jury: “The trial has been unusual in that we have not had any\n\npaid expert witnesses.” 5RR120. Mr. Lyford was correct on that one point. The\n\nreporter’s record shows that no paid expert, no fact witness, and no other witness\n\ntestified before the jury that Mr. Lyon’s $35,697 calculation “exceeds” the\n\nstatutory limit in Property Code section 53.024.                 BGI might have hired a\n\nconstruction lien or accounting expert to try and prove Mr. Lyon’s claimed\n\n$35,697 exceeded the amount permitted by statute and the instructions submitted\n\nunder Question No. 4 in the Court’s charge, but BGI chose not to do so.\n\n       Under the submitted charge and as a matter of law, it was BGI’s burden to\n\nprove, as a threshold matter, that Mr. Lyon’s $35,697 lien calculation exceeded the\n\nstatutory limit in Property Code section 53.024.

PX14. Without those pages in the reporter’s record, the jurors (1) had\n\nno idea what was in Mr. Lyon’s mind (see 10RR16-18), and (2) had no legally (nor\n\nfactually) sufficient evidentiary basis on which they could find Mr. Lyon had\n\nactual knowledge that his claimed lien amount was invalid in May or June 2010.\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fThe jury’s answer to Question No. 4 should have been disregarded (or a new trial\n\ngranted) for this independent reason as well.\n\n       The reporter’s record contains no evidence whatsoever, direct or\n\ncircumstantial, that Mr. Lyon ever thought to himself: “Yes, I know my claimed\n\n$35,697 lien is invalid or fraudulent, but I’m going to file it anyway.” BGI has\n\nargued legitimate inferences arise from the facts that Mr. Lyon did not calculate his\n\nclaimed lien amount in the way required by the Property Code, that Mr. Lyon\n\nshared office space with his father’s office (Law Offices of Ted B. Lyon &\n\nAssociates),20 and that Mr. Lyon purportedly tried to mislead or “defraud” the jury\n\nwith a liability insurance certificate dated after 2010.

The trial court’s\n\ncharge did not define “intent to defraud” so instead of the common-law definition,\n\nthe jurors were required to apply the “commonly understood” meaning of fraud.\n\nCR125. Black’s Law Dictionary teaches “Intent to defraud means an intention to\n\ndeceive another person and to induce such other person, in reliance upon such\n\ndeception, to assume, create, transfer, alter or terminate a right, obligation or power\n\nwith reference to property.”     Black’s Law Dict. 381 (5th ed. 1979) (emphases\n\nsupplied). The American Heritage Dictionary gives this definition: “de-fraud . . .\n\nTo take from or deprive by fraud, swindle.”            American Heritage Dict. 376\n\n(2nd college ed. 1985) (emphases supplied).

Again, page 2 of that faxed letter shows BGI did not\n\nwant the jurors to see (like BGI saw) the attachment pages that were the financial\n\nbackup Mr. Lyon openly relied upon and faxed to Mr. Arneson and BGI in\n\nMay 2010. PX16, the affidavit claim of lien filed the following month, claimed the\n\nidentical $35,697 lien amount and relied on the same calculations and redacted\n\nfinancial backup BGI had received by fax the month before but did not want the\n\njurors to see. Because there is no legally (nor factually) sufficient evidence that\n\nMr. Lyon made, presented, or used his affidavit claim of lien with the intent to\n\ndefraud, the jury’s “yes” answer to Question No. 4 should have been disregarded\n\n(or a new trial should have been granted) for this independent reason as well.\n\n      Finally, as yet one additional, stand-alone independent no-evidence ground,\n\nthe “yes” answer to Question No. 4 also required the jury to find that Mr. Lyon\n\nmade, presented or used his affidavit claim of lien “with the intent to cause\n\nBuilding Galveston, Inc. to suffer financial injury.” CR130. If this Court assumed\n\n(for sake of argument) that all the other elements were somehow supported by\n\nevidence in the reporter’s record, the Court should still reverse because no legally\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\f(and no factually) sufficient evidence established that Mr. Lyon made, presented or\n\nused his lien with intent to cause BGI to suffer financial injury. 22\n\n       PX16 shows Mr. Lyon’s affidavit claim of lien was filed against the Patty\n\nCakes Bakery property owned by the Rennicks (accord CR6-9); however, the\n\nreporter’s record contains no evidence indicating Mr. Lyon’s affidavit claim of lien\n\nwas ever asserted against BGI. Although BGI presented some evidence that, by\n\nagreement between BGI and the Rennicks, the $25,000 paid by the Rennicks to\n\nsettle Mr. Lyon’s lien claim was withheld from BGI’s retainage (3RR14-15), there\n\nwas no evidence this was the intent or purpose of Mr. Lyon. Instead, the only\n\nevidence is that Mr. Lyon’s intent in making, presenting or using the lien was to\n\nreceive payment from the Rennicks.

For instance, if the Court -- even\n\nthough the Court awarded fraudulent lien, it would be appropriate for the Court in\n\na judgment to suggest that if the fraudulent lien were set aside, then here’s what the\n\nfees would be.” 11RR73. Mr. Brock continued: “In the event this case were\n\nappealed, then that gives the appellate court the ability to modify the judgment, as\n\nopposed to remanding for the determination.”                    11RR73.        Again correctly\n\nforeseeing this Court’s judgment of reversal, Mr. Brock further continued: “[N]ow\n\nthat the appellate court, for instance, has said fraudulent lien was improper, that\n\nthere wasn’t adequate or sufficient evidence, then the Court could modify its [sic]\n\njudgment as it relates to the attorneys’ fees without having to remand it [sic] back\n\nto the trial court.” 11RR73 (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n\n31\n   Apart from the jury’s answer to Question No. 4 (and the trial court’s final judgment awarding\nBGI damages on its “fraudulent lien” claim), the record in this case contains no trial court order,\nadjudication or decree declaring Mr. Lyon’s earlier claim of lien is valid or invalid or,\nalternatively, inferior to the claim of any other creditor.\n\n\n                                               -50-\n\f       Despite these entreaties by Mr. Brock, the trial court chose not to make\n\nadditional or alternative findings segregating fees among the various causes of\n\naction, and thus a new trial on attorney’s fees is required at a minimum. Nor has\n\nBGI at any time (even in BGI’s Exhibit 46) segregated fees for making claims\n\nagainst Mr. Lyon (against whom the trial court did award attorney’s fees) as\n\nopposed to Lyon Construction (against which the trial court held neither damages\n\nnor attorney’s fees were recoverable). Consequently, even if some portion of the\n\nattorney’s fees might arguably be recoverable under section 53.156 of the Property\n\nCode (which Mr. Lyon respectfully denies), this Court cannot make original fact\n\nfindings on attorney’s fees. 32           Instead, as BGI’s attorney’s fee expert\n\nacknowledged, a remand for further trial court proceedings on attorney’s fees\n\nwould be necessary.\n\n       On this record, the trial court’s awards of trial and appellate attorney’s fees\n\nto BGI are legally unsupported, factually excessive, not adequately segregated\n\namong parties and claims, and (with respect) were an abuse of discretion.\n\nMr. Lyon’s issue 3 should accordingly be sustained, the trial court’s excessive (and\n\ninadequately segregated) awards for trial and appellate attorney’s fees should be\n\nreversed, and the case should be remanded for a new trial.\n\n\n32\n    See Trevino v.

Instead, BGI repeatedly “moved\n\nfor judgment” (not on the verdict) indefensibly requesting judgment for principal\n\ndamages of either $47,820.59 (if all the jury findings in BGI’s favor were upheld)\n\nor $40,889.84 (if the trial court granted Mr. Lyon’s motion to disregard the jury’s\n\nanswer to Question No. 4, permitting only BGI’s breach of contract theory to\n\nstand).   CR173-74, 175-76.     During the December 2014 motion to disregard\n\nhearing, Mr. Lyon’s counsel pointed out the damages portion of BGI’s motion was\n\ninappropriate and the most Question 3 even arguably supported was a judgment\n\nfor principal damages of about $15,800 (instead of $40,000). 10RR23-25, 27-29.\n\n      Later BGI’s trial counsel admitted in correspondence to the trial court (with\n\nan enclosed “JUDGMENT WORKSHEET”) that Question No. 3 did not support\n\n$40,889.84 in principal damages (as BGI had previously requested) but instead\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\f(according to counsel’s post-verdict calculations) a “Recoverable Difference” of\n\njust $15,889.84. CR240, 242. After the trial court rendered judgment awarding\n\nBGI $15,889.84 for breach of contract (CR245, 273) — based on BGI’s judgment\n\nworksheet calculations (CR242), instead of the the jury’s answers to Question\n\nNo. 3 (CR129) — defendants timely filed motions for new trial asserting the jury’s\n\nanswers to Question No. 3 were not only “excessive” and “manifestly too large”\n\nbut also asserting:\n\n            Question No. 3 as submitted to the jury is also too vague and\n      confusing to support the Court’s awarding $15,889.84 (or any\n      amount) for BGI’s breach of contract damages. There is no express\n      finding by the jury supporting the Court’s $15,889.84 award for BGI’s\n      breach of contract claims, and Question No. 3 cannot salvage the\n      Court’s 5-19-2015 (7-31-2015) judgment on appeal.

R. Civ. P. 301.\n\n       BGI never sought judgment on the jury’s actual answers to Question No. 3\n\nbecause BGI’s damages question and answer blanks did not call for an actual\n\nverdict on recoverable subcontract damages, but rather (at most) elements of a\n\nformula for BGI (and later the Court) to work out later in determining what\n\nprincipal amount of damages should be awarded in the Court’s judgment.\n\n       That’s not the way our system of trial by jury works. In a jury trial, as here,\n\nthe plaintiff must obtain findings the Court can incorporate into its judgment (if the\n\nevidence supports the amounts found by the jury). Otherwise, defendants are\n\ndenied their constitutional right (like the plaintiff’s right) to have the jury decide\n\nevery material fact that is disputed in the evidence (in this case, what amount of\n\nactual damages, if any, would fairly and reasonably compensate BGI for\n\nMr. Lyon’s supposed failure to comply with his subcontract). 34\n\n\n\n\n34\n     See generally Haygood v.

Do not do any i ndcpendent investigation about the case or conduct\n\nany research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post\n\ninformation about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences\n\nwith the other jurors. Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your\n\ndeliberations for any reason. I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of\n\n\n\n       Here are the instructions for answering the questions.\n\n       I. Do not let bias, prejudice or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n       2. Base yom answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the lav. that is in\n\nthese instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was not admitted\n\nin the courtroom.\n                                                                         DCJucv~\n                                                                         Ju ry Charge &nd Verd1ct\n\n                                                 1                      f47                                 123\n\f        3. You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters of law, you\n\nmust follow all of my instructions.\n\n       4. Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your notes\n\nback into the jury room and consult them during deliberations, but do not show or read your\n\nnotes to your fellow jurors during deliberations. Your notes are not evidence. Each of you\n\nshould rely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact\n\nthat another juror has or has not taken notes.\n\n       5 If my jnstnwtjons   lJSP   a word in a nray that is different from its ordinary tneaning, vse\n\nthe meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n       6. All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question or\n\nanswer is not im ortant.\n\n       7. Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"yes\" answer\n\nmust be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told otherwise. Whenever a\n\nquestiOn requrres an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your answer must be based on a\n\npreponderance of the evidence unless you are told otherwise.\n\n       The term \"preponderanee of the evidenee\" means the greater v:eight of eredible evidenee\n\n       presented in this case. If you do not find that a preponderance of the evidence supports a\n\n       \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the\n\n       rmrnber of witnesses or by the illlmber of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to\n\n       be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely\n\n       true than not true.\n\n\n                                                   2\n                                                                                                124\n\f        8. Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then just\n\nanswer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question carefully without\n\nconsidering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your answers will have.\n\n        9. Do not answer questwns by drawmg straws or by any method of chance.\n\n        10. Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to decide\n\non a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the average.\n\n        I I. Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"! will answer th1s question your\n\nway if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n        12. The answers to the questions must be based on the deeision of at least ten of the\n\ntwelve jurors. The same ten jurors must agree on every answer. Do not agree to be bound by a\n\nvote of anything less than ten jurors, even if it would be a majority.\n\n        As I have said before, jf you do not foJJo,rv these instnJctions, yo11 wjll he guilty ofjvror\n\nmisconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again.

Plaintiff Building Galveston, Inc. and Defendants Lyon Properties & Custom\n\nI\n        Homes, LLC d/b/a Lyon Construction Services and Ted B. Lyon, III, appeared through their\n\n        attorneys of record and announced that they were ready for trial. The parties agreed on the record\nI\nI\n!\n        and before the Court that the issues of recovery of attorney's fees by either Plaintiff or\nI\n'\n        Defendants would be tried to the Court following the Jury's verdict on the merits of the causes of\nt       action asserted by the parties.\nI\ni\n                A jury was duly accepted, impaneled, and sworn. After hearing evidence, arguments of\nI\nI\n\n        counsel, and the Court's instructions and after receiving guestions to be answered, the iurx\n\n        returned its verdict, which is incorporated herein as if set forth in full.\n\n                On January 30, 2014, defendant Ted B. Lyon, III, filed his motion requesting the Court to\n\n        disregard the jmy 's answer to ~aestion No. 4. en S\"ptember 21}, 2()14, !'lain tiff Building\n\n        Galveston, Inc. moved for judgment based on the jury's verdict. The Court conducted a hearing\n\n        on those motions on December 16, 2014. The Court, having heard and considered all of the\n\n        above, is of the opinion that defendant's Motion to Disregard should he DENTED\n\n               Thereafter, on February 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed its Application for Attorney's Fees. On\n\n        April 9, 20 I 5, Plaintiff filed its First Supplemental Petition. On April I 0, 2015, Defendants filed\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                 98\n\ftheir Objections to the Application and the filing of the Supplemental Petition. On Aprill7,\n\n2015, th@ Court R@ard @Yid@nC@ and argum@nt of counsel in regard to the issues concerning\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n        At the hearing, Plaintiff sought leave of court to file its First Supplemental Petition, to\n\nwhich Defendants objected. The Court denied Plaintiff leave to file the supplemental petition on\n\nthe record at the hearing as such petition was untimely. On request for reconsideration urged by\n\nPlaintiff in its post-hearing briefing and in consideration ofthe briefing supplied by both parties\n\nfollowing the heating, the Comt hereby DENIES the Plaintiffs oral motion fm leave to file its\n\nFirst Supplemental Petition.\n\n        At the hearing, Defendants made objections to the evidence which the Court took under\n\nadvisement. The Court makes the following rulings on the objections:\n\n            I. Defendants objected to Plaintiffs presentation of evidence on presentment\n               claiming that Plaintiff' failed to plead presentment. The Court SUSTAINS that\n                ~J      .~                            \\JUler ~~                ~ eviaence or\n               presentment as such evtdence would be melevant.\n\n           2. Defendants objected to Plaintiffs presentation of evidence on attorney's fees to\n              the Court arguing that Plaintiff's application for attorney's fees requested fees\n              solely under TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE$ 38 001 The Court OVERRULES\n              that objection because the pleadings properly allege attorney's fees under more\n              than one statute, and Defendants had fair notice of Plaintiffs. pleadings on\n              attorney's fees. Moreover, before Plaintiffs filed the Application for Attorney's\n              Fees, the parties agreed in open court that they would submit the issue of\n              attorney's fees to the Court after the jury verdict.\n\n        The Court, havmg heard and constdered all of the above,     IS   of the opm10n that Plamtlff's\n\nMotion for Judgment should be GRANTED and attorney's fees should be awarded to Plaintiff\n\nunder TEX.
