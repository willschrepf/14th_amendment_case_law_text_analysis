INTRODUCTION\n         Defendant Giovanni Duarte appeals after a jury convicted him of second degree\nmurder. (Pen. Code, § 187.1) The jury found true an allegation that defendant personally\nand intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death (§ 12022.53,\nsubd. (d)) and an allegation that defendant committed the murder for the benefit of a\ncriminal street gang (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5)). The trial court sentenced defendant to a\nprison term of 15 years to life for the murder, with a consecutive term of 25 years to life\nfor the firearm allegation. The trial court did not impose a separate term for the gang\nenhancement, which provided for a minimum parole eligibility term of 15 years.\n(§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5); see People v. Lopez (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1002, 1007 (Lopez).)\n\n\n         1\n             All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\f       On appeal, defendant’s arguments concern testimony by the prosecution’s gang\nexpert regarding the ties between defendant’s gang, Varrio Mountain View (VMV) and\nthe Nuestra Familia prison gang. Defendant contends there was inadequate foundation\nfor the gang expert’s testimony and that the prosecution violated statutory discovery\nrequirements by failing to timely disclose that the gang expert would testify about\nVMV’s ties to the Nuestra Familia. Defendant further contends he received ineffective\nassistance of counsel if his trial counsel’s objections were not sufficient to preserve his\nappellate challenges to the gang expert’s testimony, and that his trial counsel should have\nobjected to the gang expert’s testimony on the basis of Evidence Code section 352.\n       For reasons that we will explain, we will affirm the judgment.\n\n                                 II.     BACKGROUND\n       A.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part I\n       City of Mountain View Police Sergeant Kenneth Leal testified as the prosecution’s\ngang expert. He testified twice at trial. At the beginning of defendant’s trial, Sergeant\nLeal testified about gangs generally, including the VMV gang. Later in the trial, he\ntestified specifically about the elements of the gang allegation.\n       Sergeant Leal had been a police officer for 25 years at the time of defendant’s\ntrial. He was working as the supervisor for the Gang Suppression Team and also as a\npatrol supervisor. He had been working on the Gang Suppression Team since 2005 and\nhad been “working gangs” for his entire law enforcement career, which included a prior\nassignment with the Street Intelligence Unit, in which he gathered gang intelligence.\nSergeant Leal had over 350 hours of formal gang training, which included education at\nseminars and symposiums. Sergeant Leal also had over 500 hours of informal gang\ntraining, which was based on conversations with gang members, gang rivals, gang\nassociates, police officers, and probation officers. He had investigated over 200 gang-\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\frelated crimes. Sergeant Leal personally knew VMV gang members and had personally\ninvestigated crimes committed by VMV gang members.\n       Sergeant Leal made contact with gang members every day on the job. His goal\nwas to have nine out of every 10 contacts be “positive” contacts, during which he\nchecked in with gang members about things like school and jobs. He had over 500\npersonal contacts with gang members, about 150 of which occurred during arrests. From\nconversations with gang members, Sergeant Leal learned how to join a gang, the reasons\nfor joining a gang, the dress and hairstyles of gangs, and the signs and colors of gangs.\nHe also learned the significance of gang tattoos and graffiti, and he learned about gang\nrivalries and allegiances. Sergeant Leal regularly spoke with officers from his own\ndepartment and from other agencies in order to share information and keep up with “gang\ntrends.” He also regularly reviewed police reports and field identification cards.\n       In Santa Clara County, Norteños and Sureños are the two main rival gangs.\nNorteños associate with the color red, the number 14, and the letter “N,” which is the\nfourteenth letter of the alphabet. Norteños, also known as “northerners,” are associated\nwith the Nuestra Familia, which is a northern California prison gang whose members are\nusually serving life sentences. The Nuestra Familia has “soldiers in prison” called\nNuestra Raza or Northern Structure.\n       The Norteño street gangs are “run by the prison gang.” When members of Nuestra\nFamilia or Nuestra Raza get out of prison, they run “street regiments,” giving orders to\nstreet gangs “like VMV.” The Nuestra Familia has a “large influence” on Norteño gangs\nin Santa Clara County. For instance, the Nuestra Familia instructs the street-level gang\nmembers on “who’s in trouble, who’s not.” The street gangs are directed to sell drugs and\n“funnel money back to the prisons.” None of the members of the street gangs are\nmembers of Nuestra Familia.\n       The Mexican Mafia is the “enemy” of Nuestra Familia. The Mexican Mafia is a\nsouthern California prison gang whose street-level gang members are the Sureños. The\n                                             3\n\fMexican Mafia and Sureños associate with the color blue, the number 13, and the letter\n“M,” which is the 13th letter of the alphabet.\n       The VMV is the only Norteño gang in Mountain View. The one Sureño gang in\nMountain View is called the Mountain View Sureños (MVS). The VMV had about 20 to\n35 active members at the time of trial. VMV gang members belong to different\n“generations.” In 2004, VMV gang members considered themselves the seventh\ngeneration.\n       B.     The Shooting of Alex Fernandez\n       On September 24, 2004, Alex Fernandez was killed by two gunshot wounds to his\nchest and abdomen. Fernandez was associated with the MVS gang. He was wearing a\nbelt buckle with an “S” on it at the time of his death, and he had blue tattoos of the\nnumbers one and three on his legs. Several witnesses told police that Norteños had done\nthe shooting. However, the police had no “solid leads” about the identity of the\nperpetrators for several years.\n       The police subsequently learned that defendant had been the shooter—a fact\ndefendant did not dispute at trial, where he claimed he acted in self-defense and\nchallenged the evidence introduced to support the gang allegation.\n       The prosecution ultimately entered into immunity agreements with Anthony\nFigueroa, Marlon Ruiz, George Oseida, and Jonathan Jenkins, all of whom were with\ndefendant at the time of the shooting. Each one had been a member or associate of VMV\nat the time of the Fernandez shooting. Figueroa had not been jumped in to VMV, but his\nfather was a VMV member and the “outside perception” was that he himself was a VMV\nmember. Ruiz also had not been jumped in to VMV, but he was associated with VMV.\nGeorge Oseida was a VMV gang member. In addition to participating in the Fernandez\nhomicide, George Oseida had participated in other gang-related offenses: in 2008, he\nwas arrested for robbery and attempted murder of a rival gang member; in 2004, he was\n\n\n                                              4\n\farrested for assaulting a rival gang member with a rock. Jonathan Jenkins associated\nwith VMV members, and he gave people gang-related tattoos.\n        On September 24, 2004, Figueroa drove Ruiz and Brian Oseida (the brother of\nGeorge Oseida) to a movie theater, where they hung out outside with George Oseida,\nOscar Castillo, and others. Castillo and some of the others were talking about having\nseen some Sureño gang members in a Sureño neighborhood nearby. Figueroa heard\nCastillo and George Oseida refer to “scrap hunting,” which means “[t]o go out and look\nfor Surenos and either assault them or . . . shoot them.”\n        Figueroa, Ruiz, and the Oseida brothers subsequently left the movie theater, with\nFigueroa driving. George Oseida directed Figueroa to a residential neighborhood, then\nmade a phone call. George Oseida told the person on the phone to come outside. George\nOseida got out of the car and went to meet defendant and Jenkins, who came out of a\nhouse. Jenkins appeared to be arguing; he subsequently threw up his hands and walked\naway.\n        Defendant and George Oseida got into Figueroa’s car. George Oseida sat in the\nfront passenger seat, Ruiz was in the back seat behind Figueroa, Brian Oseida was in the\nmiddle of the back seat, and defendant was in the back seat behind George Oseida.\n        George Oseida directed Figueroa into an MVS neighborhood, in which they saw a\ngroup of about 10 to 15 MVS gang members. Someone in the car noted that Juan Luna\nwas in the group. While Figueroa’s car was stopped at a red light, Fernandez and Luna\nstarted to run up to the car; the rest of the group of MVS gang members ran away towards\nsome apartments. Luna also subsequently ran towards the apartments, but Fernandez\ncontinued to approach the passenger side of Figueroa’s car. When Fernandez reached\ninto the front of his pants, Figueroa and George Oseida both ducked, and there was a\n“loud crack.”\n        Fernandez continued to move towards George Oseida, looking like he was about\nto strike George Oseida. Fernandez threw something at the car, causing a “loud crack”\n                                             5\n\fsound. George Oseida yelled, “Buck, buck,” meaning “shoot.” Some of the backseat\npassengers yelled “Get him.” Figueroa heard two gunshots, then saw defendant holding a\ngun. Figueroa drove away from the scene. During the drive, either Brian Oseida or Ruiz\nsaid, “I hope we got him.”\n       According to George Oseida, Oscar Castillo had told him that “scraps” were\n“patrolling” in their neighborhood, which meant that Sureños were “available” to be\nassaulted. George Oseida called defendant because he knew that defendant had a gun.\nGeorge Oseida told defendant that “scraps were patrolling,” and he asked if defendant\nhad his gun. Before getting into Figueroa’s car, defendant showed George Oseida that he\nhad a gun in his backpack. Defendant pulled back the slide on the gun when they entered\nSureño territory. At some point, George Oseida asked defendant to switch seats or give\nhim the gun, because the rear window of the car did not roll down, but defendant said no.\n       According to George Oseida, defendant said, “That was Alex,” after the shooting,\nand Figueroa said, “I hope he dies.” When they cleaned Figueroa’s car, they discovered\nthat Fernandez had thrown something greasy at the car. The day after the shooting,\ndefendant said he had “sand-papered” the barrel of the gun and hidden it. Defendant later\nstated that Jenkins had thrown the gun into a creek, although Jenkins denied any\ninvolvement in disposing of the gun.\n       C.     Other Testimony From Coparticipants\n       Figueroa testified that Ruiz was selling marijuana around the time of the\nFernandez shooting. According to Figueroa, some members of VMV were trying to\n“tax[]” Ruiz for his marijuana sales. Figueroa explained that when a gang member sells\ndrugs, “taxing” means that the person pays some money to the gang in exchange for the\nbenefit of using the gang’s “brand,” which implicitly tells the buyers that the gang will\nback up the seller if the buyer “screw[s]” him. Figueroa was aware that Nuestra Familia\nregiments often sell drugs for the benefit of gangs. However, with respect to Ruiz, he did\n\n\n                                             6\n\fnot believe the Nuestra Familia was involved. Rather, he thought “it was just\nsomebody’s idea to get some money off of somebody for free.”\n       Figueroa spoke to defendant when they were in a holding cell together. Defendant\nexpressed anger that Jenkins had implicated him in a statement and at the preliminary\nhearing. Defendant said he had “let the correct people know in the jail that [Jenkins] was\nmaking statements against him.” According to Figueroa, this meant that defendant had\nreported the snitching to the Northern Structure or the Nuestra Familia.\n       George Oseida testified that in 2004, the VMV gang would hold meetings at\nvarious locations to discuss jumping in new members or getting weapons for the gang.\nHe also testified that a Huelga bird tattoo had two meanings within the Norteño gang\nculture: it can signify that someone is a member of the Northern Structure prison gang,\nor it can simply signify that someone is a member of a Norteño gang. However, “outside\nof the Nuestra Familia,” which is “the ultimate prison gang for the Norteños,” a Huelga\nbird tattoo “should be earned.” A person could earn a Huelga bird tattoo by “putting in\nwork,” i.e., by committing a violent act on a rival gang member.\n       According to George Oseida, a person who drops out of a Norteño gang while in\njail is placed in protective custody, because “the northerners within the jail” will do\nsomething to a dropout. When he first went to jail, he was in the general population with\nother northerners and thus “part of the more powerful gang within the jail.”\n       On cross-examination, George Oseida clarified that none of the seventh generation\nmembers of VMV had any interaction with the Nuestra Familia and that they were not\ncontrolled by the Nuestra Familia. However, when asked if he had ever taken directions\nfrom a prison gang, George Oseida referred to an order “that was handed down” on the\nday his brother was jumped in to the VMV gang. An older gang member had said “there\nwas a green light” on someone, meaning that VMV gang members could not hang out\nwith that person, or that the person should be beaten up or killed.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       D.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part II\n       Sergeant Leal first learned about the VMV gang when, in 1990 or 1991, he lived\nnear five brothers who were VMV gang members. He talked to the five brothers and\ntheir friends. Sergeant Leal reiterated that the VMV is a Norteño gang and that Norteños\nare the “street level” of the Nuestra Familia. He testified that VMV is part of the Norteño\n“organization” and that VMV had ties to Nuestra Familia.2\n       Sergeant Leal identified Jose Soto as someone who was a VMV gang member in\nthe 1990’s. Soto had been to prison and was a documented member of the Northern\nStructure and Nuestra Raza. Soto controlled a lot of the Bay Area’s Norteño gangs, and\nhe would send his brother into Mountain View. In the early 2000’s, Soto had been\nreleased from prison with instructions from the Nuestra Familia. Soto’s influence then\nprogressed within “the organization.”3 Sergeant Leal also identified Chris Klipp as\nsomeone who was a VMV member and who, like Soto, had “direct ties” to the Nuestra\nFamilia.\n       According to Sergeant Leal, in September of 2004 the primary activities of the\nVMV gang were vandalism, battery, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon. He\nknew this through his personal experience and through conversations with police officers,\ngang members, and witnesses to crimes.\n       To establish that VMV had engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\n(§ 186.22, subds. (e) & (f)), Sergeant Leal testified about additional criminal acts\ncommitted by VMV gang members. On September 18, 2004, VMV gang member\nCipriano Verales committed an assault with personal infliction of great bodily injury.\nAlong with an associate, Verales had beaten up a suspected Sureño gang member.\nSergeant Leal also testified about George Oseida’s 2004 gang-related assault with a rock.\n\n       2\n        Defendant objected to this testimony on the ground it had been “asked and\nanswered and covered in the first examination of this witness.”\n      3\n        Defendant objected to this testimony on the ground it lacked foundation.\n                                             8\n\fIn addition, Sergeant Leal testified about an incident in 2000 involving VMV gang\nmembers Gene Giron and Daniel Blodgett, who had confronted a Sureño gang member.\nGiron was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon; Blodgett was convicted of criminal\nthreats; gang allegations were found true as to both defendants.\n       Sergeant Leal testified that in 2004, defendant had some gang-related tattoos,\nincluding four dots on his left wrist and one dot on his right wrist. After September of\n2004, he had more gang-related tattoos, including “VMV” on his stomach and a Huelga\nbird on his right arm with the words “Loyalty above all laws.”\n       In Sergeant Leal’s opinion, defendant was an active gang member at the time of\nthe Fernandez homicide. His opinion was based on a number of factors, including\ndefendant’s 2006 admission to Sergeant Leal that he had been a member of VMV for\nover three years. Sergeant Leal also believed that, at the time, George Oseida was an\nactive member of VMV, and that Brian Oseida, Figueroa, and Ruiz were all associates of\nVMV.\n       Given a hypothetical mirroring the facts of the case, Sergeant Leal was asked\nwhether the shooting would benefit the shooter’s gang, be done in association with the\ngang, and be at the direction of the gang. (See § 186.22, subd. (b).4) Sergeant Leal\nresponded that the shooting would only benefit the gang and be done in association with\nthe gang.\n       E.     Defense Testimony\n       Gregorio Estevane testified as a gang expert for the defense. Much of his\nknowledge came from talking to gang members, correctional officers, attorneys, and law\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        Section 186.22, subdivision (b) provides for an enhancement when a person is\n“convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association\nwith any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any\ncriminal conduct by gang members.”\n                                              9\n\fenforcement officers. Estevane was not an expert on the VMV gang and had not\npreviously testified in a Norteño gang case.\n       Estevane discussed the history of gangs in California, explaining that they began\nwhen some communities pushed Latinos “off” into segregated areas. The gangs evolved\nwhen some individuals went to prison, resulting in the creation of the Mexican Mafia, the\nAryan Brotherhood, and the Northern Structure. The Mexican Mafia controls most of the\nLatino gangs in Southern California (the Sureños), while the Nuestra Familia controls the\nNorteños. In Santa Clara County, the Nuestra Familia and the Norteños control the jails.\n       There are several common features of California gangs. Their motive is usually to\n“brand fear.” They have a structure, but it may be “loose,” and no formal organization is\nrequired in order for a gang to qualify under section 186.22. Gangs are interested in\nmaking money, so they are usually “heavily engaged in drug dealing” or other illicit\nactivities. Gang members desire to “put in work,” meaning they are ready to go to jail or\njuvenile hall, where they will get more training. A gang member’s “career goal” is\nusually to be in prison and be part of “some kind of a mafia.” Most criminal street gangs\nhave ties to “their parent organizations in the prison system.” There is typically a “direct\nstrong link” between “real street gangs” and prison gangs. Usually, the upper level of a\ngang wants to give input before a gang crime is committed, although occasionally a\nyounger group of gang members may commit a crime without giving any notice to the\nupper level. A typical gang mission includes “branding”—that is, claiming the act to get\na benefit for the gang.\n       Given a hypothetical based on the facts of the instant case, Estevane did not\nbelieve the crime was a “gang event.” The crime was not done in association with a\ncriminal street gang because the driver of the car and some of the passengers were not\npart of the plan. The crime did not benefit the gang because there was no “branding.”\n       Estevane initially testified that in his opinion, VMV was not a criminal street gang\nwithin the meaning of section 186.22. While VMV has a common sign or signal,\n                                               10\n\fEstevane did not think that the “primary activities” requirement was satisfied.\n(See § 186.22, subd. (f).) He would expect to see that members of VMV had been\nconvicted of murder, drug dealing, and extortion. However, he later admitted that under\nsection 186.22, crimes such as assault and vehicle theft could comprise the gang’s\nprimary activities. He also acknowledged that section 186.22 does not require evidence\nof convictions for purposes of the primary activities element.\n       Estevane also did not think that the predicate offenses supported a finding that\nVMV was a criminal street gang. The Verales crime was not prosecuted as a gang crime\n(i.e., there was no gang allegation), and Verales had denied being a gang member,\nalthough the facts did show that Verales had issued a gang challenge during the incident.\nThe George Oseida crime also was questionable as a predicate, because although a gang\nenhancement was alleged, it was not admitted as part of the plea bargain. Estevane later\nacknowledged that predicate offenses do not need to have gang enhancements under\nsection 186.22.\n       Estevane later clarified that he was not giving an opinion about whether VMV\nmeets the statutory definition of a criminal street gang, but that he believed that Sergeant\nLeal’s opinion was not based upon sufficient facts provided in the prosecution’s\ndiscovery materials. For instance, Sergeant Leal had described Soto as a “documented”\nmember of the Nuestra Familia or Nuestra Raza, which implied there were documents\navailable, such as prison classification records, but no such documents had been provided\nin discovery.\n       F.       Charges, Trial, and Sentence\n       Defendant was charged with murder (§ 187), with an allegation that defendant\npersonally and intentionally discharged a firearm, causing great bodily injury or death\n(§ 12022.53, subd. (d)), an allegation that defendant committed the murder for the benefit\nof a criminal street gang (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5)), and an allegation that defendant was a\n\n\n                                             11\n\fminor at the time of the commission of the offense (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 707, subd.\n(b)(1)).\n       The jury found defendant not guilty of first degree murder but guilty of second\ndegree murder, and it found true all of the special allegations. The trial court sentenced\ndefendant to a prison term of 15 years to life for the murder, with a consecutive term of\n25 years to life for the firearm allegation. The trial court did not impose a separate term\nfor the gang enhancement, which provided for a minimum parole eligibility term of 15\nyears. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5); see Lopez, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1007.)\n\n                                   III.   DISCUSSION\n       Defendant’s arguments on appeal all concern Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the\nties between VMV and the Nuestra Familia. Defendant contends there was inadequate\nfoundation for that testimony and that the prosecution violated statutory discovery\nrequirements by failing to timely disclose that Sergeant Leal would testify about VMV’s\nties to the Nuestra Familia. Defendant further contends he received ineffective assistance\nof counsel if his trial counsel’s objections were not sufficient to preserve his appellate\nchallenges to the testimony, and that his trial counsel should have objected on the basis of\nEvidence Code section 352.\n       We begin our analysis of these issues by reviewing the trial proceedings related to\nSergeant Leal’s testimony about the ties between VMV and the Nuestra Familia.\n              1.     Motion in Limine\n       Defendant’s motions in limine included a motion to exclude any gang expert\ntestimony by Sergeant Leal. Defendant argued that Sergeant Leal’s opinion about\nwhether the Fernandez shooting was done for the benefit of a criminal street gang “would\nbe speculative, have no sound basis, and would unduly prejudice [defendant] and confuse\nthe jury with irrelevant and highly inflammatory allegations unsupported by either the\nfacts or the law.” Defendant argued that Sergeant Leal’s testimony could not establish\n\n\n                                             12\n\fthat VMV was a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22. Specifically,\nthe expert witness discovery materials did not contain evidence that VMV’s primary\nactivities were offenses enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e) or evidence that\nVMV members had engaged in a pattern of criminal activity. Defendant requested the\ntrial court hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of Sergeant Leal’s\nexpert opinion.\n       During a hearing on motions in limine, defendant repeated the arguments in his\nwritten motion. He indicated he had received, in discovery, “everything upon which this\nexpert was supposed to have based his opinion.” In response, the prosecutor explained\nthat there was not documentation supporting every aspect of Sergeant Leal’s expert\nopinion. The prosecutor noted that Sergeant Leal had been in a gang unit since 1988 and\nthat some of his opinions were based on conversations he had, not all of which were\ndocumented.\n       The trial court ruled that Sergeant Leal could render an expert opinion about the\nprimary activities of VMV and that the jury could decide if the statutory requirements\nwere met. The trial court noted that defendant’s challenges to Sergeant Leal’s expert\nopinion went to its weight, not its admissibility.\n              2.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part 1\n       After Sergeant Leal gave his initial testimony about the Nuestra Familia’s ties to\nNorteño street gangs “like VMV,” defendant’s trial counsel expressed a “concern.”\nDefendant’s trial counsel asserted that nothing in the discovery summary of Sergeant\nLeal’s testimony contained “any evidence that the Nuestra Familia is directing [VMV].”\nDefendant’s trial counsel indicated he was objecting to that testimony. The trial court\nresponded to the objection as follows: “Well, you can cross-examine him. I mean, I\nthink that’s within his expertise.”\n       On cross-examination, Sergeant Leal specified that his formal training on gangs\nhad covered the Nuestra Familia and Mexican Mafia prison gangs. He also had formal\n                                             13\n\ftraining concerning the VMV gang from the gang detective who preceded him. This\ninformation was not listed on his curriculum vitae. Defendant’s trial counsel asked\nSergeant Leal what evidence supported his testimony about the Nuestra Familia directing\nthe activities of VMV. Sergeant Leal responded, “I don’t have physical evidence that I\ncan show you. My opinion is based on my training and experience, conversations I’ve\nhad with other gang detectives, other police officers who work Norteno gangs, who’ve\nworked [VMV]. It’s also based on conversations I’ve had with prior VMV gang\nmembers and associates and VMV gang members.”\n       Defendant’s trial counsel asked Sergeant Leal if he had any evidence, for instance,\nthat VMV had been “taxing local drug dealers” at the direction of the Nuestra Familia\nand whether he had any evidence that in 2004, the Nuestra Familia had directed VMV\nmembers to commit any specific crimes. Sergeant Leal did not have such evidence. He\nalso did not have any evidence that members of the Nuestra Familia even knew about\nVMV.\n             3.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part 2\n       As noted above, when Sergeant Leal testified for the second time, he named Soto\nand Klipp as VMV members who had direct ties to the Nuestra Familia. Sergeant Leal\ntestified that Soto had been to prison, that Soto was a documented member of the\nNorthern Structure and Nuestra Raza, that Soto controlled a lot of the Bay Area’s\nNorteño gangs, and that in the early 2000’s, Soto had been released from prison with\ninstructions from the Nuestra Familia. Sergeant Leal testified that Klipp was a VMV\ngang member with ties to the Nuestra Familia.\n       During a subsequent break, defendant’s trial counsel objected. Defendant’s trial\ncounsel noted that Sergeant Leal had not previously provided any specific names when\ntestifying about the connection between VMV and the Nuestra Familia, and that Sergeant\nLeal had previously testified that he had no evidence that the Nuestra Familia even knew\nthat VMV existed. Defendant’s trial counsel objected that Sergeant Leal had provided a\n                                            14\n\f“new basis” for his opinion without giving the defense any time to investigate those facts.\nDefendant’s trial counsel argued that this violated the prosecution’s discovery\nobligations. Defendant’s trial counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis of the discovery\nviolation and prosecutorial misconduct. Alternatively, he requested that the testimony\nabout Soto and Klipp be stricken.\n       The prosecutor responded, asserting that she did not know Sergeant Leal would\nmention Soto and Klipp. However, she was aware that Sergeant Leal had done additional\nresearch after he was cross-examined regarding the ties between VMV and the Nuestra\nFamilia. The prosecutor herself knew that Soto was a member of both VMV and the\nNuestra Familia because she was prosecuting a case involving the Nuestra Familia and\nSoto was on a chart in her office. After Sergeant Leal’s initial testimony and cross-\nexamination, he had asked the prosecutor “what was going to happen the next time he\ntestified.” The prosecutor said she would ask him about predicate offenses and primary\nactivities. Sergeant Leal mentioned that he had been cross-examined about the Nuestra\nFamilia’s ties to VMV. The prosecutor told him that her chart of Nuestra Familia\nmembers included “a guy . . . , Soto.” Sergeant Leal said that he knew who Soto was.\n       The trial court noted that defendant’s trial counsel had not objected to Sergeant\nLeal’s testimony about Soto and Klipp. While acknowledging that an objection could\nhave highlighted the testimony, the trial court noted that defendant’s trial counsel could\nhave requested a sidebar, during which the trial court could have precluded the prosecutor\nfrom further questioning Sergeant Leal on the topic of the Nuestra Familia. The court\nfurther noted that Sergeant Leal had not testified that Soto had directed defendant or\nGeorge Oseida. The trial court declined to order a mistrial. The court indicated it\nbelieved the prosecutor should have disclosed to the defense that Sergeant Leal had\ninformation about Soto and Klipp. However, the prosecutor had not asked questions\nconcerning whether the Nuestra Familia had directed VMV, only whether there were ties\nbetween the two groups. Additionally, the defense had not timely objected.\n                                            15\n\f       Defendant’s trial counsel argued that the jury would think that the Nuestra Familia\n“ordered this hit.” He asked the trial court to instruct the jury that the prosecution had\nviolated its discovery obligations.\n       The trial court pointed out that Sergeant Leal had testified that the crime would\nbenefit the shooter’s gang and was done in association with the gang, but not that the\ncrime was done at the direction of a gang. Further, there was no evidence that the\nNuestra Familia had ordered a “hit.” Thus, the jury was not likely to make such an\ninference. The trial court ordered the prosecution not to argue such a theory. The trial\ncourt declined to give a discovery violation instruction, finding that an instruction would\nhighlight the issue and imply there had been a discovery violation, which was not true.\nThe trial court also declined to instruct the jury that there was no evidence the Nuestra\nFamilia had ordered a “hit,” but it noted that the parties could enter into such a\nstipulation.\n               4.    Evidence Code Section 402 Hearing\n       The trial court held an Evidence Code section 402 hearing shortly after the above\ndiscussion. Sergeant Leal acknowledged that during the first part of his testimony, he\nhad testified that he had no evidence that the Northern Structure even knew VMV\nexisted. However, he had subsequently “remembered about them.” Sergeant Leal\ntestified that he had spoken with the prosecutor regarding Soto’s connection to the\nNorthern Structure; the prosecutor had indicated she would be asking him about that\ninformation. Following the hearing, the trial court reiterated it was denying defendant’s\nmistrial motion, and it also denied defendant’s motion to strike Sergeant Leal’s expert\ntestimony.\n       The next day, defendant renewed his motion to strike Sergeant Leal’s testimony\nabout the relationship between the Nuestra Familia and VMV and specifically the\ntestimony regarding Soto and Klipp. Defendant’s trial counsel reiterated that he had not\nreceived any discovery on the relationship between VMV and the Nuestra Familia, the\n                                             16\n\fNorthern Structure, or Nuestra Raza. Defendant’s trial counsel indicated that he wanted\nto investigate Soto and Klipp and that he needed a continuance to do so, unless the\ntestimony was stricken. Defendant’s trial counsel reiterated that his concern was that the\njury would be left with the impression that the Northern Structure or the Nuestra Familia\nwas directing VMV around the time of the Fernandez shooting. The trial court denied\ndefendant’s request, again noting that Sergeant Leal had testified that he could not say\nthat the shooting had been done at the direction of a criminal street gang.\n              5.      Request for CALCRIM No. 306\n       Defendant filed a written motion requesting the trial court instruct the jury on\nuntimely disclosure of evidence pursuant to CALCRIM No. 306.5 The trial court denied\nthe motion, making a number of findings. First, the prosecutor did not ask Sergeant Leal\nto bring in further information about the Nuestra Familia’s ties to VMV; Sergeant Leal\n“did it on his own initiative.” Second, the evidence was not exculpatory. Third, the\ndefense could have requested criminal records for Soto and Klipp on an expedited basis.\nFourth, the instruction relates to the prosecution’s pre-trial discovery obligations, and\nthus it did not exactly apply to the situation. Fifth, there was no evidence that the late\ndisclosure had any effect on the defense. The trial court offered to consider giving an\nalternative instruction drafted by counsel. Defendant’s trial counsel thereafter submitted\na proposed instruction, which is not in the record, but the trial court refused to give it.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         CALCRIM No. 306 provides in part: “Both the People and the defense must\ndisclose their evidence to the other side before trial, within the time limits set by law.\nFailure to follow this rule may deny the other side the chance to produce all relevant\nevidence, to counter opposing evidence, or to receive a fair trial. [¶] An attorney for the\n(People/defense) failed to disclose: <describe evidence that was not disclosed> [within\nthe legal time period]. [¶] In evaluating the weight and significance of that evidence,\nyou may consider the effect, if any, of that late disclosure.”\n\n                                              17\n\f               6.    Foundation\n       Defendant first contends there was inadequate foundation for Sergeant Leal’s\nexpert testimony about VMV’s ties to the Nuestra Familia and that the trial court abused\nits discretion by failing to strike that testimony. (See People v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th\n622, 672 (Fuiava) [abuse of discretion standard applied to claim of inadequate foundation\nfor expert testimony].)\n       An expert may generally base his or her opinion on any “matter” known to him or\nher, including hearsay not otherwise admissible, which may reasonably be relied upon for\nthat purpose. (Evid. Code, § 801, subd. (b).) “Of course, any material that forms the\nbasis of an expert’s opinion testimony must be reliable. [Citation.] For ‘the law does not\naccord to the expert’s opinion the same degree of credence or integrity as it does the data\nunderlying the opinion. Like a house built on sand, the expert’s opinion is no better than\nthe facts on which it is based.’ ” (People v. Gardeley (1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 618\n(Gardeley).)\n       Defendant relies primarily on In re Alexander L. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 605\n(Alexander L.), in which the appellate court found that a gang expert’s testimony lacked\nadequate foundation “because information establishing reliability was never elicited from\nhim at trial.” (Id. at p. 612.) The issue in Alexander L. was whether the gang expert’s\ntestimony was sufficient to establish that the primary activities of the minor’s gang were\noffenses enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e). The gang expert’s entire\ntestimony on the primary activities issue was as follows: “ ‘I know they’ve committed\nquite a few assaults with a deadly weapon, several assaults. I know they’ve been\ninvolved in murders. [¶] I know they’ve been involved with auto thefts, auto/vehicle\nburglaries, felony graffiti, narcotic violations.’ ” (Alexander L., supra, at p. 611.) The\nappellate court found that the testimony lacked foundation because the prosecution failed\nto elicit any “specifics . . . as to the circumstances of these crimes, or where, when, or\nhow [the gang expert] had obtained the information.” (Id. at pp. 611-612.) Without such\n                                              18\n\finformation, the court explained, it was impossible to know whether the basis of the gang\nexpert’s testimony was reliable. (Id. at p. 612.)\n       The court in Alexander L. noted that Gardeley, supra, 14 Cal.4th 605, was a case\nin which “a proper foundation was laid for the expert witness’s testimony.”\n(Alexander L., 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 613.) In Gardeley, the gang expert’s opinion was\nbased on “investigations of hundreds of gang-related offenses, conversations with [the]\ndefendants and other [gang] members, as well as information from fellow officers and\nvarious law enforcement agencies.” (Gardeley, supra, at p. 612.) The Alexander L. court\nexplained why Gardeley was distinguishable: “[U]nlike here, the court knew where the\ninformation to which the expert was testifying originated and was able to assess its\nreliability.” (Alexander L., supra, at p. 613.)\n       Other cases have found that a gang expert’s testimony was based on adequate\nfoundation where the expert testified that his or her opinion was based on personal\ninvestigation. For instance, in People v. Martinez (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1324\n(Martinez), the gang expert’s testimony about the gang’s primary activities had a\nsufficient foundation because the expert had spent “eight years dealing with the gang,\nincluding investigations and personal conversations with members,” and had reviewed\nreports about the gang. (Id. at p. 1330.) In People v. Olguin (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355\n(Olguin), the gang expert’s opinion “that gangs generally react violently to the crossing\nout of their graffiti” had a sufficient foundation where it was “based on his investigation\nof cases over several years, his interviews with gang members and others, and his review\nof police reports.” (Id. at p. 1370.)\n       Here, as in Gardeley, Martinez, and Olguin, the record shows that Sergeant Leal’s\ntestimony about the connections between VMV and the Nuestra Familia was based on his\nexperience and investigation. Sergeant Leal testified that when members of the Nuestra\nFamilia or Nuestra Raza get out of prison, they give orders to street gangs such as VMV,\nand he explained that this testimony was based on his training and experience,\n                                             19\n\fconversations with other officers, and conversations with VMV gang members and\nassociates. When Sergeant Leal returned to the stand later in the trial and identified Soto\nand Klipp as VMV gang members who had “direct ties” to the Nuestra Familia, he\nexplained that he had subsequently “remembered about” Soto and Klipp. In other words,\nthat testimony, too, was based on Sergeant Leal’s training and experience, conversations\nwith other officers, and conversations with VMV gang members and associates. Unlike\nin Alexander L., here it was not “impossible to tell” whether the basis of the gang expert’s\ntestimony was reliable. (Alexander L., supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 612.)\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to strike\nSergeant Leal’s testimony about the ties between VMV and the Nuestra Familia on the\nground that it lacked adequate foundation. (See Fuiava, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 672.)\n              7.     Discovery\n       Defendant next contends that the prosecution violated statutory discovery\nrequirements by failing to timely disclose that Sergeant Leal would testify about VMV’s\nties to the Nuestra Familia. Defendant contends that the trial court should have granted a\nmistrial, stricken the testimony, or instructed the jury regarding the untimely disclosure.\n       The Attorney General contends that defendant failed to preserve this issue for\nappellate review because his discovery objection was not “contemporaneous” with\nSergeant Leal’s challenged testimony. “The requirement that an objection to evidence be\ntimely made is important because it ‘allows the court to remedy the situation before any\nprejudice accrues.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Boyette (2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 424.) An\nobjection that is made during a later break, rather than contemporaneously with the\nintroduction of challenged evidence, may be found untimely. (See People v. Suff (2014)\n58 Cal.4th 1013, 1076.) However, since defendant claims that he received ineffective\nassistance of counsel if this claim was forfeited, we will reach the merits of the issue.\n(See People v. Catlin (2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 129.)\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       In order to establish that trial counsel was ineffective, defendant must show\n(1) that counsel’s performance was deficient because it was not “the result of reasonable\nprofessional judgment” and “outside the wide range of professionally competent\nassistance” (Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466 U.S. 668, 690 (Strickland)) and (2)\nprejudice, that is, a “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different” (id. at p. 694).\n       Pursuant to section 1054.1, subdivision (f), the prosecutor is required to disclose to\nthe defense “[r]elevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or reports of the\nstatements of witnesses whom the prosecutor intends to call at the trial, including any\nreports or statements of experts made in conjunction with the case, including the results\nof physical or mental examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons which\nthe prosecutor intends to offer in evidence at the trial.” The required disclosures “shall be\nmade at least 30 days prior to the trial,” but “[i]f the material and information becomes\nknown to, or comes into the possession of, a party within 30 days of trial, disclosure shall\nbe made immediately.” (§ 1054.7.)\n       If a party has not complied with the discovery requirements of section 1054.1, the\ntrial court “may make any order necessary to enforce” those requirements “including, but\nnot limited to, immediate disclosure, contempt proceedings, delaying or prohibiting the\ntestimony of a witness or the presentation of real evidence, continuance of the matter, or\nany other lawful order.” (§ 1054.5, subd. (b).) The trial court may also “advise the jury\nof any failure or refusal to disclose and of any untimely disclosure.” (Ibid.)\n       In this case, defendant first contends the prosecution should have disclosed that\nSergeant Leal would testify that there was a connection between the Nuestra Familia and\nNorteño street gangs “like VMV.” However, nothing in the record establishes that this\ntestimony was based on any specific discoverable materials such as statements or reports.\n(See § 1054.1, subd. (f).) In fact, on cross-examination, Sergeant Leal specified that he\n\n\n                                             21\n\fhad no “physical evidence” and that his opinion was based on his “training and\nexperience” and conversations with officers and gang members.\n       The Attorney General points out that in People v. Roberts (1992) 2 Cal.4th 271\n(Roberts), the California Supreme Court held that the prosecution has no obligation to\nproduce the “vast array of materials” on which gang experts rely when explaining the\nway gangs work. (Id. at p. 299.) The Roberts defendant had requested “discovery of all\ndocuments and other sources from which the [gang experts] had derived their knowledge,\neven if complying would mean producing everything one witness had seen for seven\nyears,” but the trial court had “rejected the request as too broad and burdensome.” (Id. at\np. 298.) The gang experts subsequently testified about the “practices and rules” of the\ndefendant’s gang. (Ibid.) The California Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s\ndiscovery ruling, finding that the Sixth Amendment’s confrontation clause did not require\nthe prosecutor to disclose the information that the expert testimony was based on. (Id. at\np. 299.)\n       We agree that here, as in Roberts, the prosecution’s discovery obligations did not\nrequire disclosure of every conversation that the gang expert had or every facet of his\ntestimony about how gangs operate. Such an obligation would be “too broad and\nburdensome.” (Roberts, supra, 2 Cal.4th at p. 298.) Thus, trial counsel was not\nineffective for failing to object at the time of Sergeant Leal’s initial testimony.\n       Even if we were to find that reasonable trial counsel would have objected and\nargued that the prosecution had an obligation to tell the defense that Sergeant Leal would\ndescribe how the Nuestra Familia directs or controls Norteño street gangs such as VMV,\nwe would find no prejudice. The challenged testimony did not cause, as defendant\ncontends, “incurable prejudice,” nor did it impact defendant’s right to a fair trial.\nSergeant Leal did not testify that the Nuestra Familia controlled VMV specifically, nor\ndid he testify that the Nuestra Familia directed the commission of the charged offense.\nNone of Sergeant Leal’s testimony established a direct connection between the Nuestra\n                                              22\n\fFamilia and defendant or defendant’s coparticipants, and George Oseida testified that the\nseventh generation members of VMV were not controlled by the Nuestra Familia.\nFurther, the most prejudicial evidence of the connection between the Nuestra Familia and\nVMV came from Figueroa, who testified that defendant had told the Nuestra Familia\nabout Jenkins snitching. Finally, the evidence was overwhelming as to both defendant’s\nguilt of second degree murder and the gang allegation.6 On this record, there is no\n“reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different.” (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at p. 694.)\n       Defendant also contends the prosecution should have disclosed the mid-trial\nconversation between the prosecutor and Sergeant Leal in which the prosecutor named\nSoto as a member of both the Nuestra Familia and VMV. We agree with the trial court\nthat the prosecutor should have disclosed the conversation. As defendant points out, the\nstatutory disclosure requirements apply “to relevant oral statements of witnesses\ncommunicated orally to defense counsel by third parties, such as an investigator.”\n(Roland v. Superior Court (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 154, 163.) However, trial counsel’s\nfailure to object to this testimony did not result in prejudice. The challenged testimony\nwas very general, and it was not inflammatory. Sergeant Leal stated that Soto and Klipp\nwere VMV members with direct ties to the Nuestra Familia. Sergeant Leal did not testify\nthat Soto or Klipp had any direct connection to defendant, to defendant’s coparticipants,\nor to the charged offense. In fact, Sergeant Leal testified that he could not give the\nopinion that the charged offense was committed at the “direction of” a criminal street\n\n       6\n         Defendant claims that the jury’s read-back requests and the length of\ndeliberations (approximately 7 hours over two days) suggest the case was close.\nHowever, considering the length of the trial and number of witnesses, the deliberations\nwere not particularly lengthy, and the jury had to spend a portion of that time determining\nwhether defendant was guilty of first degree murder. Further, even if the deliberations\ncould be characterized as lengthy, this “could as easily be reconciled with the jury’s\nconscientious performance of its civic duty, rather than its difficulty in reaching a\ndecision.” (People v. Walker (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-439.)\n                                             23\n\fgang. (§ 186.22, subd. (b).) Finally, as noted above, the evidence was overwhelming\nboth as to defendant’s guilt of second degree murder and as to the gang allegation. Even\nif trial counsel had timely objected and moved to strike the challenged testimony, there is\nno “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different.” (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at p. 694.)\n              8.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel/Evidence Code Section 352\n       Defendant contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial\ncounsel did not object to the gang expert’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia on the\nbasis of Evidence Code section 352.7\n       Evidence Code section 352 provides: “The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.”\n       Defendant first contends that the evidence concerning the Nuestra Familia prison\ngang “had marginal, if any, relevance to the gang allegations.” “In general, where a gang\nenhancement is alleged, expert testimony concerning the culture, habits, and psychology\nof gangs is permissible because these subjects are ‘sufficiently beyond common\nexperience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.’ [Citations.]”\n(People v. Valdez (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 494, 506.) “[E]vidence of gang membership is\n[also] often relevant to, and admissible regarding, the charged offense.” (People v.\nHernandez (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1049.) “Evidence of the defendant’s gang\naffiliation—including evidence of the gang’s territory, membership, signs, symbols,\nbeliefs and practices, criminal enterprises, rivalries, and the like—can help prove identity,\n\n\n       7\n        Defendant did bring a motion in limine to exclude Sergeant Leal’s entire\ntestimony as unduly prejudicial, which appears to have been intended as a reference to\nEvidence Code section 352. However, this motion did not specifically pertain to\nSergeant Leal’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia.\n                                              24\n\fmotive, modus operandi, specific intent, means of applying force or fear, or other issues\npertinent to guilt of the charged crime. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n       Here, Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the development of Norteño gangs included\nhis description of the Nuestra Familia. His testimony about the history of Norteño gangs\nwas relevant to provide background and context for defendant’s offense, in which he and\na group of VMV members and associates went looking to shoot a member of a rival\nSureño gang without any specific provocation. The evidence was thus relevant to both\nthe gang enhancement and the charged offense.\n       Defendant contends that any relevance of the challenged evidence was\noutweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. As he points out, in the context of Evidence\nCode section 352, “the concept of ‘undue prejudice’ ” refers to “evidence which uniquely\ntends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has\nvery little effect on the issues.” (People v. Branch (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 274, 286.) As\npreviously explained, the challenged evidence did not connect defendant directly to the\nNuestra Familia, Soto, or Klipp. Thus, the challenged evidence did not tend to evoke an\nemotional bias against defendant as an individual.\n       In arguing that Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia was unduly\nprejudicial, defendant cites People v. Albarran (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 214 (Albarran).\nIn Albarran, the defendant was convicted of a number of offenses, with gang allegations\nfound true as to each offense, but the trial court found that insufficient evidence\nsupported the gang allegations and granted his motion for a new trial as to those\nallegations. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court also should have granted\nhim a new trial on the substantive offenses because without the gang allegations, the gang\nevidence was “irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.” (Id. at p. 223.) The Court of Appeal\nagreed, finding that much of the gang evidence, including “threats to kill police officers\n[made by the defendant’s gang], descriptions of the criminal activities of other gang\nmembers, and reference to the Mexican Mafia” was irrelevant and presented a substantial\n                                             25\n\frisk of undue prejudice. (Id. at p. 228.) This case does not involve a motion for a new\ntrial and here there is no dispute that the gang allegations were supported by substantial\nevidence. Thus, Albarran is distinguishable.\n       Because Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia gang was relevant\nand not unduly prejudicial, an objection based on Evidence Code section 352 would not\nhave been meritorious. Thus, even if reasonable trial counsel would have made such an\nobjection, there is no “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.” (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at\np. 694.)\n\n                                   IV.

INTRODUCTION\n         Defendant Giovanni Duarte appeals after a jury convicted him of second degree\nmurder. (Pen. Code, § 187.1) The jury found true an allegation that defendant personally\nand intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death (§ 12022.53,\nsubd. (d)) and an allegation that defendant committed the murder for the benefit of a\ncriminal street gang (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5)). The trial court sentenced defendant to a\nprison term of 15 years to life for the murder, with a consecutive term of 25 years to life\nfor the firearm allegation. The trial court did not impose a separate term for the gang\nenhancement, which provided for a minimum parole eligibility term of 15 years.\n(§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5); see People v.

Defendant contends there was inadequate foundation\nfor the gang expert’s testimony and that the prosecution violated statutory discovery\nrequirements by failing to timely disclose that the gang expert would testify about\nVMV’s ties to the Nuestra Familia. Defendant further contends he received ineffective\nassistance of counsel if his trial counsel’s objections were not sufficient to preserve his\nappellate challenges to the gang expert’s testimony, and that his trial counsel should have\nobjected to the gang expert’s testimony on the basis of Evidence Code section 352.\n       For reasons that we will explain, we will affirm the judgment.\n\n                                 II.     BACKGROUND\n       A.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part I\n       City of Mountain View Police Sergeant Kenneth Leal testified as the prosecution’s\ngang expert. He testified twice at trial. At the beginning of defendant’s trial, Sergeant\nLeal testified about gangs generally, including the VMV gang. Later in the trial, he\ntestified specifically about the elements of the gang allegation.\n       Sergeant Leal had been a police officer for 25 years at the time of defendant’s\ntrial. He was working as the supervisor for the Gang Suppression Team and also as a\npatrol supervisor. He had been working on the Gang Suppression Team since 2005 and\nhad been “working gangs” for his entire law enforcement career, which included a prior\nassignment with the Street Intelligence Unit, in which he gathered gang intelligence.\nSergeant Leal had over 350 hours of formal gang training, which included education at\nseminars and symposiums. Sergeant Leal also had over 500 hours of informal gang\ntraining, which was based on conversations with gang members, gang rivals, gang\nassociates, police officers, and probation officers. He had investigated over 200 gang-\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\frelated crimes. Sergeant Leal personally knew VMV gang members and had personally\ninvestigated crimes committed by VMV gang members.\n       Sergeant Leal made contact with gang members every day on the job. His goal\nwas to have nine out of every 10 contacts be “positive” contacts, during which he\nchecked in with gang members about things like school and jobs. He had over 500\npersonal contacts with gang members, about 150 of which occurred during arrests. From\nconversations with gang members, Sergeant Leal learned how to join a gang, the reasons\nfor joining a gang, the dress and hairstyles of gangs, and the signs and colors of gangs.\nHe also learned the significance of gang tattoos and graffiti, and he learned about gang\nrivalries and allegiances. Sergeant Leal regularly spoke with officers from his own\ndepartment and from other agencies in order to share information and keep up with “gang\ntrends.” He also regularly reviewed police reports and field identification cards.\n       In Santa Clara County, Norteños and Sureños are the two main rival gangs.\nNorteños associate with the color red, the number 14, and the letter “N,” which is the\nfourteenth letter of the alphabet. Norteños, also known as “northerners,” are associated\nwith the Nuestra Familia, which is a northern California prison gang whose members are\nusually serving life sentences. The Nuestra Familia has “soldiers in prison” called\nNuestra Raza or Northern Structure.\n       The Norteño street gangs are “run by the prison gang.” When members of Nuestra\nFamilia or Nuestra Raza get out of prison, they run “street regiments,” giving orders to\nstreet gangs “like VMV.” The Nuestra Familia has a “large influence” on Norteño gangs\nin Santa Clara County. For instance, the Nuestra Familia instructs the street-level gang\nmembers on “who’s in trouble, who’s not.” The street gangs are directed to sell drugs and\n“funnel money back to the prisons.” None of the members of the street gangs are\nmembers of Nuestra Familia.\n       The Mexican Mafia is the “enemy” of Nuestra Familia. The Mexican Mafia is a\nsouthern California prison gang whose street-level gang members are the Sureños. The\n                                             3\n\fMexican Mafia and Sureños associate with the color blue, the number 13, and the letter\n“M,” which is the 13th letter of the alphabet.\n       The VMV is the only Norteño gang in Mountain View. The one Sureño gang in\nMountain View is called the Mountain View Sureños (MVS). The VMV had about 20 to\n35 active members at the time of trial. VMV gang members belong to different\n“generations.” In 2004, VMV gang members considered themselves the seventh\ngeneration.\n       B.     The Shooting of Alex Fernandez\n       On September 24, 2004, Alex Fernandez was killed by two gunshot wounds to his\nchest and abdomen. Fernandez was associated with the MVS gang. He was wearing a\nbelt buckle with an “S” on it at the time of his death, and he had blue tattoos of the\nnumbers one and three on his legs. Several witnesses told police that Norteños had done\nthe shooting. However, the police had no “solid leads” about the identity of the\nperpetrators for several years.\n       The police subsequently learned that defendant had been the shooter—a fact\ndefendant did not dispute at trial, where he claimed he acted in self-defense and\nchallenged the evidence introduced to support the gang allegation.\n       The prosecution ultimately entered into immunity agreements with Anthony\nFigueroa, Marlon Ruiz, George Oseida, and Jonathan Jenkins, all of whom were with\ndefendant at the time of the shooting. Each one had been a member or associate of VMV\nat the time of the Fernandez shooting. Figueroa had not been jumped in to VMV, but his\nfather was a VMV member and the “outside perception” was that he himself was a VMV\nmember. Ruiz also had not been jumped in to VMV, but he was associated with VMV.\nGeorge Oseida was a VMV gang member. In addition to participating in the Fernandez\nhomicide, George Oseida had participated in other gang-related offenses: in 2008, he\nwas arrested for robbery and attempted murder of a rival gang member; in 2004, he was\n\n\n                                              4\n\farrested for assaulting a rival gang member with a rock. Jonathan Jenkins associated\nwith VMV members, and he gave people gang-related tattoos.\n        On September 24, 2004, Figueroa drove Ruiz and Brian Oseida (the brother of\nGeorge Oseida) to a movie theater, where they hung out outside with George Oseida,\nOscar Castillo, and others. Castillo and some of the others were talking about having\nseen some Sureño gang members in a Sureño neighborhood nearby. Figueroa heard\nCastillo and George Oseida refer to “scrap hunting,” which means “[t]o go out and look\nfor Surenos and either assault them or . . . shoot them.”\n        Figueroa, Ruiz, and the Oseida brothers subsequently left the movie theater, with\nFigueroa driving. George Oseida directed Figueroa to a residential neighborhood, then\nmade a phone call. George Oseida told the person on the phone to come outside. George\nOseida got out of the car and went to meet defendant and Jenkins, who came out of a\nhouse. Jenkins appeared to be arguing; he subsequently threw up his hands and walked\naway.\n        Defendant and George Oseida got into Figueroa’s car. George Oseida sat in the\nfront passenger seat, Ruiz was in the back seat behind Figueroa, Brian Oseida was in the\nmiddle of the back seat, and defendant was in the back seat behind George Oseida.\n        George Oseida directed Figueroa into an MVS neighborhood, in which they saw a\ngroup of about 10 to 15 MVS gang members. Someone in the car noted that Juan Luna\nwas in the group. While Figueroa’s car was stopped at a red light, Fernandez and Luna\nstarted to run up to the car; the rest of the group of MVS gang members ran away towards\nsome apartments. Luna also subsequently ran towards the apartments, but Fernandez\ncontinued to approach the passenger side of Figueroa’s car. When Fernandez reached\ninto the front of his pants, Figueroa and George Oseida both ducked, and there was a\n“loud crack.”\n        Fernandez continued to move towards George Oseida, looking like he was about\nto strike George Oseida. Fernandez threw something at the car, causing a “loud crack”\n                                             5\n\fsound. George Oseida yelled, “Buck, buck,” meaning “shoot.” Some of the backseat\npassengers yelled “Get him.” Figueroa heard two gunshots, then saw defendant holding a\ngun. Figueroa drove away from the scene. During the drive, either Brian Oseida or Ruiz\nsaid, “I hope we got him.”\n       According to George Oseida, Oscar Castillo had told him that “scraps” were\n“patrolling” in their neighborhood, which meant that Sureños were “available” to be\nassaulted. George Oseida called defendant because he knew that defendant had a gun.\nGeorge Oseida told defendant that “scraps were patrolling,” and he asked if defendant\nhad his gun. Before getting into Figueroa’s car, defendant showed George Oseida that he\nhad a gun in his backpack. Defendant pulled back the slide on the gun when they entered\nSureño territory. At some point, George Oseida asked defendant to switch seats or give\nhim the gun, because the rear window of the car did not roll down, but defendant said no.\n       According to George Oseida, defendant said, “That was Alex,” after the shooting,\nand Figueroa said, “I hope he dies.” When they cleaned Figueroa’s car, they discovered\nthat Fernandez had thrown something greasy at the car. The day after the shooting,\ndefendant said he had “sand-papered” the barrel of the gun and hidden it. Defendant later\nstated that Jenkins had thrown the gun into a creek, although Jenkins denied any\ninvolvement in disposing of the gun.\n       C.     Other Testimony From Coparticipants\n       Figueroa testified that Ruiz was selling marijuana around the time of the\nFernandez shooting. According to Figueroa, some members of VMV were trying to\n“tax[]” Ruiz for his marijuana sales. Figueroa explained that when a gang member sells\ndrugs, “taxing” means that the person pays some money to the gang in exchange for the\nbenefit of using the gang’s “brand,” which implicitly tells the buyers that the gang will\nback up the seller if the buyer “screw[s]” him. Figueroa was aware that Nuestra Familia\nregiments often sell drugs for the benefit of gangs. However, with respect to Ruiz, he did\n\n\n                                             6\n\fnot believe the Nuestra Familia was involved. Rather, he thought “it was just\nsomebody’s idea to get some money off of somebody for free.”\n       Figueroa spoke to defendant when they were in a holding cell together. Defendant\nexpressed anger that Jenkins had implicated him in a statement and at the preliminary\nhearing. Defendant said he had “let the correct people know in the jail that [Jenkins] was\nmaking statements against him.” According to Figueroa, this meant that defendant had\nreported the snitching to the Northern Structure or the Nuestra Familia.\n       George Oseida testified that in 2004, the VMV gang would hold meetings at\nvarious locations to discuss jumping in new members or getting weapons for the gang.\nHe also testified that a Huelga bird tattoo had two meanings within the Norteño gang\nculture: it can signify that someone is a member of the Northern Structure prison gang,\nor it can simply signify that someone is a member of a Norteño gang. However, “outside\nof the Nuestra Familia,” which is “the ultimate prison gang for the Norteños,” a Huelga\nbird tattoo “should be earned.” A person could earn a Huelga bird tattoo by “putting in\nwork,” i.e., by committing a violent act on a rival gang member.\n       According to George Oseida, a person who drops out of a Norteño gang while in\njail is placed in protective custody, because “the northerners within the jail” will do\nsomething to a dropout. When he first went to jail, he was in the general population with\nother northerners and thus “part of the more powerful gang within the jail.”\n       On cross-examination, George Oseida clarified that none of the seventh generation\nmembers of VMV had any interaction with the Nuestra Familia and that they were not\ncontrolled by the Nuestra Familia. However, when asked if he had ever taken directions\nfrom a prison gang, George Oseida referred to an order “that was handed down” on the\nday his brother was jumped in to the VMV gang. An older gang member had said “there\nwas a green light” on someone, meaning that VMV gang members could not hang out\nwith that person, or that the person should be beaten up or killed.\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       D.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part II\n       Sergeant Leal first learned about the VMV gang when, in 1990 or 1991, he lived\nnear five brothers who were VMV gang members. He talked to the five brothers and\ntheir friends. Sergeant Leal reiterated that the VMV is a Norteño gang and that Norteños\nare the “street level” of the Nuestra Familia. He testified that VMV is part of the Norteño\n“organization” and that VMV had ties to Nuestra Familia.2\n       Sergeant Leal identified Jose Soto as someone who was a VMV gang member in\nthe 1990’s. Soto had been to prison and was a documented member of the Northern\nStructure and Nuestra Raza. Soto controlled a lot of the Bay Area’s Norteño gangs, and\nhe would send his brother into Mountain View. In the early 2000’s, Soto had been\nreleased from prison with instructions from the Nuestra Familia. Soto’s influence then\nprogressed within “the organization.”3 Sergeant Leal also identified Chris Klipp as\nsomeone who was a VMV member and who, like Soto, had “direct ties” to the Nuestra\nFamilia.\n       According to Sergeant Leal, in September of 2004 the primary activities of the\nVMV gang were vandalism, battery, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon. He\nknew this through his personal experience and through conversations with police officers,\ngang members, and witnesses to crimes.\n       To establish that VMV had engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\n(§ 186.22, subds. (e) & (f)), Sergeant Leal testified about additional criminal acts\ncommitted by VMV gang members. On September 18, 2004, VMV gang member\nCipriano Verales committed an assault with personal infliction of great bodily injury.\nAlong with an associate, Verales had beaten up a suspected Sureño gang member.\nSergeant Leal also testified about George Oseida’s 2004 gang-related assault with a rock.\n\n       2\n        Defendant objected to this testimony on the ground it had been “asked and\nanswered and covered in the first examination of this witness.”\n      3\n        Defendant objected to this testimony on the ground it lacked foundation.\n                                             8\n\fIn addition, Sergeant Leal testified about an incident in 2000 involving VMV gang\nmembers Gene Giron and Daniel Blodgett, who had confronted a Sureño gang member.\nGiron was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon; Blodgett was convicted of criminal\nthreats; gang allegations were found true as to both defendants.\n       Sergeant Leal testified that in 2004, defendant had some gang-related tattoos,\nincluding four dots on his left wrist and one dot on his right wrist. After September of\n2004, he had more gang-related tattoos, including “VMV” on his stomach and a Huelga\nbird on his right arm with the words “Loyalty above all laws.”\n       In Sergeant Leal’s opinion, defendant was an active gang member at the time of\nthe Fernandez homicide. His opinion was based on a number of factors, including\ndefendant’s 2006 admission to Sergeant Leal that he had been a member of VMV for\nover three years. Sergeant Leal also believed that, at the time, George Oseida was an\nactive member of VMV, and that Brian Oseida, Figueroa, and Ruiz were all associates of\nVMV.\n       Given a hypothetical mirroring the facts of the case, Sergeant Leal was asked\nwhether the shooting would benefit the shooter’s gang, be done in association with the\ngang, and be at the direction of the gang. (See § 186.22, subd. (b).4) Sergeant Leal\nresponded that the shooting would only benefit the gang and be done in association with\nthe gang.\n       E.     Defense Testimony\n       Gregorio Estevane testified as a gang expert for the defense. Much of his\nknowledge came from talking to gang members, correctional officers, attorneys, and law\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        Section 186.22, subdivision (b) provides for an enhancement when a person is\n“convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association\nwith any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any\ncriminal conduct by gang members.”\n                                              9\n\fenforcement officers. Estevane was not an expert on the VMV gang and had not\npreviously testified in a Norteño gang case.\n       Estevane discussed the history of gangs in California, explaining that they began\nwhen some communities pushed Latinos “off” into segregated areas. The gangs evolved\nwhen some individuals went to prison, resulting in the creation of the Mexican Mafia, the\nAryan Brotherhood, and the Northern Structure. The Mexican Mafia controls most of the\nLatino gangs in Southern California (the Sureños), while the Nuestra Familia controls the\nNorteños. In Santa Clara County, the Nuestra Familia and the Norteños control the jails.\n       There are several common features of California gangs. Their motive is usually to\n“brand fear.” They have a structure, but it may be “loose,” and no formal organization is\nrequired in order for a gang to qualify under section 186.22. Gangs are interested in\nmaking money, so they are usually “heavily engaged in drug dealing” or other illicit\nactivities. Gang members desire to “put in work,” meaning they are ready to go to jail or\njuvenile hall, where they will get more training. A gang member’s “career goal” is\nusually to be in prison and be part of “some kind of a mafia.” Most criminal street gangs\nhave ties to “their parent organizations in the prison system.” There is typically a “direct\nstrong link” between “real street gangs” and prison gangs. Usually, the upper level of a\ngang wants to give input before a gang crime is committed, although occasionally a\nyounger group of gang members may commit a crime without giving any notice to the\nupper level. A typical gang mission includes “branding”—that is, claiming the act to get\na benefit for the gang.\n       Given a hypothetical based on the facts of the instant case, Estevane did not\nbelieve the crime was a “gang event.” The crime was not done in association with a\ncriminal street gang because the driver of the car and some of the passengers were not\npart of the plan. The crime did not benefit the gang because there was no “branding.”\n       Estevane initially testified that in his opinion, VMV was not a criminal street gang\nwithin the meaning of section 186.22. While VMV has a common sign or signal,\n                                               10\n\fEstevane did not think that the “primary activities” requirement was satisfied.\n(See § 186.22, subd. (f).) He would expect to see that members of VMV had been\nconvicted of murder, drug dealing, and extortion. However, he later admitted that under\nsection 186.22, crimes such as assault and vehicle theft could comprise the gang’s\nprimary activities. He also acknowledged that section 186.22 does not require evidence\nof convictions for purposes of the primary activities element.\n       Estevane also did not think that the predicate offenses supported a finding that\nVMV was a criminal street gang. The Verales crime was not prosecuted as a gang crime\n(i.e., there was no gang allegation), and Verales had denied being a gang member,\nalthough the facts did show that Verales had issued a gang challenge during the incident.\nThe George Oseida crime also was questionable as a predicate, because although a gang\nenhancement was alleged, it was not admitted as part of the plea bargain. Estevane later\nacknowledged that predicate offenses do not need to have gang enhancements under\nsection 186.22.\n       Estevane later clarified that he was not giving an opinion about whether VMV\nmeets the statutory definition of a criminal street gang, but that he believed that Sergeant\nLeal’s opinion was not based upon sufficient facts provided in the prosecution’s\ndiscovery materials. For instance, Sergeant Leal had described Soto as a “documented”\nmember of the Nuestra Familia or Nuestra Raza, which implied there were documents\navailable, such as prison classification records, but no such documents had been provided\nin discovery.\n       F.       Charges, Trial, and Sentence\n       Defendant was charged with murder (§ 187), with an allegation that defendant\npersonally and intentionally discharged a firearm, causing great bodily injury or death\n(§ 12022.53, subd. (d)), an allegation that defendant committed the murder for the benefit\nof a criminal street gang (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5)), and an allegation that defendant was a\n\n\n                                             11\n\fminor at the time of the commission of the offense (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 707, subd.\n(b)(1)).\n       The jury found defendant not guilty of first degree murder but guilty of second\ndegree murder, and it found true all of the special allegations. The trial court sentenced\ndefendant to a prison term of 15 years to life for the murder, with a consecutive term of\n25 years to life for the firearm allegation. The trial court did not impose a separate term\nfor the gang enhancement, which provided for a minimum parole eligibility term of 15\nyears. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(5); see Lopez, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1007.)\n\n                                   III.   DISCUSSION\n       Defendant’s arguments on appeal all concern Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the\nties between VMV and the Nuestra Familia. Defendant contends there was inadequate\nfoundation for that testimony and that the prosecution violated statutory discovery\nrequirements by failing to timely disclose that Sergeant Leal would testify about VMV’s\nties to the Nuestra Familia. Defendant further contends he received ineffective assistance\nof counsel if his trial counsel’s objections were not sufficient to preserve his appellate\nchallenges to the testimony, and that his trial counsel should have objected on the basis of\nEvidence Code section 352.\n       We begin our analysis of these issues by reviewing the trial proceedings related to\nSergeant Leal’s testimony about the ties between VMV and the Nuestra Familia.\n              1.     Motion in Limine\n       Defendant’s motions in limine included a motion to exclude any gang expert\ntestimony by Sergeant Leal. Defendant argued that Sergeant Leal’s opinion about\nwhether the Fernandez shooting was done for the benefit of a criminal street gang “would\nbe speculative, have no sound basis, and would unduly prejudice [defendant] and confuse\nthe jury with irrelevant and highly inflammatory allegations unsupported by either the\nfacts or the law.” Defendant argued that Sergeant Leal’s testimony could not establish\n\n\n                                             12\n\fthat VMV was a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22. Specifically,\nthe expert witness discovery materials did not contain evidence that VMV’s primary\nactivities were offenses enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e) or evidence that\nVMV members had engaged in a pattern of criminal activity. Defendant requested the\ntrial court hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of Sergeant Leal’s\nexpert opinion.\n       During a hearing on motions in limine, defendant repeated the arguments in his\nwritten motion. He indicated he had received, in discovery, “everything upon which this\nexpert was supposed to have based his opinion.” In response, the prosecutor explained\nthat there was not documentation supporting every aspect of Sergeant Leal’s expert\nopinion. The prosecutor noted that Sergeant Leal had been in a gang unit since 1988 and\nthat some of his opinions were based on conversations he had, not all of which were\ndocumented.\n       The trial court ruled that Sergeant Leal could render an expert opinion about the\nprimary activities of VMV and that the jury could decide if the statutory requirements\nwere met. The trial court noted that defendant’s challenges to Sergeant Leal’s expert\nopinion went to its weight, not its admissibility.\n              2.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part 1\n       After Sergeant Leal gave his initial testimony about the Nuestra Familia’s ties to\nNorteño street gangs “like VMV,” defendant’s trial counsel expressed a “concern.”\nDefendant’s trial counsel asserted that nothing in the discovery summary of Sergeant\nLeal’s testimony contained “any evidence that the Nuestra Familia is directing [VMV].”\nDefendant’s trial counsel indicated he was objecting to that testimony. The trial court\nresponded to the objection as follows: “Well, you can cross-examine him. I mean, I\nthink that’s within his expertise.”\n       On cross-examination, Sergeant Leal specified that his formal training on gangs\nhad covered the Nuestra Familia and Mexican Mafia prison gangs. He also had formal\n                                             13\n\ftraining concerning the VMV gang from the gang detective who preceded him. This\ninformation was not listed on his curriculum vitae. Defendant’s trial counsel asked\nSergeant Leal what evidence supported his testimony about the Nuestra Familia directing\nthe activities of VMV. Sergeant Leal responded, “I don’t have physical evidence that I\ncan show you. My opinion is based on my training and experience, conversations I’ve\nhad with other gang detectives, other police officers who work Norteno gangs, who’ve\nworked [VMV]. It’s also based on conversations I’ve had with prior VMV gang\nmembers and associates and VMV gang members.”\n       Defendant’s trial counsel asked Sergeant Leal if he had any evidence, for instance,\nthat VMV had been “taxing local drug dealers” at the direction of the Nuestra Familia\nand whether he had any evidence that in 2004, the Nuestra Familia had directed VMV\nmembers to commit any specific crimes. Sergeant Leal did not have such evidence. He\nalso did not have any evidence that members of the Nuestra Familia even knew about\nVMV.\n             3.     Gang Expert Testimony – Part 2\n       As noted above, when Sergeant Leal testified for the second time, he named Soto\nand Klipp as VMV members who had direct ties to the Nuestra Familia. Sergeant Leal\ntestified that Soto had been to prison, that Soto was a documented member of the\nNorthern Structure and Nuestra Raza, that Soto controlled a lot of the Bay Area’s\nNorteño gangs, and that in the early 2000’s, Soto had been released from prison with\ninstructions from the Nuestra Familia. Sergeant Leal testified that Klipp was a VMV\ngang member with ties to the Nuestra Familia.\n       During a subsequent break, defendant’s trial counsel objected. Defendant’s trial\ncounsel noted that Sergeant Leal had not previously provided any specific names when\ntestifying about the connection between VMV and the Nuestra Familia, and that Sergeant\nLeal had previously testified that he had no evidence that the Nuestra Familia even knew\nthat VMV existed. Defendant’s trial counsel objected that Sergeant Leal had provided a\n                                            14\n\f“new basis” for his opinion without giving the defense any time to investigate those facts.\nDefendant’s trial counsel argued that this violated the prosecution’s discovery\nobligations. Defendant’s trial counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis of the discovery\nviolation and prosecutorial misconduct. Alternatively, he requested that the testimony\nabout Soto and Klipp be stricken.\n       The prosecutor responded, asserting that she did not know Sergeant Leal would\nmention Soto and Klipp. However, she was aware that Sergeant Leal had done additional\nresearch after he was cross-examined regarding the ties between VMV and the Nuestra\nFamilia. The prosecutor herself knew that Soto was a member of both VMV and the\nNuestra Familia because she was prosecuting a case involving the Nuestra Familia and\nSoto was on a chart in her office. After Sergeant Leal’s initial testimony and cross-\nexamination, he had asked the prosecutor “what was going to happen the next time he\ntestified.” The prosecutor said she would ask him about predicate offenses and primary\nactivities. Sergeant Leal mentioned that he had been cross-examined about the Nuestra\nFamilia’s ties to VMV. The prosecutor told him that her chart of Nuestra Familia\nmembers included “a guy . . . , Soto.” Sergeant Leal said that he knew who Soto was.\n       The trial court noted that defendant’s trial counsel had not objected to Sergeant\nLeal’s testimony about Soto and Klipp. While acknowledging that an objection could\nhave highlighted the testimony, the trial court noted that defendant’s trial counsel could\nhave requested a sidebar, during which the trial court could have precluded the prosecutor\nfrom further questioning Sergeant Leal on the topic of the Nuestra Familia. The court\nfurther noted that Sergeant Leal had not testified that Soto had directed defendant or\nGeorge Oseida. The trial court declined to order a mistrial. The court indicated it\nbelieved the prosecutor should have disclosed to the defense that Sergeant Leal had\ninformation about Soto and Klipp. However, the prosecutor had not asked questions\nconcerning whether the Nuestra Familia had directed VMV, only whether there were ties\nbetween the two groups. Additionally, the defense had not timely objected.\n                                            15\n\f       Defendant’s trial counsel argued that the jury would think that the Nuestra Familia\n“ordered this hit.” He asked the trial court to instruct the jury that the prosecution had\nviolated its discovery obligations.\n       The trial court pointed out that Sergeant Leal had testified that the crime would\nbenefit the shooter’s gang and was done in association with the gang, but not that the\ncrime was done at the direction of a gang. Further, there was no evidence that the\nNuestra Familia had ordered a “hit.” Thus, the jury was not likely to make such an\ninference. The trial court ordered the prosecution not to argue such a theory. The trial\ncourt declined to give a discovery violation instruction, finding that an instruction would\nhighlight the issue and imply there had been a discovery violation, which was not true.\nThe trial court also declined to instruct the jury that there was no evidence the Nuestra\nFamilia had ordered a “hit,” but it noted that the parties could enter into such a\nstipulation.\n               4.    Evidence Code Section 402 Hearing\n       The trial court held an Evidence Code section 402 hearing shortly after the above\ndiscussion. Sergeant Leal acknowledged that during the first part of his testimony, he\nhad testified that he had no evidence that the Northern Structure even knew VMV\nexisted. However, he had subsequently “remembered about them.” Sergeant Leal\ntestified that he had spoken with the prosecutor regarding Soto’s connection to the\nNorthern Structure; the prosecutor had indicated she would be asking him about that\ninformation. Following the hearing, the trial court reiterated it was denying defendant’s\nmistrial motion, and it also denied defendant’s motion to strike Sergeant Leal’s expert\ntestimony.\n       The next day, defendant renewed his motion to strike Sergeant Leal’s testimony\nabout the relationship between the Nuestra Familia and VMV and specifically the\ntestimony regarding Soto and Klipp. Defendant’s trial counsel reiterated that he had not\nreceived any discovery on the relationship between VMV and the Nuestra Familia, the\n                                             16\n\fNorthern Structure, or Nuestra Raza. Defendant’s trial counsel indicated that he wanted\nto investigate Soto and Klipp and that he needed a continuance to do so, unless the\ntestimony was stricken. Defendant’s trial counsel reiterated that his concern was that the\njury would be left with the impression that the Northern Structure or the Nuestra Familia\nwas directing VMV around the time of the Fernandez shooting. The trial court denied\ndefendant’s request, again noting that Sergeant Leal had testified that he could not say\nthat the shooting had been done at the direction of a criminal street gang.\n              5.      Request for CALCRIM No. 306\n       Defendant filed a written motion requesting the trial court instruct the jury on\nuntimely disclosure of evidence pursuant to CALCRIM No. 306.5 The trial court denied\nthe motion, making a number of findings. First, the prosecutor did not ask Sergeant Leal\nto bring in further information about the Nuestra Familia’s ties to VMV; Sergeant Leal\n“did it on his own initiative.” Second, the evidence was not exculpatory. Third, the\ndefense could have requested criminal records for Soto and Klipp on an expedited basis.\nFourth, the instruction relates to the prosecution’s pre-trial discovery obligations, and\nthus it did not exactly apply to the situation. Fifth, there was no evidence that the late\ndisclosure had any effect on the defense. The trial court offered to consider giving an\nalternative instruction drafted by counsel. Defendant’s trial counsel thereafter submitted\na proposed instruction, which is not in the record, but the trial court refused to give it.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         CALCRIM No. 306 provides in part: “Both the People and the defense must\ndisclose their evidence to the other side before trial, within the time limits set by law.\nFailure to follow this rule may deny the other side the chance to produce all relevant\nevidence, to counter opposing evidence, or to receive a fair trial. [¶] An attorney for the\n(People/defense) failed to disclose: <describe evidence that was not disclosed> [within\nthe legal time period]. [¶] In evaluating the weight and significance of that evidence,\nyou may consider the effect, if any, of that late disclosure.”\n\n                                              17\n\f               6.    Foundation\n       Defendant first contends there was inadequate foundation for Sergeant Leal’s\nexpert testimony about VMV’s ties to the Nuestra Familia and that the trial court abused\nits discretion by failing to strike that testimony. (See People v. Fuiava (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844218\"><a href=\"/opinion/844218/people-v-fuiava/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672 (Fuiava) [abuse of discretion standard applied to claim of inadequate foundation\nfor expert testimony].)\n       An expert may generally base his or her opinion on any “matter” known to him or\nher, including hearsay not otherwise admissible, which may reasonably be relied upon for\nthat purpose.

[Citation.] For ‘the law does not\naccord to the expert’s opinion the same degree of credence or integrity as it does the data\nunderlying the opinion.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Alexander L.), in which the appellate court found that a gang expert’s testimony lacked\nadequate foundation “because information establishing reliability was never elicited from\nhim at trial.” (Id. at p. 612.) The issue in Alexander L. was whether the gang expert’s\ntestimony was sufficient to establish that the primary activities of the minor’s gang were\noffenses enumerated in section 186.22, subdivision (e). The gang expert’s entire\ntestimony on the primary activities issue was as follows: “ ‘I know they’ve committed\nquite a few assaults with a deadly weapon, several assaults. I know they’ve been\ninvolved in murders. [¶] I know they’ve been involved with auto thefts, auto/vehicle\nburglaries, felony graffiti, narcotic violations.’ ” (Alexander L., supra, at p. 611.) The\nappellate court found that the testimony lacked foundation because the prosecution failed\nto elicit any “specifics . . . as to the circumstances of these crimes, or where, when, or\nhow [the gang expert] had obtained the information.” (Id. at pp. 611-612.) Without such\n                                              18\n\finformation, the court explained, it was impossible to know whether the basis of the gang\nexpert’s testimony was reliable. (Id. at p. 612.)\n       The court in Alexander L. noted that Gardeley, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1122997\"><a href=\"/opinion/1122997/people-v-gardeley/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, was a case\nin which “a proper foundation was laid for the expert witness’s testimony.”\n(Alexander L., 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 613.) In Gardeley, the gang expert’s opinion was\nbased on “investigations of hundreds of gang-related offenses, conversations with [the]\ndefendants and other [gang] members, as well as information from fellow officers and\nvarious law enforcement agencies.” (Gardeley, supra, at p. 612.) The Alexander L. court\nexplained why Gardeley was distinguishable: “[U]nlike here, the court knew where the\ninformation to which the expert was testifying originated and was able to assess its\nreliability.” (Alexander L., supra, at p. 613.)\n       Other cases have found that a gang expert’s testimony was based on adequate\nfoundation where the expert testified that his or her opinion was based on personal\ninvestigation. For instance, in People v. Martinez (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244870\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244870/people-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Martinez), the gang expert’s testimony about the gang’s primary activities had a\nsufficient foundation because the expert had spent “eight years dealing with the gang,\nincluding investigations and personal conversations with members,” and had reviewed\nreports about the gang. (Id. at p. 1330.) In People v. Olguin (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Olguin), the gang expert’s opinion “that gangs generally react violently to the crossing\nout of their graffiti” had a sufficient foundation where it was “based on his investigation\nof cases over several years, his interviews with gang members and others, and his review\nof police reports.” (Id. at p. 1370.)\n       Here, as in Gardeley, Martinez, and Olguin, the record shows that Sergeant Leal’s\ntestimony about the connections between VMV and the Nuestra Familia was based on his\nexperience and investigation. Sergeant Leal testified that when members of the Nuestra\nFamilia or Nuestra Raza get out of prison, they give orders to street gangs such as VMV,\nand he explained that this testimony was based on his training and experience,\n                                             19\n\fconversations with other officers, and conversations with VMV gang members and\nassociates. When Sergeant Leal returned to the stand later in the trial and identified Soto\nand Klipp as VMV gang members who had “direct ties” to the Nuestra Familia, he\nexplained that he had subsequently “remembered about” Soto and Klipp. In other words,\nthat testimony, too, was based on Sergeant Leal’s training and experience, conversations\nwith other officers, and conversations with VMV gang members and associates. Unlike\nin Alexander L., here it was not “impossible to tell” whether the basis of the gang expert’s\ntestimony was reliable. (Alexander L., supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 612.)\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to strike\nSergeant Leal’s testimony about the ties between VMV and the Nuestra Familia on the\nground that it lacked adequate foundation. (See Fuiava, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 672.)\n              7.     Discovery\n       Defendant next contends that the prosecution violated statutory discovery\nrequirements by failing to timely disclose that Sergeant Leal would testify about VMV’s\nties to the Nuestra Familia. Defendant contends that the trial court should have granted a\nmistrial, stricken the testimony, or instructed the jury regarding the untimely disclosure.\n       The Attorney General contends that defendant failed to preserve this issue for\nappellate review because his discovery objection was not “contemporaneous” with\nSergeant Leal’s challenged testimony. “The requirement that an objection to evidence be\ntimely made is important because it ‘allows the court to remedy the situation before any\nprejudice accrues.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Boyette (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2544386\"><a href=\"/opinion/2544386/people-v-boyette/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424.) An\nobjection that is made during a later break, rather than contemporaneously with the\nintroduction of challenged evidence, may be found untimely. (See People v.

However, since defendant claims that he received ineffective\nassistance of counsel if this claim was forfeited, we will reach the merits of the issue.\n(See People v. Catlin (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129.)\n\n\n                                             20\n\f       In order to establish that trial counsel was ineffective, defendant must show\n(1) that counsel’s performance was deficient because it was not “the result of reasonable\nprofessional judgment” and “outside the wide range of professionally competent\nassistance” (Strickland v. Washington (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (Strickland)) and (2)\nprejudice, that is, a “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different” (id. at p. 694).\n       Pursuant to section 1054.1, subdivision (f), the prosecutor is required to disclose to\nthe defense “[r]elevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or reports of the\nstatements of witnesses whom the prosecutor intends to call at the trial, including any\nreports or statements of experts made in conjunction with the case, including the results\nof physical or mental examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons which\nthe prosecutor intends to offer in evidence at the trial.” The required disclosures “shall be\nmade at least 30 days prior to the trial,” but “[i]f the material and information becomes\nknown to, or comes into the possession of, a party within 30 days of trial, disclosure shall\nbe made immediately.” (§ 1054.7.)\n       If a party has not complied with the discovery requirements of section 1054.1, the\ntrial court “may make any order necessary to enforce” those requirements “including, but\nnot limited to, immediate disclosure, contempt proceedings, delaying or prohibiting the\ntestimony of a witness or the presentation of real evidence, continuance of the matter, or\nany other lawful order.” (§ 1054.5, subd. (b).) The trial court may also “advise the jury\nof any failure or refusal to disclose and of any untimely disclosure.” (Ibid.)\n       In this case, defendant first contends the prosecution should have disclosed that\nSergeant Leal would testify that there was a connection between the Nuestra Familia and\nNorteño street gangs “like VMV.” However, nothing in the record establishes that this\ntestimony was based on any specific discoverable materials such as statements or reports.\n(See § 1054.1, subd. (f).) In fact, on cross-examination, Sergeant Leal specified that he\n\n\n                                             21\n\fhad no “physical evidence” and that his opinion was based on his “training and\nexperience” and conversations with officers and gang members.\n       The Attorney General points out that in People v. Roberts (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249738/people-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Roberts), the California Supreme Court held that the prosecution has no obligation to\nproduce the “vast array of materials” on which gang experts rely when explaining the\nway gangs work. (Id. at p. 299.) The Roberts defendant had requested “discovery of all\ndocuments and other sources from which the [gang experts] had derived their knowledge,\neven if complying would mean producing everything one witness had seen for seven\nyears,” but the trial court had “rejected the request as too broad and burdensome.” (Id. at\np. 298.) The gang experts subsequently testified about the “practices and rules” of the\ndefendant’s gang. (Ibid.) The California Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s\ndiscovery ruling, finding that the Sixth Amendment’s confrontation clause did not require\nthe prosecutor to disclose the information that the expert testimony was based on. (Id. at\np. 299.)\n       We agree that here, as in Roberts, the prosecution’s discovery obligations did not\nrequire disclosure of every conversation that the gang expert had or every facet of his\ntestimony about how gangs operate. Such an obligation would be “too broad and\nburdensome.” (Roberts, supra, 2 Cal.4th at p. 298.) Thus, trial counsel was not\nineffective for failing to object at the time of Sergeant Leal’s initial testimony.\n       Even if we were to find that reasonable trial counsel would have objected and\nargued that the prosecution had an obligation to tell the defense that Sergeant Leal would\ndescribe how the Nuestra Familia directs or controls Norteño street gangs such as VMV,\nwe would find no prejudice. The challenged testimony did not cause, as defendant\ncontends, “incurable prejudice,” nor did it impact defendant’s right to a fair trial.\nSergeant Leal did not testify that the Nuestra Familia controlled VMV specifically, nor\ndid he testify that the Nuestra Familia directed the commission of the charged offense.\nNone of Sergeant Leal’s testimony established a direct connection between the Nuestra\n                                              22\n\fFamilia and defendant or defendant’s coparticipants, and George Oseida testified that the\nseventh generation members of VMV were not controlled by the Nuestra Familia.\nFurther, the most prejudicial evidence of the connection between the Nuestra Familia and\nVMV came from Figueroa, who testified that defendant had told the Nuestra Familia\nabout Jenkins snitching. Finally, the evidence was overwhelming as to both defendant’s\nguilt of second degree murder and the gang allegation.6 On this record, there is no\n“reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different.” (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at p. 694.)\n       Defendant also contends the prosecution should have disclosed the mid-trial\nconversation between the prosecutor and Sergeant Leal in which the prosecutor named\nSoto as a member of both the Nuestra Familia and VMV. We agree with the trial court\nthat the prosecutor should have disclosed the conversation. As defendant points out, the\nstatutory disclosure requirements apply “to relevant oral statements of witnesses\ncommunicated orally to defense counsel by third parties, such as an investigator.”\n(Roland v. Superior Court (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274665\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274665/roland-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The challenged testimony\nwas very general, and it was not inflammatory. Sergeant Leal stated that Soto and Klipp\nwere VMV members with direct ties to the Nuestra Familia. Sergeant Leal did not testify\nthat Soto or Klipp had any direct connection to defendant, to defendant’s coparticipants,\nor to the charged offense. In fact, Sergeant Leal testified that he could not give the\nopinion that the charged offense was committed at the “direction of” a criminal street\n\n       6\n         Defendant claims that the jury’s read-back requests and the length of\ndeliberations (approximately 7 hours over two days) suggest the case was close.\nHowever, considering the length of the trial and number of witnesses, the deliberations\nwere not particularly lengthy, and the jury had to spend a portion of that time determining\nwhether defendant was guilty of first degree murder. Further, even if the deliberations\ncould be characterized as lengthy, this “could as easily be reconciled with the jury’s\nconscientious performance of its civic duty, rather than its difficulty in reaching a\ndecision.” (People v. Walker (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2263292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2263292/people-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Finally, as noted above, the evidence was overwhelming\nboth as to defendant’s guilt of second degree murder and as to the gang allegation. Even\nif trial counsel had timely objected and moved to strike the challenged testimony, there is\nno “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different.” (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at p. 694.)\n              8.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel/Evidence Code Section 352\n       Defendant contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial\ncounsel did not object to the gang expert’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia on the\nbasis of Evidence Code section 352.7\n       Evidence Code section 352 provides: “The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.”\n       Defendant first contends that the evidence concerning the Nuestra Familia prison\ngang “had marginal, if any, relevance to the gang allegations.” “In general, where a gang\nenhancement is alleged, expert testimony concerning the culture, habits, and psychology\nof gangs is permissible because these subjects are ‘sufficiently beyond common\nexperience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.’ [Citations.]”\n(People v. Valdez (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506.) “[E]vidence of gang membership is\n[also] often relevant to, and admissible regarding, the charged offense.” (People v.\nHernandez (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548849\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548849/people-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1049.) “Evidence of the defendant’s gang\naffiliation—including evidence of the gang’s territory, membership, signs, symbols,\nbeliefs and practices, criminal enterprises, rivalries, and the like—can help prove identity,\n\n\n       7\n        Defendant did bring a motion in limine to exclude Sergeant Leal’s entire\ntestimony as unduly prejudicial, which appears to have been intended as a reference to\nEvidence Code section 352. However, this motion did not specifically pertain to\nSergeant Leal’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia.\n                                              24\n\fmotive, modus operandi, specific intent, means of applying force or fear, or other issues\npertinent to guilt of the charged crime. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n       Here, Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the development of Norteño gangs included\nhis description of the Nuestra Familia. His testimony about the history of Norteño gangs\nwas relevant to provide background and context for defendant’s offense, in which he and\na group of VMV members and associates went looking to shoot a member of a rival\nSureño gang without any specific provocation. The evidence was thus relevant to both\nthe gang enhancement and the charged offense.\n       Defendant contends that any relevance of the challenged evidence was\noutweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. As he points out, in the context of Evidence\nCode section 352, “the concept of ‘undue prejudice’ ” refers to “evidence which uniquely\ntends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has\nvery little effect on the issues.” (People v. Branch (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2261720\"><a href=\"/opinion/2261720/people-v-branch/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286.) As\npreviously explained, the challenged evidence did not connect defendant directly to the\nNuestra Familia, Soto, or Klipp. Thus, the challenged evidence did not tend to evoke an\nemotional bias against defendant as an individual.\n       In arguing that Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia was unduly\nprejudicial, defendant cites People v. Albarran (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Albarran).\nIn Albarran, the defendant was convicted of a number of offenses, with gang allegations\nfound true as to each offense, but the trial court found that insufficient evidence\nsupported the gang allegations and granted his motion for a new trial as to those\nallegations. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court also should have granted\nhim a new trial on the substantive offenses because without the gang allegations, the gang\nevidence was “irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.” (Id. at p. 223.) The Court of Appeal\nagreed, finding that much of the gang evidence, including “threats to kill police officers\n[made by the defendant’s gang], descriptions of the criminal activities of other gang\nmembers, and reference to the Mexican Mafia” was irrelevant and presented a substantial\n                                             25\n\frisk of undue prejudice. (Id. at p. 228.) This case does not involve a motion for a new\ntrial and here there is no dispute that the gang allegations were supported by substantial\nevidence. Thus, Albarran is distinguishable.\n       Because Sergeant Leal’s testimony about the Nuestra Familia gang was relevant\nand not unduly prejudicial, an objection based on Evidence Code section 352 would not\nhave been meritorious. Thus, even if reasonable trial counsel would have made such an\nobjection, there is no “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.” (Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at\np. 694.)\n\n                                   IV.
