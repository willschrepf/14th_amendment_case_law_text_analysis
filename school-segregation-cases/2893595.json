Berger and Realty Research Corporation (“RRC”)\n\n(together “appellants”) appeal the District Court’s order granting summary judgment to\n\fappellees the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Department of Treasury (“DOT”)\n\nand denying appellants’ request for disclosure of documents under the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and certain\n\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). We will affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       Appellants were the subjects of a civil Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (“TFRP”)\n\ninvestigation and criminal investigation by the IRS. The investigation did not result in\n\nany charges against either of them. On December 8, 2003, they wrote to the IRS\n\nrequesting records pertaining to themselves and to the investigations of them under the\n\nFOIA, the Privacy Act, and the IRC. In addition to other records, appellants requested the\n\ntime records of Revenue Officer Mary Williams, who conducted the TFRP investigation.\n\n       The IRS responded on July 23, 2004, releasing 459 pages of documents, but\n\nadvised appellants that it was withholding in full or in part numerous documents exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under FOIA. On August 27, 2004, appellants appealed and expanded the\n\nscope of their document request. On July 15, 2005, the IRS Appeals Office released\n\nadditional documents, but reaffirmed its decision to withhold the rest.\n\n       On August 3, 2005, appellants filed a complaint in the District Court seeking\n\ndisclosure of the withheld documents. The case was referred to Mary Ellen Keys, an\n\nattorney at the IRS’s Office of Assistant Chief Counsel for Disclosure and Privacy Law.\n\nOn June 6, 2006, appellants wrote to the IRS, again expanding the scope of their\n\n\n                                             2\n\fdocument request. On or about August 15, 2006, the IRS released approximately 900\n\nadditional pages.\n\n       On October 27, 2006, appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing that the\n\nremaining pages had been properly withheld. Affidavits from IRS officers were\n\nsubmitted in support of the motion, including the Declaration of Ms. Keys, explaining\n\nwhich pages had been withheld and the reasons for withholding them. Keys stated that\n\nOfficer Williams’s time records consisted of 711 pages that were being withheld in their\n\nentirety under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (“Exemption 6”). Keys noted that, in addition to\n\nExemption 6, the time records could also be withheld under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)\n\n(“Exemption 3”), in conjunction with 26 U.S.C. § 6103(a), because the information\n\nlargely consisted of information relating to third-party taxpayers.\n\n       On December 8, 2006, appellants filed a brief in opposition to appellees’ motion\n\nand submitted a copy of the “Vaughn” index prepared by the IRS in conjunction with the\n\nsummary judgment motion.1 On January 9, 2007, the IRS informed the District Court that\n\nit intended to release additional pages, and, on January 19, 2006, twenty-two pages were\n\nreleased. On January 12, 2007, appellees filed a reply brief together with additional\n\naffidavits, including another Declaration of Ms. Keys responding to arguments made in\n\nappellants’ brief. Keys stated that the IRS had withheld Officer Williams’ time records\n\n\n\n   1\n     A “Vaughn” index is an affidavit that supplies an index of withheld documents and\ndetails the agency’s justification for claiming an exemption. Patterson v. Fed. Bureau of\nInvestigation, 893 F.2d 595, 599 n.7 (3d Cir. 1990).\n\n                                             3\n\funder Exemption 6 because they were a “personal accounting of the time spent on the\n\njob,” reporting time spent examining various taxpayers and time reported as sick leave,\n\nvacation time, training, and other administrative reasons, and that disclosure would be a\n\n“clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” App. at 388. On May 22, 2007, the\n\nDistrict Court granted appellees’ motion for summary judgment, finding that the balance\n\nof the time records had been properly withheld under Exemption 6, and that the Privacy\n\nAct did not otherwise require their disclosure. Appellants timely appealed. We have\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Appellants argue that Officer Williams’s time records are not protected by\n\nExemption 6 of the FOIA, their release is required under the Privacy Act, and that the\n\nDistrict Court abused its discretion by declining to conduct an in camera review of the\n\nremaining documents withheld by the IRS.\n\n       When reviewing an order of a district court granting summary judgment in\n\nproceedings seeking disclosure under the FOIA, a reviewing court must determine\n\nwhether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its decision and, if so, whether\n\nthat decision was clearly erroneous. Abdelfattah v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 488\n\nF.3d 178, 182 (3d Cir. 2007). We will reverse only “if the findings are unsupported by\n\nsubstantial evidence, lack adequate evidentiary support in the record, are against the clear\n\nweight of the evidence or where the district court has misapprehended the weight of the\n\n\n                                              4\n\fevidence.” Id., quoting Lame v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 767 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir. 1985).\n\n       Exemption 6 of the FOIA exempts from disclosure “personnel and medical files\n\nand similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion\n\nof personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). To determine whether the exemption applies,\n\ncourts balance the public interest in disclosure against the privacy interest protected by\n\nthe exemption. Sheet Metal Workers Int’l Assn, Local Union No. 19 v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nVeterans Affairs, 135 F.3d 891, 897 (3d Cir. 1998). There is a presumption in favor of\n\ndisclosure, and the agency has the burden of proving that an exemption applies. Id.\n\n       Appellants first argue that Officer Williams’s time records are not “similar files”\n\nthat would be expected to contain the type of personal information Exemption 6 was\n\ndesigned to protect, and instead merely reflect the activities she performed while\n\ninvestigating appellants or performing other work-related functions. However, the term\n\n“similar files” is construed broadly and not limited to those files that contain intimate\n\ndetails or highly personal information. U.S. Dep’t of State v. Washington Post Co., 456\n\nU.S. 595, 600 (1982). Rather, the exemption is intended to cover records that can be\n\n“identified as applying to that individual.” Id. at 602. Williams’s time records are a\n\npersonal recording of the time expended as an employee and therefore can be identified as\n\napplying to her.\n\n       Appellants argue that even if the time records are “similar files,” Officer Williams\n\nhas only a minimal, if any, privacy interest in those records. They argue, moreover, that\n\n\n                                              5\n\feven assuming she has a privacy interest in those parts of her time records containing\n\npersonal information, this does not explain why the rest of those records are protected.\n\nWilliams, they argue, would not be expected to have a privacy interest in those parts of\n\nthe records that merely recount the activities performed during the course of her official\n\nduties as an employee of the IRS. We disagree. Williams has a privacy interest in her\n\nrecords as a whole because they are a personal recording of how she spent her time at\n\nwork. Whether some parts contain information not subject to an exemption goes to\n\nwhether those parts are segregable from the portions that are exempt,2 and the District\n\nCourt found they were not. Moreover, “even a slight privacy interest will tip the scales in\n\nfavor of non-disclosure” when balanced against a weak public interest in disclosure.\n\nSheet Metal Workers Int’l Ass’n, Local Union No. 19, 135 F.3d at 904.\n\n       Appellants argue that the District Court erroneously found both that the public did\n\nnot have an interest in the time records and that Officer Williams’s privacy interest\n\noutweighed any public interest in disclosure. When balancing the privacy interest against\n\nthe public interest in disclosure, the only relevant public interest is the extent to which\n\ndisclosure would “serve the ‘core purpose of the FOIA,’ which is ‘contributing\n\n\n\n   2\n      When responding to requests for the release of documents, “[a]ny reasonably\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record\nafter deletion of the portions which are exempt . . . .” 5 U.S.C. 552(b). The District\nCourt found that “considering the extensive amount of personal information” in the time\nrecords, they “may not be reasonably segregated such that only information which would\nnot clearly invade Williams’s personal privacy would be disclosed.” App. at 35. Ms.\nKeys’s Declarations support this finding.\n\n                                               6\n\fsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.’”\n\nId. at 897 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Defense v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487\n\n(1994)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n       Appellants maintain that the public has an interest in the manner in which the IRS\n\nconducts civil tax investigations, whether public servants carry out their duties in an\n\nefficient and law-abiding manner, whether investigations are comprehensive, and whether\n\nbudget monies are allotted in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Disclosure of\n\nOfficer Williams’s time records, however, would not “contribute significantly” to the\n\npublic understanding of the operations of the IRS or “appreciably further the citizens[’]\n\nright to be informed about what their government is up to.” Id. at 900 (quoting Dep’t of\n\nDefense, 510 U.S. at 497). Indeed, disclosure of her records would only serve appellants’\n\nnarrow interest in knowing how she investigated their particular case. Williams’s privacy\n\ninterest in her time records, even if slight, outweighs this weak public interest in their\n\ndisclosure, and disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.3\n\n                                             III.\n\n       Our scope of review of the grant of a motion for summary judgment with respect\n\nto disclosure under the Privacy Act is the same as that used by the District Court.\n\nPatterson v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 893 F.2d 595, 602 (3d Cir. 1990). We must\n\n\n\n\n   3\n     Because we hold that Officer Williams’s time records are exempt under Exemption\n6, we need not reach the issue of whether they are also exempt under Exemption 3.\n\n                                              7\n\fdecide whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact in dispute, assuming\n\nresolution of the disputed fact in favor of the non-moving party, and determine whether\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.\n\n       Appellants argue that the time records should have been released to them under the\n\nPrivacy Act because they include information pertaining to Berger4 that can be retrieved\n\nby taxpayer name.5 Under the Privacy Act, an individual may request from an agency\n\naccess to his records or to “any information pertaining to him” which is maintained in a\n\nsystem of records from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or\n\nsome other identifier assigned to that individual. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5) and (d)(1).\n\nRecords shall not be disclosed “except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior\n\nwritten consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains . . . .” Id. § 552a(b).\n\n       Officer Williams’s time records were created pursuant to the conditions of her\n\nemployment, not, as appellants suggest, “in connection with” her investigation of them.\n\nReply Br. at 8. Those records record the time Williams spent performing her job duties –\n\ninvestigating other taxpayers as well as appellants, training, and administrative work – as\n\nwell as her vacation time and sick leave. Therefore, the time records pertain to Williams,\n\n\n\n   4\n     The Privacy Act only applies to the records of individuals and therefore this\nchallenge is to records pertaining to Berger only.\n   5\n      The parties dispute for the first time on appeal whether time records are retrievable\nfrom an IRS system of records by taxpayer name. In the District Court, the parties limited\ntheir Privacy Act arguments to whether the time records pertained to Berger. We do so as\nwell, and agree with the District Court that they do not.\n\n                                              8\n\fnot Berger, and cannot, absent the consent of Williams, be released under the Privacy\n\nAct.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       Finally, appellants argue that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to\n\nperform an in camera review of the “relatively few remaining documents” that were\n\nwithheld. Reply Br. at 25. Review was necessary, they argue, to ensure that the IRS had\n\ncomplied with the FOIA’s segregation requirement and because the IRS’s conduct and\n\naffidavits suggested that it was not withholding documents in good faith. The FOIA\n\npermits a district court to examine in camera the contents of agency records that have\n\nbeen withheld. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). Such review is discretionary. Hilton v. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, 844 F.2d 126, 128 (3d Cir. 1988). In camera review, however, should not be\n\nresorted to “routinely” and is unnecessary if agency affidavits or other showings are\n\nspecific. Ferri v. Bell, 645 F.2d 1213, 1225-26 (3d Cir. 1981).\n\n       The District Court concluded that in camera review was not warranted because it\n\nwas “satisfied with the detail and specificity” of the IRS’s affidavits, in particular the\n\nDeclarations of Ms. Keys, and of the Vaughn index, and because there was no evidence\n\nthat the IRS acted in bad faith. App. at 14. The District Court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin so concluding. Moreover, the IRS was at all times responsive to appellants’ requests\n\nand, indeed, re-reviewed the records each time appellants expanded the scope of their\n\ndocument requests and, again, after they submitted their brief on the motion for summary\n\n\n                                               9\n\fjudgment.\n\n                                          V.\n\n      We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f",

Berger and Realty Research Corporation (“RRC”)\n\n(together “appellants”) appeal the District Court’s order granting summary judgment to\n\fappellees the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Department of Treasury (“DOT”)\n\nand denying appellants’ request for disclosure of documents under the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and certain\n\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). We will affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       Appellants were the subjects of a civil Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (“TFRP”)\n\ninvestigation and criminal investigation by the IRS. The investigation did not result in\n\nany charges against either of them. On December 8, 2003, they wrote to the IRS\n\nrequesting records pertaining to themselves and to the investigations of them under the\n\nFOIA, the Privacy Act, and the IRC. In addition to other records, appellants requested the\n\ntime records of Revenue Officer Mary Williams, who conducted the TFRP investigation.\n\n       The IRS responded on July 23, 2004, releasing 459 pages of documents, but\n\nadvised appellants that it was withholding in full or in part numerous documents exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under FOIA. On August 27, 2004, appellants appealed and expanded the\n\nscope of their document request. On July 15, 2005, the IRS Appeals Office released\n\nadditional documents, but reaffirmed its decision to withhold the rest.\n\n       On August 3, 2005, appellants filed a complaint in the District Court seeking\n\ndisclosure of the withheld documents. The case was referred to Mary Ellen Keys, an\n\nattorney at the IRS’s Office of Assistant Chief Counsel for Disclosure and Privacy Law.\n\nOn June 6, 2006, appellants wrote to the IRS, again expanding the scope of their\n\n\n                                             2\n\fdocument request. On or about August 15, 2006, the IRS released approximately 900\n\nadditional pages.\n\n       On October 27, 2006, appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing that the\n\nremaining pages had been properly withheld. Affidavits from IRS officers were\n\nsubmitted in support of the motion, including the Declaration of Ms. Keys, explaining\n\nwhich pages had been withheld and the reasons for withholding them. Keys stated that\n\nOfficer Williams’s time records consisted of 711 pages that were being withheld in their\n\nentirety under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (“Exemption 6”). Keys noted that, in addition to\n\nExemption 6, the time records could also be withheld under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)\n\n(“Exemption 3”), in conjunction with 26 U.S.C. § 6103(a), because the information\n\nlargely consisted of information relating to third-party taxpayers.\n\n       On December 8, 2006, appellants filed a brief in opposition to appellees’ motion\n\nand submitted a copy of the “Vaughn” index prepared by the IRS in conjunction with the\n\nsummary judgment motion.1 On January 9, 2007, the IRS informed the District Court that\n\nit intended to release additional pages, and, on January 19, 2006, twenty-two pages were\n\nreleased. On January 12, 2007, appellees filed a reply brief together with additional\n\naffidavits, including another Declaration of Ms. Keys responding to arguments made in\n\nappellants’ brief. Keys stated that the IRS had withheld Officer Williams’ time records\n\n\n\n   1\n     A “Vaughn” index is an affidavit that supplies an index of withheld documents and\ndetails the agency’s justification for claiming an exemption.

On May 22, 2007, the\n\nDistrict Court granted appellees’ motion for summary judgment, finding that the balance\n\nof the time records had been properly withheld under Exemption 6, and that the Privacy\n\nAct did not otherwise require their disclosure. Appellants timely appealed. We have\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Appellants argue that Officer Williams’s time records are not protected by\n\nExemption 6 of the FOIA, their release is required under the Privacy Act, and that the\n\nDistrict Court abused its discretion by declining to conduct an in camera review of the\n\nremaining documents withheld by the IRS.\n\n       When reviewing an order of a district court granting summary judgment in\n\nproceedings seeking disclosure under the FOIA, a reviewing court must determine\n\nwhether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its decision and, if so, whether\n\nthat decision was clearly erroneous.

To determine whether the exemption applies,\n\ncourts balance the public interest in disclosure against the privacy interest protected by\n\nthe exemption. Sheet Metal Workers Int’l Assn, Local Union No. 19 v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nVeterans Affairs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897 (3d Cir. 1998). There is a presumption in favor of\n\ndisclosure, and the agency has the burden of proving that an exemption applies. Id.\n\n       Appellants first argue that Officer Williams’s time records are not “similar files”\n\nthat would be expected to contain the type of personal information Exemption 6 was\n\ndesigned to protect, and instead merely reflect the activities she performed while\n\ninvestigating appellants or performing other work-related functions. However, the term\n\n“similar files” is construed broadly and not limited to those files that contain intimate\n\ndetails or highly personal information. U.S. Dep’t of State v. Washington Post Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110709\"><a href=\"/opinion/110709/department-of-state-v-washington-post-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (1982). Rather, the exemption is intended to cover records that can be\n\n“identified as applying to that individual.” Id. at 602. Williams’s time records are a\n\npersonal recording of the time expended as an employee and therefore can be identified as\n\napplying to her.\n\n       Appellants argue that even if the time records are “similar files,” Officer Williams\n\nhas only a minimal, if any, privacy interest in those records. They argue, moreover, that\n\n\n                                              5\n\feven assuming she has a privacy interest in those parts of her time records containing\n\npersonal information, this does not explain why the rest of those records are protected.\n\nWilliams, they argue, would not be expected to have a privacy interest in those parts of\n\nthe records that merely recount the activities performed during the course of her official\n\nduties as an employee of the IRS. We disagree. Williams has a privacy interest in her\n\nrecords as a whole because they are a personal recording of how she spent her time at\n\nwork. Whether some parts contain information not subject to an exemption goes to\n\nwhether those parts are segregable from the portions that are exempt,2 and the District\n\nCourt found they were not. Moreover, “even a slight privacy interest will tip the scales in\n\nfavor of non-disclosure” when balanced against a weak public interest in disclosure.\n\nSheet Metal Workers Int’l Ass’n, Local Union No. 19, 135 F.3d at 904.\n\n       Appellants argue that the District Court erroneously found both that the public did\n\nnot have an interest in the time records and that Officer Williams’s privacy interest\n\noutweighed any public interest in disclosure. When balancing the privacy interest against\n\nthe public interest in disclosure, the only relevant public interest is the extent to which\n\ndisclosure would “serve the ‘core purpose of the FOIA,’ which is ‘contributing\n\n\n\n   2\n      When responding to requests for the release of documents, “[a]ny reasonably\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record\nafter deletion of the portions which are exempt . . . .” 5 U.S.C. 552(b). The District\nCourt found that “considering the extensive amount of personal information” in the time\nrecords, they “may not be reasonably segregated such that only information which would\nnot clearly invade Williams’s personal privacy would be disclosed.” App. at 35. Ms.\nKeys’s Declarations support this finding.\n\n                                               6\n\fsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.’”\n\nId. at 897 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Defense v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112932\"><a href=\"/opinion/112932/department-of-defense-v-flra/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1994)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n       Appellants maintain that the public has an interest in the manner in which the IRS\n\nconducts civil tax investigations, whether public servants carry out their duties in an\n\nefficient and law-abiding manner, whether investigations are comprehensive, and whether\n\nbudget monies are allotted in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Disclosure of\n\nOfficer Williams’s time records, however, would not “contribute significantly” to the\n\npublic understanding of the operations of the IRS or “appreciably further the citizens[’]\n\nright to be informed about what their government is up to.” Id. at 900 (quoting Dep’t of\n\nDefense, 510 U.S. at 497). Indeed, disclosure of her records would only serve appellants’\n\nnarrow interest in knowing how she investigated their particular case. Williams’s privacy\n\ninterest in her time records, even if slight, outweighs this weak public interest in their\n\ndisclosure, and disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.3\n\n                                             III.\n\n       Our scope of review of the grant of a motion for summary judgment with respect\n\nto disclosure under the Privacy Act is the same as that used by the District Court.\n\nPatterson v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534800\"><a href=\"/opinion/534800/nos-89-5342-89-5781/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 602 (3d Cir. 1990). We must\n\n\n\n\n   3\n     Because we hold that Officer Williams’s time records are exempt under Exemption\n6, we need not reach the issue of whether they are also exempt under Exemption 3.\n\n                                              7\n\fdecide whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact in dispute, assuming\n\nresolution of the disputed fact in favor of the non-moving party, and determine whether\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.\n\n       Appellants argue that the time records should have been released to them under the\n\nPrivacy Act because they include information pertaining to Berger4 that can be retrieved\n\nby taxpayer name.5 Under the Privacy Act, an individual may request from an agency\n\naccess to his records or to “any information pertaining to him” which is maintained in a\n\nsystem of records from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or\n\nsome other identifier assigned to that individual. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(5) and (d)(1).\n\nRecords shall not be disclosed “except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior\n\nwritten consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains . . . .” Id. § 552a(b).\n\n       Officer Williams’s time records were created pursuant to the conditions of her\n\nemployment, not, as appellants suggest, “in connection with” her investigation of them.\n\nReply Br. at 8. Those records record the time Williams spent performing her job duties –\n\ninvestigating other taxpayers as well as appellants, training, and administrative work – as\n\nwell as her vacation time and sick leave. Therefore, the time records pertain to Williams,\n\n\n\n   4\n     The Privacy Act only applies to the records of individuals and therefore this\nchallenge is to records pertaining to Berger only.\n   5\n      The parties dispute for the first time on appeal whether time records are retrievable\nfrom an IRS system of records by taxpayer name. In the District Court, the parties limited\ntheir Privacy Act arguments to whether the time records pertained to Berger. We do so as\nwell, and agree with the District Court that they do not.\n\n                                              8\n\fnot Berger, and cannot, absent the consent of Williams, be released under the Privacy\n\nAct.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       Finally, appellants argue that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to\n\nperform an in camera review of the “relatively few remaining documents” that were\n\nwithheld. Reply Br. at 25. Review was necessary, they argue, to ensure that the IRS had\n\ncomplied with the FOIA’s segregation requirement and because the IRS’s conduct and\n\naffidavits suggested that it was not withholding documents in good faith. The FOIA\n\npermits a district court to examine in camera the contents of agency records that have\n\nbeen withheld. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). Such review is discretionary. Hilton v. Dep’t of\n\nJustice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504394\"><a href=\"/opinion/504394/william-h-hinton-v-the-department-of-justice-and-the-federal-bureau-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128 (3d Cir. 1988).

App. at 14. The District Court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin so concluding. Moreover, the IRS was at all times responsive to appellants’ requests\n\nand, indeed, re-reviewed the records each time appellants expanded the scope of their\n\ndocument requests and, again, after they submitted their brief on the motion for summary\n\n\n                                               9\n\fjudgment.\n\n                                          V.\n\n      We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f</pre>",
