In 1997, Milwaukee County’s\nJuvenile Detention Center instituted a policy that re-\nquired each unit of the facility to be staffed at all times by\nat least one officer of the same sex as the detainees\nhoused on that unit. Because there were far more male\nunits than female units at the facility, this policy had the\neffect of reducing the number of shifts available for female\n\f2                                                   No. 07-2534\n\nofficers. Ersol Henry and Terri Lewis, both female officers\nat the facility, brought this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, alleg-\ning sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title\nVII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. After a bench trial, the district\ncourt concluded that the gender-specific policy was based\non a bona fide occupational qualification and that no\nother discrimination or retaliation had occurred; accord-\ningly, it entered judgment in favor of the County. For the\nreasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the judg-\nment of the district court.\n\n\n                                I\n                      BACKGROUND\n                               A.\n  At the time relevant to this appeal, Ersol Henry and Terri\nLewis were employed as Juvenile Corrections Officers\n(“JCOs”) at the Milwaukee County Juvenile Detention\nCenter (“JDC”). The JDC, part of the Wisconsin State\nJuvenile Justice System, is a detention facility designed to\nhouse temporarily juveniles awaiting juvenile court\nproceedings.\n  The statutory mission of the Wisconsin juvenile justice\nsystem includes, inter alia, punishment, deterrence, and\n“the development of competency in the juvenile offender,\nso that he or she is more capable of living productively and\nresponsibly in the community.” Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(c).\nThe mission statement of the JDC, in particular, states\nthat the facility is intended:\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                  3\n\n    1. To serve the community by providing care for\n    young people who, because they represent a danger to\n    themselves or others, could not remain safely in the\n    community pending the outcome of a Juvenile Court\n    proceeding.\n    2. To serve the Juvenile Courts by maintaining close\n    supervision and observation of youngsters and en-\n    suring their appearance in court.\n    3. To serve the detained youth by providing the\n    best possible care in an atmosphere of fairness and\n    dignity so that their encounter with the Juvenile\n    Justice System can be a positive one.\nTr. Ex. 1021.\n  Most juveniles at the JDC are detained there for only a\nshort period of time. The average length of stay is ten\ndays, although for those juveniles awaiting their initial\ncourt appearances, the average stay is approximately\nthree weeks. Juveniles often are detained for as little as one\nday. Occasionally, a juvenile may be detained there for\nas long as one year.\n  In 1991, Thomas Wanta was appointed superintendent\nof the JDC. The facility that Mr. Wanta inherited in\n1991 was a poorly-maintained, over-crowded detention\nfacility built for indirect (also known as linear) supervision.\nThe juveniles were housed in cells on a long hallway, and\nJCOs walked the halls monitoring the inmates from the\noutside without much interaction. Mr. Wanta believed\nthat this indirect form of supervision was a poor way\nto care for and to rehabilitate juveniles; accordingly, he\n\f4                                                No. 07-2534\n\nadvanced the idea of a new facility better adapted to a\nmethod of supervision in which staff members and\ninmates would have closer, more direct contact.\n  As a result of his efforts, a new, non-linear juvenile\ndetention facility was completed in April 1996. The new\nJDC contains common rooms, classrooms and recreation\nrooms where the juveniles spend the majority of their\ndaytime hours. At night, however, the juveniles are\nconfined to their living areas, which are assigned based\non their sex, age and classification.\n  The living areas at the new facility are organized into\nseven single-sex “pods.” Each can accommodate between\n11 and 22 juveniles of the same sex.1 Each pod consists of\na number of individual cells, a control center desk from\nwhich the staff can monitor the cells and communicate\nwith the pod via intercom, and a common area or “day\nroom” with tables, chairs and a television. The individual\ncells each contain a bed, a toilet, a desk and a small storage\narea. The entire cell, including the toilet, is visible from\nthe outside through a window in the cell door.\n  The juveniles are monitored at all times by JCOs. During\nthe first (morning) and second (evening) shifts, two JCOs\nare assigned to supervise each pod. During the third\n(night) shift, when the juveniles are locked inside their\ncells and generally are asleep, only one JCO is assigned to\nmonitor each pod. In addition to the JCOs assigned to\npods, the JDC also has a male and a female “runner” on\n\n\n1\n  One pod at the JDC was reserved for females. The other\nsix pods housed male juveniles.\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                    5\n\nduty at all times. The runner is a JCO who is responsible\nfor performing the intake procedures for newly-admitted\njuveniles, including any necessary pat-downs and super-\nvision of showering during the night hours.2 Another\nstaff member monitors the central control center at all\ntimes.\n  The advent of the new facility provided an opportunity\nfor Mr. Wanta to shift the JDC’s method of supervision\nfrom an indirect model to a direct model and to encourage\nJCOs to have greater interaction with the juveniles they\nmonitored. Accordingly, in 1997, Mr. Wanta instituted a\nnew role model/mentoring program at the JDC. The staff,\nincluding the JCOs, received basic training in mentoring,\nrole modeling and child development in order to equip\nthem to interact more effectively with the juveniles. In\nfurtherance of this program, Mr. Wanta also required that\na staff member of the same sex be available on each pod\nat all times throughout the day and night to mentor the\njuveniles.3\n  Prior to the move to the new facility, JCOs had been\nassigned to shifts without regard to the sex of the officer.\n\n\n2\n  Other than these newly-admitted juveniles, all regular\nshowering takes place on the second shift.\n3\n  Although the juveniles generally are confined to their cells at\nnight, cell occupants can, and occasionally do, talk with JCOs\nthrough their doors. Staff members are permitted to speak\nwith the juveniles through their doors at night; however, they\nare not permitted to enter the individual cells at night except\nin an emergency. If they do enter the cells at night, an alarm\nwill sound.\n\f6                                                  No. 07-2534\n\nMr. Wanta’s new policy, however, required that each pod\nbe staffed at all times by at least one JCO of the same sex\nas the juveniles housed on the pod. During the day shifts,\nwhen two JCOs staffed each pod, one of the two JCOs\ncould be of the opposite sex; however, during the night\nshifts, when only one JCO staffed each pod, the sole JCO\non duty had to be of the same sex as the juveniles in the\npod. Because the JDC housed far more male juveniles than\nfemale juveniles,4 Mr. Wanta’s same-sex role model/\nmentoring policy afforded male JCOs more opportunities\nfor work than those available to female JCOs. The night\nshift was particularly problematic. It was perceived as\nthe easiest shift; those officers assigned to it received\npremium pay; and it afforded the most opportunities\nfor overtime.\n  During the time of their employment as JCOs, Ms. Henry\nand Ms. Lewis primarily worked one of the day shifts.\nPrior to 1997, however, they each had earned a substantial\namount of additional income from voluntary overtime,\npredominantly by working the night shift. According to\na collective bargaining agreement, voluntary overtime at\nthe JDC traditionally had been apportioned according\nto seniority. Employees with the most seniority could\n“put in” for overtime, and they would receive the first\nopportunities to work their preferred shifts. Ms. Lewis\n\n\n\n4\n  The ratio of male detainees to female detainees at the JDC was\nbetween 4:1 and 6:1 during the relevant time period. Six of the\npods at the new JDC were reserved for males; one was\nreserved for females.\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                      7\n\nand Ms. Henry were relatively senior employees, and\nthey often were able to work overtime at the old JDC.\n  After Mr. Wanta instituted the same-sex pod policy,\nhowever, far fewer women were allowed to work the third\nshift because there were far fewer female pods than male\npods at the facility. As a result of the same-sex role\nmodel/mentoring program, most of the available night\nshifts with premium pay were reserved for male em-\nployees. Female officers like Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis no\nlonger were able to get the same number of overtime\nhours as they previously had received. Instead, male\nemployees with less seniority were allowed to work these\nshifts. Consequently, Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis received\nsignificantly less compensation than they had received\nprior to the institution of the same-sex role\nmodel/mentoring program.5\n\n\n                                B.\n  Prior to the institution of this policy, Ms. Henry and\nMs. Lewis each had filed an unrelated EEOC complaint\nalleging harassment and discrimination in the work-\nplace. In October of 1997, they filed additional grievances\nregarding the sex-specific requirements of the third shift.\n\n\n\n5\n  At the time of trial, despite the efforts of Mr. Wanta, the same-\nsex overtime policy was not being followed strictly at the JDC.\nOn the advice of counsel, the JDC began allowing females to\nwork in male pods during the third shift, so long as they kept\nthe doors between the pods open. Tr. at 659.\n\f8                                               No. 07-2534\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that they subsequently were treated\neven more negatively than they had been treated before\nthey filed these complaints.\n  Ms. Henry testified at trial that her Head of Shift, Bobby\nBell, became aggressive and threatening toward her after\nshe began objecting to the JDC’s sex-based shift assign-\nments and to other instances of alleged discrimination.\nShe also stated that she once was removed from the\nvoluntary overtime list for being tardy by just one\nminute and that she was criticized informally by man-\nagement for minor things such as eating a sandwich and\nwearing a sweater at work. She testified that other em-\nployees were not disciplined or criticized for such minor\ninfractions. She also noted that her timecard had been\nwritten on in red ink, which she found embarrassing, and\nthat occasionally her timecards had been missing alto-\ngether—an unusual occurrence.\n  Ms. Lewis testified that, after filing her EEOC charges,\nher doctor’s notes were no longer accepted without\nquestion for sick leave purposes. Both plaintiffs stated\nthat their managers called them very early in the mornings\non weekends and on vacation days when the managers\nknew that they would be unable to work. They also\nasserted that, despite repeated requests, they no longer\nwere assigned to work together or to work at the “easier”\nJCO positions which they preferred. Finally, they testified\nthat they were referred to as “troublemakers” and other\nderogatory terms by their managers and fellow JCOs.\n Ultimately, Ms. Lewis and Ms. Henry decided to take\npositions in different departments because of this alleged\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                 9\n\nharassment. Although their hourly pay rate was greater\nin these positions than their hourly rate had been while\nworking as JCOs, their total income was less because\nthey were unable to get overtime pay in these positions.\n\n\n                             C.\n  Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis brought this action in the\ndistrict court. They alleged that, in violation of Title VII,\nthey had been denied overtime assignments on the third\nshift at the JDC because of their sex. They also alleged\nthat they were subjected to a variety of other indignities\nin the workplace on account of their sex and that the\ndefendants had retaliated against them for filing com-\nplaints of discrimination.\n  Before the district court, the County denied that\nMs. Henry and Ms. Lewis had experienced any harass-\nment on account of their sex or in retaliation for their\nEEOC charges. The County admitted that it had assigned\npositions on the third shift based on the employees’ sex;\nhowever, it asserted as a defense that its sex-based classifi-\ncations were a bona fide occupational qualification\n(“BFOQ”) permissible under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e). It\nbased this defense largely on the testimony of the JDC’s\nsuperintendent, Mr. Wanta, who testified that, in\nhis professional judgment, a same-sex role model/\nmentoring program would best facilitate the rehabilitative\ngoals of the JDC.\n  After a three-day bench trial, the district court con-\ncluded that the same-sex staffing policy on the third shift\n\f10                                                No. 07-2534\n\nwas a BFOQ. It found that “[t]he essence of the JDC’s\nbusiness is to ensure and promote the care, rehabilitation,\nsafety and security of the juveniles entrusted to its care.”\nR.60 at 11. Based on Mr. Wanta’s testimony, it then con-\ncluded that “same gender role modeling furthers the\ntwin goals of rehabilitation and security in the juvenile\ndetention setting,” id. at 4, and that “[s]ame gender shift\nassignments serve to protect the privacy interests of the\njuvenile detainees,” id. at 5. Finally, relying on general\nstudies that heterosexual assaults are statistically more\nlikely than homosexual assaults, the court found that\n“[s]ame gender shift assignments also serve the goals of\nrisk management and security.” Id. In the district court’s\nview, the “alternative to protecting against this risk . . . is\nto hire an additional staff member for each pod on third\nshift at an approximate cost of $750,000 per year.” Id.\nAccordingly, it found that gender was a BFOQ for JCOs\nworking the third shift; therefore, the sex-based shift\nassignments did not violate the anti-discrimination provi-\nsions of Title VII.\n   Regarding the plaintiffs’ other claims, the district court\nfound that the allegedly harassing incidents did not\naffect the terms and conditions of their employment\nbecause they were “trivial inconveniences” that did “not\nrise to the level of an adverse employment action.” Id. at 7.\nIt also found that the alleged retaliatory actions were not\nmaterially adverse actions that would dissuade a rea-\nsonable employee from engaging in protected activity.\nId. at 8. Finally, the district court found that the plain-\ntiffs had failed to demonstrate any causal connection\nbetween their gender or their EEOC charges and the\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                11\n\nalleged harassment. Id. at 9-10. Accordingly, it denied\ntheir claims of discrimination and retaliation under Title\nVII.\n  The district court therefore entered judgment in favor\nof the defendants on May 31, 2007. Ms. Henry and\nMs. Lewis timely appealed.\n\n\n                              II\n                       DISCUSSION\n                             A.\n  We begin by setting forth the general principles that\nmust govern our decision. Title VII makes it unlawful\nfor an employer to “limit, segregate, or classify his em-\nployees” based on their sex in a way that would adversely\naffect their employment. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2). An\nexception exists, however, when sex is a bona fide oc-\ncupational qualification (“BFOQ”) that is “reasonably\nnecessary to the normal operation of that particular\nbusiness or enterprise.” Id. § 2000e-2(e); see also Int’l\nUnion, United Auto. Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers\nv. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 201 (1991); Torres v.\nWis. Dep’t of Health & Social Servs., 859 F.2d 1523, 1527\n(7th Cir. 1988) (en banc).\n  The Supreme Court has cautioned that the BFOQ\ndefense is written narrowly and is to be read narrowly.\nInt’l Union, 499 U.S. at 201. It has made clear that the\ndefense is “meant to be an extremely narrow exception to\nthe general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of\n\f12                                                  No. 07-2534\n\nsex.” Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 334 (1977). In\nDothard, the Court quoted approvingly the Fifth Circuit’s\nformulation in Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, 442\nF.2d 385, 388 (5th Cir. 1971), that “discrimination based\non sex is valid only when the essence of the business\noperation would be undermined.” Dothard, 433 U.S. at\n333; see also Torres, 859 F.2d at 1527.\n  Employers bear the burden of establishing the affirma-\ntive defense that a particular qualification is a BFOQ. See\nMeacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 128 S. Ct. 2395, 2400-\n01 (2008); Everson v. Mich. Dep’t of Corr., 391 F.3d 737, 748\n(6th Cir. 2004). Employers also bear the burden of proving\nthat they could not rearrange job responsibilities or\notherwise eliminate the clash between the business neces-\nsities and the employment opportunities of female\nofficers. Torres v. Wis. Dept. of Health & Social Servs., 838\nF.2d 944, 953 n.6 (7th Cir. 1988) (reheard and reversed on\nother grounds in Torres, 859 F.2d 1523).6\n\n\n                               B.\n  Before the district court, Milwaukee County relied on\na series of cases from this and other circuits that exa-\nmined whether sex could be a BFOQ for officers in adult\n\n\n\n6\n  See also Everson v. Mich. Dept. of Corr., 391 F.3d 737, 749 (6th\nCir. 2004); Reed v. County of Casey, 184 F.3d 597, 600 (6th Cir.\n1999); Chambers v. Omaha Girls Club, Inc., 834 F.2d 697, 704 (8th\nCir. 1987); Edwards v. Dep’t of Corr., 615 F. Supp. 804, 809 (M.D.\nAla. 1985).\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                13\n\nfemale correctional facilities. See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1532;\nEverson, 391 F.3d at 747-60; Robino v. Iranon, 145 F.3d 1109,\n1110-11 (9th Cir. 1998); Tharp v. Iowa Dep’t of Corr., 68 F.3d\n223, 226 (8th Cir. 1995). In each of these cases, the court\nheld that the goals of security, safety, privacy and rehabili-\ntation could, in some circumstances, justify sex-based\nassignments in female prisons. Milwaukee County\nsubmits that, like the sex-specific shift assignments in\nadult female correctional facilities, the sex-specific assign-\nments at issue here should be upheld because they are\nnecessary to protect the juveniles’ safety and privacy\nand to further the facility’s rehabilitative goals.\n  In Torres, we determined that the unique circum-\nstances of the female prison at issue required prison\nadministrators to “innovate and experiment.” 859 F.2d at\n1529. In the course of our decision, we noted that, because\nprison administrators in general face unusually difficult\nchallenges in dealing with the “perplexing sociological\nproblems of how best to achieve the goals of the penal\nfunction in the criminal justice system: to punish justly, to\ndeter future crime, and to return imprisoned persons to\nsociety with an improved chance of being useful,\nlaw-abiding citizens,” prison administrators’ decisions\nmust receive some degree of deference. Id. Accordingly,\nalthough the decisions of prison officials are not\naccorded as much deference in Title VII cases as they are\nin constitutional cases, their decisions “are entitled to\nsubstantial weight when they are the product of a reasoned\ndecision-making process, based on available information and\nexperience.” Id. at 1532 (emphasis added); see also Robino,\n\f14                                               No. 07-2534\n\n145 F.3d at 1110; Everson, 391 F.3d at 750. Milwaukee\nCounty contends that, like in Torres, the administrators\nof the JDC were entitled to substantial deference in their\ndecision to implement a sex-specific policy regarding\nshift assignments. In its view, the goals and circumstances\nof the juvenile detention context, when compared to the\nfemale corrections context, are equally complex and\nchallenging.\n  We agree that the administrators of juvenile detention\nfacilities, like the administrators of female correctional\nfacilities, are entitled to substantial deference when\nfashioning policies to further the goals of the facility. We\ndo not agree, however, that the discretion accorded to\nthese individuals in either context is effectively unlimited.\nA defendant ultimately must introduce sufficient evi-\ndence to prove that the administrator’s judgment—that\na particular sex classification is reasonably necessary to\nthe normal operation of the institution—is “the product of\na reasoned decision-making process, based on available\ninformation and experience.” See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1532.\n  The district court concluded that the JDC’s policy of\nassigning shifts according to an employee’s sex was based\non its administrator’s reasonable belief that the policy\nwould “promote” the goals of rehabilitation, security and\nprivacy. R.60 at 11. All of these functions are, as the dis-\ntrict court concluded, essential to the mission of the JDC.\nHowever, Title VII’s standard is not satisfied simply\nbecause a policy promotes an essential function of an\ninstitution. Although sex-based assignments might be\nhelpful in pursuing these goals, in order to satisfy the anti-\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                   15\n\ndiscrimination strictures of Title VII, Milwaukee County\nmust show that the contested sex classifications are\n“reasonably necessary.” See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1527 (emphasis\nin original); see also Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62,\n86 (2000) (noting that the “reasonably necessary” standard\nof the BFOQ defense is “a far cry from the rational\nbasis standard”).\n  We must conclude that Milwaukee County’s contention\nthat sex-based assignments are reasonably necessary to\nachieve these goals, at least on the third shift, is not\nsupported by the record before us. The employer, Mil-\nwaukee County, has the burden to demonstrate that it\ncould not rearrange job responsibilities to eliminate or\nminimize the conflict between the inmates’ privacy,\nsecurity and rehabilitation interests and the employees’\nrights under Title VII. See Torres, 838 F.2d at 952 n.6;\nChambers v. Omaha Girls Club, Inc., 834 F.2d 697, 704 (8th\nCir. 1987). Although reducing the number of opposite-sex\nstaff on the pods may help to promote security, efficient\nrisk management and privacy, Milwaukee County has\nfailed to establish that its policy was reasonably necessary\nfor these goals. We address each proffered justification\nin turn.\n  The evidence in the record does not support the conclu-\nsion that the juveniles’ safety or security, or the institu-\ntion’s ability to manage risk effectively, was at all in\njeopardy because of the presence of opposite-sex JCOs on\nthe third shift. The district court correctly asserted that\nheterosexual assaults and misconduct are statistically\nmore likely than homosexual attacks. The record estab-\n\f16                                               No. 07-2534\n\nlishes, however, that there has not been a single instance\nof staff-on-inmate sexual assault at the JDC, on any shift,\nby either sex; nor has there been a significant problem\nwith false accusations against the staff. Furthermore, other\nsafety precautions, such as door alarms and the presence\nof supervisors, runners and video cameras, currently are\nworking to prevent actual and alleged security breaches.\nAlthough Milwaukee County contends that a staff mem-\nber may be able to circumvent the alarm system in order\nto enter a juvenile’s cell at night, the record contains\nno evidence that this contingency has occurred or was\nlikely to occur at the JDC.\n  More fundamentally, Milwaukee County offered no\nreasons why the numerous alternatives to same-sex\nstaffing suggested by the plaintiffs at trial, such as improv-\ning the alarm system, installing additional cameras, leaving\nthe doors open between the pods at night or increasing\nthe frequency of supervisor patrols, would not have\nmitigated any concern. Notably, Mr. Wanta testified at\ntrial that he had not investigated the cost of any of these\noptions. He did assert that adding an additional staff\nmember on each of the pods during the third shift would\nhave been prohibitively costly; however, he did not\nprovide any data on this point, and such an augmentation\nin personnel certainly was not the only option available\nto minimize the already-minimal risk of staff-on-juvenile\nsexual assault. The BFOQ defense extends only to those\npolicies that are “reasonably necessary to the normal\noperation” of the institution, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e)(1). It\ndoes not excuse investigation of and reliance upon alterna-\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                     17\n\ntives that involve minor additional costs or inconve-\nniences.7\n   Milwaukee County’s proffered privacy justification is\neven more difficult to justify on the record before us. The\nrecord affirmatively shows that the JDC allowed JCOs of\nthe opposite sex to monitor the pods during both of the\ndaytime shifts. It is undisputed that the vast majority of\nthe time that the juveniles were unclothed occurred during\nthese daytime shifts. Showering generally took place\nduring the second shift, when members of the opposite\nsex were permitted to staff the pods. The only showering\nthat occurred on the third shift was monitored by one of\nthe runners who performed the intake procedures. The\njuveniles were provided with pajamas, which they were\nrequired to wear at night. They changed into this attire\non the second shift, and they changed out of it on the\nfirst shift—again, while JCOs of the opposite sex were\npermitted to view them. Although Milwaukee County\npresented testimony that third-shift JCOs occasionally\nviewed juveniles using the toilet, masturbating or other-\nwise acting out sexually, it is undisputed that this situa-\ntion occurred on the first and second shifts as well.\n  This situation is therefore very different from cases\nsuch as Torres, 859 F.2d at 1530, and Everson, 391 F.3d at\n753, which involved the presence of male guards in the\n\n\n\n7\n  See, e.g., Chambers, 834 F.2d at 701 (noting that “[t]he employer\nmust demonstrate that there is a compelling need to maintain\nthat practice, and the practice cannot be justified by routine\nbusiness considerations” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f18                                              No. 07-2534\n\nhousing units of all-female prisons. In Torres, we held that\nthe superintendent reasonably made a “professional\njudgment that giving women prisoners a living environ-\nment free from the presence of males in a position of\nauthority was necessary to foster the goal of rehabilita-\ntion.” 859 F.2d at 1530. In Everson, the court determined\nthat, “given the endemic problem of sexual abuse in\nMichigan’s female facilities” and other unique circum-\nstances, 391 F.3d at 761, the presence of male guards, at\nany time, in the housing units was a threat to “the\nsecurity of the prison, the safety of inmates and the pro-\ntection of the privacy rights of inmates,” id. at 753. In\nEverson and Torres, prison officials permitted no officers\nof the opposite sex to guard the living units at any time\nbecause the specific needs of the institutions and the\nprisoners housed in those institutions reasonably re-\nquired such a policy. The same-sex policy was aimed at a\nspecific condition and was tailored to address that\nspecific condition. The plans were quite clearly “the\nproduct of a reasoned decision-making process, based on\navailable information and experience.” Torres, 859 F.2d at\n1532. Here, by contrast, we are faced with the fact that the\nJDC allowed JCOs of the opposite sex to guard the juve-\nniles during those times when the privacy interests of the\njuveniles were most in jeopardy. Under these circum-\nstances, we cannot say that, with respect to privacy\nconcerns, the same-sex policy is the product of the same\nsort of comprehensive professional decision-making as\nexhibited in Torres and Everson. The inconsistencies in\nimplementation cast a significant doubt on whether the\npolicy is reasonably necessary to achieve the institution’s\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                      19\n\ngoal of protecting the privacy interests of the juveniles.\nTherefore, on this factor as well, the record reveals a\nfailure of proof on the part of Milwaukee County.\n   The County also contends that same-sex staffing on the\nthird shift is necessary to further the JDC’s mission of\nrehabilitation. Contrary to the submission of the plain-\ntiffs, we have no doubt that the County is correct in stating\nthat this goal is a very important goal of the institution.8\n\n\n8\n   Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis take issue with the district court’s\ndetermination that rehabilitation is part of the “essence of the\nbusiness” of the JDC. They note that neither the Wisconsin\nregulations nor the JDC’s own mission statement mentions the\nword “rehabilitation.” They also assert that the juveniles are in\nthe JDC for very brief periods of time, and, unlike in a penal\ninstitution, rehabilitation in a short-term detention facility is\na futile goal.\n   Based on its interpretation of the juvenile justice statute and\nthe JDC’s mission statement, as well as on testimony from Mr.\nWanta and others, the district court concluded that rehabilita-\ntion indeed was part of the essence of the JDC’s business.\nWisconsin’s juvenile justice code requires the juvenile justice\nsystem to take action directed at providing the best possible\ncare for the juveniles and at preventing future delinquent\nbehavior by developing their ability to lead productive and\nresponsible lives. Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(c), (f). Wisconsin courts\nalso have recognized the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile\njustice system. See In re Hezzie R., 580 N.W.2d 660, 668 & n.4\n(Wis. 1998). Mr. Wanta and other administrators testified that\nthe juveniles’ time at the JDC, generally a result of a crisis\nsituation, is often a valuable opportunity for intervention and\n                                                      (continued...)\n\f20                                                  No. 07-2534\n\n  The record contains substantial testimony from\nMr. Wanta on this factor. He described the basis for his\ndetermination that a role model/mentoring policy was\nnecessary to the JDC’s rehabilitative efforts. Tr. at 607-19,\n634-35, 658-60. He noted that, in formulating the policy, he\nhad relied upon his own experience with juvenile correc-\ntions, information learned from his attendance at various\nseminars and committee meetings, his interviews with\nthe juveniles and staff at the JDC, consultations with\nexperts in the field and professional literature supporting\nsuch programs.9 Each of these sources suggested that the\ndirect role modeling/mentoring form of supervision, rather\nthan the indirect form of supervision, was the best avail-\nable method of providing care and rehabilitation to\njuveniles in detention facilities. Mr. Wanta, in his profes-\nsional judgment, concluded that institution of the direct\nrole model/mentoring form of supervision was necessary\nto achieve the JDC’s mission of rehabilitation. The founda-\ntion for his belief is well established in the record.\n The conclusion that the effectiveness of these role\nmodel/mentoring programs requires the presence of at\n\n\n\n8\n  (...continued)\nrehabilitation. Tr. at 623-24. This evidence supports the district\ncourt’s finding that rehabilitation is part of the “essence” of\nthe JDC.\n9\n  See, e.g., Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention\n(“OJJDP”), Delinquency Prevention: Desktop Guide to Good Juvenile\nDetention Practice (Roush ed., 1996), R.48, Ex. 1013 (praising\nthe virtues of direct supervision over indirect supervision).\n\fNo. 07-2534                                               21\n\nleast one staff member of the same sex as the juveniles in\neach pod at all times, however, does not find the same\nstrong foundation in the record. Mr. Wanta expressed\nhis belief that same-sex role model/mentoring was more\neffective than cross-gender programs. He testified that, in\nformulating this view, he relied upon his own personal\nexperiences, as well as literature on mentoring programs,\nwhich “indicate that gender mentoring improves the\nchances of child behavior changes being positive.” Tr. at\n635. He continued: “[A]ll the statistics and the research\nthat I have seen indicates that a male mentoring a male,\nand a female mentoring a female, exponentially increases\nthe chance of success than would cross-gender . . .\nmentoring.” Id.\n  In support of his belief, Mr. Wanta referenced a\nreport from the Office of Juvenile Justice and\nDelinquency Prevention (“OJJDP”), Juvenile Mentoring\nPrograms: A Progress Review (Sept. 2000), R.48, Ex. 1022.\nAlthough this publication was not available at the time\nof his decision, he suggested that it supported his view\nthat same-sex role modeling was necessary for rehabilita-\ntion. This report, however, is specific to one-on-one mentor\nmatching programs for at-risk youth. Moreover, its find-\nings regarding the effect of sex-specific assignments, even\nin this circumstance, are inconclusive at best. See id. at 5.\nMr. Wanta did not explain how anecdotal evidence from\nthese after-school mentoring programs is relevant to the\nvastly different juvenile detention setting. More impor-\ntantly, it does not speak to the issue of whether, to achieve\nsuccess in mentoring, same-sex supervision on the third\nshift, when the juveniles are isolated and likely asleep\n\f22                                                     No. 07-2534\n\nin their cells, is reasonably necessary. The other publica-\ntions admitted into evidence by the County appear to\nadd little to this precise question.1 0\n  We are well aware that the professionals who have\nthe great responsibility for running penal institutions\nneed to innovate and experiment if they are to succeed\nin resolving the crisis in this important area of gover-\nnance. Indeed, we already have recognized that the\ninability to proffer solid empirical evidence in support of\na particular policy certainly is not fatal to a BFOQ defense.\nSee Torres, 859 F.2d at 1532. Even if we defer to Mr. Wanta’s\njudgment that a mentoring program is important to the\nsuccess of juvenile institutions such as the one he\nmanages, and even if we defer to his judgment with\nrespect to the need for same-sex mentoring of juveniles\nin such an environment, we still must be satisfied in the\npresent litigation that these professional judgments\nrequire a rigid rule that such a same-sex mentoring pro-\ngram reasonably necessitates the presence of a JCO of the\n\n\n10\n  See OJJDP, Psychiatric Disorders of Youth in Detention (April\n2006), R.48, Ex. 1017 (discussing the prevalence of juveniles with\nmental disorders in juvenile detention facilities); U.S. Dep’t of\nJustice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Prison Rape Elimination Act of\n2003: Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities 2004 (July\n2005), R.48, Ex. 1015 (discussing nationwide statistics on sexual\nassault in correctional facilities); OJJDP, Juvenile Mentoring\nPrograms: 1998 Report to Congress (Dec. 1998), R.48, Ex. 1023\n(discussing mentor matching programs outside the detention\ncontext, and noting that most programs use gender as a match-\ning criteria).\n\fNo. 07-2534                                               23\n\nsame sex at all times. Milwaukee County had the responsi-\nbility to introduce sufficient evidence in the record to\nsupport the conclusion that such same-sex presence at\nall times was reasonably necessary to meet the institu-\ntion’s essential goals. Here, the record, although perhaps\ndemonstrating the worth of a mentoring program and\nthe usefulness of mentors of the same sex, does not\npresent a sufficiently strong case with respect to the need\nfor the presence of those mentors seven days a week and\ntwenty-four hours a day.\n  At trial, Mr. Wanta explained how the JCOs were to\nact as role models and mentors at the JDC:\n   On a practical sense, I just wanted a staff member to be\n   a good, positive person. To display positive attitude.\n   To display respect towards the juvenile. Respect\n   towards your peers. Respect toward any individual\n   that came across their area. To model how to interact.\n   Whether interacting with that juvenile, so the other\n   juveniles who observe can see that interaction going\n   on and the positive outcomes to that type of interac-\n   tion. Interaction with your peers in a positive way. . . .\n   [T]he biggest focus was . . . for staff to demonstrate\n   proper behavior.\nTr. at 609. JCOs were not trained or expected to act as\ncounselors; if any serious counseling was necessary, the\nJCOs were instructed to refer the juvenile to an on-site\nnurse trained in mental health. Instead, the JCOs carried\nout their role model/mentoring responsibilities by pro-\nviding the juveniles with a constant model of proper\nbehavior in their interactions with others.\n\f24                                              No. 07-2534\n\n   Given this description of the role of JCOs in the\nmentoring program, we must conclude that the record does\nnot respond to the question of why a JCO of the same\nsex is reasonably necessary during the night shift. Ac-\ncording to the record, the opportunity for the JCO to\ninteract with the juveniles on the third shift is very mini-\nmal. The third shift begins after the juveniles are locked\ndown for the night, and the JCOs on third shift were\ninstructed to encourage them to sleep. Although there\nwas testimony at trial that staff occasionally spoke with\njuveniles through their doors at night, particularly when\nthey were ill or acting out and it was necessary to calm\nthem down, this interaction was kept to a minimum. There\nis no evidence that the JCOs ever spoke with the juveniles\nabout confidential counseling matters at night. Indeed,\nbecause the other juveniles in the pod would have been\nable to hear any conversations that occurred, the JCOs\ntestified at trial that they were encouraged to avoid these\ntypes of discussions on the third shift.\n  The County provided no reasons why opposite-sex\nJCOs were incapable of appropriately interacting with\nthese juveniles to the extent necessary to provide a good\nbehavioral role model on the third shift. Mr. Wanta’s\nassertion that “consistency” in the same-sex mentoring\nprogram requires the presence of someone of the same\nsex within each pod at all times is simply not justified by\nthe record. Furthermore, the County failed to provide\nevidence that the many non-discriminatory alternatives\nproffered by the plaintiffs would have been intolerable\nhere. The plaintiffs questioned Mr. Wanta about nu-\nmerous other possibilities for encouraging rehabilitation\n\fNo. 07-2534                                               25\n\nthrough the availability of same-sex staff, such as hiring\nmore JCOs for the third shift, leaving the doors between\npods open or increasing the frequency of supervisor\nrotations. They also noted that numerous other mecha-\nnisms to encourage rehabilitation already were in place\nat the facility, including educational programs, counselors,\nguest speakers, community mentors and other programs\navailable to facilitate the JDC’s mission. The County\nfailed to explain why the presence of a same-sex JCO\nwithin each pod during the hours that the juveniles were\nsleeping was reasonably necessary to its rehabilitative\nefforts.\n  Accordingly, we must conclude that the County failed\nto meet its burden to prove that the sex-based classifica-\ntion at issue here was reasonably necessary for the re-\nhabilitation, security or privacy functions of the JDC.\nTherefore, Milwaukee’s BFOQ defense must fail. The JDC’s\nthird shift policy adversely affected the plaintiffs’ employ-\nment. It is undisputed that overtime pay had been a\nsignificant and expected component of the plaintiffs’\ncompensation prior to the institution of the sex-based\npolicy. Not only did the majority of overtime work avail-\nable occur on the third shift, but the third shift also\noffered a fifty cent per hour pay premium. Accordingly,\nthe dramatic reduction in the opportunity for women to\nwork on the third shift constituted an adverse employ-\nment action. See Lewis v. City of Chicago, 496 F.3d 645, 653-\n54 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that the denial of the opportu-\nnity for overtime pay, when that pay is a significant and\nrecurring part of an employee’s total earnings, can consti-\ntute an adverse employment action). Because the JDC’s\n\f26                                                 No. 07-2534\n\nthird-shift policy adversely affected the plaintiffs’ em-\nployment opportunities, we must conclude that it is in\nviolation of Title VII.\n\n\n                              C.\n  Finally, we turn to the plaintiffs’ workplace harassment\nand retaliation claims. Both plaintiffs testified regarding\na number of incidents that occurred, both before and\nafter they had filed their EEOC charges, which they\nbelieved were forms of harassment and retaliation. The\ndistrict court, however, held a bench trial and determined\nthat these incidents were merely trivial inconveniences\nand isolated acts that did not rise to the level of harass-\nment necessary to establish a claim under either the\ndiscrimination or retaliation provisions of Title VII. The\ncourt also found that the plaintiffs did not present any\nevidence of a causal connection between their sex or their\ncomplaints and the alleged harassment. We review these\nfindings of fact for clear error. Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); Cerros,\n288 F.3d at 1044.\n  Title VII prohibits sex discrimination in the terms and\nconditions of employment. Jackson v. County of Racine,\n474 F.3d 493, 499 (7th Cir. 2007). In order to establish a\nTitle VII claim based on workplace harassment, then, the\nplaintiffs must prove that a reasonable person would\nfind the alleged harassment to be so severe or pervasive\nas to create a hostile work environment, thus affecting the\nterms and conditions of employment. Id.; Kriescher v. Fox\nHills Golf Resort & Conf. Ctr. FHR, Inc., 384 F.3d 912, 915\n(7th Cir. 2004). Furthermore, they must show that there\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                  27\n\nis a “link between this treatment and [their] sex.” Jackson,\n474 F.3d at 499.\n   The analysis regarding the plaintiffs’ retaliation claims\nis similar. Title VII prohibits employers from discrim-\ninating against employees who report or oppose practices\nmade unlawful under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). The\nrange of conduct prohibited under the anti-retaliation\nprovision is broader than its anti-discrimination provision,\nhowever, because “the discriminatory acts proscribed by\nTitle VII’s anti-retaliation provision are not limited to\nthose that affect the terms and conditions of one’s em-\nployment.” Lewis, 496 F.3d at 655 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Nevertheless, in order to\nestablish a claim for retaliation under Title VII, the plain-\ntiffs must prove that the alleged employment actions were\nmaterially adverse such that they would dissuade a\nreasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Id.\nAdditionally, they must show a causal link between these\nalleged adverse actions and their protected activity. Basith\nv. Cook County, 241 F.3d 919, 933 (7th Cir. 2001).\n  After a review of the record, we conclude that the\ndistrict court did not err in its determination that the\nalleged incidents did not rise to the level of harassment or\nretaliation. The Supreme Court has emphasized the\nnecessity of separating “significant from trivial harms.”\nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 68\n(2006). It further cautioned that “[a]n employee’s decision\nto report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that\nemployee from those petty slights or minor annoyances\nthat often take place at work.” Id. Title VII’s anti-retaliation\n\f28                                              No. 07-2534\n\nprovision prohibits only those employer actions that are\nlikely to deter victims of discrimination from invoking the\nAct’s remedial mechanisms. Id. We agree with the district\ncourt that the alleged incidents, such as being told not\nto wear sweaters or eat in front of the juveniles, unspeci-\nfied “intimidation” and door slamming by the head of\nshift, missing or marked up time-cards, occasional early\nmorning phone calls, and not being assigned to work\ntogether on the same shift or in easier pods are the type\nof petty slights and minor annoyances that generally will\nnot create such deterrence. Additionally, because these\nincidents do not rise to the level of an adverse action\nunder the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII, they\ncertainly do not constitute workplace harassment suf-\nficient to establish a discrimination claim. See id. at 67.\n  Furthermore, the district court did not err when it\nconcluded that the plaintiffs had failed to prove a causal\nlink between their discrimination complaints and the\nalleged harassment. The plaintiffs did not even attempt to\nshow that any of the alleged harassment was tied to their\nsex. As for retaliation, the plaintiffs point only to “suspi-\ncious timing” and an allegation that they were referred to\nas “troublemakers” to suggest that the incidents of which\nthey complain were a result of retaliation for their pro-\ntected activity. The district court here found that the\ntiming of the incidents in question was not suspicious;\nthe difficulties the plaintiffs had been having with their\nmanagers had been ongoing well before they engaged in\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                     29\n\nany protected activity.1 1 The district court further found\nthat the managers’ alleged use of the term “troublemakers”\nwas not in reference to any of the plaintiff’s protected\nactivities. R.60 at 10. Instead, it found that the plaintiffs\nin fact had been difficult employees, constantly lodging\ntrivial grievances and generally complaining whenever\nsuperiors tried to correct their behavior; the term “trouble-\nmaker” had been used in reference to the plaintiffs’ general\nbehavior, not their EEOC complaints. Id. We cannot say\nthat this finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                          Conclusion\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is af-\nfirmed in part and reversed in part. The case is remanded\nto the district court for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. The parties shall bear their own costs in this\nappeal.\n                                           A FFIRMED in part;\n                            R EVERSED and R EMANDED in part\n\n\n\n\n11\n   Furthermore, suspicious timing alone is not enough to\nestablish causation. See, e.g., Sauzek v. Exxon Coal USA, Inc., 202\nF.3d 913, 918 (7th Cir. 2000) (“Speculation based on suspicious\ntiming alone, however, does not support a reasonable inference\nof retaliation; instead, plaintiffs must produce facts which\nsomehow tie the adverse decision to the plaintiffs’ protected\nactions.”); Culver v. Gorman & Co., 416 F.3d 540, 546 (7th Cir.\n2005) (noting that timing “will rarely be sufficient in and of\nitself to create a triable issue”).\n\f30                                                  No. 07-2534\n\n  E ASTERBROOK, Chief Judge, concurring. The court’s opin-\nion applies Torres v. Wisconsin Department of Health &\nSocial Services, 859 F.2d 1523 (7th Cir. 1988) (en banc).\nI dissented from that decision, because I thought that\nthe majority’s approach could allow an employer to\nestablish a bona fide occupational qualification on the\nbasis of wishful thinking rather than proof. 859 F.2d at\n1535–38. After Torres the Supreme Court emphasized that\nthe BFOQ defense requires an employer to prove that\n“objective, verifiable requirements [that only one sex can\nfulfil] . . . concern job-related skills and aptitudes.” Automo-\nbile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 201 (1991).\nSee also Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977). Cf.\nJohnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144 (7th Cir. 1995). But we need\nnot decide whether Torres requires a fresh look, because\nthe court’s opinion (which I join) shows that the em-\nployer’s justifications flunk the Torres standard.\n  Milwaukee County decided that at least one guard of\nthe same sex as the prisoners is necessary not only for\nthe prison as a whole (to perform body-cavity searches,\nfor example), but also for each pod in the prison. A pod\nin Milwaukee’s Juvenile Detention Center may contain as\nfew as 11 inmates, and because women occupy only one\npod the County’s policy reduced women’s opportunities\nfor employment as guards. The County expresses concern\nabout sexual assaults but admits that no guard has ever\nsexually assaulted any prisoner in its care—and data from\nprisons elsewhere do not show that female guards are\nlikely to assault male prisoners sexually. That left the\nCounty with stereotypes, such as the proposition that\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                 31\n\nguards of the same sex serve as mentors or role models\nfor the prisoners.\n   I call this a stereotype because it is based on folk wisdom.\nIt could, in principle, be based on facts, such as proof that\nrecidivism rates fall (or legitimate income after release\nrises) when a prison has more guards of the inmates’ sex.\nBut the County conceded that it lacked such data when\nit adopted this policy, and neither expert witnesses nor\nany published studies supplied an empirical foundation\nfor the policy at trial.\n  Employers frequently assert that inmates (or students)\nrespond more favorably to guards (or teachers) of their\nown sex or race. If this sort of justification had been\nadvanced for matching the race of the inmates and the\nguards (or students and their teachers), courts would not\ngo along. See Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S.\n267 (1986). Cf. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996).\n(Whether short boot-camp programs are exceptional for\nthis purpose, see Wittmer v. Peters, 87 F.3d 916 (7th Cir.\n1996), is not important to a case that involves the long-\nterm operation of regular prisons.) Why then should\ncourts accept the same sort of “justification” for sex\ndiscrimination?\n  The majority in Torres concluded that Title VII should\nnot be used to block experiments that might lead to the\nsort of data that would establish a BFOQ. Twenty years\nhave passed since Torres, and Wisconsin’s prisons (like\nthose in other states) have had ample opportunity to try\ndifferent policies. Other states (and other prisons in\nWisconsin) allow people to guard the opposite sex both\n\f32                                             No. 07-2534\n\nday and night; data should not be hard to come by. But\ninstead of producing data, the defendants in this case\nreiterated sexual stereotypes. A court that permits a state\n(or for that matter a federal agency) to make decisions\ninfluenced by intuitions about what the data ultimately\nwill show must insist that the state (or agency) find out\nwhether those intuitions are sound or simply supersti-\ntions. See Bechtel v. FCC, 10 F.3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\nWisconsin has not made anything of the 20 years’ breath-\ning space provided by Torres, and the time has passed\nwhen cheap talk and unverifiable assertions of “profes-\nsional experience” may substitute for the kind of evidence\nthat Johnson Controls and Dothard contemplate.\n\n\n\n\n                          8-20-08\n\f",

In 1997, Milwaukee County’s\nJuvenile Detention Center instituted a policy that re-\nquired each unit of the facility to be staffed at all times by\nat least one officer of the same sex as the detainees\nhoused on that unit. Because there were far more male\nunits than female units at the facility, this policy had the\neffect of reducing the number of shifts available for female\n\f2                                                   No. 07-2534\n\nofficers. Ersol Henry and Terri Lewis, both female officers\nat the facility, brought this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, alleg-\ning sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title\nVII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. After a bench trial, the district\ncourt concluded that the gender-specific policy was based\non a bona fide occupational qualification and that no\nother discrimination or retaliation had occurred; accord-\ningly, it entered judgment in favor of the County. For the\nreasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the judg-\nment of the district court.\n\n\n                                I\n                      BACKGROUND\n                               A.\n  At the time relevant to this appeal, Ersol Henry and Terri\nLewis were employed as Juvenile Corrections Officers\n(“JCOs”) at the Milwaukee County Juvenile Detention\nCenter (“JDC”). The JDC, part of the Wisconsin State\nJuvenile Justice System, is a detention facility designed to\nhouse temporarily juveniles awaiting juvenile court\nproceedings.\n  The statutory mission of the Wisconsin juvenile justice\nsystem includes, inter alia, punishment, deterrence, and\n“the development of competency in the juvenile offender,\nso that he or she is more capable of living productively and\nresponsibly in the community.” Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(c).\nThe mission statement of the JDC, in particular, states\nthat the facility is intended:\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                  3\n\n    1. To serve the community by providing care for\n    young people who, because they represent a danger to\n    themselves or others, could not remain safely in the\n    community pending the outcome of a Juvenile Court\n    proceeding.\n    2. To serve the Juvenile Courts by maintaining close\n    supervision and observation of youngsters and en-\n    suring their appearance in court.\n    3. To serve the detained youth by providing the\n    best possible care in an atmosphere of fairness and\n    dignity so that their encounter with the Juvenile\n    Justice System can be a positive one.\nTr. Ex. 1021.\n  Most juveniles at the JDC are detained there for only a\nshort period of time. The average length of stay is ten\ndays, although for those juveniles awaiting their initial\ncourt appearances, the average stay is approximately\nthree weeks. Juveniles often are detained for as little as one\nday. Occasionally, a juvenile may be detained there for\nas long as one year.\n  In 1991, Thomas Wanta was appointed superintendent\nof the JDC. The facility that Mr. Wanta inherited in\n1991 was a poorly-maintained, over-crowded detention\nfacility built for indirect (also known as linear) supervision.\nThe juveniles were housed in cells on a long hallway, and\nJCOs walked the halls monitoring the inmates from the\noutside without much interaction. Mr. Wanta believed\nthat this indirect form of supervision was a poor way\nto care for and to rehabilitate juveniles; accordingly, he\n\f4                                                No. 07-2534\n\nadvanced the idea of a new facility better adapted to a\nmethod of supervision in which staff members and\ninmates would have closer, more direct contact.\n  As a result of his efforts, a new, non-linear juvenile\ndetention facility was completed in April 1996. The new\nJDC contains common rooms, classrooms and recreation\nrooms where the juveniles spend the majority of their\ndaytime hours. At night, however, the juveniles are\nconfined to their living areas, which are assigned based\non their sex, age and classification.\n  The living areas at the new facility are organized into\nseven single-sex “pods.” Each can accommodate between\n11 and 22 juveniles of the same sex.1 Each pod consists of\na number of individual cells, a control center desk from\nwhich the staff can monitor the cells and communicate\nwith the pod via intercom, and a common area or “day\nroom” with tables, chairs and a television. The individual\ncells each contain a bed, a toilet, a desk and a small storage\narea. The entire cell, including the toilet, is visible from\nthe outside through a window in the cell door.\n  The juveniles are monitored at all times by JCOs. During\nthe first (morning) and second (evening) shifts, two JCOs\nare assigned to supervise each pod. During the third\n(night) shift, when the juveniles are locked inside their\ncells and generally are asleep, only one JCO is assigned to\nmonitor each pod. In addition to the JCOs assigned to\npods, the JDC also has a male and a female “runner” on\n\n\n1\n  One pod at the JDC was reserved for females. The other\nsix pods housed male juveniles.\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                    5\n\nduty at all times. The runner is a JCO who is responsible\nfor performing the intake procedures for newly-admitted\njuveniles, including any necessary pat-downs and super-\nvision of showering during the night hours.2 Another\nstaff member monitors the central control center at all\ntimes.\n  The advent of the new facility provided an opportunity\nfor Mr. Wanta to shift the JDC’s method of supervision\nfrom an indirect model to a direct model and to encourage\nJCOs to have greater interaction with the juveniles they\nmonitored. Accordingly, in 1997, Mr. Wanta instituted a\nnew role model/mentoring program at the JDC. The staff,\nincluding the JCOs, received basic training in mentoring,\nrole modeling and child development in order to equip\nthem to interact more effectively with the juveniles. In\nfurtherance of this program, Mr. Wanta also required that\na staff member of the same sex be available on each pod\nat all times throughout the day and night to mentor the\njuveniles.3\n  Prior to the move to the new facility, JCOs had been\nassigned to shifts without regard to the sex of the officer.\n\n\n2\n  Other than these newly-admitted juveniles, all regular\nshowering takes place on the second shift.\n3\n  Although the juveniles generally are confined to their cells at\nnight, cell occupants can, and occasionally do, talk with JCOs\nthrough their doors. Staff members are permitted to speak\nwith the juveniles through their doors at night; however, they\nare not permitted to enter the individual cells at night except\nin an emergency. If they do enter the cells at night, an alarm\nwill sound.\n\f6                                                  No. 07-2534\n\nMr. Wanta’s new policy, however, required that each pod\nbe staffed at all times by at least one JCO of the same sex\nas the juveniles housed on the pod. During the day shifts,\nwhen two JCOs staffed each pod, one of the two JCOs\ncould be of the opposite sex; however, during the night\nshifts, when only one JCO staffed each pod, the sole JCO\non duty had to be of the same sex as the juveniles in the\npod. Because the JDC housed far more male juveniles than\nfemale juveniles,4 Mr. Wanta’s same-sex role model/\nmentoring policy afforded male JCOs more opportunities\nfor work than those available to female JCOs. The night\nshift was particularly problematic. It was perceived as\nthe easiest shift; those officers assigned to it received\npremium pay; and it afforded the most opportunities\nfor overtime.\n  During the time of their employment as JCOs, Ms. Henry\nand Ms. Lewis primarily worked one of the day shifts.\nPrior to 1997, however, they each had earned a substantial\namount of additional income from voluntary overtime,\npredominantly by working the night shift. According to\na collective bargaining agreement, voluntary overtime at\nthe JDC traditionally had been apportioned according\nto seniority. Employees with the most seniority could\n“put in” for overtime, and they would receive the first\nopportunities to work their preferred shifts. Ms. Lewis\n\n\n\n4\n  The ratio of male detainees to female detainees at the JDC was\nbetween 4:1 and 6:1 during the relevant time period. Six of the\npods at the new JDC were reserved for males; one was\nreserved for females.\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                      7\n\nand Ms. Henry were relatively senior employees, and\nthey often were able to work overtime at the old JDC.\n  After Mr. Wanta instituted the same-sex pod policy,\nhowever, far fewer women were allowed to work the third\nshift because there were far fewer female pods than male\npods at the facility. As a result of the same-sex role\nmodel/mentoring program, most of the available night\nshifts with premium pay were reserved for male em-\nployees. Female officers like Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis no\nlonger were able to get the same number of overtime\nhours as they previously had received. Instead, male\nemployees with less seniority were allowed to work these\nshifts. Consequently, Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis received\nsignificantly less compensation than they had received\nprior to the institution of the same-sex role\nmodel/mentoring program.5\n\n\n                                B.\n  Prior to the institution of this policy, Ms. Henry and\nMs. Lewis each had filed an unrelated EEOC complaint\nalleging harassment and discrimination in the work-\nplace. In October of 1997, they filed additional grievances\nregarding the sex-specific requirements of the third shift.\n\n\n\n5\n  At the time of trial, despite the efforts of Mr. Wanta, the same-\nsex overtime policy was not being followed strictly at the JDC.\nOn the advice of counsel, the JDC began allowing females to\nwork in male pods during the third shift, so long as they kept\nthe doors between the pods open. Tr. at 659.\n\f8                                               No. 07-2534\n\nThe plaintiffs allege that they subsequently were treated\neven more negatively than they had been treated before\nthey filed these complaints.\n  Ms. Henry testified at trial that her Head of Shift, Bobby\nBell, became aggressive and threatening toward her after\nshe began objecting to the JDC’s sex-based shift assign-\nments and to other instances of alleged discrimination.\nShe also stated that she once was removed from the\nvoluntary overtime list for being tardy by just one\nminute and that she was criticized informally by man-\nagement for minor things such as eating a sandwich and\nwearing a sweater at work. She testified that other em-\nployees were not disciplined or criticized for such minor\ninfractions. She also noted that her timecard had been\nwritten on in red ink, which she found embarrassing, and\nthat occasionally her timecards had been missing alto-\ngether—an unusual occurrence.\n  Ms. Lewis testified that, after filing her EEOC charges,\nher doctor’s notes were no longer accepted without\nquestion for sick leave purposes. Both plaintiffs stated\nthat their managers called them very early in the mornings\non weekends and on vacation days when the managers\nknew that they would be unable to work. They also\nasserted that, despite repeated requests, they no longer\nwere assigned to work together or to work at the “easier”\nJCO positions which they preferred. Finally, they testified\nthat they were referred to as “troublemakers” and other\nderogatory terms by their managers and fellow JCOs.\n Ultimately, Ms. Lewis and Ms. Henry decided to take\npositions in different departments because of this alleged\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                 9\n\nharassment. Although their hourly pay rate was greater\nin these positions than their hourly rate had been while\nworking as JCOs, their total income was less because\nthey were unable to get overtime pay in these positions.\n\n\n                             C.\n  Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis brought this action in the\ndistrict court. They alleged that, in violation of Title VII,\nthey had been denied overtime assignments on the third\nshift at the JDC because of their sex. They also alleged\nthat they were subjected to a variety of other indignities\nin the workplace on account of their sex and that the\ndefendants had retaliated against them for filing com-\nplaints of discrimination.\n  Before the district court, the County denied that\nMs. Henry and Ms. Lewis had experienced any harass-\nment on account of their sex or in retaliation for their\nEEOC charges. The County admitted that it had assigned\npositions on the third shift based on the employees’ sex;\nhowever, it asserted as a defense that its sex-based classifi-\ncations were a bona fide occupational qualification\n(“BFOQ”) permissible under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e). It\nbased this defense largely on the testimony of the JDC’s\nsuperintendent, Mr. Wanta, who testified that, in\nhis professional judgment, a same-sex role model/\nmentoring program would best facilitate the rehabilitative\ngoals of the JDC.\n  After a three-day bench trial, the district court con-\ncluded that the same-sex staffing policy on the third shift\n\f10                                                No. 07-2534\n\nwas a BFOQ. It found that “[t]he essence of the JDC’s\nbusiness is to ensure and promote the care, rehabilitation,\nsafety and security of the juveniles entrusted to its care.”\nR.60 at 11. Based on Mr. Wanta’s testimony, it then con-\ncluded that “same gender role modeling furthers the\ntwin goals of rehabilitation and security in the juvenile\ndetention setting,” id. at 4, and that “[s]ame gender shift\nassignments serve to protect the privacy interests of the\njuvenile detainees,” id. at 5. Finally, relying on general\nstudies that heterosexual assaults are statistically more\nlikely than homosexual assaults, the court found that\n“[s]ame gender shift assignments also serve the goals of\nrisk management and security.” Id. In the district court’s\nview, the “alternative to protecting against this risk . . . is\nto hire an additional staff member for each pod on third\nshift at an approximate cost of $750,000 per year.” Id.\nAccordingly, it found that gender was a BFOQ for JCOs\nworking the third shift; therefore, the sex-based shift\nassignments did not violate the anti-discrimination provi-\nsions of Title VII.\n   Regarding the plaintiffs’ other claims, the district court\nfound that the allegedly harassing incidents did not\naffect the terms and conditions of their employment\nbecause they were “trivial inconveniences” that did “not\nrise to the level of an adverse employment action.” Id. at 7.\nIt also found that the alleged retaliatory actions were not\nmaterially adverse actions that would dissuade a rea-\nsonable employee from engaging in protected activity.\nId. at 8. Finally, the district court found that the plain-\ntiffs had failed to demonstrate any causal connection\nbetween their gender or their EEOC charges and the\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                11\n\nalleged harassment. Id. at 9-10. Accordingly, it denied\ntheir claims of discrimination and retaliation under Title\nVII.\n  The district court therefore entered judgment in favor\nof the defendants on May 31, 2007. Ms. Henry and\nMs. Lewis timely appealed.\n\n\n                              II\n                       DISCUSSION\n                             A.\n  We begin by setting forth the general principles that\nmust govern our decision. Title VII makes it unlawful\nfor an employer to “limit, segregate, or classify his em-\nployees” based on their sex in a way that would adversely\naffect their employment. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2). An\nexception exists, however, when sex is a bona fide oc-\ncupational qualification (“BFOQ”) that is “reasonably\nnecessary to the normal operation of that particular\nbusiness or enterprise.” Id. § 2000e-2(e); see also Int’l\nUnion, United Auto.

In each of these cases, the court\nheld that the goals of security, safety, privacy and rehabili-\ntation could, in some circumstances, justify sex-based\nassignments in female prisons. Milwaukee County\nsubmits that, like the sex-specific shift assignments in\nadult female correctional facilities, the sex-specific assign-\nments at issue here should be upheld because they are\nnecessary to protect the juveniles’ safety and privacy\nand to further the facility’s rehabilitative goals.\n  In Torres, we determined that the unique circum-\nstances of the female prison at issue required prison\nadministrators to “innovate and experiment.” 859 F.2d at\n1529. In the course of our decision, we noted that, because\nprison administrators in general face unusually difficult\nchallenges in dealing with the “perplexing sociological\nproblems of how best to achieve the goals of the penal\nfunction in the criminal justice system: to punish justly, to\ndeter future crime, and to return imprisoned persons to\nsociety with an improved chance of being useful,\nlaw-abiding citizens,” prison administrators’ decisions\nmust receive some degree of deference. Id. Accordingly,\nalthough the decisions of prison officials are not\naccorded as much deference in Title VII cases as they are\nin constitutional cases, their decisions “are entitled to\nsubstantial weight when they are the product of a reasoned\ndecision-making process, based on available information and\nexperience.” Id. at 1532 (emphasis added); see also Robino,\n\f14                                               No. 07-2534\n\n145 F.3d at 1110; Everson, 391 F.3d at 750. Milwaukee\nCounty contends that, like in Torres, the administrators\nof the JDC were entitled to substantial deference in their\ndecision to implement a sex-specific policy regarding\nshift assignments. In its view, the goals and circumstances\nof the juvenile detention context, when compared to the\nfemale corrections context, are equally complex and\nchallenging.\n  We agree that the administrators of juvenile detention\nfacilities, like the administrators of female correctional\nfacilities, are entitled to substantial deference when\nfashioning policies to further the goals of the facility. We\ndo not agree, however, that the discretion accorded to\nthese individuals in either context is effectively unlimited.\nA defendant ultimately must introduce sufficient evi-\ndence to prove that the administrator’s judgment—that\na particular sex classification is reasonably necessary to\nthe normal operation of the institution—is “the product of\na reasoned decision-making process, based on available\ninformation and experience.” See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1532.\n  The district court concluded that the JDC’s policy of\nassigning shifts according to an employee’s sex was based\non its administrator’s reasonable belief that the policy\nwould “promote” the goals of rehabilitation, security and\nprivacy. R.60 at 11. All of these functions are, as the dis-\ntrict court concluded, essential to the mission of the JDC.\nHowever, Title VII’s standard is not satisfied simply\nbecause a policy promotes an essential function of an\ninstitution. Although sex-based assignments might be\nhelpful in pursuing these goals, in order to satisfy the anti-\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                   15\n\ndiscrimination strictures of Title VII, Milwaukee County\nmust show that the contested sex classifications are\n“reasonably necessary.” See Torres, 859 F.2d at 1527 (emphasis\nin original); see also Kimel v.

The employer, Mil-\nwaukee County, has the burden to demonstrate that it\ncould not rearrange job responsibilities to eliminate or\nminimize the conflict between the inmates’ privacy,\nsecurity and rehabilitation interests and the employees’\nrights under Title VII.

Although reducing the number of opposite-sex\nstaff on the pods may help to promote security, efficient\nrisk management and privacy, Milwaukee County has\nfailed to establish that its policy was reasonably necessary\nfor these goals. We address each proffered justification\nin turn.\n  The evidence in the record does not support the conclu-\nsion that the juveniles’ safety or security, or the institu-\ntion’s ability to manage risk effectively, was at all in\njeopardy because of the presence of opposite-sex JCOs on\nthe third shift. The district court correctly asserted that\nheterosexual assaults and misconduct are statistically\nmore likely than homosexual attacks. The record estab-\n\f16                                               No. 07-2534\n\nlishes, however, that there has not been a single instance\nof staff-on-inmate sexual assault at the JDC, on any shift,\nby either sex; nor has there been a significant problem\nwith false accusations against the staff. Furthermore, other\nsafety precautions, such as door alarms and the presence\nof supervisors, runners and video cameras, currently are\nworking to prevent actual and alleged security breaches.\nAlthough Milwaukee County contends that a staff mem-\nber may be able to circumvent the alarm system in order\nto enter a juvenile’s cell at night, the record contains\nno evidence that this contingency has occurred or was\nlikely to occur at the JDC.\n  More fundamentally, Milwaukee County offered no\nreasons why the numerous alternatives to same-sex\nstaffing suggested by the plaintiffs at trial, such as improv-\ning the alarm system, installing additional cameras, leaving\nthe doors open between the pods at night or increasing\nthe frequency of supervisor patrols, would not have\nmitigated any concern. Notably, Mr. Wanta testified at\ntrial that he had not investigated the cost of any of these\noptions. He did assert that adding an additional staff\nmember on each of the pods during the third shift would\nhave been prohibitively costly; however, he did not\nprovide any data on this point, and such an augmentation\nin personnel certainly was not the only option available\nto minimize the already-minimal risk of staff-on-juvenile\nsexual assault. The BFOQ defense extends only to those\npolicies that are “reasonably necessary to the normal\noperation” of the institution, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e)(1). It\ndoes not excuse investigation of and reliance upon alterna-\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                     17\n\ntives that involve minor additional costs or inconve-\nniences.7\n   Milwaukee County’s proffered privacy justification is\neven more difficult to justify on the record before us. The\nrecord affirmatively shows that the JDC allowed JCOs of\nthe opposite sex to monitor the pods during both of the\ndaytime shifts. It is undisputed that the vast majority of\nthe time that the juveniles were unclothed occurred during\nthese daytime shifts. Showering generally took place\nduring the second shift, when members of the opposite\nsex were permitted to staff the pods. The only showering\nthat occurred on the third shift was monitored by one of\nthe runners who performed the intake procedures. The\njuveniles were provided with pajamas, which they were\nrequired to wear at night. They changed into this attire\non the second shift, and they changed out of it on the\nfirst shift—again, while JCOs of the opposite sex were\npermitted to view them. Although Milwaukee County\npresented testimony that third-shift JCOs occasionally\nviewed juveniles using the toilet, masturbating or other-\nwise acting out sexually, it is undisputed that this situa-\ntion occurred on the first and second shifts as well.\n  This situation is therefore very different from cases\nsuch as Torres, 859 F.2d at 1530, and Everson, 391 F.3d at\n753, which involved the presence of male guards in the\n\n\n\n7\n  See, e.g., Chambers, 834 F.2d at 701 (noting that “[t]he employer\nmust demonstrate that there is a compelling need to maintain\nthat practice, and the practice cannot be justified by routine\nbusiness considerations” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f18                                              No. 07-2534\n\nhousing units of all-female prisons. In Torres, we held that\nthe superintendent reasonably made a “professional\njudgment that giving women prisoners a living environ-\nment free from the presence of males in a position of\nauthority was necessary to foster the goal of rehabilita-\ntion.” 859 F.2d at 1530. In Everson, the court determined\nthat, “given the endemic problem of sexual abuse in\nMichigan’s female facilities” and other unique circum-\nstances, 391 F.3d at 761, the presence of male guards, at\nany time, in the housing units was a threat to “the\nsecurity of the prison, the safety of inmates and the pro-\ntection of the privacy rights of inmates,” id. at 753. In\nEverson and Torres, prison officials permitted no officers\nof the opposite sex to guard the living units at any time\nbecause the specific needs of the institutions and the\nprisoners housed in those institutions reasonably re-\nquired such a policy. The same-sex policy was aimed at a\nspecific condition and was tailored to address that\nspecific condition. The plans were quite clearly “the\nproduct of a reasoned decision-making process, based on\navailable information and experience.” Torres, 859 F.2d at\n1532. Here, by contrast, we are faced with the fact that the\nJDC allowed JCOs of the opposite sex to guard the juve-\nniles during those times when the privacy interests of the\njuveniles were most in jeopardy. Under these circum-\nstances, we cannot say that, with respect to privacy\nconcerns, the same-sex policy is the product of the same\nsort of comprehensive professional decision-making as\nexhibited in Torres and Everson. The inconsistencies in\nimplementation cast a significant doubt on whether the\npolicy is reasonably necessary to achieve the institution’s\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                      19\n\ngoal of protecting the privacy interests of the juveniles.\nTherefore, on this factor as well, the record reveals a\nfailure of proof on the part of Milwaukee County.\n   The County also contends that same-sex staffing on the\nthird shift is necessary to further the JDC’s mission of\nrehabilitation. Contrary to the submission of the plain-\ntiffs, we have no doubt that the County is correct in stating\nthat this goal is a very important goal of the institution.8\n\n\n8\n   Ms. Henry and Ms. Lewis take issue with the district court’s\ndetermination that rehabilitation is part of the “essence of the\nbusiness” of the JDC. They note that neither the Wisconsin\nregulations nor the JDC’s own mission statement mentions the\nword “rehabilitation.” They also assert that the juveniles are in\nthe JDC for very brief periods of time, and, unlike in a penal\ninstitution, rehabilitation in a short-term detention facility is\na futile goal.\n   Based on its interpretation of the juvenile justice statute and\nthe JDC’s mission statement, as well as on testimony from Mr.\nWanta and others, the district court concluded that rehabilita-\ntion indeed was part of the essence of the JDC’s business.\nWisconsin’s juvenile justice code requires the juvenile justice\nsystem to take action directed at providing the best possible\ncare for the juveniles and at preventing future delinquent\nbehavior by developing their ability to lead productive and\nresponsible lives. Wis. Stat. § 938.01(2)(c), (f). Wisconsin courts\nalso have recognized the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile\njustice system. See In re Hezzie R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1709584\"><a href=\"/opinion/1709584/state-v-hezzie-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 668 & n.4\n(Wis. 1998). Mr. Wanta and other administrators testified that\nthe juveniles’ time at the JDC, generally a result of a crisis\nsituation, is often a valuable opportunity for intervention and\n                                                      (continued...)\n\f20                                                  No. 07-2534\n\n  The record contains substantial testimony from\nMr. Wanta on this factor. He described the basis for his\ndetermination that a role model/mentoring policy was\nnecessary to the JDC’s rehabilitative efforts. Tr. at 607-19,\n634-35, 658-60. He noted that, in formulating the policy, he\nhad relied upon his own experience with juvenile correc-\ntions, information learned from his attendance at various\nseminars and committee meetings, his interviews with\nthe juveniles and staff at the JDC, consultations with\nexperts in the field and professional literature supporting\nsuch programs.9 Each of these sources suggested that the\ndirect role modeling/mentoring form of supervision, rather\nthan the indirect form of supervision, was the best avail-\nable method of providing care and rehabilitation to\njuveniles in detention facilities. Mr. Wanta, in his profes-\nsional judgment, concluded that institution of the direct\nrole model/mentoring form of supervision was necessary\nto achieve the JDC’s mission of rehabilitation. The founda-\ntion for his belief is well established in the record.\n The conclusion that the effectiveness of these role\nmodel/mentoring programs requires the presence of at\n\n\n\n8\n  (...continued)\nrehabilitation. Tr. at 623-24. This evidence supports the district\ncourt’s finding that rehabilitation is part of the “essence” of\nthe JDC.\n9\n  See, e.g., Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention\n(“OJJDP”), Delinquency Prevention: Desktop Guide to Good Juvenile\nDetention Practice (Roush ed., 1996), R.48, Ex. 1013 (praising\nthe virtues of direct supervision over indirect supervision).\n\fNo. 07-2534                                               21\n\nleast one staff member of the same sex as the juveniles in\neach pod at all times, however, does not find the same\nstrong foundation in the record. Mr. Wanta expressed\nhis belief that same-sex role model/mentoring was more\neffective than cross-gender programs. He testified that, in\nformulating this view, he relied upon his own personal\nexperiences, as well as literature on mentoring programs,\nwhich “indicate that gender mentoring improves the\nchances of child behavior changes being positive.” Tr. at\n635. He continued: “[A]ll the statistics and the research\nthat I have seen indicates that a male mentoring a male,\nand a female mentoring a female, exponentially increases\nthe chance of success than would cross-gender . . .\nmentoring.” Id.\n  In support of his belief, Mr. Wanta referenced a\nreport from the Office of Juvenile Justice and\nDelinquency Prevention (“OJJDP”), Juvenile Mentoring\nPrograms: A Progress Review (Sept. 2000), R.48, Ex. 1022.\nAlthough this publication was not available at the time\nof his decision, he suggested that it supported his view\nthat same-sex role modeling was necessary for rehabilita-\ntion. This report, however, is specific to one-on-one mentor\nmatching programs for at-risk youth. Moreover, its find-\nings regarding the effect of sex-specific assignments, even\nin this circumstance, are inconclusive at best. See id. at 5.\nMr. Wanta did not explain how anecdotal evidence from\nthese after-school mentoring programs is relevant to the\nvastly different juvenile detention setting. More impor-\ntantly, it does not speak to the issue of whether, to achieve\nsuccess in mentoring, same-sex supervision on the third\nshift, when the juveniles are isolated and likely asleep\n\f22                                                     No. 07-2534\n\nin their cells, is reasonably necessary. The other publica-\ntions admitted into evidence by the County appear to\nadd little to this precise question.1 0\n  We are well aware that the professionals who have\nthe great responsibility for running penal institutions\nneed to innovate and experiment if they are to succeed\nin resolving the crisis in this important area of gover-\nnance. Indeed, we already have recognized that the\ninability to proffer solid empirical evidence in support of\na particular policy certainly is not fatal to a BFOQ defense.\nSee Torres, 859 F.2d at 1532. Even if we defer to Mr. Wanta’s\njudgment that a mentoring program is important to the\nsuccess of juvenile institutions such as the one he\nmanages, and even if we defer to his judgment with\nrespect to the need for same-sex mentoring of juveniles\nin such an environment, we still must be satisfied in the\npresent litigation that these professional judgments\nrequire a rigid rule that such a same-sex mentoring pro-\ngram reasonably necessitates the presence of a JCO of the\n\n\n10\n  See OJJDP, Psychiatric Disorders of Youth in Detention (April\n2006), R.48, Ex. 1017 (discussing the prevalence of juveniles with\nmental disorders in juvenile detention facilities); U.S. Dep’t of\nJustice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Prison Rape Elimination Act of\n2003: Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities 2004 (July\n2005), R.48, Ex. 1015 (discussing nationwide statistics on sexual\nassault in correctional facilities); OJJDP, Juvenile Mentoring\nPrograms: 1998 Report to Congress (Dec. 1998), R.48, Ex. 1023\n(discussing mentor matching programs outside the detention\ncontext, and noting that most programs use gender as a match-\ning criteria).\n\fNo. 07-2534                                               23\n\nsame sex at all times. Milwaukee County had the responsi-\nbility to introduce sufficient evidence in the record to\nsupport the conclusion that such same-sex presence at\nall times was reasonably necessary to meet the institu-\ntion’s essential goals. Here, the record, although perhaps\ndemonstrating the worth of a mentoring program and\nthe usefulness of mentors of the same sex, does not\npresent a sufficiently strong case with respect to the need\nfor the presence of those mentors seven days a week and\ntwenty-four hours a day.\n  At trial, Mr. Wanta explained how the JCOs were to\nact as role models and mentors at the JDC:\n   On a practical sense, I just wanted a staff member to be\n   a good, positive person. To display positive attitude.\n   To display respect towards the juvenile. Respect\n   towards your peers. Respect toward any individual\n   that came across their area. To model how to interact.\n   Whether interacting with that juvenile, so the other\n   juveniles who observe can see that interaction going\n   on and the positive outcomes to that type of interac-\n   tion. Interaction with your peers in a positive way. . . .\n   [T]he biggest focus was . . . for staff to demonstrate\n   proper behavior.\nTr. at 609. JCOs were not trained or expected to act as\ncounselors; if any serious counseling was necessary, the\nJCOs were instructed to refer the juvenile to an on-site\nnurse trained in mental health. Instead, the JCOs carried\nout their role model/mentoring responsibilities by pro-\nviding the juveniles with a constant model of proper\nbehavior in their interactions with others.\n\f24                                              No. 07-2534\n\n   Given this description of the role of JCOs in the\nmentoring program, we must conclude that the record does\nnot respond to the question of why a JCO of the same\nsex is reasonably necessary during the night shift. Ac-\ncording to the record, the opportunity for the JCO to\ninteract with the juveniles on the third shift is very mini-\nmal. The third shift begins after the juveniles are locked\ndown for the night, and the JCOs on third shift were\ninstructed to encourage them to sleep. Although there\nwas testimony at trial that staff occasionally spoke with\njuveniles through their doors at night, particularly when\nthey were ill or acting out and it was necessary to calm\nthem down, this interaction was kept to a minimum. There\nis no evidence that the JCOs ever spoke with the juveniles\nabout confidential counseling matters at night. Indeed,\nbecause the other juveniles in the pod would have been\nable to hear any conversations that occurred, the JCOs\ntestified at trial that they were encouraged to avoid these\ntypes of discussions on the third shift.\n  The County provided no reasons why opposite-sex\nJCOs were incapable of appropriately interacting with\nthese juveniles to the extent necessary to provide a good\nbehavioral role model on the third shift. Mr. Wanta’s\nassertion that “consistency” in the same-sex mentoring\nprogram requires the presence of someone of the same\nsex within each pod at all times is simply not justified by\nthe record. Furthermore, the County failed to provide\nevidence that the many non-discriminatory alternatives\nproffered by the plaintiffs would have been intolerable\nhere. The plaintiffs questioned Mr. Wanta about nu-\nmerous other possibilities for encouraging rehabilitation\n\fNo. 07-2534                                               25\n\nthrough the availability of same-sex staff, such as hiring\nmore JCOs for the third shift, leaving the doors between\npods open or increasing the frequency of supervisor\nrotations. They also noted that numerous other mecha-\nnisms to encourage rehabilitation already were in place\nat the facility, including educational programs, counselors,\nguest speakers, community mentors and other programs\navailable to facilitate the JDC’s mission. The County\nfailed to explain why the presence of a same-sex JCO\nwithin each pod during the hours that the juveniles were\nsleeping was reasonably necessary to its rehabilitative\nefforts.\n  Accordingly, we must conclude that the County failed\nto meet its burden to prove that the sex-based classifica-\ntion at issue here was reasonably necessary for the re-\nhabilitation, security or privacy functions of the JDC.\nTherefore, Milwaukee’s BFOQ defense must fail. The JDC’s\nthird shift policy adversely affected the plaintiffs’ employ-\nment. It is undisputed that overtime pay had been a\nsignificant and expected component of the plaintiffs’\ncompensation prior to the institution of the sex-based\npolicy. Not only did the majority of overtime work avail-\nable occur on the third shift, but the third shift also\noffered a fifty cent per hour pay premium. Accordingly,\nthe dramatic reduction in the opportunity for women to\nwork on the third shift constituted an adverse employ-\nment action. See Lewis v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454062/lewis-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653-\n54 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that the denial of the opportu-\nnity for overtime pay, when that pay is a significant and\nrecurring part of an employee’s total earnings, can consti-\ntute an adverse employment action).

The\nrange of conduct prohibited under the anti-retaliation\nprovision is broader than its anti-discrimination provision,\nhowever, because “the discriminatory acts proscribed by\nTitle VII’s anti-retaliation provision are not limited to\nthose that affect the terms and conditions of one’s em-\nployment.” Lewis, 496 F.3d at 655 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Nevertheless, in order to\nestablish a claim for retaliation under Title VII, the plain-\ntiffs must prove that the alleged employment actions were\nmaterially adverse such that they would dissuade a\nreasonable person from engaging in protected activity. Id.\nAdditionally, they must show a causal link between these\nalleged adverse actions and their protected activity. Basith\nv. Cook County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772269\"><a href=\"/opinion/772269/abuzaffer-basith-v-cook-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 933 (7th Cir. 2001).\n  After a review of the record, we conclude that the\ndistrict court did not err in its determination that the\nalleged incidents did not rise to the level of harassment or\nretaliation. The Supreme Court has emphasized the\nnecessity of separating “significant from trivial harms.”\nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68\n(2006). It further cautioned that “[a]n employee’s decision\nto report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that\nemployee from those petty slights or minor annoyances\nthat often take place at work.” Id. Title VII’s anti-retaliation\n\f28                                              No. 07-2534\n\nprovision prohibits only those employer actions that are\nlikely to deter victims of discrimination from invoking the\nAct’s remedial mechanisms. Id. We agree with the district\ncourt that the alleged incidents, such as being told not\nto wear sweaters or eat in front of the juveniles, unspeci-\nfied “intimidation” and door slamming by the head of\nshift, missing or marked up time-cards, occasional early\nmorning phone calls, and not being assigned to work\ntogether on the same shift or in easier pods are the type\nof petty slights and minor annoyances that generally will\nnot create such deterrence. Additionally, because these\nincidents do not rise to the level of an adverse action\nunder the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII, they\ncertainly do not constitute workplace harassment suf-\nficient to establish a discrimination claim. See id. at 67.\n  Furthermore, the district court did not err when it\nconcluded that the plaintiffs had failed to prove a causal\nlink between their discrimination complaints and the\nalleged harassment. The plaintiffs did not even attempt to\nshow that any of the alleged harassment was tied to their\nsex. As for retaliation, the plaintiffs point only to “suspi-\ncious timing” and an allegation that they were referred to\nas “troublemakers” to suggest that the incidents of which\nthey complain were a result of retaliation for their pro-\ntected activity. The district court here found that the\ntiming of the incidents in question was not suspicious;\nthe difficulties the plaintiffs had been having with their\nmanagers had been ongoing well before they engaged in\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                     29\n\nany protected activity.1 1 The district court further found\nthat the managers’ alleged use of the term “troublemakers”\nwas not in reference to any of the plaintiff’s protected\nactivities. R.60 at 10. Instead, it found that the plaintiffs\nin fact had been difficult employees, constantly lodging\ntrivial grievances and generally complaining whenever\nsuperiors tried to correct their behavior; the term “trouble-\nmaker” had been used in reference to the plaintiffs’ general\nbehavior, not their EEOC complaints. Id. We cannot say\nthat this finding was clearly erroneous.\n\n\n                          Conclusion\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is af-\nfirmed in part and reversed in part. The case is remanded\nto the district court for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. The parties shall bear their own costs in this\nappeal.\n                                           A FFIRMED in part;\n                            R EVERSED and R EMANDED in part\n\n\n\n\n11\n   Furthermore, suspicious timing alone is not enough to\nestablish causation.

But we need\nnot decide whether Torres requires a fresh look, because\nthe court’s opinion (which I join) shows that the em-\nployer’s justifications flunk the Torres standard.\n  Milwaukee County decided that at least one guard of\nthe same sex as the prisoners is necessary not only for\nthe prison as a whole (to perform body-cavity searches,\nfor example), but also for each pod in the prison. A pod\nin Milwaukee’s Juvenile Detention Center may contain as\nfew as 11 inmates, and because women occupy only one\npod the County’s policy reduced women’s opportunities\nfor employment as guards. The County expresses concern\nabout sexual assaults but admits that no guard has ever\nsexually assaulted any prisoner in its care—and data from\nprisons elsewhere do not show that female guards are\nlikely to assault male prisoners sexually. That left the\nCounty with stereotypes, such as the proposition that\n\fNo. 07-2534                                                 31\n\nguards of the same sex serve as mentors or role models\nfor the prisoners.\n   I call this a stereotype because it is based on folk wisdom.\nIt could, in principle, be based on facts, such as proof that\nrecidivism rates fall (or legitimate income after release\nrises) when a prison has more guards of the inmates’ sex.\nBut the County conceded that it lacked such data when\nit adopted this policy, and neither expert witnesses nor\nany published studies supplied an empirical foundation\nfor the policy at trial.\n  Employers frequently assert that inmates (or students)\nrespond more favorably to guards (or teachers) of their\nown sex or race. If this sort of justification had been\nadvanced for matching the race of the inmates and the\nguards (or students and their teachers), courts would not\ngo along. See Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). Cf. United States v.

Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720670\"><a href=\"/opinion/720670/earl-wittmer-earl-craig-cox-and-james-jeffers-v-howard-a-peters-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir.\n1996), is not important to a case that involves the long-\nterm operation of regular prisons.) Why then should\ncourts accept the same sort of “justification” for sex\ndiscrimination?\n  The majority in Torres concluded that Title VII should\nnot be used to block experiments that might lead to the\nsort of data that would establish a BFOQ. Twenty years\nhave passed since Torres, and Wisconsin’s prisons (like\nthose in other states) have had ample opportunity to try\ndifferent policies. Other states (and other prisons in\nWisconsin) allow people to guard the opposite sex both\n\f32                                             No. 07-2534\n\nday and night; data should not be hard to come by. But\ninstead of producing data, the defendants in this case\nreiterated sexual stereotypes. A court that permits a state\n(or for that matter a federal agency) to make decisions\ninfluenced by intuitions about what the data ultimately\nwill show must insist that the state (or agency) find out\nwhether those intuitions are sound or simply supersti-\ntions. See Bechtel v.

Cir. 1993).\nWisconsin has not made anything of the 20 years’ breath-\ning space provided by Torres, and the time has passed\nwhen cheap talk and unverifiable assertions of “profes-\nsional experience” may substitute for the kind of evidence\nthat Johnson Controls and Dothard contemplate.\n\n\n\n\n                          8-20-08\n\f</pre>",
