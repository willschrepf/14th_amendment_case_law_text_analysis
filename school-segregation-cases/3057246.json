(Mother), mother of C.B., N.B., W.B., and K.B., appeals from the\njuvenile court’s orders declaring her four children dependents of the juvenile court,\npursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivisions (b) and (c),1 and\nremoving them from Mother’s custody, pursuant to section 361, subdivision (c)(1). On\nappeal, Mother contends the juvenile court erred in finding that active efforts were made\nto provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup\nof this Indian family, pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).2 We shall\naffirm the juvenile court’s orders.\n\n\n\n         1\n        All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n         2\n             The children’s presumed father (Father) is not a party to this appeal.\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On April 30, 2015, the juvenile court granted the application of the Mendocino\nCounty Health and Human Services Agency (Agency) for an order authorizing entry into\nMother’s family home to conduct a child welfare investigation, pursuant to section 328,\nto determine whether child welfare services should be offered to the family and whether\njuvenile court proceedings should be commenced. In its application, the Agency reported\nthat, between 2008 and 2013, the Agency had received 26 referrals for the family, which\nhad been minimally investigated due to the noncooperation of Mother. Then, in\nSeptember 2014, the Agency received two referrals from mandated reporters alleging\ngeneral neglect of the children, including poor hygiene and substandard and unsafe living\nconditions. These allegations were found to be inconclusive and the Agency had\n“worked creatively” with Mother on a voluntary basis “to put rudimentary interventions,\nsupports and services in place.” Beginning on March 24, 2015, however, the Agency had\nreceived three more referrals alleging general neglect of the children; poor hygiene and\nat-risk behaviors of then 12-year-old C.B.; and worsened living conditions for the family,\nwhich lived outside of the city grid, reportedly on tribal family land. On April 29, 2015,\nthe social worker and two supervisors went to the residence and saw that the amount of\nrefuse in the yard appeared to have tripled since the social worker’s last visit in\nDecember 2014. There was also a pungent odor of urine, feces, and refuse. The children\nand Mother were wearing filthy clothing and the children had layers of embedded dirt on\nthem. During the visit, Mother was uncooperative, defensive, and hostile. She refused to\nallow the social worker to enter the family’s trailer home.\n       On May 6, 2015, the Agency filed an original petition alleging, pursuant to section\n300, subdivision (b), that the parents had been unable to recognize and provide for the\nchildren’s most basic needs, and that Mother was unable to put the best interests of the\nchildren first, due to her anger and mental health issues. The petition noted that the social\nworker and her supervisor had gone to the residence with law enforcement on April 30,\n2015, where they observed the children to be filthy and covered with dirt. During the\nApril 30 visit to the property, Mother had “continuously berated her children in a harsh\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand controlling manner to follow her directions as she exhibited hostile, confrontational,\ndefiant, and angry behaviors in their presence.” The petition contained allegations that\nFather had a history of drug dealing and methamphetamine use, as well as daily use of\nmarijuana, which impaired his ability to adequately care for and supervise the children.\n       The petition further alleged that the parents had been unwilling and unable to\nmaintain a safe, sanitary living environment for the children. During the April 30 visit,\nthere had been an overwhelming stench and the social worker had seen piles of household\nrefuse, including rotting food, dirty diapers, and other garbage strewn throughout the\nresidence, an 18-foot travel trailer in which the family was living,. The trailer appeared\nuninhabitable due to filth, wear and tear, and an unsanitary interior. The stove did not\nappear to work and there was no running water in the trailer. There were two beds for six\npeople. Some of the children slept on the floor, on a pile of dirty clothes and blankets.\nThere was also a shoe box sized container filled with marijuana in a cupboard in the\nliving area of the trailer. Garbage was also strewn around the property and there was a\nfive by four foot pile of smoldering household refuse burning within around 10 feet of the\ntrailer. The petition stated that “the condition of the trailer and the property did not meet\nminimum community (tribal) standards of cleanliness.”\n       The petition also alleged, under subdivision (c) of section 300, that “[t]he ongoing\ncontrolling and manipulative behaviors of the mother around her children, together with\nthe absence of healthy parenting by either parent,” placed the children at risk of physical\nand emotional harm. During much of the three-and-one-half-hour visit on April 30,\n2015, Mother continuously berated her children and kept her three youngest children\nlocked inside her van with her, with only the driver side window open approximately six\ninches. The outside temperature was hot and the three children could be heard screaming\nand crying. Seven-year-old N.B. later said he was upset because Mother had told the\nchildren that the Agency was trying to take them away from her.\n       In the report for the detention hearing, filed on May 7, 2015, the social worker\nrelated that, in addition to the serious deterioration of the property and major concerns\nregarding the ongoing neglect of the children, “there are also concerns over the mental\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhealth and anger issues of the mother that appear to severely impair her ability to provide\nfor the basic needs and healthy functioning of her children, with [C.B.] also requiring\nmental health assessment.” The social worker also reported that the older children did\nnot appear to be regularly attending school.\n       During the April 30, 2015 visit to the property, Father appeared to be under the\ninfluence, and seemed paralyzed at times and uncertain about speaking to the social\nworker unless instructed to do so by Mother. During that visit, it took hours to finally\nreach agreement on an interim safety plan, due to Mother’s lack of cooperation and\nvolatile, erratic behavior. Under the plan, the children went to stay temporarily with their\npaternal grandmother, although five days later the grandmother informed the social\nworker that she could no longer care for the children because she was unable to manage\ntheir behaviors. The children were therefore detained by the Agency.\n       Regarding Native American status, Mother had told the social worker that she is\naffiliated with the Yokayo Rancheria Tribe, which she said is “ ‘no longer federally\nrecognized.’ ” Father stated that he has no Native American heritage.\n       In an addendum to the detention report, filed on May 11, 2015, the social worker\nreported that a fifth child, 15 years old, had been in the care of his maternal grandmother\nfrom the age of six or seven, and would remain in her care. The social worker also\nreported that Mother and Father had both voluntarily agreed to submit to a random drug\ntest on May 7. Mother had preliminarily tested positive for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\nand methamphetamine, while Father never arrived at the Agency for testing.\n       Mother testified at the May 12, 2015 detention hearing that she was upset when\nthe social worker and law enforcement came to her property on April 30, but she denied\nyelling or barricading her children in her van. Since the children were removed, Mother\nhad taken steps to clean up the property, which is owned by the Yokayo Tribe of Indians,\nincluding removing the trash from the trailer and adding another bed. The trash outside\nthe trailer had also been removed. There had always been a working generator and\naccess to running water on the property. There was also a port-a-potty. The children\nbathed every other day at the nearby house of Mother’s cousin. The family was in the\n\n\n                                               4\n\fprocess of fixing up another house on their property, and Mother’s grandmother had said\nthat Mother and the youngest children could stay with her until the new house was\nlivable. Mother did not believe the condition of the property prior to the cleanup was\nhazardous to the health or safety of the children. N.B. was not attending school due to a\nmedical issue with his eardrum and C.B. had been attending school “until an incident a\nfew months back.” Mother also testified that she and Father used marijuana.\n       Social worker Jannee Dale also testified at the hearing. She and other Agency\nstaff had visited the family’s property on April 29, 2015, after receiving three referrals\nabout the condition of the property and incidents involving the oldest child, C.B., who\napparently was not attending school. Dale had arranged for tribal representative Lorraine\nLaiwa to meet her at the property, but Laiwa had arrived early and left before Dale\narrived. Once there, Mother stepped between Dale and the trailer and refused to let her\nsee inside the trailer or talk to the children.\n       The following day, the Agency obtained a warrant and Dale returned to the\nproperty with police, who served the warrant. During the three-and-one-half-hour visit,\nthe children were primarily inside the van, but there were a few points when they were\nnot. Dale described the garbage, the fire, and the strong smell of garbage, smoke, and\nburning plastic on the property. Mother was very upset and yelled a lot, and tried to call\nLaiwa several times during the visit. Ultimately, the Agency and the parents worked out\na safety plan that allowed the paternal grandmother to care for the children, instead of the\nAgency detaining them.\n       There had been a total of 29 or 30 referrals for the property since 2008. The\nAgency had previously worked with the family three times to attempt to clean up the\nproperty. Dale believed the living conditions were hazardous in April 2015, because\nthere were toxic fumes from burning plastic; there was rotten food throughout the trailer;\nthere was a bottle of apple juice on the ground right next to bottles of Pinesol, within\nreach of the children; and there were soiled diapers all over the property. There were also\nconcerns about the older children’s school attendance. Dale did not believe it was safe to\nreturn the children to Mother, even assuming the property had been cleaned up. She\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fbelieved the family needed services, given that she had already worked with them for\nthree months the prior year, and yet the problems “continue[d] to happen over and over\nagain.” Dale was also concerned about mother’s emotional stability and wanted to\nascertain whether her issues could be addressed by a doctor or therapist. Another\nconcern involved the parents’ substance abuse.\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court reaffirmed a prior temporary\ndetention order, due to a longstanding problem with the home not meeting minimum\ncommunity standards and the probability that conditions, even if they had improved\ntemporarily, might deteriorate again and present a risk to the children.\n       In the jurisdiction report filed on June 2, 2015, the social worker reported that the\nchildren were placed together in foster care. C.B. had had 25 unexcused absences from\nschool between January and March 23, 2015. C.B. was mimicking Mother’s behaviors in\nher placement, including disregard for rules, bullying, and trying to get the other children\nto follow her defiant, disrespectful behaviors. C.B. was receiving counseling services\nand the other three children had been referred for medical, mental health, and educational\nevaluations and services.\n       Mother had tested positive for THC five times in May. The social worker had\nreferred the parents for substance abuse treatment and assessment and to “In-take support\nservices.” In May, the social worker had contacted Consolidated Tribal Health to inquire\nabout the availability of culturally appropriate parenting, hygiene, and nutrition classes,\nbut was informed no such classes were available. She was currently trying to obtain\nresources and information for the parents from the outreach program coordinator at\nConsolidated Tribal Health. The parents had weekly supervised visitation with the four\nchildren removed from their care, as well as with their older son. The Agency had also\nprovided Mother and the maternal grandmother with gas vouchers for transportation to\nvisitation.\n       On June 17, 2015, the Agency filed an amended petition with additional\nallegations under section 300, subdivision (b)—that Mother had a current substance\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fabuse problem—and subdivision (c)—that N.B. was exhibiting behaviors that indicated\nemotional damage.\n       At the June 18, 2015 jurisdictional hearing, both parents waived their rights, the\nparties agreed to language for a second amended petition, and the court sustained the\nallegations of the amended petition, which dismissed the allegations under section 300,\nsubdivision (b)(4) regarding the events observed at the family residence by Agency\npersonnel on April 30, 2015.\n       At the conclusion of a June 25, 2015 hearing regarding an out of county placement\nfor the oldest daughter, C.B., the juvenile court stated that there had been an attempt to\nplace C.B. with the paternal grandmother, but, when the grandmother could not deal with\nC.B.’s behaviors, she had been placed in a local facility where there were issues\nregarding her interactions with other children and her self-injurious behavior. The court\nfound that the social worker had diligently looked for a closer facility for C.B. that would\nprovide a higher level of safety and supervision, but she was not able to find an\nappropriate placement that was closer than the facility in which she had been placed,\nwhich was a three-hour drive from her parents.\n       In the disposition report filed on July 9, 2015, the social worker reported that\nMother had tested positive for THC on several occasions in June; on June 24, she had\nobtained a medical marijuana recommendation. Also in June, Mother had participated in\nan alcohol and drug assessment, and had been determined to be in need of treatment for\ncannabis abuse. She was being referred to a culturally appropriate treatment program at\nConsolidated Tribal Health.\n       During a family team meeting on June 29, 2015, attended by Agency staff, Mother\nand the maternal grandmother, case plans were developed for the family, which contained\nservice objectives for Mother related to meeting the children’s physical, emotional,\nmedical, and educational needs; maintaining a relationship with the children through\nvisitation; staying sober and showing the ability to live free from alcohol and drug\ndependency; consistently, appropriately, and adequately parenting the children; and\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fcomplying with medical or psychological treatment.3 Two days later, the social worker\nmet with both parents to go over and sign the case plans.\n       The three younger children were not placed together in foster care due to the lack\nof available foster homes. Mother had demonstrated that she was invested in having her\nchildren returned to her, attending every visit, attending two family team meetings, and\nmaking substantial progress in cleaning the property. She still needed much support,\nhowever, because, as the social worker explained, “this is not merely a situation of a dirty\nhouse. This is a situation with a multitude of neglect [sic] of these four children who are\ntoo young to understand and have been segregated from society in mom’s effort to\nprotect her children from ‘outsiders.’ These children are seriously delayed in their\nacademic as well as emotional and social skills.”\n       The Agency recommended continued out of home placement for the children and\nreunification services for the parents.\n       At the July 15, 2015 dispositional hearing, Lorraine Laiwa testified that she had\nbeen the director and case manager for the Indian Child and Family Preservation, a\nconsortium of four tribes, for 20 years. She had been qualified as an Indian expert\nwitness in Mendocino County Juvenile Dependency Court 30 to 40 times. Laiwa had\nworked with every tribe in Mendocino and Lake Counties as an ICWA worker, including\none year for the Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians (Big Valley Tribe). She was familiar\nwith the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community with respect to\nchild rearing practices. Laiwa was asked to be an expert in this case by the Agency and\nthe Big Valley Tribe. She had reviewed the petition and all of the reports filed in this\ncase. She also had spoken about the case with the social worker, with Big Valley tribal\nrepresentatives, and with the parents.\n\n\n       3\n         Proposed services for Mother included visitation support, participation in a\nsubstance abuse assessment and completion of all treatment recommendations, drug\ntesting, participation in culturally appropriate anger management and parenting education\nprograms, and participation in a psychological evaluation and completion of all treatment\nrecommendations.\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       Although the family’s property had been cleaned up when Laiwa was there a few\nweeks earlier, she did not believe the children should be returned to the home until more\nwas done to make it a safe place for them. There was another property the tribe was\nconsidering for the family, but the house there was old and needed a great deal of work.\nOther issues that concerned Laiwa included Mother’s positive drug test for\nmethamphetamine. Father had said he was taking medication that “was making [him]\nfeel out of it,” and Laiwa believed there might be a connection between substance use,\nprescription medication, and the condition of the home.\n       Laiwa had learned that Mother and her oldest daughter, C.B., were eligible for Big\nValley tribal membership. She did not know about the eligibility of the rest of the\nchildren.\n       In the circumstances of the case, Laiwa believed that the parents’ continued\ncustody of their children at present was likely to result in serious emotional and physical\ndamage to the children. She had spoken with the tribal representative and one of the\ncouncil members, and they also believed it would be detrimental to return the children\n“until things are fixed up for the family and a more permanent home for them [sic].”\nBoth Laiwa and the tribe believed it was in the children’s best interest to be placed in\nfoster care until a relative placement could be found or until another suitable placement,\napproved by the tribe, was found.\n       On cross-examination, Laiwa testified that she had met with Mother about four\ntimes since becoming involved with the case, and Laiwa believed Mother “loves her\nchildren very much.” She did not know what remedial services the Agency had offered\nthe family.\n       Nancy Hernandez, ICWA coordinator for the Big Valley Tribe and social services\ncoordinator for four Rancherias, testified that, of the four children, C.B. was an enrolled\nmember of the Big Valley Tribe and the other three children—N.B., W.B., and K.B.—\nwere eligible members because Mother was an enrolled member.\n       The social worker on the case, Jannee Dale, again testified that she had worked\nwith the family starting in September 2014, and, with the participation of Laiwa, had put\n\n\n                                             9\n\fin place a “risk reduction plan,” which was a written agreement between the Agency and\nthe parents that attempted to mitigate the risks to the children. Dale had inquired at that\ntime about tribal resources that might be available for the family but, because their tribe\nis not federally recognized, there was no assistance available. She was able to get them\nfood and clothing vouchers. She had also worked with Mother about trying to request an\nindividualized education program for N.B., who was extremely sensitive to noise.\nSubsequently, in March 2015, Agency staff went to the home and saw that it was in\nworse condition than it had been initially.\n       In April 2015, the Agency prepared a safety plan for the children, which involved\nthem staying with the paternal grandparents while the Agency worked with the family to\ntry to alleviate their problems, including the hazardous conditions at the residence,\nMother’s hostility and possible mental health issues, and Father’s being under the\ninfluence. The purpose of the safety plan was to avoid having to detain the children\nwhile dealing with the family’s issues. Shortly thereafter, the grandmother said she could\nnot take care of the children due to their behavioral issues, which were affecting her\nhealth. The Agency therefore placed the children in foster care.\n       Since the children were detained, Mother had been cooperating with the Agency in\nterms of drug testing and participating in a substance abuse assessment.4 The Agency\nhad also begun discussions with her about treatment options. At the first of two family\nteam meetings in mid- to late May 2015, the social worker had talked with Mother about\ngetting a psychological evaluation to be able to properly tailor mental health services, and\nhad discussed with her the possibility of working with a particular family counselor\nregarding anger management issues and another counselor regarding mental health\nissues. At the second family team meeting on June 29, the social worker had discussed\nwith Mother the possibility of her obtaining anger management services. The purpose of\nthe family team meetings was to determine what services were needed and to develop the\n\n\n       4\n       After her first positive drug test for methamphetamine, Mother had tested\napproximately a dozen times, and had not tested positive for methamphetamine again.\n\n\n                                              10\n\fcase plan. Dale testified that she had planned to request an order for a psychological\nassessment at the dispositional hearing, which is when the Agency typically made such a\nrequest. On cross-examination, Dale said she was not aware that Mother had obtained a\nmental health assessment on her own and was beginning mental health services at\nConsolidated Tribal Health.\n       Following Dale’s testimony, Laiwa was recalled as a witness. Based on her\nexperience, and after listening to the social worker’s testimony, Laiwa testified that she\nbelieved the Agency had made active efforts to avoid having to remove the children from\ntheir home. She also believed that the Agency’s efforts were consistent with customary\ntribal efforts in child rearing because “they provided all kinds of services for the family\nso that something like this would never occur. They were there to help them to look at\navenues of how to keep their families together. Because I understand, and I know, that\nthere were many, many referrals on this family before.”\n       On cross-examination, Laiwa testified that she understood “active efforts” under\nICWA to mean “working with our different agencies that provided the services that\nwould be helpful to an Indian family.”\n       Mother testified at the hearing that she was asking the court to return all four of\nthe children to live with her in the trailer, which now contained three beds and had been\ncleaned up since the children were removed. The trash on the property had also been\nremoved. Mother planned to obtain a garbage bin to dispose of garbage daily.\n       In May 2015, the Agency had given Mother a referral for a substance abuse\nassessment and evaluation, which she completed in June. The evaluator had\nrecommended that she seek treatment for cannabis dependency and the social worker had\ngiven her a referral to the “Intake Support” group; she had already attended three\nmeetings. The social worker had not yet given her any other referrals for services,\nalthough Mother, on her own, had begun a mental health evaluation the previous day.\n       At the conclusion of the evidence, Mother’s attorney argued that Laiwa, the ICWA\nexpert, “had no understanding of what active efforts are” and expressed doubt about how\nmuch weight her testimony should be given. The court addressed counsel’s concerns,\n\n\n                                             11\n\fstating: “Ms. Laiwa is quite modest. I think I’ve seen her testify as an ICWA expert in\nexcess of 50 times. She is a respected tribal elder. She’s worked with virtually all the\ntribes in our local area in Mendocino and Lake County. And while she may have used\nwords slightly different than the words in the statute, I know she understands what active\nefforts are.” The court acknowledged that “she needed to have her memory jogged with\nthe voluminous information that is in these reports and the file, and she did testify twice.\nNevertheless, I did find her expert testimony on the salient reports’ points required by\nICWA to be, based on the evidence, to be credible and to satisfy the intent of the act.”\n       The court then turned to the merits of the case and found that the parents had made\nsignificant efforts toward cleaning up the residence, that they had made efforts to get\ninvolved in services, and that they were “extraordinarily committed to their children.\nThey love their children.” The court nonetheless found that, in light of the state of the\nhome when the children were removed and the 25 referrals on the condition of the home\nover several years and its repeated deterioration, there was a concern that the residence\nwould again deteriorate into a condition that was unsafe for the children. The court also\nacknowledged that 13-year-old C.B. had been placed far away, in Sacramento, which was\nnot optimal. But the court believed that the Agency had made “extraordinary efforts to\ntry to find a closer placement” for her, including a relative placement. The court noted\nthat C.B. had exhibited “numerous and dangerous and difficult” behaviors since removal.\nBased on various concerns, including the possibility that the parents were using C.B. to\nmake hospital emergency room visits as part of drug-seeking behavior, the court was\nconcerned about the parents’ current ability to safely care for C.B. as well as the other\nchildren.\n       The court found that reasonable efforts had been made to eliminate the need to\nremove the children from the home and further found, by clear and convincing evidence,\nthat there was a substantial danger to the children’s physical and mental health and safety\nto return them to the home, and “that active efforts were made to provide remedial\nservices designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and these efforts proved\nunsuccessful.” The active efforts included a risk reduction plan and a safety plan prior to\n\n\n                                             12\n\fdetention, which Laiwa believed were the types of services and efforts she would expect\nto see prior to removal of the children from the home. The Agency had also consulted\nwith and complied with the wishes of the tribe regarding the children’s placement. The\ncourt ordered the Agency to continue assessing the viability of a relative placement and\nto attempt to find a placement closer to home for C.B. The court also ordered\nreunification services for the parents.\n       On July 23, 2015, Mother filed notices of appeal as to each of the four children.\n                                          DISCUSSION\n       Mother contends the juvenile court erred when it found that active efforts were\nmade to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\nbreakup of this Indian family, pursuant to ICWA.\n       “California courts have been inconsistent in the standards they apply to review a\nfinding that active efforts had been made to provide services and programs designed to\nprevent the breakup of an Indian family.” (C.F. v. Superior Court (2014) 230\nCal.App.4th 227, 238-239 (C.F.).) We agree with the conclusion of Division Four of this\nDistrict in C.F. that the substantial evidence test is the appropriate standard of review,\nespecially where, as here, a juvenile court’s finding on active efforts involves credibility\ndeterminations. (Id. at p. 239.)5\n       “Congress passed the ICWA in 1978 ‘to promote the stability and security of\nIndian tribes and families by establishing minimum standards for removal of Indian\nchildren from their families and placement of such children “in foster or adoptive homes\nwhich will reflect the unique values of Indian culture . . . .” ’ [Citing, inter alia, 25\nU.S.C. § 1902.] [¶] The ICWA’s procedural and substantive requirements must be\nfollowed in involuntary child custody proceedings when an ‘Indian child’ is involved.\n\n\n       5\n         Moreover, even if the standard of review for whether the services provided\nconstituted active efforts was de novo, as Mother argues it should be, we would reach the\nsame result. (See, e.g., In re K.B. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1275, 1286 [citing Alaska case\nlaw in concluding that, when services provided could be found in record, active efforts\ndetermination would be a mixed question of law and fact, reviewed independently].)\n\n\n                                               13\n\fAn ‘Indian child’ is defined by the ICWA as ‘any unmarried person who is under age\neighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in\nan Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.’ (25 U.S.C.\n§ 1903(4).)” (In re Jeffrey A. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1103, 1106.) In this case, it is\nundisputed that the four children are Indian children for purposes of ICWA.\n       Section 361.7 addresses standards for involuntary foster care placement of or\ntermination of parental rights over an Indian child, requiring a child welfare agency to\nprovide evidence “that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that\nthese efforts have proved unsuccessful.” (§ 361.7, subd. (a).) “What constitutes active\nefforts shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis,” and the efforts must “be made in a\nmanner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values, conditions, and\nway of life of the Indian child’s tribe. Active efforts shall utilize the available resources\nof the Indian child’s extended family, tribe, tribal and other Indian social service\nagencies, and individual Indian caregiver service providers.” (§ 361.7, subd. (b).) In\naddition, under subdivision (c) of section 361.7, “[n]o foster care placement or\nguardianship may be ordered in the proceeding in the absence of a determination,\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of a qualified expert\nwitness, . . . that the continued custody of the child by the parent . . . is likely to result in\nserious emotional or physical damage to the child.”6\n       Neither ICWA nor section 361.7 provides a definition of active efforts. (C.F.,\nsupra, 230 Cal.App.4th at p. 240; see 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d); cf. In re K.B., supra, 173\nCal.App.4th at p. 1287 [setting forth “a useful guideline” for distinguishing passive\n\n\n\n       6\n         Section 361.7, enacted in 2006, tracks the language of title 25 United States\nCode section 1912(d), which is part of ICWA and provides: “Any party seeking to effect\na foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State\nlaw shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services\nand rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that\nthese efforts have proved unsuccessful.”\n\n\n                                                14\n\fefforts from active efforts: “ ‘Passive efforts are where a plan is drawn up and the client\nmust develop his or her own resources towards bringing it to fruition. Active efforts . . .\n[are] where the state caseworker takes the client through the steps of the plan rather than\nrequiring that the plan be performed on its own’ ”].) However, recently updated\nguidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), which were intended to provide\nguidance to state courts and child welfare agencies implementing ICWA’s provisions,\nexplain that active efforts “are intended primarily to maintain and reunite an Indian child\nwith his or her family or tribal community and constitute more than [the] reasonable\nefforts” required in most dependency cases. (Department of the Interior, BIA, Guidelines\nfor State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10150, ¶ A.2,\n(Feb. 25, 2015) (Guidelines).)7\n\n\n       7\n         The Guidelines contain examples of active efforts, including: “(1) Engaging the\nIndian child, the Indian child’s parents, the Indian child’s extended family members, and\nthe Indian child’s custodian(s); [¶] (2) Taking steps necessary to keep siblings together;\n[¶] (3) Identifying appropriate services and helping the parents to overcome barriers,\nincluding actively assisting the parents in obtaining such services; [¶] (4) Identifying,\nnotifying, and inviting representatives of the Indian child’s tribe to participate; [¶] (5)\nConducting or causing to be conducted a diligent search for the Indian child’s extended\nfamily members for assistance and possible placement; [¶] (6) Taking into account the\nIndian child’s tribe’s prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life, and\nrequesting the assistance of representatives designated by the Indian child’s tribe with\nsubstantial knowledge of the prevailing social and cultural standards; [¶] (7) Offering\nand employing all available and culturally appropriate family preservation strategies; [¶]\n(8) Completing a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the Indian child’s\nfamily, with a focus on safe reunification as the most desirable goal; [¶] (9) Notifying\nand consulting with extended family members of the Indian child to provide family\nstructure and support for the Indian child, to assure cultural connections, and to serve as\nplacement resources for the Indian child; [¶] (10) Making arrangements to provide\nfamily interaction in the most natural setting that can ensure the Indian child’s safety\nduring any necessary removal; [¶] (11) Identifying community resources including\nhousing, financial, transportation, mental health, substance abuse, and peer support\nservices and actively assisting the Indian child’s parents or extended family in utilizing\nand accessing those resources; [¶] (12) Monitoring progress and participation in services;\n[¶] (13) Providing consideration of alternative ways of addressing the needs of the Indian\nchild’s parents and extended family, if services do not exist or if existing services are not\navailable; [¶] (14) Supporting regular visits and trial home visits of the Indian child\n\n                                             15\n\f        The updated Guidelines clarify that the active efforts requirement “begins from the\nmoment the possibility arises that an agency case or investigation may result in the need\nfor an Indian child to be placed outside the custody of either parent . . . in order to prevent\nremoval.” (Guidelines at p. 10152, ¶ B.1(a).) The party attempting to place an Indian\nchild in foster care must also “demonstrate to the court that prior to, and until the\ncommencement of, the proceeding, active efforts have been made to avoid the need to\nremove the Indian child from his or her parents or Indian custodians and show that those\nefforts have been unsuccessful.” (Guidelines at p. 10156, ¶ D.2(a).)\n        In the present case, Mother claims the Agency failed to make active efforts,\narguing in particular that the social worker “should have immediately referred Mother to\neither anger management or mental health assessments,” but did not do so. We agree\nwith the Agency that there is substantial evidence to support the juvenile court’s finding\nthat active efforts were made to prevent the breakup of this family. (See § 361.7, subd.\n(a).)\n        This evidence of active efforts includes the fact that the Agency began working\nwith the family in September 2014, developing a risk reduction plan to prevent removal.\nThen, in April 2015, when the Agency found the residence in worse condition than ever,\nit worked with the parents to create a safety plan to avoid detention of the children,\nplacing the children with their paternal grandparents while working on the family’s\nproblems. These were the types of efforts and services ICWA expert Lorraine Laiwa said\nshe would expect to see prior to removal of the children from the home.\n        The Agency only detained the children after the grandparents indicated they could\nno longer care for the children. The Agency had also consulted with the tribe regarding\nthe children’s placement, and both Laiwa and the tribe believed it was in the children’s\n\n\n\n\nduring any period of removal, consistent with the need to ensure the safety of the child;\nand [¶] (15) Providing post-reunification services and monitoring.” (Guidelines at\np. 10150, ¶ A.2.)\n\n\n                                              16\n\fbest interest to be placed in foster care until a relative placement could be found or until\nanother suitable placement, approved by the tribe, was identified.\n       Moreover, it was only during the April 30, 2015 visit to the residence that the\nAgency became aware of Mother’s potential drug, mental health, and anger issues. Since\ndetention, the Agency had worked with Mother to obtain a substance abuse assessment\nand drug testing, and had begun discussing treatment options with her; it had also\nreferred her to “In-take support services.” In addition, the Agency had arranged for two\nfamily team meetings, in May and June, in order to determine what services were needed\nand to develop a case plan. At the first meeting, the social worker had talked to Mother\nabout getting a psychological evaluation, to be able to tailor mental health services to her\nneeds, and also about the possibility of working with one particular Native American\ncounselor regarding anger management issues and another regarding mental health\nissues. Dale planned to request an order for a psychological evaluation at the\ndispositional hearing. At the second family team meeting, the social worker had\ndiscussed with Mother the possibility of her obtaining anger management services.\n       In addition, in May, the social worker had contacted Consolidated Tribal Health\nregarding the availability of culturally appropriate parenting, hygiene, and nutrition\nclasses, but was told that no such classes were available. Both the social worker and\nMother testified that Mother had been referred to the Intake Support group, which\napparently involved dealing with her anger and denial issues related to Agency\nintervention, and Mother testified that she had already attended three meetings. The\nsocial worker was presently trying to obtain resources and information for the parents\nfrom the outreach program coordinator at Consolidated Tribal Health. Also in May, C.B.\nhad begun receiving counseling services and the other children had been referred for\nmedical, mental health, and educational evaluations and services. The parents had\nregular supervised visitation with the children and the Agency had provided Mother and\nthe maternal grandmother—who was caring for the oldest son—with gas vouchers for\ntransportation to visitation.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       Mother argues that the Agency should have provided mental health and anger\nmanagement services earlier, before the children were removed from the home. It must\nbe remembered, however, that Mother’s possible mental health, anger, and substance\nabuse issues did not even come to light until the visit to the home at the end of April.\nAfter that, as previously discussed, the Agency did arrange for a substance abuse\nassessment and testing, began looking for culturally appropriate services, and held two\nfamily team meetings to begin to formulate a case plan, which would take effect\nfollowing the court’s order of reunification services at the dispositional hearing.8\n       Mother compares the facts of this case with In re K.B., supra, 173 Cal.App.4th\n1275 in which the social services agency had provided the mother with numerous\nservices to assist her in reunifying with her children and the appellate court had found\nthat the agency had made active efforts when it “provided the mother with the resources\nnecessary to achieve the goals of her case plan.” (Id. at p. 1287.) In K.B., however, the\nactive efforts determination was made following termination of parental rights, after\nmany months of reunification services. Here, on the other hand, only two months had\nelapsed between detention and the dispositional hearing, and the Agency had been\nactively working with Mother to develop a case plan and arrange for services relevant to\nMother’s substance abuse, mental health, and anger issues. Hence, In re K.B. and the\npresent case are not comparable.\n       Finally, ICWA expert Laiwa believed the Agency had made active efforts to avoid\nhaving to remove the children from their home and that the Agency’s efforts were\nconsistent with customary tribal efforts in child rearing. Although Mother asserts that we\nshould not give much weight to Laiwa’s testimony, arguing that she did not understand\nthe meaning of active efforts under ICWA, the court found otherwise. The court stated\nthat Laiwa is a respected tribal elder who had worked with virtually all of the tribes in the\n\n\n\n       8\n        Mother’s proposed case plan included, inter alia, participating in a psychological\nevaluation and following all treatment recommendations, and participating in culturally\nappropriate anger management and parenting education programs.\n\n\n                                             18\n\farea; the court had seen her testify as an ICWA expert more than 50 times. While\nacknowledging that she may not have used the exact words of the statute and did need to\nhave her memory jogged “with the voluminous information” in the case files, the court\nfound that her testimony was credible and satisfied the intent of ICWA.\n       In light of all of the evidence in the record of the Agency’s efforts, both before and\nafter detention, as well as Laiwa’s expert opinion that the Agency had satisfied ICWA’s\nactive efforts requirement, we conclude substantial evidence supports the juvenile court’s\nfinding that the Agency made active efforts in the circumstances of this case “to provide\nremedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the\nIndian family,” but that these efforts had been unsuccessful.

(Mother), mother of C.B., N.B., W.B., and K.B., appeals from the\njuvenile court’s orders declaring her four children dependents of the juvenile court,\npursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivisions (b) and (c),1 and\nremoving them from Mother’s custody, pursuant to section 361, subdivision (c)(1). On\nappeal, Mother contends the juvenile court erred in finding that active efforts were made\nto provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup\nof this Indian family, pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).2 We shall\naffirm the juvenile court’s orders.\n\n\n\n         1\n        All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n         2\n             The children’s presumed father (Father) is not a party to this appeal.\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       On April 30, 2015, the juvenile court granted the application of the Mendocino\nCounty Health and Human Services Agency (Agency) for an order authorizing entry into\nMother’s family home to conduct a child welfare investigation, pursuant to section 328,\nto determine whether child welfare services should be offered to the family and whether\njuvenile court proceedings should be commenced. In its application, the Agency reported\nthat, between 2008 and 2013, the Agency had received 26 referrals for the family, which\nhad been minimally investigated due to the noncooperation of Mother. Then, in\nSeptember 2014, the Agency received two referrals from mandated reporters alleging\ngeneral neglect of the children, including poor hygiene and substandard and unsafe living\nconditions. These allegations were found to be inconclusive and the Agency had\n“worked creatively” with Mother on a voluntary basis “to put rudimentary interventions,\nsupports and services in place.” Beginning on March 24, 2015, however, the Agency had\nreceived three more referrals alleging general neglect of the children; poor hygiene and\nat-risk behaviors of then 12-year-old C.B.; and worsened living conditions for the family,\nwhich lived outside of the city grid, reportedly on tribal family land. On April 29, 2015,\nthe social worker and two supervisors went to the residence and saw that the amount of\nrefuse in the yard appeared to have tripled since the social worker’s last visit in\nDecember 2014. There was also a pungent odor of urine, feces, and refuse. The children\nand Mother were wearing filthy clothing and the children had layers of embedded dirt on\nthem. During the visit, Mother was uncooperative, defensive, and hostile. She refused to\nallow the social worker to enter the family’s trailer home.\n       On May 6, 2015, the Agency filed an original petition alleging, pursuant to section\n300, subdivision (b), that the parents had been unable to recognize and provide for the\nchildren’s most basic needs, and that Mother was unable to put the best interests of the\nchildren first, due to her anger and mental health issues. The petition noted that the social\nworker and her supervisor had gone to the residence with law enforcement on April 30,\n2015, where they observed the children to be filthy and covered with dirt. During the\nApril 30 visit to the property, Mother had “continuously berated her children in a harsh\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand controlling manner to follow her directions as she exhibited hostile, confrontational,\ndefiant, and angry behaviors in their presence.” The petition contained allegations that\nFather had a history of drug dealing and methamphetamine use, as well as daily use of\nmarijuana, which impaired his ability to adequately care for and supervise the children.\n       The petition further alleged that the parents had been unwilling and unable to\nmaintain a safe, sanitary living environment for the children. During the April 30 visit,\nthere had been an overwhelming stench and the social worker had seen piles of household\nrefuse, including rotting food, dirty diapers, and other garbage strewn throughout the\nresidence, an 18-foot travel trailer in which the family was living,. The trailer appeared\nuninhabitable due to filth, wear and tear, and an unsanitary interior. The stove did not\nappear to work and there was no running water in the trailer. There were two beds for six\npeople. Some of the children slept on the floor, on a pile of dirty clothes and blankets.\nThere was also a shoe box sized container filled with marijuana in a cupboard in the\nliving area of the trailer. Garbage was also strewn around the property and there was a\nfive by four foot pile of smoldering household refuse burning within around 10 feet of the\ntrailer. The petition stated that “the condition of the trailer and the property did not meet\nminimum community (tribal) standards of cleanliness.”\n       The petition also alleged, under subdivision (c) of section 300, that “[t]he ongoing\ncontrolling and manipulative behaviors of the mother around her children, together with\nthe absence of healthy parenting by either parent,” placed the children at risk of physical\nand emotional harm. During much of the three-and-one-half-hour visit on April 30,\n2015, Mother continuously berated her children and kept her three youngest children\nlocked inside her van with her, with only the driver side window open approximately six\ninches. The outside temperature was hot and the three children could be heard screaming\nand crying. Seven-year-old N.B. later said he was upset because Mother had told the\nchildren that the Agency was trying to take them away from her.\n       In the report for the detention hearing, filed on May 7, 2015, the social worker\nrelated that, in addition to the serious deterioration of the property and major concerns\nregarding the ongoing neglect of the children, “there are also concerns over the mental\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhealth and anger issues of the mother that appear to severely impair her ability to provide\nfor the basic needs and healthy functioning of her children, with [C.B.] also requiring\nmental health assessment.” The social worker also reported that the older children did\nnot appear to be regularly attending school.\n       During the April 30, 2015 visit to the property, Father appeared to be under the\ninfluence, and seemed paralyzed at times and uncertain about speaking to the social\nworker unless instructed to do so by Mother. During that visit, it took hours to finally\nreach agreement on an interim safety plan, due to Mother’s lack of cooperation and\nvolatile, erratic behavior. Under the plan, the children went to stay temporarily with their\npaternal grandmother, although five days later the grandmother informed the social\nworker that she could no longer care for the children because she was unable to manage\ntheir behaviors. The children were therefore detained by the Agency.\n       Regarding Native American status, Mother had told the social worker that she is\naffiliated with the Yokayo Rancheria Tribe, which she said is “ ‘no longer federally\nrecognized.’ ” Father stated that he has no Native American heritage.\n       In an addendum to the detention report, filed on May 11, 2015, the social worker\nreported that a fifth child, 15 years old, had been in the care of his maternal grandmother\nfrom the age of six or seven, and would remain in her care. The social worker also\nreported that Mother and Father had both voluntarily agreed to submit to a random drug\ntest on May 7. Mother had preliminarily tested positive for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)\nand methamphetamine, while Father never arrived at the Agency for testing.\n       Mother testified at the May 12, 2015 detention hearing that she was upset when\nthe social worker and law enforcement came to her property on April 30, but she denied\nyelling or barricading her children in her van. Since the children were removed, Mother\nhad taken steps to clean up the property, which is owned by the Yokayo Tribe of Indians,\nincluding removing the trash from the trailer and adding another bed. The trash outside\nthe trailer had also been removed. There had always been a working generator and\naccess to running water on the property. There was also a port-a-potty. The children\nbathed every other day at the nearby house of Mother’s cousin. The family was in the\n\n\n                                               4\n\fprocess of fixing up another house on their property, and Mother’s grandmother had said\nthat Mother and the youngest children could stay with her until the new house was\nlivable. Mother did not believe the condition of the property prior to the cleanup was\nhazardous to the health or safety of the children. N.B. was not attending school due to a\nmedical issue with his eardrum and C.B. had been attending school “until an incident a\nfew months back.” Mother also testified that she and Father used marijuana.\n       Social worker Jannee Dale also testified at the hearing. She and other Agency\nstaff had visited the family’s property on April 29, 2015, after receiving three referrals\nabout the condition of the property and incidents involving the oldest child, C.B., who\napparently was not attending school. Dale had arranged for tribal representative Lorraine\nLaiwa to meet her at the property, but Laiwa had arrived early and left before Dale\narrived. Once there, Mother stepped between Dale and the trailer and refused to let her\nsee inside the trailer or talk to the children.\n       The following day, the Agency obtained a warrant and Dale returned to the\nproperty with police, who served the warrant. During the three-and-one-half-hour visit,\nthe children were primarily inside the van, but there were a few points when they were\nnot. Dale described the garbage, the fire, and the strong smell of garbage, smoke, and\nburning plastic on the property. Mother was very upset and yelled a lot, and tried to call\nLaiwa several times during the visit. Ultimately, the Agency and the parents worked out\na safety plan that allowed the paternal grandmother to care for the children, instead of the\nAgency detaining them.\n       There had been a total of 29 or 30 referrals for the property since 2008. The\nAgency had previously worked with the family three times to attempt to clean up the\nproperty. Dale believed the living conditions were hazardous in April 2015, because\nthere were toxic fumes from burning plastic; there was rotten food throughout the trailer;\nthere was a bottle of apple juice on the ground right next to bottles of Pinesol, within\nreach of the children; and there were soiled diapers all over the property. There were also\nconcerns about the older children’s school attendance. Dale did not believe it was safe to\nreturn the children to Mother, even assuming the property had been cleaned up. She\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fbelieved the family needed services, given that she had already worked with them for\nthree months the prior year, and yet the problems “continue[d] to happen over and over\nagain.” Dale was also concerned about mother’s emotional stability and wanted to\nascertain whether her issues could be addressed by a doctor or therapist. Another\nconcern involved the parents’ substance abuse.\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court reaffirmed a prior temporary\ndetention order, due to a longstanding problem with the home not meeting minimum\ncommunity standards and the probability that conditions, even if they had improved\ntemporarily, might deteriorate again and present a risk to the children.\n       In the jurisdiction report filed on June 2, 2015, the social worker reported that the\nchildren were placed together in foster care. C.B. had had 25 unexcused absences from\nschool between January and March 23, 2015. C.B. was mimicking Mother’s behaviors in\nher placement, including disregard for rules, bullying, and trying to get the other children\nto follow her defiant, disrespectful behaviors. C.B. was receiving counseling services\nand the other three children had been referred for medical, mental health, and educational\nevaluations and services.\n       Mother had tested positive for THC five times in May. The social worker had\nreferred the parents for substance abuse treatment and assessment and to “In-take support\nservices.” In May, the social worker had contacted Consolidated Tribal Health to inquire\nabout the availability of culturally appropriate parenting, hygiene, and nutrition classes,\nbut was informed no such classes were available. She was currently trying to obtain\nresources and information for the parents from the outreach program coordinator at\nConsolidated Tribal Health. The parents had weekly supervised visitation with the four\nchildren removed from their care, as well as with their older son. The Agency had also\nprovided Mother and the maternal grandmother with gas vouchers for transportation to\nvisitation.\n       On June 17, 2015, the Agency filed an amended petition with additional\nallegations under section 300, subdivision (b)—that Mother had a current substance\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fabuse problem—and subdivision (c)—that N.B. was exhibiting behaviors that indicated\nemotional damage.\n       At the June 18, 2015 jurisdictional hearing, both parents waived their rights, the\nparties agreed to language for a second amended petition, and the court sustained the\nallegations of the amended petition, which dismissed the allegations under section 300,\nsubdivision (b)(4) regarding the events observed at the family residence by Agency\npersonnel on April 30, 2015.\n       At the conclusion of a June 25, 2015 hearing regarding an out of county placement\nfor the oldest daughter, C.B., the juvenile court stated that there had been an attempt to\nplace C.B. with the paternal grandmother, but, when the grandmother could not deal with\nC.B.’s behaviors, she had been placed in a local facility where there were issues\nregarding her interactions with other children and her self-injurious behavior. The court\nfound that the social worker had diligently looked for a closer facility for C.B. that would\nprovide a higher level of safety and supervision, but she was not able to find an\nappropriate placement that was closer than the facility in which she had been placed,\nwhich was a three-hour drive from her parents.\n       In the disposition report filed on July 9, 2015, the social worker reported that\nMother had tested positive for THC on several occasions in June; on June 24, she had\nobtained a medical marijuana recommendation. Also in June, Mother had participated in\nan alcohol and drug assessment, and had been determined to be in need of treatment for\ncannabis abuse. She was being referred to a culturally appropriate treatment program at\nConsolidated Tribal Health.\n       During a family team meeting on June 29, 2015, attended by Agency staff, Mother\nand the maternal grandmother, case plans were developed for the family, which contained\nservice objectives for Mother related to meeting the children’s physical, emotional,\nmedical, and educational needs; maintaining a relationship with the children through\nvisitation; staying sober and showing the ability to live free from alcohol and drug\ndependency; consistently, appropriately, and adequately parenting the children; and\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fcomplying with medical or psychological treatment.3 Two days later, the social worker\nmet with both parents to go over and sign the case plans.\n       The three younger children were not placed together in foster care due to the lack\nof available foster homes. Mother had demonstrated that she was invested in having her\nchildren returned to her, attending every visit, attending two family team meetings, and\nmaking substantial progress in cleaning the property. She still needed much support,\nhowever, because, as the social worker explained, “this is not merely a situation of a dirty\nhouse. This is a situation with a multitude of neglect [sic] of these four children who are\ntoo young to understand and have been segregated from society in mom’s effort to\nprotect her children from ‘outsiders.’ These children are seriously delayed in their\nacademic as well as emotional and social skills.”\n       The Agency recommended continued out of home placement for the children and\nreunification services for the parents.\n       At the July 15, 2015 dispositional hearing, Lorraine Laiwa testified that she had\nbeen the director and case manager for the Indian Child and Family Preservation, a\nconsortium of four tribes, for 20 years. She had been qualified as an Indian expert\nwitness in Mendocino County Juvenile Dependency Court 30 to 40 times. Laiwa had\nworked with every tribe in Mendocino and Lake Counties as an ICWA worker, including\none year for the Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians (Big Valley Tribe). She was familiar\nwith the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community with respect to\nchild rearing practices. Laiwa was asked to be an expert in this case by the Agency and\nthe Big Valley Tribe. She had reviewed the petition and all of the reports filed in this\ncase. She also had spoken about the case with the social worker, with Big Valley tribal\nrepresentatives, and with the parents.\n\n\n       3\n         Proposed services for Mother included visitation support, participation in a\nsubstance abuse assessment and completion of all treatment recommendations, drug\ntesting, participation in culturally appropriate anger management and parenting education\nprograms, and participation in a psychological evaluation and completion of all treatment\nrecommendations.\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       Although the family’s property had been cleaned up when Laiwa was there a few\nweeks earlier, she did not believe the children should be returned to the home until more\nwas done to make it a safe place for them. There was another property the tribe was\nconsidering for the family, but the house there was old and needed a great deal of work.\nOther issues that concerned Laiwa included Mother’s positive drug test for\nmethamphetamine. Father had said he was taking medication that “was making [him]\nfeel out of it,” and Laiwa believed there might be a connection between substance use,\nprescription medication, and the condition of the home.\n       Laiwa had learned that Mother and her oldest daughter, C.B., were eligible for Big\nValley tribal membership. She did not know about the eligibility of the rest of the\nchildren.\n       In the circumstances of the case, Laiwa believed that the parents’ continued\ncustody of their children at present was likely to result in serious emotional and physical\ndamage to the children. She had spoken with the tribal representative and one of the\ncouncil members, and they also believed it would be detrimental to return the children\n“until things are fixed up for the family and a more permanent home for them [sic].”\nBoth Laiwa and the tribe believed it was in the children’s best interest to be placed in\nfoster care until a relative placement could be found or until another suitable placement,\napproved by the tribe, was found.\n       On cross-examination, Laiwa testified that she had met with Mother about four\ntimes since becoming involved with the case, and Laiwa believed Mother “loves her\nchildren very much.” She did not know what remedial services the Agency had offered\nthe family.\n       Nancy Hernandez, ICWA coordinator for the Big Valley Tribe and social services\ncoordinator for four Rancherias, testified that, of the four children, C.B. was an enrolled\nmember of the Big Valley Tribe and the other three children—N.B., W.B., and K.B.—\nwere eligible members because Mother was an enrolled member.\n       The social worker on the case, Jannee Dale, again testified that she had worked\nwith the family starting in September 2014, and, with the participation of Laiwa, had put\n\n\n                                             9\n\fin place a “risk reduction plan,” which was a written agreement between the Agency and\nthe parents that attempted to mitigate the risks to the children. Dale had inquired at that\ntime about tribal resources that might be available for the family but, because their tribe\nis not federally recognized, there was no assistance available. She was able to get them\nfood and clothing vouchers. She had also worked with Mother about trying to request an\nindividualized education program for N.B., who was extremely sensitive to noise.\nSubsequently, in March 2015, Agency staff went to the home and saw that it was in\nworse condition than it had been initially.\n       In April 2015, the Agency prepared a safety plan for the children, which involved\nthem staying with the paternal grandparents while the Agency worked with the family to\ntry to alleviate their problems, including the hazardous conditions at the residence,\nMother’s hostility and possible mental health issues, and Father’s being under the\ninfluence. The purpose of the safety plan was to avoid having to detain the children\nwhile dealing with the family’s issues. Shortly thereafter, the grandmother said she could\nnot take care of the children due to their behavioral issues, which were affecting her\nhealth. The Agency therefore placed the children in foster care.\n       Since the children were detained, Mother had been cooperating with the Agency in\nterms of drug testing and participating in a substance abuse assessment.4 The Agency\nhad also begun discussions with her about treatment options. At the first of two family\nteam meetings in mid- to late May 2015, the social worker had talked with Mother about\ngetting a psychological evaluation to be able to properly tailor mental health services, and\nhad discussed with her the possibility of working with a particular family counselor\nregarding anger management issues and another counselor regarding mental health\nissues. At the second family team meeting on June 29, the social worker had discussed\nwith Mother the possibility of her obtaining anger management services. The purpose of\nthe family team meetings was to determine what services were needed and to develop the\n\n\n       4\n       After her first positive drug test for methamphetamine, Mother had tested\napproximately a dozen times, and had not tested positive for methamphetamine again.\n\n\n                                              10\n\fcase plan. Dale testified that she had planned to request an order for a psychological\nassessment at the dispositional hearing, which is when the Agency typically made such a\nrequest. On cross-examination, Dale said she was not aware that Mother had obtained a\nmental health assessment on her own and was beginning mental health services at\nConsolidated Tribal Health.\n       Following Dale’s testimony, Laiwa was recalled as a witness. Based on her\nexperience, and after listening to the social worker’s testimony, Laiwa testified that she\nbelieved the Agency had made active efforts to avoid having to remove the children from\ntheir home. She also believed that the Agency’s efforts were consistent with customary\ntribal efforts in child rearing because “they provided all kinds of services for the family\nso that something like this would never occur. They were there to help them to look at\navenues of how to keep their families together. Because I understand, and I know, that\nthere were many, many referrals on this family before.”\n       On cross-examination, Laiwa testified that she understood “active efforts” under\nICWA to mean “working with our different agencies that provided the services that\nwould be helpful to an Indian family.”\n       Mother testified at the hearing that she was asking the court to return all four of\nthe children to live with her in the trailer, which now contained three beds and had been\ncleaned up since the children were removed. The trash on the property had also been\nremoved. Mother planned to obtain a garbage bin to dispose of garbage daily.\n       In May 2015, the Agency had given Mother a referral for a substance abuse\nassessment and evaluation, which she completed in June. The evaluator had\nrecommended that she seek treatment for cannabis dependency and the social worker had\ngiven her a referral to the “Intake Support” group; she had already attended three\nmeetings. The social worker had not yet given her any other referrals for services,\nalthough Mother, on her own, had begun a mental health evaluation the previous day.\n       At the conclusion of the evidence, Mother’s attorney argued that Laiwa, the ICWA\nexpert, “had no understanding of what active efforts are” and expressed doubt about how\nmuch weight her testimony should be given. The court addressed counsel’s concerns,\n\n\n                                             11\n\fstating: “Ms. Laiwa is quite modest. I think I’ve seen her testify as an ICWA expert in\nexcess of 50 times. She is a respected tribal elder. She’s worked with virtually all the\ntribes in our local area in Mendocino and Lake County. And while she may have used\nwords slightly different than the words in the statute, I know she understands what active\nefforts are.” The court acknowledged that “she needed to have her memory jogged with\nthe voluminous information that is in these reports and the file, and she did testify twice.\nNevertheless, I did find her expert testimony on the salient reports’ points required by\nICWA to be, based on the evidence, to be credible and to satisfy the intent of the act.”\n       The court then turned to the merits of the case and found that the parents had made\nsignificant efforts toward cleaning up the residence, that they had made efforts to get\ninvolved in services, and that they were “extraordinarily committed to their children.\nThey love their children.” The court nonetheless found that, in light of the state of the\nhome when the children were removed and the 25 referrals on the condition of the home\nover several years and its repeated deterioration, there was a concern that the residence\nwould again deteriorate into a condition that was unsafe for the children. The court also\nacknowledged that 13-year-old C.B. had been placed far away, in Sacramento, which was\nnot optimal. But the court believed that the Agency had made “extraordinary efforts to\ntry to find a closer placement” for her, including a relative placement. The court noted\nthat C.B. had exhibited “numerous and dangerous and difficult” behaviors since removal.\nBased on various concerns, including the possibility that the parents were using C.B. to\nmake hospital emergency room visits as part of drug-seeking behavior, the court was\nconcerned about the parents’ current ability to safely care for C.B. as well as the other\nchildren.\n       The court found that reasonable efforts had been made to eliminate the need to\nremove the children from the home and further found, by clear and convincing evidence,\nthat there was a substantial danger to the children’s physical and mental health and safety\nto return them to the home, and “that active efforts were made to provide remedial\nservices designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and these efforts proved\nunsuccessful.” The active efforts included a risk reduction plan and a safety plan prior to\n\n\n                                             12\n\fdetention, which Laiwa believed were the types of services and efforts she would expect\nto see prior to removal of the children from the home. The Agency had also consulted\nwith and complied with the wishes of the tribe regarding the children’s placement. The\ncourt ordered the Agency to continue assessing the viability of a relative placement and\nto attempt to find a placement closer to home for C.B. The court also ordered\nreunification services for the parents.\n       On July 23, 2015, Mother filed notices of appeal as to each of the four children.\n                                          DISCUSSION\n       Mother contends the juvenile court erred when it found that active efforts were\nmade to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\nbreakup of this Indian family, pursuant to ICWA.\n       “California courts have been inconsistent in the standards they apply to review a\nfinding that active efforts had been made to provide services and programs designed to\nprevent the breakup of an Indian family.” (C.F. v. Superior Court (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 238-239 (C.F.).) We agree with the conclusion of Division Four of this\nDistrict in C.F. that the substantial evidence test is the appropriate standard of review,\nespecially where, as here, a juvenile court’s finding on active efforts involves credibility\ndeterminations. (Id. at p. 239.)5\n       “Congress passed the ICWA in 1978 ‘to promote the stability and security of\nIndian tribes and families by establishing minimum standards for removal of Indian\nchildren from their families and placement of such children “in foster or adoptive homes\nwhich will reflect the unique values of Indian culture . . . .” ’ [Citing, inter alia, 25\nU.S.C. § 1902.] [¶] The ICWA’s procedural and substantive requirements must be\nfollowed in involuntary child custody proceedings when an ‘Indian child’ is involved.\n\n\n       5\n         Moreover, even if the standard of review for whether the services provided\nconstituted active efforts was de novo, as Mother argues it should be, we would reach the\nsame result. (See, e.g., In re K.B. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In this case, it is\nundisputed that the four children are Indian children for purposes of ICWA.\n       Section 361.7 addresses standards for involuntary foster care placement of or\ntermination of parental rights over an Indian child, requiring a child welfare agency to\nprovide evidence “that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that\nthese efforts have proved unsuccessful.” (§ 361.7, subd. (a).) “What constitutes active\nefforts shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis,” and the efforts must “be made in a\nmanner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values, conditions, and\nway of life of the Indian child’s tribe. Active efforts shall utilize the available resources\nof the Indian child’s extended family, tribe, tribal and other Indian social service\nagencies, and individual Indian caregiver service providers.” (§ 361.7, subd. (b).) In\naddition, under subdivision (c) of section 361.7, “[n]o foster care placement or\nguardianship may be ordered in the proceeding in the absence of a determination,\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of a qualified expert\nwitness, . . . that the continued custody of the child by the parent . . . is likely to result in\nserious emotional or physical damage to the child.”6\n       Neither ICWA nor section 361.7 provides a definition of active efforts. (C.F.,\nsupra, 230 Cal.App.4th at p. 240; see 25 U.S.C. § 1912(d); cf. In re K.B., supra, 173\nCal.App.4th at p. 1287 [setting forth “a useful guideline” for distinguishing passive\n\n\n\n       6\n         Section 361.7, enacted in 2006, tracks the language of title 25 United States\nCode section 1912(d), which is part of ICWA and provides: “Any party seeking to effect\na foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State\nlaw shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services\nand rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that\nthese efforts have proved unsuccessful.”\n\n\n                                                14\n\fefforts from active efforts: “ ‘Passive efforts are where a plan is drawn up and the client\nmust develop his or her own resources towards bringing it to fruition. Active efforts . . .\n[are] where the state caseworker takes the client through the steps of the plan rather than\nrequiring that the plan be performed on its own’ ”].) However, recently updated\nguidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), which were intended to provide\nguidance to state courts and child welfare agencies implementing ICWA’s provisions,\nexplain that active efforts “are intended primarily to maintain and reunite an Indian child\nwith his or her family or tribal community and constitute more than [the] reasonable\nefforts” required in most dependency cases. (Department of the Interior, BIA, Guidelines\nfor State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10150, ¶ A.2,\n(Feb. 25, 2015) (Guidelines).)7\n\n\n       7\n         The Guidelines contain examples of active efforts, including: “(1) Engaging the\nIndian child, the Indian child’s parents, the Indian child’s extended family members, and\nthe Indian child’s custodian(s); [¶] (2) Taking steps necessary to keep siblings together;\n[¶] (3) Identifying appropriate services and helping the parents to overcome barriers,\nincluding actively assisting the parents in obtaining such services; [¶] (4) Identifying,\nnotifying, and inviting representatives of the Indian child’s tribe to participate; [¶] (5)\nConducting or causing to be conducted a diligent search for the Indian child’s extended\nfamily members for assistance and possible placement; [¶] (6) Taking into account the\nIndian child’s tribe’s prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life, and\nrequesting the assistance of representatives designated by the Indian child’s tribe with\nsubstantial knowledge of the prevailing social and cultural standards; [¶] (7) Offering\nand employing all available and culturally appropriate family preservation strategies; [¶]\n(8) Completing a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the Indian child’s\nfamily, with a focus on safe reunification as the most desirable goal; [¶] (9) Notifying\nand consulting with extended family members of the Indian child to provide family\nstructure and support for the Indian child, to assure cultural connections, and to serve as\nplacement resources for the Indian child; [¶] (10) Making arrangements to provide\nfamily interaction in the most natural setting that can ensure the Indian child’s safety\nduring any necessary removal; [¶] (11) Identifying community resources including\nhousing, financial, transportation, mental health, substance abuse, and peer support\nservices and actively assisting the Indian child’s parents or extended family in utilizing\nand accessing those resources; [¶] (12) Monitoring progress and participation in services;\n[¶] (13) Providing consideration of alternative ways of addressing the needs of the Indian\nchild’s parents and extended family, if services do not exist or if existing services are not\navailable; [¶] (14) Supporting regular visits and trial home visits of the Indian child\n\n                                             15\n\f        The updated Guidelines clarify that the active efforts requirement “begins from the\nmoment the possibility arises that an agency case or investigation may result in the need\nfor an Indian child to be placed outside the custody of either parent . . . in order to prevent\nremoval.” (Guidelines at p. 10152, ¶ B.1(a).) The party attempting to place an Indian\nchild in foster care must also “demonstrate to the court that prior to, and until the\ncommencement of, the proceeding, active efforts have been made to avoid the need to\nremove the Indian child from his or her parents or Indian custodians and show that those\nefforts have been unsuccessful.” (Guidelines at p. 10156, ¶ D.2(a).)\n        In the present case, Mother claims the Agency failed to make active efforts,\narguing in particular that the social worker “should have immediately referred Mother to\neither anger management or mental health assessments,” but did not do so. We agree\nwith the Agency that there is substantial evidence to support the juvenile court’s finding\nthat active efforts were made to prevent the breakup of this family. (See § 361.7, subd.\n(a).)\n        This evidence of active efforts includes the fact that the Agency began working\nwith the family in September 2014, developing a risk reduction plan to prevent removal.\nThen, in April 2015, when the Agency found the residence in worse condition than ever,\nit worked with the parents to create a safety plan to avoid detention of the children,\nplacing the children with their paternal grandparents while working on the family’s\nproblems. These were the types of efforts and services ICWA expert Lorraine Laiwa said\nshe would expect to see prior to removal of the children from the home.\n        The Agency only detained the children after the grandparents indicated they could\nno longer care for the children. The Agency had also consulted with the tribe regarding\nthe children’s placement, and both Laiwa and the tribe believed it was in the children’s\n\n\n\n\nduring any period of removal, consistent with the need to ensure the safety of the child;\nand [¶] (15) Providing post-reunification services and monitoring.” (Guidelines at\np. 10150, ¶ A.2.)\n\n\n                                              16\n\fbest interest to be placed in foster care until a relative placement could be found or until\nanother suitable placement, approved by the tribe, was identified.\n       Moreover, it was only during the April 30, 2015 visit to the residence that the\nAgency became aware of Mother’s potential drug, mental health, and anger issues. Since\ndetention, the Agency had worked with Mother to obtain a substance abuse assessment\nand drug testing, and had begun discussing treatment options with her; it had also\nreferred her to “In-take support services.” In addition, the Agency had arranged for two\nfamily team meetings, in May and June, in order to determine what services were needed\nand to develop a case plan. At the first meeting, the social worker had talked to Mother\nabout getting a psychological evaluation, to be able to tailor mental health services to her\nneeds, and also about the possibility of working with one particular Native American\ncounselor regarding anger management issues and another regarding mental health\nissues. Dale planned to request an order for a psychological evaluation at the\ndispositional hearing. At the second family team meeting, the social worker had\ndiscussed with Mother the possibility of her obtaining anger management services.\n       In addition, in May, the social worker had contacted Consolidated Tribal Health\nregarding the availability of culturally appropriate parenting, hygiene, and nutrition\nclasses, but was told that no such classes were available. Both the social worker and\nMother testified that Mother had been referred to the Intake Support group, which\napparently involved dealing with her anger and denial issues related to Agency\nintervention, and Mother testified that she had already attended three meetings. The\nsocial worker was presently trying to obtain resources and information for the parents\nfrom the outreach program coordinator at Consolidated Tribal Health. Also in May, C.B.\nhad begun receiving counseling services and the other children had been referred for\nmedical, mental health, and educational evaluations and services. The parents had\nregular supervised visitation with the children and the Agency had provided Mother and\nthe maternal grandmother—who was caring for the oldest son—with gas vouchers for\ntransportation to visitation.\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f       Mother argues that the Agency should have provided mental health and anger\nmanagement services earlier, before the children were removed from the home. It must\nbe remembered, however, that Mother’s possible mental health, anger, and substance\nabuse issues did not even come to light until the visit to the home at the end of April.\nAfter that, as previously discussed, the Agency did arrange for a substance abuse\nassessment and testing, began looking for culturally appropriate services, and held two\nfamily team meetings to begin to formulate a case plan, which would take effect\nfollowing the court’s order of reunification services at the dispositional hearing.8\n       Mother compares the facts of this case with In re K.B., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1275</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> in which the social services agency had provided the mother with numerous\nservices to assist her in reunifying with her children and the appellate court had found\nthat the agency had made active efforts when it “provided the mother with the resources\nnecessary to achieve the goals of her case plan.” (Id. at p. 1287.) In K.B., however, the\nactive efforts determination was made following termination of parental rights, after\nmany months of reunification services. Here, on the other hand, only two months had\nelapsed between detention and the dispositional hearing, and the Agency had been\nactively working with Mother to develop a case plan and arrange for services relevant to\nMother’s substance abuse, mental health, and anger issues. Hence, In re K.B. and the\npresent case are not comparable.\n       Finally, ICWA expert Laiwa believed the Agency had made active efforts to avoid\nhaving to remove the children from their home and that the Agency’s efforts were\nconsistent with customary tribal efforts in child rearing. Although Mother asserts that we\nshould not give much weight to Laiwa’s testimony, arguing that she did not understand\nthe meaning of active efforts under ICWA, the court found otherwise. The court stated\nthat Laiwa is a respected tribal elder who had worked with virtually all of the tribes in the\n\n\n\n       8\n        Mother’s proposed case plan included, inter alia, participating in a psychological\nevaluation and following all treatment recommendations, and participating in culturally\nappropriate anger management and parenting education programs.\n\n\n                                             18\n\farea; the court had seen her testify as an ICWA expert more than 50 times. While\nacknowledging that she may not have used the exact words of the statute and did need to\nhave her memory jogged “with the voluminous information” in the case files, the court\nfound that her testimony was credible and satisfied the intent of ICWA.\n       In light of all of the evidence in the record of the Agency’s efforts, both before and\nafter detention, as well as Laiwa’s expert opinion that the Agency had satisfied ICWA’s\nactive efforts requirement, we conclude substantial evidence supports the juvenile court’s\nfinding that the Agency made active efforts in the circumstances of this case “to provide\nremedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the\nIndian family,” but that these efforts had been unsuccessful.
