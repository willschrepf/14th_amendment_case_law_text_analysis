Defendants moved for summary judgment, and the district\ncourt dismissed all claims except an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim against\n\fLieutenant Jeff Gutzmer, who authorized use of the restraint board. Gutzmer appeals\nthe denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Reviewing that issue\nde novo and the facts in the light most favorable to Jackson, we reverse. See Burns\nv. Eaton, 752 F.3d 1136, 1138 (8th Cir. 2014).\n\n                                           I.\n\n       A. Convicted of arson, Jackson was admitted to the Minnesota Correctional\nFacility in St. Cloud in November 2012. An initial psychiatric assessment reflected\nhis self-reported history of 28 suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, hearing voices to\nharm himself and others, cutting himself, depression, and anxiety. The assessment\nalso related violent episodes including stabbing his school principal with scissors and\nstriking his fiancé with a bottle. The examining doctor diagnosed Jackson with\ndepression, borderline personality disorder with possible dissociative episodes, and\nalcohol dependency.\n\n       During Jackson’s first week at the St. Cloud facility, he violated multiple rules,\nincluding threatening others, possessing a weapon, and assaulting correctional staff.\nThe weapon possession violation was a major infraction. Jackson also reported that\nvoices were telling him to slit his cellmate’s throat. The Minnesota Department of\nCorrections (DOC) transferred Jackson to the Oak Park Heights maximum security\nfacility, placed him on disciplinary segregation status, and assigned him to the\nAdministrative Control Unit (ACU). Designed to protect inmates from themselves\nand others and to maintain orderly prison operations, the ACU is the most secure\nprison living unit in Minnesota. ACU inmates are confined to their cells for twenty-\nthree hours per day and allowed only limited personal property. To receive medical\nattention, an ACU inmate can submit a written “kite” for a medical visit; for\nemergency life-threatening situations, an inmate can press a duress button in his cell.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f       While at Oak Park Heights, Jackson was sent repeatedly to ACU or to Complex\n5, a segregation unit for less threatening inmates or those with shorter segregation\nsentences. He was convicted of more than twenty rule violations, including\nassaulting staff, disorderly conduct, threatening behavior, disobeying direct orders,\nabuse or harassment, and destruction of prison property. In one incident, Jackson\nrefused to return to his cell, kicked a responding officer in the thigh, and threatened\nthat “whoever put hands on me is going to die.”\n\n        In a November 2013 incident, after scheduling a medical visit for neck pain,\nJackson told a correctional officer that he had swallowed a razor blade, triggering an\nIncident Command System (ICS) call for a self-injurious inmate. A doctor responded\nand evaluated Jackson’s complaint of chest, arm, and neck pain. He was then placed\nin a Complex 5 cell. A few hours later, he covered his cell camera with plastic lining\nfrom his mattress, refused directives to come to the door to be placed in restraints, and\nstated he was going to “get to ACU by doing whatever it takes.” The next day, while\nstaff removed the mattress, Jackson spat in the eye of a correctional officer. For these\nviolations, Jackson was placed in the ACU for 540 days of segregation and given 180\ndays of extended incarceration. Jackson resided in the ACU until April 2014, when\nACU inmates were moved to Complex 5 because of ACU construction.\n\n       B. The events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred on May 13, 2014. We relate\nfacts stated in Jackson’s Declaration In Opposition to Defendants’ Motion For\nSummary Judgment. Around 7:20 a.m. that morning, Jackson declared, he informed\na non-defendant correctional officer he was not feeling well, but it was not serious\nenough for medical attention. By noon, he was experiencing severe chest pains,\nnausea, shortness of breath, and vomiting, side effects he attributed to a depression\nmedication, Effexor. Over the next hour and a half, Jackson tried to get medical\nattention by notifying a nurse and a correctional officer and by pushing his emergency\nduress button at three different times. At 1:38 p.m., thinking his medical situation\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwas “dire,” Jackson grabbed a “grease container” in his cell and began to knock on\nthe door to alert staff of his medical needs. Then, Jackson declared:\n\n             For several minutes I was knocking on my door with the grease\n      container, [and] at approximately 1:40 p.m. my neighbors . . . began\n      asking me what was going on and why I was knocking on my door. My\n      neighbors (I believe) had been hearing me ask for medical assistance.\n      I explain to them the situation and tell them I need ‘help’ and they began\n      hitting their doors trying to get the attention of the staff.\n\n             For approximately 5 minutes staff completely ignore the noise . . .\n      [until defendant Sergeant Donn] Weber finally heads towards [my cell]\n      and all inmates stop hitting their doors. . . . Weber walks directly to my\n      door, I attempt to stand and speak with him but my chest contracts\n      painfully hard and I cry out in pain, and in my weakened state, slide\n      down the inside of my door . . . . I see [Sergeant] Weber . . . activating\n      an ICS response . . . for a self-injurious inmate. I was not hurting\n      myself.1\n\n       Lieutenant Gutzmer, responsible for supervising the ACU until 3:00 p.m. that\nday, responded to Weber’s ICS call for a self-injurious inmate. Though it is disputed\nwhether Gutzmer witnessed Jackson kicking and punching the cell door after\nGutzmer arrived, it is undisputed that Sgt. Weber told Gutzmer that Jackson had been\n\n\n      1\n        Sergeant Weber’s contemporaneous incident report partially contradicted\nJackson’s Declaration. According to Sergeant Weber, he “could see that inmate\nJackson . . . was in his cell, pounding/kicking his door and that he was the source of\nthe disturbance. The door of [Jackson’s cell] was shaking and rattling and inmate\nJackson was out of control, screaming and yelling incoherently, as he punched and/or\nkicked the cell door.” However, after activating ICS and attempting to calm Jackson,\nSergeant Weber concluded that “Inmate Jackson was NOT ‘out of control’ but rather\nappeared to be in total control of his actions and emotions. Inmate Jackson fully\nadmitted that he was only causing the disturbance in an attempt to manipulate health\nservices staff into visiting him at his cell.”\n\n                                         -4-\n\fkicking and punching his cell door and ignored directives to stop. In Gutzmer’s\nexperience, he had seen inmates break their wrist, feet, or hands by kicking or\npunching a cell door. Gutzmer averred that he feared Jackson may continue to\nengage in self-injurious behavior if not restrained. So Gutzmer “decided to err on the\nside of safety” and authorized the use of the restraint board.\n\n       C. After Gutzmer decided Jackson should be placed on the restraint board, the\nofficers complied with DOC policies for “pinion restraints.” Jackson was cuffed,\nplaced in leg restraints, and escorted by multiple correctional officers to a table\noutside his cell, where he was seen by two nurses. Jackson complained to the nurses\nof chest pains. The nurses determined that his vital signs, blood pressure, respiration,\nand pulse were normal, and his skin was warm and dry; he could talk normally and\ndid not appear to be in distress or suffering from any medical need requiring\nimmediate treatment or attention. The nurses medically cleared Jackson to be placed\non the restraint board. Consistent with policy, Jackson’s extraction from his cell and\nplacement on the restraint board were videotaped. The handcuffed and shackled\nJackson appears subdued and complies with officer instructions. The video confirms\nthe prior medical clearance and shows him being safely placed face down on the\nrestraint board at approximately 2:00 p.m., with a towel under his head and restraint\nstraps across his legs, back, and head. A nurse made sure the restraints were not too\ntight, and an officer informed Jackson that he may request to use a bathroom “in a\nmanner that maintains the safety of the staff and the offender.”\n\n       Jackson was taken to a different cell while on the restraint board. A mental\nhealth professional evaluated him, officers checked on him every fifteen minutes\nusing a camera in the cell, and an officer and a nurse checked on him in person every\nthirty minutes to examine his blood circulation and to determine whether he would\ncomply with staff directives and could be unrestrained. Jackson repeatedly yelled and\nremoved his head restraint. After a non-defendant correctional officer told Jackson\nhe could not use the bathroom, Jackson urinated on himself at approximately 4:25\n\n                                          -5-\n\fp.m. Gutzmer’s shift ended at 3:00 p.m., and Gutzmer did not see Jackson after he\nwas placed on the restraint board. Lieutenant Jeffrey White, Oak Park Heights Watch\nCommander from 2:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., received reports that Jackson had\ndemonstrated he would cooperate with staff directives. Lt. White authorized\nJackson’s removal from the board at 5:25 p.m.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       Paragraph 62 of Jackson’s lengthy pro se complaint alleged that Lt. Gutzmer’s\nactions “in authorizing the use of force and pinion restraints without need or\nprovocation were done maliciously and sadistically and . . . constituted . . . cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of” the Eighth Amendment. “An officer may be held\nliable only for his or her own use of excessive force.” Smith v. City of Minneapolis,\n754 F.3d 541, 547-48 (8th Cir. 2014) (quotation omitted). As Jackson does not allege\nthat the ICS officers used excessive force in removing him from his cell to the table\nwhere the nurses examined him, the only issue on appeal is whether Lt. Gutzmer used\nor authorized the use of excessive force in placing Jackson on the restraint board.\n\n      “After incarceration, only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.”\nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986) (quotation omitted). What constitutes\nthe “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” varies based on the alleged\nconstitutional violation. “[W]henever prison officials stand accused of using\nexcessive physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause,\nthe core judicial inquiry is that set out in Whitley: whether force was applied in a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to\ncause harm.” Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1992); see Wilkins v. Gaddy,\n559 U.S. 34, 37 (2010). This inquiry turns on “such factors as the need for the\napplication of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that\nwas used, and the extent of injury inflicted,” from which “inferences may be drawn\n\n                                          -6-\n\fas to whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary, or instead\nevinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is\ntantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321. The\nword “sadistically” is not surplusage; “‘maliciously’ and ‘sadistically’ have different\nmeanings, and the two together establish a higher level of intent than would either\nalone.” Howard v. Barnett, 21 F.3d 868, 872 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n       This is a highly deferential standard. “It does not insulate from review actions\ntaken in bad faith and for no legitimate purpose, but it requires that neither judge nor\njury freely substitute their judgment for that of officials who have made a considered\nchoice.” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 322. “[P]rison administrators should be accorded\nwide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that\nin their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain\ninstitutional security.” Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6 (quotation and alteration omitted).\nEvidence “that prison officials arguably erred in judgment” in deciding to use even\ndeadly force “falls far short of a showing that there was no plausible basis for [their]\nbelief that this degree of force was necessary.” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 323. If the\nevidence shows only “a mere dispute over the reasonableness of a particular use of\nforce or the existence of arguably superior alternatives . . . the case should not go to\nthe jury.” Id. at 322.\n\n       This is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity, a\ndoctrine that “shields a government official from liability unless his conduct violates\n‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.’” Burns, 752 F.3d at 1139, quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. 800, 818 (1982). Qualified immunity protects “all but the plainly incompetent\nor those who knowingly violate the law.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341\n(1986). Because it protects officials from the burden of defending insubstantial\nclaims, as well as from damage liability, the Supreme Court has “stressed the\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fimportance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in\nlitigation.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009) (quotation omitted).\n\n       The pretrial denial of qualified immunity is an appealable final order to the\nextent it turns on an issue of law. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985).\nWe have no jurisdiction to review a district court’s interlocutory summary judgment\norder that “determines only a question of ‘evidence sufficiency,’ i.e., which facts a\nparty may, or may not, be able to prove at trial.” Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 313\n(1995). Jackson argues we lack jurisdiction over this appeal for two reasons: first,\nbecause there is a genuine fact dispute whether Jackson was placed on the restraint\nboard because he was self-injurious, as Weber and Gutzmer claim, or “as wanton\npunishment for calling attention to his medical condition,” as Jackson claims; and\nsecond, because issues “related to Gutzmer’s intent preclude interlocutory review.”\n\n       The second reason requires only brief discussion because it is contrary to\ncontrolling authority. In Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 588-89 (1998), the\nSupreme Court acknowledged the inherent difficulty of applying qualified immunity,\na defense in which “the defendant’s subjective intent is simply irrelevant,” to claims\nin which the defendant’s improper motive is “an essential component of the plaintiff’s\naffirmative case.” Though the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court for imposing\non the plaintiff a heightened burden of proof to avoid qualified immunity, the Court\nfirmly rejected the notion that summary judgment based on qualified immunity may\nnot be granted when defendant’s intent is at issue. See id. at 600 (“summary\njudgment serves as the ultimate screen to weed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior\nto trial”), 604-05 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting), 612 (Scalia, J., dissenting). As\nrelevant here, the majority held that a plaintiff opposing a properly supported\nsummary judgment motion based on qualified immunity “must identify affirmative\nevidence from which a jury could find that the plaintiff has carried his or her burden\nof proving the pertinent motive.” Id. at 600. We applied that standard in affirming\nthe grant of qualified immunity to a correctional officer accused of using excessive\n\n                                         -8-\n\fforce in violation of the Eighth Amendment on an inmate who was pepper-sprayed\nwhen he refused to return to his cell after showering. Burns, 752 F.3d at 1139. We\nhave jurisdiction to review that issue on this appeal.\n\n       Jackson’s first reason requires more discussion. The district court denied\nqualified immunity because Jackson’s claim that he was not kicking or punching his\ncell door would permit a fact-finder to find that Gutzmer used the restraint board “for\npunishment, not to prevent self-harm despite what prison officials say,” and “Eighth\nCircuit precedent makes clear that using a restraint board for punishment as opposed\nto incapacitation may constitute an Eighth Amendment violation,” citing Walker v.\nBowersox, 526 F.3d 1186, 1188 (8th Cir. 2008). We conclude this reasoning is\nwrong as a matter of law.\n\n       Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense governed by an objective standard\nin which “the defendant’s subjective intent is simply irrelevant.” Crawford-El, 523\nU.S. at 588. “The immunity standard in Harlow itself eliminates all motive-based\nclaims in which the official’s conduct did not violate clearly established law.” Id. at\n592. Thus, just as an arresting officer with probable cause to arrest for a particular\nviolation is entitled to qualified immunity even if that was not his motive at the time\nof arrest, see Peterson v. Kopp, 754 F.3d 594, 599-600 (8th Cir. 2014), Gutzmer is\nentitled to qualified immunity if the totality of the circumstances justified use of the\nrestraint board even if Gutzmer erred in believing Jackson was self-injurious when\nplaced on the board.\n\n       In addition, the district court erred in construing Walker as equating\n“punishment” of an inmate with an excessive use of force. “The punishment of\nincarcerated prisoners . . . effectuates prison management and prisoner rehabilitative\ngoals. . . . Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct\nfalls within the expected perimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.”\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 485 (1995).2 A typical punishment for inmate\nmisconduct is punitive segregation, as in Sandin. But here, because of Jackson’s\nprior misconduct, he was already in the most segregated living unit in the Minnesota\nprison system. If Jackson’s additional misconduct on May 13, 2014 warranted\nadditional discipline, no Eighth Circuit case, and certainly no Supreme Court case,\nhas ever held that such “punishment” violates the Eighth Amendment.\n\n       Turning to the merits of the alleged Eighth Amendment violation, the issue of\nintent that is an element of Jackson’s claim is whether undisputed facts establish that\nforce was applied “in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,” or whether\nLt. Gutzmer applied force “maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Hudson, 503\nU.S. at 6-7.3 We have jurisdiction to review whether, viewing the facts in the\nsummary judgment record most favorably to Jackson, he “identif[ied] affirmative\nevidence from which a jury could find that [he] carried his . . . burden of proving” that\n\n      2\n       By contrast, “pretrial detainees . . . cannot be punished at all, much less\n‘maliciously and sadistically.’” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2475\n(2015).\n      3\n        In Key v. McKinney, 176 F.3d 1083, 1086 (8th Cir. 1999), we concluded there\nwas no Eighth Amendment violation when prison officials restrained an inmate with\nhandcuffs connected to a leg chain for twenty-four hours after the inmate threw water\non a correctional officer during a work detail. Though Key involved inmate\n“restraints,” we analyzed the Eighth Amendment issue under the deliberate\nindifference standard that applies to conditions of confinement cases, rather than the\nmalicious and sadistic standard Whitley applied to excessive force cases. See also\nCamp v. Brennan, 54 F. App’x 78, 81 (3d Cir. 2002) (analyzing Eighth Amendment\nclaim of improper use of a four-point restraint as a conditions of confinement claim).\nMost excessive force cases involve beatings, physical altercations, or use of force\nsuch as Tasers. When the use of passive restraints is challenged, careful analysis of\nthe factual context may be needed to determine the appropriate substantive standard.\nThat is not in question here, so we will not further address the issue.\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fGutzmer’s actions reflected a malicious and sadistic motive. Burns, 752 F.3d at 1139,\nquoting Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 600; see Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d 895, 906-07\n(9th Cir. 2001). This issue turns on consideration of far more than whether use of the\nrestraint board was unreasonable because Jackson was not self-injurious. See\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 321.\n\n       To review again the undisputed facts, Sgt. Weber went to Jackson’s cell in\nresponse to loud banging and called the ICS team because Jackson may be self-\ninjurious. Before the ICS team and two nurses arrived, Weber had concluded that\nJackson was not out of control, he was simply raising a ruckus to get medical\nattention (which Jackson’s Declaration admits). The ICS officers came to the cell and\nlaboriously restrained Jackson so he could be safely taken from his cell to the table\nwhere two nurses, summoned from their regular duties, examined Jackson and\nconcluded there was no need for immediate medical attention. Jackson admitted\ncausing a disturbance so that he could bypass prison rules for obtaining medical\nattention, misconduct warranting discipline. He violated rules for obtaining medical\nassistance, falsely claimed a medical emergency, and seriously disrupted ACU\noperations. Thus, “[t]his is not a case where a complete absence of penological\npurpose raised the reasonable inference that [Lt. Gutzmer] acted maliciously in an\neffort to cause harm.” Burns, 752 F.3d at 1140.4\n\n       Discipline was warranted after the nurses reported that Jackson had contrived\na medical emergency and could safely be placed on the restraint board. Lt. Gutzmer\nplaced Jackson on a restraint board for up to four hours, complying with DOC\npolicies governing its use by videotaping Jackson’s placement, obtaining prior\nmedical clearance, and having a nurse make sure his placement on the board was not\n\n      4\n       Jackson in his Declaration stated that, before Lt. Gutzmer was involved, a\ncorrectional officer responding to the third time Jackson improperly pushed his duress\nbutton said, “if you don’t stop pushing the button and harassing [correctional officers]\non rounds with fake requests for help you’ll be placed on the [restraint] board.”\n\n                                         -11-\n\finjurious or painful. This short-term discipline to induce compliance, while\nuncomfortable and unpleasant, was unlikely to be painful or to cause physical or\npsychological harm to an inmate already in punitive segregation. The restraint\nconditions in Walker were far less justified and far more painful and likely to harm\nthe inmate. See 526 F.3d at 1188. In these circumstances, we must defer to Lt.\nGutzmer’s judgment that employing this restraint in accordance with the safety\nprecautions required by prison policy was “needed to preserve internal order and\ndiscipline and to maintain institutional security.” Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6. It is not\nconstitutionally significant that the DOC policy generally instructs officials not to use\nforce or restraints as a form of punishment. See, e.g., Falls v. Nesbitt, 966 F.2d 375,\n379-80 (8th Cir. 1992).5\n\n       As in Burns, we conclude that Jackson presented no evidence whatsoever that\nGutzmer’s actions “evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction\nof harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\nat 321. Jackson argues that, when he was placed on the restraint board, there was no\nlonger a risk of self-injurious behavior, so the evidence demonstrates that Gutzmer\nplaced Jackson on the restraint board “as punishment for seeking medical attention,”\nthereby violating the Eighth Amendment. But punishing an inmate “to preserve\ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security” does not violate\nthe Eighth Amendment, Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6, unless the punishment or force used\nis “repugnant to the conscience of mankind,” id. at 10 (quotation omitted), like the\n“degrading and dangerous” hitching post restraint at issue in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S.\n730, 745 (2002). Nor is there evidence of prior contacts or relations between Jackson\nand Gutzmer that would be specific evidence of a malicious motive to harm. See\nBurns, 752 F.3d at 1140.\n\n      5\n        We also conclude that “the extent of the threat to the safety of [Jackson], as\nreasonably perceived by [Lt. Gutzmer] on the basis of facts known to” him, suggested\nthat “the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary” to stop Jackson\nbefore he injured himself. Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321.\n\n                                          -12-\n\f       For these reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal and\nthe denial of qualified immunity to Lt. Gutzmer must be reversed because the record\nfails to establish the alleged Eighth Amendment excessive force violation. The\nMemorandum and Order of the district court dated March 31, 2016 is reversed in part,\nand the case is remanded with directions to enter summary judgment dismissing the\nexcessive force claim against Lt. Jeff Gutzmer.\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f",

Eaton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1138 (8th Cir. 2014).\n\n                                           I.\n\n       A. Convicted of arson, Jackson was admitted to the Minnesota Correctional\nFacility in St. Cloud in November 2012. An initial psychiatric assessment reflected\nhis self-reported history of 28 suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, hearing voices to\nharm himself and others, cutting himself, depression, and anxiety. The assessment\nalso related violent episodes including stabbing his school principal with scissors and\nstriking his fiancé with a bottle. The examining doctor diagnosed Jackson with\ndepression, borderline personality disorder with possible dissociative episodes, and\nalcohol dependency.\n\n       During Jackson’s first week at the St. Cloud facility, he violated multiple rules,\nincluding threatening others, possessing a weapon, and assaulting correctional staff.\nThe weapon possession violation was a major infraction. Jackson also reported that\nvoices were telling him to slit his cellmate’s throat. The Minnesota Department of\nCorrections (DOC) transferred Jackson to the Oak Park Heights maximum security\nfacility, placed him on disciplinary segregation status, and assigned him to the\nAdministrative Control Unit (ACU). Designed to protect inmates from themselves\nand others and to maintain orderly prison operations, the ACU is the most secure\nprison living unit in Minnesota. ACU inmates are confined to their cells for twenty-\nthree hours per day and allowed only limited personal property. To receive medical\nattention, an ACU inmate can submit a written “kite” for a medical visit; for\nemergency life-threatening situations, an inmate can press a duress button in his cell.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f       While at Oak Park Heights, Jackson was sent repeatedly to ACU or to Complex\n5, a segregation unit for less threatening inmates or those with shorter segregation\nsentences. He was convicted of more than twenty rule violations, including\nassaulting staff, disorderly conduct, threatening behavior, disobeying direct orders,\nabuse or harassment, and destruction of prison property. In one incident, Jackson\nrefused to return to his cell, kicked a responding officer in the thigh, and threatened\nthat “whoever put hands on me is going to die.”\n\n        In a November 2013 incident, after scheduling a medical visit for neck pain,\nJackson told a correctional officer that he had swallowed a razor blade, triggering an\nIncident Command System (ICS) call for a self-injurious inmate. A doctor responded\nand evaluated Jackson’s complaint of chest, arm, and neck pain. He was then placed\nin a Complex 5 cell. A few hours later, he covered his cell camera with plastic lining\nfrom his mattress, refused directives to come to the door to be placed in restraints, and\nstated he was going to “get to ACU by doing whatever it takes.” The next day, while\nstaff removed the mattress, Jackson spat in the eye of a correctional officer. For these\nviolations, Jackson was placed in the ACU for 540 days of segregation and given 180\ndays of extended incarceration. Jackson resided in the ACU until April 2014, when\nACU inmates were moved to Complex 5 because of ACU construction.\n\n       B. The events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred on May 13, 2014. We relate\nfacts stated in Jackson’s Declaration In Opposition to Defendants’ Motion For\nSummary Judgment. Around 7:20 a.m. that morning, Jackson declared, he informed\na non-defendant correctional officer he was not feeling well, but it was not serious\nenough for medical attention. By noon, he was experiencing severe chest pains,\nnausea, shortness of breath, and vomiting, side effects he attributed to a depression\nmedication, Effexor. Over the next hour and a half, Jackson tried to get medical\nattention by notifying a nurse and a correctional officer and by pushing his emergency\nduress button at three different times. At 1:38 p.m., thinking his medical situation\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwas “dire,” Jackson grabbed a “grease container” in his cell and began to knock on\nthe door to alert staff of his medical needs. Then, Jackson declared:\n\n             For several minutes I was knocking on my door with the grease\n      container, [and] at approximately 1:40 p.m. my neighbors . . . began\n      asking me what was going on and why I was knocking on my door. My\n      neighbors (I believe) had been hearing me ask for medical assistance.\n      I explain to them the situation and tell them I need ‘help’ and they began\n      hitting their doors trying to get the attention of the staff.\n\n             For approximately 5 minutes staff completely ignore the noise . . .\n      [until defendant Sergeant Donn] Weber finally heads towards [my cell]\n      and all inmates stop hitting their doors. . . . Weber walks directly to my\n      door, I attempt to stand and speak with him but my chest contracts\n      painfully hard and I cry out in pain, and in my weakened state, slide\n      down the inside of my door . . . . I see [Sergeant] Weber . . . activating\n      an ICS response . . . for a self-injurious inmate. I was not hurting\n      myself.1\n\n       Lieutenant Gutzmer, responsible for supervising the ACU until 3:00 p.m. that\nday, responded to Weber’s ICS call for a self-injurious inmate. Though it is disputed\nwhether Gutzmer witnessed Jackson kicking and punching the cell door after\nGutzmer arrived, it is undisputed that Sgt. Weber told Gutzmer that Jackson had been\n\n\n      1\n        Sergeant Weber’s contemporaneous incident report partially contradicted\nJackson’s Declaration. According to Sergeant Weber, he “could see that inmate\nJackson . . . was in his cell, pounding/kicking his door and that he was the source of\nthe disturbance. The door of [Jackson’s cell] was shaking and rattling and inmate\nJackson was out of control, screaming and yelling incoherently, as he punched and/or\nkicked the cell door.” However, after activating ICS and attempting to calm Jackson,\nSergeant Weber concluded that “Inmate Jackson was NOT ‘out of control’ but rather\nappeared to be in total control of his actions and emotions. Inmate Jackson fully\nadmitted that he was only causing the disturbance in an attempt to manipulate health\nservices staff into visiting him at his cell.”\n\n                                         -4-\n\fkicking and punching his cell door and ignored directives to stop. In Gutzmer’s\nexperience, he had seen inmates break their wrist, feet, or hands by kicking or\npunching a cell door. Gutzmer averred that he feared Jackson may continue to\nengage in self-injurious behavior if not restrained. So Gutzmer “decided to err on the\nside of safety” and authorized the use of the restraint board.\n\n       C. After Gutzmer decided Jackson should be placed on the restraint board, the\nofficers complied with DOC policies for “pinion restraints.” Jackson was cuffed,\nplaced in leg restraints, and escorted by multiple correctional officers to a table\noutside his cell, where he was seen by two nurses. Jackson complained to the nurses\nof chest pains. The nurses determined that his vital signs, blood pressure, respiration,\nand pulse were normal, and his skin was warm and dry; he could talk normally and\ndid not appear to be in distress or suffering from any medical need requiring\nimmediate treatment or attention. The nurses medically cleared Jackson to be placed\non the restraint board. Consistent with policy, Jackson’s extraction from his cell and\nplacement on the restraint board were videotaped. The handcuffed and shackled\nJackson appears subdued and complies with officer instructions. The video confirms\nthe prior medical clearance and shows him being safely placed face down on the\nrestraint board at approximately 2:00 p.m., with a towel under his head and restraint\nstraps across his legs, back, and head. A nurse made sure the restraints were not too\ntight, and an officer informed Jackson that he may request to use a bathroom “in a\nmanner that maintains the safety of the staff and the offender.”\n\n       Jackson was taken to a different cell while on the restraint board. A mental\nhealth professional evaluated him, officers checked on him every fifteen minutes\nusing a camera in the cell, and an officer and a nurse checked on him in person every\nthirty minutes to examine his blood circulation and to determine whether he would\ncomply with staff directives and could be unrestrained. Jackson repeatedly yelled and\nremoved his head restraint. After a non-defendant correctional officer told Jackson\nhe could not use the bathroom, Jackson urinated on himself at approximately 4:25\n\n                                          -5-\n\fp.m. Gutzmer’s shift ended at 3:00 p.m., and Gutzmer did not see Jackson after he\nwas placed on the restraint board. Lieutenant Jeffrey White, Oak Park Heights Watch\nCommander from 2:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., received reports that Jackson had\ndemonstrated he would cooperate with staff directives. Lt. White authorized\nJackson’s removal from the board at 5:25 p.m.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       Paragraph 62 of Jackson’s lengthy pro se complaint alleged that Lt. Gutzmer’s\nactions “in authorizing the use of force and pinion restraints without need or\nprovocation were done maliciously and sadistically and . . . constituted . . . cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of” the Eighth Amendment. “An officer may be held\nliable only for his or her own use of excessive force.” Smith v.

As Jackson does not allege\nthat the ICS officers used excessive force in removing him from his cell to the table\nwhere the nurses examined him, the only issue on appeal is whether Lt. Gutzmer used\nor authorized the use of excessive force in placing Jackson on the restraint board.\n\n      “After incarceration, only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.”\nWhitley v. Albers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (1986) (quotation omitted). What constitutes\nthe “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” varies based on the alleged\nconstitutional violation. “[W]henever prison officials stand accused of using\nexcessive physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause,\nthe core judicial inquiry is that set out in Whitley: whether force was applied in a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to\ncause harm.” Hudson v. McMillian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6-7 (1992); see Wilkins v.

This inquiry turns on “such factors as the need for the\napplication of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that\nwas used, and the extent of injury inflicted,” from which “inferences may be drawn\n\n                                          -6-\n\fas to whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary, or instead\nevinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is\ntantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321. The\nword “sadistically” is not surplusage; “‘maliciously’ and ‘sadistically’ have different\nmeanings, and the two together establish a higher level of intent than would either\nalone.” Howard v. Barnett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667632\"><a href=\"/opinion/667632/keith-howard-v-co-ii-barnett-cco-i-johnson-co-i-malone/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n       This is a highly deferential standard. “It does not insulate from review actions\ntaken in bad faith and for no legitimate purpose, but it requires that neither judge nor\njury freely substitute their judgment for that of officials who have made a considered\nchoice.” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 322. “[P]rison administrators should be accorded\nwide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that\nin their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain\ninstitutional security.” Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6 (quotation and alteration omitted).\nEvidence “that prison officials arguably erred in judgment” in deciding to use even\ndeadly force “falls far short of a showing that there was no plausible basis for [their]\nbelief that this degree of force was necessary.” Whitley, 475 U.S. at 323. If the\nevidence shows only “a mere dispute over the reasonableness of a particular use of\nforce or the existence of arguably superior alternatives . . . the case should not go to\nthe jury.” Id. at 322.\n\n       This is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity, a\ndoctrine that “shields a government official from liability unless his conduct violates\n‘clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.’” Burns, 752 F.3d at 1139, quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (1982).

Because it protects officials from the burden of defending insubstantial\nclaims, as well as from damage liability, the Supreme Court has “stressed the\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fimportance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in\nlitigation.” Pearson v.

See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1985).\nWe have no jurisdiction to review a district court’s interlocutory summary judgment\norder that “determines only a question of ‘evidence sufficiency,’ i.e., which facts a\nparty may, or may not, be able to prove at trial.” Johnson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313\n(1995). Jackson argues we lack jurisdiction over this appeal for two reasons: first,\nbecause there is a genuine fact dispute whether Jackson was placed on the restraint\nboard because he was self-injurious, as Weber and Gutzmer claim, or “as wanton\npunishment for calling attention to his medical condition,” as Jackson claims; and\nsecond, because issues “related to Gutzmer’s intent preclude interlocutory review.”\n\n       The second reason requires only brief discussion because it is contrary to\ncontrolling authority. In Crawford-El v. Britton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118203\"><a href=\"/opinion/118203/crawford-el-v-britton/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588-89 (1998), the\nSupreme Court acknowledged the inherent difficulty of applying qualified immunity,\na defense in which “the defendant’s subjective intent is simply irrelevant,” to claims\nin which the defendant’s improper motive is “an essential component of the plaintiff’s\naffirmative case.” Though the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court for imposing\non the plaintiff a heightened burden of proof to avoid qualified immunity, the Court\nfirmly rejected the notion that summary judgment based on qualified immunity may\nnot be granted when defendant’s intent is at issue. See id. at 600 (“summary\njudgment serves as the ultimate screen to weed out truly insubstantial lawsuits prior\nto trial”), 604-05 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting), 612 (Scalia, J., dissenting). As\nrelevant here, the majority held that a plaintiff opposing a properly supported\nsummary judgment motion based on qualified immunity “must identify affirmative\nevidence from which a jury could find that the plaintiff has carried his or her burden\nof proving the pertinent motive.” Id. at 600. We applied that standard in affirming\nthe grant of qualified immunity to a correctional officer accused of using excessive\n\n                                         -8-\n\fforce in violation of the Eighth Amendment on an inmate who was pepper-sprayed\nwhen he refused to return to his cell after showering. Burns, 752 F.3d at 1139. We\nhave jurisdiction to review that issue on this appeal.\n\n       Jackson’s first reason requires more discussion. The district court denied\nqualified immunity because Jackson’s claim that he was not kicking or punching his\ncell door would permit a fact-finder to find that Gutzmer used the restraint board “for\npunishment, not to prevent self-harm despite what prison officials say,” and “Eighth\nCircuit precedent makes clear that using a restraint board for punishment as opposed\nto incapacitation may constitute an Eighth Amendment violation,” citing Walker v.\nBowersox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1190035\"><a href=\"/opinion/1190035/walker-v-bowersox/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1188 (8th Cir. 2008). We conclude this reasoning is\nwrong as a matter of law.\n\n       Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense governed by an objective standard\nin which “the defendant’s subjective intent is simply irrelevant.” Crawford-El, 523\nU.S. at 588. “The immunity standard in Harlow itself eliminates all motive-based\nclaims in which the official’s conduct did not violate clearly established law.” Id. at\n592. Thus, just as an arresting officer with probable cause to arrest for a particular\nviolation is entitled to qualified immunity even if that was not his motive at the time\nof arrest, see Peterson v. Kopp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">754</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599-600 (8th Cir. 2014), Gutzmer is\nentitled to qualified immunity if the totality of the circumstances justified use of the\nrestraint board even if Gutzmer erred in believing Jackson was self-injurious when\nplaced on the board.\n\n       In addition, the district court erred in construing Walker as equating\n“punishment” of an inmate with an excessive use of force. “The punishment of\nincarcerated prisoners . . . effectuates prison management and prisoner rehabilitative\ngoals. . . . Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct\nfalls within the expected perimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.”\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fSandin v.

But here, because of Jackson’s\nprior misconduct, he was already in the most segregated living unit in the Minnesota\nprison system. If Jackson’s additional misconduct on May 13, 2014 warranted\nadditional discipline, no Eighth Circuit case, and certainly no Supreme Court case,\nhas ever held that such “punishment” violates the Eighth Amendment.\n\n       Turning to the merits of the alleged Eighth Amendment violation, the issue of\nintent that is an element of Jackson’s claim is whether undisputed facts establish that\nforce was applied “in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline,” or whether\nLt. Gutzmer applied force “maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” Hudson, 503\nU.S. at 6-7.3 We have jurisdiction to review whether, viewing the facts in the\nsummary judgment record most favorably to Jackson, he “identif[ied] affirmative\nevidence from which a jury could find that [he] carried his . . . burden of proving” that\n\n      2\n       By contrast, “pretrial detainees . . . cannot be punished at all, much less\n‘maliciously and sadistically.’” Kingsley v. Hendrickson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2811847\"><a href=\"/opinion/2811847/kingsley-v-hendrickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764105\"><a href=\"/opinion/764105/kelvin-key-raymond-marvin-mickelson-jr-gary-case-on-their-own-behalf-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1086 (8th Cir. 1999), we concluded there\nwas no Eighth Amendment violation when prison officials restrained an inmate with\nhandcuffs connected to a leg chain for twenty-four hours after the inmate threw water\non a correctional officer during a work detail. Though Key involved inmate\n“restraints,” we analyzed the Eighth Amendment issue under the deliberate\nindifference standard that applies to conditions of confinement cases, rather than the\nmalicious and sadistic standard Whitley applied to excessive force cases. See also\nCamp v. Brennan, 54 F. App’x 78, 81 (3d Cir. 2002) (analyzing Eighth Amendment\nclaim of improper use of a four-point restraint as a conditions of confinement claim).\nMost excessive force cases involve beatings, physical altercations, or use of force\nsuch as Tasers. When the use of passive restraints is challenged, careful analysis of\nthe factual context may be needed to determine the appropriate substantive standard.\nThat is not in question here, so we will not further address the issue.\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fGutzmer’s actions reflected a malicious and sadistic motive. Burns, 752 F.3d at 1139,\nquoting Crawford-El, 523 U.S. at 600; see Jeffers v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775179\"><a href=\"/opinion/775179/donnell-jeffers-v-james-gomez-director-california-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 906-07\n(9th Cir. 2001). This issue turns on consideration of far more than whether use of the\nrestraint board was unreasonable because Jackson was not self-injurious. See\nWhitley, 475 U.S. at 321.\n\n       To review again the undisputed facts, Sgt. Weber went to Jackson’s cell in\nresponse to loud banging and called the ICS team because Jackson may be self-\ninjurious. Before the ICS team and two nurses arrived, Weber had concluded that\nJackson was not out of control, he was simply raising a ruckus to get medical\nattention (which Jackson’s Declaration admits). The ICS officers came to the cell and\nlaboriously restrained Jackson so he could be safely taken from his cell to the table\nwhere two nurses, summoned from their regular duties, examined Jackson and\nconcluded there was no need for immediate medical attention. Jackson admitted\ncausing a disturbance so that he could bypass prison rules for obtaining medical\nattention, misconduct warranting discipline. He violated rules for obtaining medical\nassistance, falsely claimed a medical emergency, and seriously disrupted ACU\noperations. Thus, “[t]his is not a case where a complete absence of penological\npurpose raised the reasonable inference that [Lt. Gutzmer] acted maliciously in an\neffort to cause harm.” Burns, 752 F.3d at 1140.4\n\n       Discipline was warranted after the nurses reported that Jackson had contrived\na medical emergency and could safely be placed on the restraint board. Lt. Gutzmer\nplaced Jackson on a restraint board for up to four hours, complying with DOC\npolicies governing its use by videotaping Jackson’s placement, obtaining prior\nmedical clearance, and having a nurse make sure his placement on the board was not\n\n      4\n       Jackson in his Declaration stated that, before Lt. Gutzmer was involved, a\ncorrectional officer responding to the third time Jackson improperly pushed his duress\nbutton said, “if you don’t stop pushing the button and harassing [correctional officers]\non rounds with fake requests for help you’ll be placed on the [restraint] board.”\n\n                                         -11-\n\finjurious or painful. This short-term discipline to induce compliance, while\nuncomfortable and unpleasant, was unlikely to be painful or to cause physical or\npsychological harm to an inmate already in punitive segregation. The restraint\nconditions in Walker were far less justified and far more painful and likely to harm\nthe inmate. See 526 F.3d at 1188. In these circumstances, we must defer to Lt.\nGutzmer’s judgment that employing this restraint in accordance with the safety\nprecautions required by prison policy was “needed to preserve internal order and\ndiscipline and to maintain institutional security.” Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6. It is not\nconstitutionally significant that the DOC policy generally instructs officials not to use\nforce or restraints as a form of punishment. See, e.g., Falls v. Nesbitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584262\"><a href=\"/opinion/584262/ts-falls-sergeant-cummins-unit-adc-v-john-nesbitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n379-80 (8th Cir. 1992).5\n\n       As in Burns, we conclude that Jackson presented no evidence whatsoever that\nGutzmer’s actions “evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction\nof harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\nat 321. Jackson argues that, when he was placed on the restraint board, there was no\nlonger a risk of self-injurious behavior, so the evidence demonstrates that Gutzmer\nplaced Jackson on the restraint board “as punishment for seeking medical attention,”\nthereby violating the Eighth Amendment. But punishing an inmate “to preserve\ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security” does not violate\nthe Eighth Amendment, Hudson, 503 U.S. at 6, unless the punishment or force used\nis “repugnant to the conscience of mankind,” id. at 10 (quotation omitted), like the\n“degrading and dangerous” hitching post restraint at issue in Hope v. Pelzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121169\"><a href=\"/opinion/121169/hope-v-pelzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 745 (2002). Nor is there evidence of prior contacts or relations between Jackson\nand Gutzmer that would be specific evidence of a malicious motive to harm. See\nBurns, 752 F.3d at 1140.\n\n      5\n        We also conclude that “the extent of the threat to the safety of [Jackson], as\nreasonably perceived by [Lt. Gutzmer] on the basis of facts known to” him, suggested\nthat “the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary” to stop Jackson\nbefore he injured himself. Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321.\n\n                                          -12-\n\f       For these reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal and\nthe denial of qualified immunity to Lt. Gutzmer must be reversed because the record\nfails to establish the alleged Eighth Amendment excessive force violation. The\nMemorandum and Order of the district court dated March 31, 2016 is reversed in part,\nand the case is remanded with directions to enter summary judgment dismissing the\nexcessive force claim against Lt. Jeff Gutzmer.\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f</pre>",
