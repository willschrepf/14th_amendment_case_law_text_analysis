The case was referred to Magistrate William Haynes, Jr. and on May 24, 1985, a report and recommendation was entered finding procedural due process violations vis-a-vis petitioner's continued confinement in administrative segregation.  Specifically, the decisions in January 1985 (by the warden) and February 1985 (by the Segregation Review Board members) did not comply with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> because adequate reasons were not given for continued confinement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this appeal is whether petitioner was entitled to damages based on the finding of a due process violation.  We hold that Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978) is dispositive of this case and damages are hereby denied.  Carey holds that a Sec.  1983 procedural due process claim is compensatory only if there is proof of actual injury.  Petitioner has failed to meet this burden.  Indeed, the district court held a hearing on September 19, 1985, finding in an Order dated September 20, 1985, that \"there was reasonable justification for the continued incarceration of the petitioner to administrative segregation at the time in question.\"    Administrative segregation would have been proper even if detailed reasons were given for petitioner's continued confinement.  Thus, this case is analogous to Carey where the Court held \"[R]espondents<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> would not be entitled to recover damages representing the value of missed school time if petitioners showed on remand 'that there was just cause for the suspension[s] and that therefore [respondents] would have been suspended even if a proper hearing had been held.\"'   Id. at 252.
