P. 56, we\r<br>\r<br>          canvass the material facts in a light that flatters, but does not\r<br>\r<br>          impermissibly distort,  the plaintiff's claims.   We then recount\r<br>\r<br>          the travel of the case.\r<br>\r<br>                                    A.  The Facts.\r                                    A.  The Facts.\r                                        _________\r<br>\r<br>                    We outline  the facts, omitting the  graphic details on\r<br>\r<br>          which  our dissenting  brother prefers  to dwell.   In  our view,\r<br>\r<br>          these  details  are not  relevant to  the  legal issues  posed on\r<br>\r<br>          appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                    In the early morning hours  of May 26, 1988, plaintiff-\r<br>\r<br>          appellant  Wilfredo Martinez  Rodriguez  (Martinez),  a  youthful\r<br>\r<br>          member of Puerto Rico's  police force, drove to the  Loiza Street\r<br>\r<br>          Precinct,  located in  the  San Juan  metropolitan area.   Though\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez was not scheduled to begin his shift until 4:00 a.m., he\r<br>\r<br>          arrived  early, pursuant to local custom, in order to procure his\r<br>\r<br>          post  assignment.  Martinez alleges that he  was on duty from the\r<br>\r<br>          moment  he arrived    even before his shift  began   because from\r<br>\r<br>          that  point  forward he  was  subject  to  the shift  commander's\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          orders.\r<br>\r<br>                    Upon  Martinez' arrival,  a fellow  officer who  was on\r<br>\r<br>          duty at  the time,  Angel Valentin Corali  (Valentin), approached\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez' car and called him \"pretty boy\" (\"papito lindo\").  When\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez alighted, Valentin drew his service revolver, pointed it\r<br>\r<br>          at Martinez' stomach, cocked the hammer, placed his finger on the\r<br>\r<br>          trigger,  and  inquired if  Martinez was  afraid.   Valentin then\r<br>\r<br>          disarmed  the weapon,  and Martinez  hurried inside  the station,\r<br>\r<br>          first telling  Valentin:  \"Don't  horse around with  that because\r<br>\r<br>          you will kill me.\"\r<br>\r<br>                    Shortly  after  this  fracas  had   occurred,  Valentin\r<br>\r<br>          accosted Martinez in the  radio room, inserted his finger  into a\r<br>\r<br>          small hole in Martinez'  undershirt, and ripped it.   Once again,\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez walked away  from Valentin.   He then  changed into  his\r<br>\r<br>          uniform, entered  the waiting  room, and  reported  to his  shift\r<br>\r<br>          supervisor, defendant-appellee Juan Trinidad Marrero (Trinidad).\r<br>\r<br>                    Soon  thereafter,  Valentin  reappeared,   pointed  his\r<br>\r<br>          revolver at Martinez' genitals, cocked  the hammer, and, with his\r<br>\r<br>          finger on the trigger, threatened to \"blow away\" Martinez'  penis\r<br>\r<br>          (asking  him, somewhat  rhetorically, if  he was  scared).   When\r<br>\r<br>          Valentin lowered the weapon, Martinez immediately moved away from\r<br>\r<br>          him.   Within minutes Valentin again  approached Martinez, cocked\r<br>\r<br>          the  revolver,  aimed  it  at Martinez'  groin,  and  resumed his\r<br>\r<br>          taunting.     The   revolver  accidentally   discharged,  maiming\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  first  encounter  took  place  in  the  precinct's\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          parking lot and  the rest transpired  inside the police  station.\r<br>\r<br>          According to Martinez, roughly  twenty minutes elapsed from start\r<br>\r<br>          to finish.  All  parties agree that the shooting,  which occurred\r<br>\r<br>          before the 4:00 a.m. shift change, was unintentional.1\r<br>\r<br>                               B.

Travel of the Case.\r                                   __________________\r<br>\r<br>                    On  May  22,  1989,  Martinez  filed  suit  in  federal\r<br>\r<br>          district  court  against   numerous  defendants,  including,   as\r<br>\r<br>          relevant here, Rafael Colon Pizarro (Colon), Luis A. Velez Rentas\r<br>\r<br>          (Velez),  and  Trinidad  (collectively, \"the  officers\"  or  \"the\r<br>\r<br>          defendants\").2     Invoking  42  U.S.C.      1983  and  premising\r<br>\r<br>          jurisdiction  on the  existence  of a  federal  question, see  28\r                                                                    ___\r<br>\r<br>          U.S.C.     1331  (1988), he  alleged  that  his  rights had  been\r<br>\r<br>          abridged in that each  defendant owed him a duty to intervene and\r<br>\r<br>          protect  him  from readily  discernible harm  at  the hands  of a\r<br>\r<br>          fellow  officer,  but  each   defendant  breached  this  duty  by\r<br>\r<br>          subsequent  inaction.3   Martinez  asserted  pendent tort  claims\r<br>\r<br>          with respect  to  all  three  defendants  and,  with  respect  to\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               1In  his memorandum of law  in support of  his opposition to\r<br>          defendant  Carlos Lopez-Feliciano's  motion to  dismiss, Martinez\r<br>          stated that  \"the revolver apparently fired by accident.\"  Record\r<br>          Appendix  at  21.   At  any  rate,  the  summary judgment  record\r<br>          contains no facts that would support a contrary finding; and, for\r<br>          aught  that appears,  Martinez has  never asserted  that Valentin\r<br>          shot him intentionally.\r<br>\r<br>               2Plaintiff asserted claims against several other defendants,\r<br>          including  Valentin and  Lopez-Feliciano.   Those claims  are not\r<br>          before us, and we ignore them for purposes of this opinion.\r<br>\r<br>               3Although  the underlying  facts  are  hotly  contested,  we\r<br>          assume  for purposes of this  appeal, as Martinez  would have it,\r<br>          that  all three  defendants witnessed  the entire  progression of\r<br>          events and had a meaningful opportunity to intervene at each step\r<br>          along the way.\r<br>\r<br>                                          4\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          Trinidad,  asserted a  section  1983 claim  based on  supervisory\r<br>\r<br>          liability.\r<br>\r<br>                    After  a  flurry of  pretrial  discovery,  the officers\r<br>\r<br>          moved for  summary  judgment.   They  argued,  inter  alia,  that\r                                                         _____  ____\r<br>\r<br>          Valentin was not acting under color  of state law when the mishap\r<br>\r<br>          occurred; and that, therefore,  onlooker officers did not have  a\r<br>\r<br>          constitutional  duty  to  intervene  on Martinez'  behalf.    The\r<br>\r<br>          district  court   referred  the  motions  and   Martinez'  timely\r<br>\r<br>          opposition to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate concluded that,\r<br>\r<br>          under DeShaney, the officers  had no constitutional obligation to\r                ________\r<br>\r<br>          protect Martinez from Valentin's  actions, and urged the district\r<br>\r<br>          court to grant summary  judgment.  The plaintiff objected  to the\r<br>\r<br>          magistrate's report and  recommendation, but the  district court,\r<br>\r<br>          affording de novo review, see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 72(b), adopted the\r                    __ ____         ___\r<br>\r<br>          report,  accepted   the  recommendation,  and   entered  judgment\r<br>\r<br>          accordingly.  This appeal followed.\r<br>\r<br>          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r<br>\r<br>                    A district  court may  grant summary judgment  only \"if\r<br>\r<br>          the  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\r<br>\r<br>          admissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\r<br>\r<br>          that there is  no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that\r<br>\r<br>          the  moving party is entitled to a  judgment as a matter of law.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Fed.

On\r<br>\r<br>            the day of the events giving rise to this case, he arrived at\r<br>\r<br>            the police station  sufficiently early to  be given his  duty\r<br>\r<br>            assignment.   Martinez parked  his car in  the police parking\r<br>\r<br>            lot.   He got out of  his car and started  towards the police\r<br>\r<br>            station to get his orders for the day.  There were four other\r<br>\r<br>            police officers in the  lot:  the defendants --  Colon, V lez\r<br>\r<br>            and Trinidad -- and Valentin, who is not a defendant.  As the\r<br>\r<br>            majority  acknowledges, the defendants  were, at all relevant\r<br>\r<br>            times, on duty as  police officers and acting under  color of\r<br>\r<br>            state  law.   The three  defendants observed the  events that\r<br>\r<br>            took  place in  the parking  lot and  the police  station and\r<br>\r<br>            heard Valentin's  denigrating remarks  to Martinez.   None of\r<br>\r<br>            the defendants asked Valentin to stop his verbal and physical\r<br>\r<br>            assaults  against Martinez.  To put it starkly, they stood by\r<br>\r<br>            and  watched without protest  Valentin \"blow away\" Martinez's\r<br>\r<br>            penis.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          26\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      As Martinez walked across the parking lot, Valentin\r<br>\r<br>            said  to the defendants,  \"Here comes Pretty  Boy.\"  Valentin\r<br>\r<br>            then accosted Martinez, drew his service revolver, pointed it\r<br>\r<br>            directly  at  Martinez's genital  area,  cocked  it, put  his\r<br>\r<br>            finger on the trigger,  asked Martinez if he was  afraid, and\r<br>\r<br>            then  lowered the revolver.  Martinez  told Valentin:  \"Don't\r<br>\r<br>            horse around with that  because you will kill me.\"   Martinez\r<br>\r<br>            then  proceeded into the station  house.  A  short time later\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin again  confronted Martinez; this time  he pushed his\r<br>\r<br>            finger through a hole in Martinez's undershirt and ripped the\r<br>\r<br>            shirt open.  The  record does not disclose whether  any words\r<br>\r<br>            were  spoken  at this  juncture.    Martinez put  his  police\r<br>\r<br>            uniform on  and reported  to his shift  supervisor, defendant\r<br>\r<br>            Trinidad.\r<br>\r<br>                      A  short   time  later  Valentin   again  assaulted\r<br>\r<br>            Martinez.     This   assault   was  similar   to  the   first\r<br>\r<br>            confrontation,  but  with  an  ominous  threat.    This  time\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin pushed  the muzzle of his loaded and cocked revolver\r<br>\r<br>            into the front of  Martinez's pants  and threatened  to \"blow\r<br>\r<br>            away\" Martinez's penis.   Valentin then asked Martinez  if he\r<br>\r<br>            was  scared.   After Valentin  withdrew the  weapon, Martinez\r<br>\r<br>            moved away from him.\r<br>\r<br>                      A short time later, within minutes,  Valentin again\r<br>\r<br>            accosted Martinez.   He loaded  and cocked  his revolver  and\r<br>\r<br>            then inserted  it into  the front  of Martinez's pants  while\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          27\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            continuing to verbally  abuse him.   The  charade ended  when\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin's  revolver  discharged.    Valentin's  prior threat\r<br>\r<br>            became a reality; Martinez's penis was in fact blown away and\r<br>\r<br>            he was rendered permanently impotent.\r<br>\r<br>                      The  majority  calls  the  shooting  accidental and\r<br>\r<br>            says,  \"All parties  agree  that  the  shooting  .  .  .  was\r<br>\r<br>            unintentional.\"    Ante at  4.

I think that Valentin exercised power possessed\r<br>\r<br>            by virtue of Puerto  Rico law and made possible  only because\r<br>\r<br>            he was clothed with the authority of Puerto Rico, and that he\r<br>\r<br>            abused that power.\r<br>\r<br>                      Even if  I disregard  the obvious --  that Valentin\r<br>\r<br>            was in uniform, on duty, in the police station, and used  his\r<br>\r<br>            service  revolver to commit  the tort (all  of which militate\r<br>\r<br>            heavily  in  favor  of a  finding  that  Valentin  abused his\r<br>\r<br>            position as a  police officer) --  I believe that  Valentin's\r<br>\r<br>            status as a police officer was the only reason the defendants\r<br>\r<br>            took  no action.  If Valentin  had been a private citizen and\r<br>\r<br>            had  been  tormenting  Martinez   in  the  same  manner,  the\r<br>\r<br>            bystander  officers certainly  would  have  intervened.   The\r<br>\r<br>            record gives  rise to a reasonable  inference that Valentin's\r<br>\r<br>            police-officer status led the bystander officers  to conclude\r<br>\r<br>            that:   (1) Valentin was not mentally unbalanced to the point\r<br>\r<br>            that he  might actually shoot  Martinez, but a  stable person\r<br>\r<br>            only engaged in harassment or horseplay; and (2) Valentin was\r<br>\r<br>            skilled  enough with firearms to be allowed to engage in this\r<br>\r<br>            sort of stupidity.  Consequently, the record gives rise to an\r<br>\r<br>            inference that Valentin's  police-officer status  was a  sine\r                                                                     ____\r<br>\r<br>            qua non of  the bystander officers' non-intervention.   In my\r            ___ ___\r<br>\r<br>            view,  this inference  establishes  that Valentin  was acting\r<br>\r<br>            under color of state law. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          29\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      The majority suggests  that Martinez's status as  a\r                                                  __________\r<br>\r<br>            police  officer somehow reduced  the likelihood that Martinez\r<br>\r<br>            perceived Valentin  to be acting  with the imprimatur  of the\r<br>\r<br>            Commonwealth.

After  the\r<br>\r<br>            bystander officers  (including Trinidad, who  had supervisory\r<br>\r<br>            authority) failed  to intervene during the  initial rounds of\r<br>\r<br>            abuse by  Valentin, Martinez  could well have  concluded that\r<br>\r<br>            this  type of hazing of  young officers was  standard fare in\r<br>\r<br>            the Loiza  Street Precinct.   Therefore, Martinez  could well\r<br>\r<br>            have  believed that the Commonwealth acquiesced in Valentin's\r<br>\r<br>            actions.\r<br>\r<br>                      Because Valentin  was acting  under color  of state\r<br>\r<br>            law,  I think  it pellucid  that DeShaney  does not  bar this\r                                             ________\r<br>\r<br>            suit.

The majority concedes  that\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin's use  of his service revolver  might arguably bring\r<br>\r<br>            his actions within the color of state law.  Ante at 16.

I cannot help but wonder why the straw man  approach\r<br>\r<br>            was used.  In any event, I disagree on both grounds.\r<br>\r<br>                      Fairly   construed,    Martinez's   argument   that\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin's status  as an  on-duty police  officer made  him a\r<br>\r<br>            state actor incorporates the  argument that Valentin used the\r<br>\r<br>            indicia  and  tools  of  his  trade  (including  his  service\r<br>\r<br>            revolver) to  carry out the shooting.   For me,  this is more\r<br>\r<br>            than enough to  allow us  to consider Valentin's  use of  his\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          31\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            service  revolver as a factor in determining whether he was a\r<br>\r<br>            state actor.\r<br>\r<br>                      I  am also  am troubled  by the  majority's finding\r<br>\r<br>            that  Martinez waived his equal protection claim.

I  disagree.   As  the  majority concedes,  it  was\r<br>\r<br>            settled at the time of the events in this case that \r<br>\r<br>                      [a]n officer who is present  at the scene\r<br>                      [of  an  arrest]  and who  fails  to take\r<br>                      reasonable steps to protect the victim of\r<br>                      another officer's use of  excessive force\r<br>                      can be held liable under section 1983 for\r<br>                      his nonfeasance,  provided that he  had a\r<br>                      realistic  opportunity   to  prevent  the\r<br>                      other officer's actions.   \r<br>\r<br>            Ante at  9 (citations and internal  quotation marks omitted).\r            ____\r<br>\r<br>            In my view, this line of authority controls here.  \r<br>\r<br>                      The  majority  distinguishes   this  precedent   by\r<br>\r<br>            suggesting  that it  is  inapplicable  where  the  tortfeasor\r<br>\r<br>            officer is not acting under the  color of state law, and then\r<br>\r<br>            concludes  that Valentin  was not  so acting  here.   For the\r<br>\r<br>            reasons I have explained above (and despite the opinion of my\r<br>\r<br>            esteemed  colleagues), I  do  not think  that an  objectively\r<br>\r<br>            reasonable police officer could have seen Valentin's  actions\r<br>\r<br>            as purely private.  And because Valentin was acting under the\r<br>\r<br>            color  of  state  law,   the  aforementioned  authority   was\r<br>\r<br>            sufficient to have informed defendants of their obligation to\r<br>\r<br>            intervene  on Martinez's behalf.

If excessive  force during\r<br>\r<br>            the course of  a lawful arrest requires  intervention, so too\r<br>\r<br>            should an  assault with a  deadly weapon taking  place during\r<br>\r<br>            the  course of  an entirely  unlawful seizure.

When an officer abuses those\r<br>\r<br>            powers in front  of his  peers, he in  effect presumes  their\r<br>\r<br>            tacit  acquiescence,  if  not  outright approval.    In  this\r<br>\r<br>            situation, the  other officers have a  constitutional duty to\r<br>\r<br>            intervene.

In  our view,\r<br>\r<br>          these  details  are not  relevant to  the  legal issues  posed on\r<br>\r<br>          appeal.\r<br>\r<br>                    In the early morning hours  of May 26, 1988, plaintiff-\r<br>\r<br>          appellant  Wilfredo Martinez  Rodriguez  (Martinez),  a  youthful\r<br>\r<br>          member of Puerto Rico's  police force, drove to the  Loiza Street\r<br>\r<br>          Precinct,  located in  the  San Juan  metropolitan area.   Though\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez was not scheduled to begin his shift until 4:00 a.m., he\r<br>\r<br>          arrived  early, pursuant to local custom, in order to procure his\r<br>\r<br>          post  assignment.  Martinez alleges that he  was on duty from the\r<br>\r<br>          moment  he arrived    even before his shift  began   because from\r<br>\r<br>          that  point  forward he  was  subject  to  the shift  commander's\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          2\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          orders.\r<br>\r<br>                    Upon  Martinez' arrival,  a fellow  officer who  was on\r<br>\r<br>          duty at  the time,  Angel Valentin Corali  (Valentin), approached\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez' car and called him \"pretty boy\" (\"papito lindo\").  When\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez alighted, Valentin drew his service revolver, pointed it\r<br>\r<br>          at Martinez' stomach, cocked the hammer, placed his finger on the\r<br>\r<br>          trigger,  and  inquired if  Martinez was  afraid.   Valentin then\r<br>\r<br>          disarmed  the weapon,  and Martinez  hurried inside  the station,\r<br>\r<br>          first telling  Valentin:  \"Don't  horse around with  that because\r<br>\r<br>          you will kill me.\"\r<br>\r<br>                    Shortly  after  this  fracas  had   occurred,  Valentin\r<br>\r<br>          accosted Martinez in the  radio room, inserted his finger  into a\r<br>\r<br>          small hole in Martinez'  undershirt, and ripped it.   Once again,\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez walked away  from Valentin.   He then  changed into  his\r<br>\r<br>          uniform, entered  the waiting  room, and  reported  to his  shift\r<br>\r<br>          supervisor, defendant-appellee Juan Trinidad Marrero (Trinidad).\r<br>\r<br>                    Soon  thereafter,  Valentin  reappeared,   pointed  his\r<br>\r<br>          revolver at Martinez' genitals, cocked  the hammer, and, with his\r<br>\r<br>          finger on the trigger, threatened to \"blow away\" Martinez'  penis\r<br>\r<br>          (asking  him, somewhat  rhetorically, if  he was  scared).   When\r<br>\r<br>          Valentin lowered the weapon, Martinez immediately moved away from\r<br>\r<br>          him.   Within minutes Valentin again  approached Martinez, cocked\r<br>\r<br>          the  revolver,  aimed  it  at Martinez'  groin,  and  resumed his\r<br>\r<br>          taunting.     The   revolver  accidentally   discharged,  maiming\r<br>\r<br>          Martinez.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  first  encounter  took  place  in  the  precinct's\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          3\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          parking lot and  the rest transpired  inside the police  station.\r<br>\r<br>          According to Martinez, roughly  twenty minutes elapsed from start\r<br>\r<br>          to finish.  All  parties agree that the shooting,  which occurred\r<br>\r<br>          before the 4:00 a.m. shift change, was unintentional.1\r<br>\r<br>                               B.

Velez Rentas\r<br>\r<br>          (Velez),  and  Trinidad  (collectively, \"the  officers\"  or  \"the\r<br>\r<br>          defendants\").2     Invoking  42  U.S.C.      1983  and  premising\r<br>\r<br>          jurisdiction  on the  existence  of a  federal  question, see  28\r                                                                    ___\r<br>\r<br>          U.S.C.     1331  (1988), he  alleged  that  his  rights had  been\r<br>\r<br>          abridged in that each  defendant owed him a duty to intervene and\r<br>\r<br>          protect  him  from readily  discernible harm  at  the hands  of a\r<br>\r<br>          fellow  officer,  but  each   defendant  breached  this  duty  by\r<br>\r<br>          subsequent  inaction.3   Martinez  asserted  pendent tort  claims\r<br>\r<br>          with respect  to  all  three  defendants  and,  with  respect  to\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               1In  his memorandum of law  in support of  his opposition to\r<br>          defendant  Carlos Lopez-Feliciano's  motion to  dismiss, Martinez\r<br>          stated that  \"the revolver apparently fired by accident.\"  Record\r<br>          Appendix  at  21.   At  any  rate,  the  summary judgment  record\r<br>          contains no facts that would support a contrary finding; and, for\r<br>          aught  that appears,  Martinez has  never asserted  that Valentin\r<br>          shot him intentionally.\r<br>\r<br>               2Plaintiff asserted claims against several other defendants,\r<br>          including  Valentin and  Lopez-Feliciano.   Those claims  are not\r<br>          before us, and we ignore them for purposes of this opinion.\r<br>\r<br>               3Although  the underlying  facts  are  hotly  contested,  we\r<br>          assume  for purposes of this  appeal, as Martinez  would have it,\r<br>          that  all three  defendants witnessed  the entire  progression of\r<br>          events and had a meaningful opportunity to intervene at each step\r<br>          along the way.\r<br>\r<br>                                          4\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          Trinidad,  asserted a  section  1983 claim  based on  supervisory\r<br>\r<br>          liability.\r<br>\r<br>                    After  a  flurry of  pretrial  discovery,  the officers\r<br>\r<br>          moved for  summary  judgment.   They  argued,  inter  alia,  that\r                                                         _____  ____\r<br>\r<br>          Valentin was not acting under color  of state law when the mishap\r<br>\r<br>          occurred; and that, therefore,  onlooker officers did not have  a\r<br>\r<br>          constitutional  duty  to  intervene  on Martinez'  behalf.    The\r<br>\r<br>          district  court   referred  the  motions  and   Martinez'  timely\r<br>\r<br>          opposition to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate concluded that,\r<br>\r<br>          under DeShaney, the officers  had no constitutional obligation to\r                ________\r<br>\r<br>          protect Martinez from Valentin's  actions, and urged the district\r<br>\r<br>          court to grant summary  judgment.  The plaintiff objected  to the\r<br>\r<br>          magistrate's report and  recommendation, but the  district court,\r<br>\r<br>          affording de novo review, see Fed. R. Civ.  P. 72(b), adopted the\r                    __ ____         ___\r<br>\r<br>          report,  accepted   the  recommendation,  and   entered  judgment\r<br>\r<br>          accordingly.  This appeal followed.\r<br>\r<br>          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r<br>\r<br>                    A district  court may  grant summary judgment  only \"if\r<br>\r<br>          the  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\r<br>\r<br>          admissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\r<br>\r<br>          that there is  no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that\r<br>\r<br>          the  moving party is entitled to a  judgment as a matter of law.\"\r<br>\r<br>          Fed.

I\r<br>\r<br>            start  with  the  facts.   Although  the  majority's  factual\r<br>\r<br>            recitation  is  not  inaccurate,  it  is  not  a  full-bodied\r<br>\r<br>            portrayal of what happened.\r<br>\r<br>                                          I.\r                                          I.\r<br>\r<br>                      Plaintiff, Martinez,  was a young (age  twenty) and\r<br>\r<br>            comparatively new member of the Puerto Rico Police Force.  On\r<br>\r<br>            the day of the events giving rise to this case, he arrived at\r<br>\r<br>            the police station  sufficiently early to  be given his  duty\r<br>\r<br>            assignment.   Martinez parked  his car in  the police parking\r<br>\r<br>            lot.   He got out of  his car and started  towards the police\r<br>\r<br>            station to get his orders for the day.  There were four other\r<br>\r<br>            police officers in the  lot:  the defendants --  Colon, V lez\r<br>\r<br>            and Trinidad -- and Valentin, who is not a defendant.  As the\r<br>\r<br>            majority  acknowledges, the defendants  were, at all relevant\r<br>\r<br>            times, on duty as  police officers and acting under  color of\r<br>\r<br>            state  law.   The three  defendants observed the  events that\r<br>\r<br>            took  place in  the parking  lot and  the police  station and\r<br>\r<br>            heard Valentin's  denigrating remarks  to Martinez.   None of\r<br>\r<br>            the defendants asked Valentin to stop his verbal and physical\r<br>\r<br>            assaults  against Martinez.  To put it starkly, they stood by\r<br>\r<br>            and  watched without protest  Valentin \"blow away\" Martinez's\r<br>\r<br>            penis.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          26\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      As Martinez walked across the parking lot, Valentin\r<br>\r<br>            said  to the defendants,  \"Here comes Pretty  Boy.\"  Valentin\r<br>\r<br>            then accosted Martinez, drew his service revolver, pointed it\r<br>\r<br>            directly  at  Martinez's genital  area,  cocked  it, put  his\r<br>\r<br>            finger on the trigger,  asked Martinez if he was  afraid, and\r<br>\r<br>            then  lowered the revolver.  Martinez  told Valentin:  \"Don't\r<br>\r<br>            horse around with that  because you will kill me.\"   Martinez\r<br>\r<br>            then  proceeded into the station  house.  A  short time later\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin again  confronted Martinez; this time  he pushed his\r<br>\r<br>            finger through a hole in Martinez's undershirt and ripped the\r<br>\r<br>            shirt open.  The  record does not disclose whether  any words\r<br>\r<br>            were  spoken  at this  juncture.    Martinez put  his  police\r<br>\r<br>            uniform on  and reported  to his shift  supervisor, defendant\r<br>\r<br>            Trinidad.\r<br>\r<br>                      A  short   time  later  Valentin   again  assaulted\r<br>\r<br>            Martinez.     This   assault   was  similar   to  the   first\r<br>\r<br>            confrontation,  but  with  an  ominous  threat.    This  time\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin pushed  the muzzle of his loaded and cocked revolver\r<br>\r<br>            into the front of  Martinez's pants  and threatened  to \"blow\r<br>\r<br>            away\" Martinez's penis.

He loaded  and cocked  his revolver  and\r<br>\r<br>            then inserted  it into  the front  of Martinez's pants  while\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          27\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            continuing to verbally  abuse him.

I think that Valentin exercised power possessed\r<br>\r<br>            by virtue of Puerto  Rico law and made possible  only because\r<br>\r<br>            he was clothed with the authority of Puerto Rico, and that he\r<br>\r<br>            abused that power.\r<br>\r<br>                      Even if  I disregard  the obvious --  that Valentin\r<br>\r<br>            was in uniform, on duty, in the police station, and used  his\r<br>\r<br>            service  revolver to commit  the tort (all  of which militate\r<br>\r<br>            heavily  in  favor  of a  finding  that  Valentin  abused his\r<br>\r<br>            position as a  police officer) --  I believe that  Valentin's\r<br>\r<br>            status as a police officer was the only reason the defendants\r<br>\r<br>            took  no action.  If Valentin  had been a private citizen and\r<br>\r<br>            had  been  tormenting  Martinez   in  the  same  manner,  the\r<br>\r<br>            bystander  officers certainly  would  have  intervened.   The\r<br>\r<br>            record gives  rise to a reasonable  inference that Valentin's\r<br>\r<br>            police-officer status led the bystander officers  to conclude\r<br>\r<br>            that:   (1) Valentin was not mentally unbalanced to the point\r<br>\r<br>            that he  might actually shoot  Martinez, but a  stable person\r<br>\r<br>            only engaged in harassment or horseplay; and (2) Valentin was\r<br>\r<br>            skilled  enough with firearms to be allowed to engage in this\r<br>\r<br>            sort of stupidity.  Consequently, the record gives rise to an\r<br>\r<br>            inference that Valentin's  police-officer status  was a  sine\r                                                                     ____\r<br>\r<br>            qua non of  the bystander officers' non-intervention.   In my\r            ___ ___\r<br>\r<br>            view,  this inference  establishes  that Valentin  was acting\r<br>\r<br>            under color of state law. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          29\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                      The majority suggests  that Martinez's status as  a\r                                                  __________\r<br>\r<br>            police  officer somehow reduced  the likelihood that Martinez\r<br>\r<br>            perceived Valentin  to be acting  with the imprimatur  of the\r<br>\r<br>            Commonwealth.

After  the\r<br>\r<br>            bystander officers  (including Trinidad, who  had supervisory\r<br>\r<br>            authority) failed  to intervene during the  initial rounds of\r<br>\r<br>            abuse by  Valentin, Martinez  could well have  concluded that\r<br>\r<br>            this  type of hazing of  young officers was  standard fare in\r<br>\r<br>            the Loiza  Street Precinct.   Therefore, Martinez  could well\r<br>\r<br>            have  believed that the Commonwealth acquiesced in Valentin's\r<br>\r<br>            actions.\r<br>\r<br>                      Because Valentin  was acting  under color  of state\r<br>\r<br>            law,  I think  it pellucid  that DeShaney  does not  bar this\r                                             ________\r<br>\r<br>            suit.

The majority concedes  that\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin's use  of his service revolver  might arguably bring\r<br>\r<br>            his actions within the color of state law.  Ante at 16.

I cannot help but wonder why the straw man  approach\r<br>\r<br>            was used.  In any event, I disagree on both grounds.\r<br>\r<br>                      Fairly   construed,    Martinez's   argument   that\r<br>\r<br>            Valentin's status  as an  on-duty police  officer made  him a\r<br>\r<br>            state actor incorporates the  argument that Valentin used the\r<br>\r<br>            indicia  and  tools  of  his  trade  (including  his  service\r<br>\r<br>            revolver) to  carry out the shooting.   For me,  this is more\r<br>\r<br>            than enough to  allow us  to consider Valentin's  use of  his\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          31\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            service  revolver as a factor in determining whether he was a\r<br>\r<br>            state actor.\r<br>\r<br>                      I  am also  am troubled  by the  majority's finding\r<br>\r<br>            that  Martinez waived his equal protection claim.

As  the  majority concedes,  it  was\r<br>\r<br>            settled at the time of the events in this case that \r<br>\r<br>                      [a]n officer who is present  at the scene\r<br>                      [of  an  arrest]  and who  fails  to take\r<br>                      reasonable steps to protect the victim of\r<br>                      another officer's use of  excessive force\r<br>                      can be held liable under section 1983 for\r<br>                      his nonfeasance,  provided that he  had a\r<br>                      realistic  opportunity   to  prevent  the\r<br>                      other officer's actions.   \r<br>\r<br>            Ante at  9 (citations and internal  quotation marks omitted).\r            ____\r<br>\r<br>            In my view, this line of authority controls here.  \r<br>\r<br>                      The  majority  distinguishes   this  precedent   by\r<br>\r<br>            suggesting  that it  is  inapplicable  where  the  tortfeasor\r<br>\r<br>            officer is not acting under the  color of state law, and then\r<br>\r<br>            concludes  that Valentin  was not  so acting  here.   For the\r<br>\r<br>            reasons I have explained above (and despite the opinion of my\r<br>\r<br>            esteemed  colleagues), I  do  not think  that an  objectively\r<br>\r<br>            reasonable police officer could have seen Valentin's  actions\r<br>\r<br>            as purely private.  And because Valentin was acting under the\r<br>\r<br>            color  of  state  law,   the  aforementioned  authority   was\r<br>\r<br>            sufficient to have informed defendants of their obligation to\r<br>\r<br>            intervene  on Martinez's behalf.   See Anderson,  483 U.S. at\r                                               ___ ________\r<br>\r<br>            640 (\"This is not to say that an official action is protected\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          34\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>            by qualified immunity unless the very  action in question has\r<br>\r<br>            previously been held unlawful, but  it is to say that  in the\r<br>\r<br>            light   of  pre-existing   law   the  unlawfulness   must  be\r<br>\r<br>            apparent.\")  (citation omitted).   If excessive  force during\r<br>\r<br>            the course of  a lawful arrest requires  intervention, so too\r<br>\r<br>            should an  assault with a  deadly weapon taking  place during\r<br>\r<br>            the  course of  an entirely  unlawful seizure.    I therefore\r                                         ________\r<br>\r<br>            disagree with the majority's qualified immunity analysis.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                         IV.\r                                         IV.\r<br>\r<br>                      Police  officers are entrusted with great powers --\r<br>\r<br>            including the privileged use of force -- for the very purpose\r<br>\r<br>            of preventing lawless violence.  When an officer abuses those\r<br>\r<br>            powers in front  of his  peers, he in  effect presumes  their\r<br>\r<br>            tacit  acquiescence,  if  not  outright approval.    In  this\r<br>\r<br>            situation, the  other officers have a  constitutional duty to\r<br>\r<br>            intervene.  I therefore respectfully dissent.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          35\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",
