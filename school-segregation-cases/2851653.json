GUARDIAN SECURITY SERVICES, INC.,\nd/b/a GUARDIAN SECURITY SERVICES,\n\nDefendant-Appellee.\n\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.\nNo. 97 C 8311--Suzanne B. Conlon, Judge.\n\n\nArgued February 23, 1999--Decided July 5, 2000\n\n\n\n  Before COFFEY, RIPPLE, and ROVNER, Circuit Judges.\n\n  ROVNER, Circuit Judge. Kyra Kyles and Lolita\nPierce worked for the Legal Assistance Foundation\nof Chicago (\"LAF\") as employment testers./1 In\nthat capacity, they applied for work as a\nreceptionist with Guardian Security Services\n(\"Guardian\"). Although each of their white\ncounterparts was offered the job, neither Kyles\nnor Pierce, both of whom are African-American,\ngot past the initial interview. They sued\nGuardian for race discrimination under Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e, as well as section 1 of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866, 42 U.S.C. sec. 1981. The district\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of\nGuardian, reasoning that, as testers with no\ngenuine interest in employment with Guardian,\nKyles and Pierce lacked standing to sue. We\nconclude that testers do have standing to sue for\nviolations of Title VII, but not section 1981.\n\nI.\n\n  Because the district court entered summary\njudgment in favor of Guardian, we owe Kyles and\nPierce a favorable summary of the facts. See\nFrobose v. American Sav. & Loan Ass’n of\nDanville, 152 F.3d 602, 604 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n  LAF is a public-interest law firm that provides\n\flegal assistance to individuals who lack the\nmeans to retain counsel privately. Its employment\ntesting project aims to detect discrimination in\nthe employment sector using testing methods that\nhave been used for years to assess compliance\nwith the nation’s fair housing laws.\nSpecifically, in order to detect racial\ndiscrimination, LAF pairs a white tester with one\nof color, provides them both with fictitious\ncredentials designed to be comparable in all\npertinent respects (and perhaps somewhat more\nfavorable to the non-white tester/2), trains\nthem to interview similarly, and then sends them\nto apply for work with the same employer. The\ntesters later prepare detailed reports of their\nexperiences. The project director reviews the\ndata, and when it appears that an employer is\nengaged in discrimination, informs the testers.\nAlone or in conjunction with bona fide job\napplicants, the testers who were rejected for\nemployment may then pursue administrative and\njudicial remedies, as they did in this case. In\norder to remove questions about their objectivity\nand neutrality, however, the testers assigned\ntheir right to damages to LAF, and later to the\nChicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under\nLaw and the Public Interest Law Initiative.\n\n  Kyles and Pierce were college students in 1995\nwhen they took summer jobs with the LAF’s\nemployment testing project. As a condition of\ntheir employment with the project, they agreed to\nrefuse any job offer extended to them in the\ncourse of their testing activities. With the help\nof LAF staff members, Kyles and Pierce then\nprepared fictitious resumes that supplemented\ntheir actual experiences with additional\nemployment, education, and other data aimed at\nmaking them attractive to prospective employers.\n\n  In the Spring of 1995, Guardian placed an\nadvertisement in the Chicago Tribune soliciting\napplications for the position of receptionist.\nLAF sent a pair of resumes to Guardian in\nresponse to the advertisement--one on behalf of\na white candidate and one on behalf of an\nAfrican-American candidate. Each of the resumes\nincluded information that permitted the reader to\ndiscern the race of the applicant. The African-\nAmerican’s resume reflected credentials that were\ncomparable to, if not better than, the white\napplicant. Guardian did not respond to the\nAfrican-American’s application at all, but\ntelephoned three times for the white candidate.\n\n  LAF subsequently sent Kyles and Pierce to\nGuardian to apply in person for the receptionist\nopening. Each was paired with a white tester.\nAlthough Kyles and Pierce were assigned\ncredentials that were comparable or superior to\n\fthose of their white counterparts, neither one of\nthem fared as well in the application process.\n\n  Kyles had an interview with Guardian’s director\nof human resources, Martin Labno, who told her\nthat after consulting with Guardian’s president\nand vice-president, he would ultimately select a\ngroup of three to four individuals to call back\nfor a second interview. When Kyles’ white\ncounterpart applied for the job the following\nday, she interviewed not only with Labno but with\nGuardian’s vice-president, Michael Malinowski,\nreturned a day later for a typing test, and was\noffered the job on the spot. Soon after the white\ntester turned the offer down, Kyles called\nGuardian to check on the status of her\napplication and was told that Labno had not yet\ndecided whom to summon for a second interview.\nShe never heard from Guardian again.\n\n  Within a few days, Pierce applied for the job.\nLabno interviewed her and told her that, after\nconsulting with the company’s president or its\nvice-president, he would be conducting follow-up\ninterviews over the next few days. He promised to\ncall her within a day or two. Pierce’s white\npartner applied for the job on the same day,\ninterviewed with Labno, and took a typing test.\nOne week later, Guardian summoned the white\ntester for a second interview and offered her the\njob. When Pierce telephoned around that time to\ninquire about the status of the selection\nprocess, Labno told her that the company was\n\"running behind.\" The white tester turned down\nthe job offer, but Guardian never followed up\nwith Pierce.\n\n  After securing right-to-sue letters from the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission\n(\"EEOC\"),/3 Kyles and Pierce filed suit against\nGuardian alleging that the company had engaged in\nracial discrimination in violation of both Title\nVII and section 1981. Guardian counterclaimed,\nalleging that Kyles and Pierce had fraudulently\nmisrepresented their interest in employment with\nthe company. On summary judgment, Judge Conlon\nheld that, as testers, Kyles and Pierce lacked\nstanding to maintain the suit. Kyles v. J.K.\nGuardian Security Servs., Inc., 77 Fair Empl. Prac.\nCas. (BNA) 1473, 1998 WL 677165 (N.D. Ill. Sept.\n22, 1998). They were not interested in working\nfor Guardian and would not have accepted\nemployment had the company offered it to them.\nConsequently, they did not suffer the type of\npersonal, redressable injury that would satisfy\nthe \"case or controversy\" requirement found in\nArticle III of the Constitution. Id., at *2. At\nbest, the plaintiffs were asserting the rights of\na \"hypothetical third-party applicant who would\nhave been harmed in a similar situation.\" Id., at\n\f*3. Judge Conlon also found standing wanting as\na statutory matter. Id., at *3-*4. Both Title VII\nand section 1981 condition the right to sue on a\nbona fide application for employment, she\nreasoned. Id., at *3. In that regard, they stand\napart from the Fair Housing Act, under which\ncourts have acknowledged tester standing. Id.\nHaving found that the plaintiffs lacked standing\nto pursue their federal claims, Judge Conlon\nrelinquished jurisdiction over Guardian’s state-\nlaw counterclaims. Id., at *4; see 28 U.S.C. sec.\n1367(c)(3).\n\nII.\n\n  The Constitution confines the federal judicial\npower to \"Cases\" or \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const. Art.\nIII, sec. 2. Implicit in that limitation is the\nrequirement that the party invoking the court’s\njurisdiction have standing. Arizonans for\nOfficial English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 64, 117\nS. Ct. 1055, 1067 (1997); Gillespie v. City of\nIndianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 701 (7th Cir. 1999),\ncert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 934 (2000). Broadly\nspeaking, standing turns on one’s personal stake\nin the dispute. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina\nEnvironmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 72,\n98 S. Ct. 2620, 2630 (1978). In order to\nestablish that interest, the plaintiff must show\nthat: (1) she has suffered an \"injury in fact\"\nthat is (a) concrete and particularized and (b)\nactual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable\nto the challenged action of the defendant; and\n(3) it is likely, as opposed to merely\nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by\na favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130,\n2136 (1992); Gillespie, 185 F.3d at 701.\n\n  A plaintiff’s claim might satisfy each of these\nArticle III criteria and yet run afoul of\njudicially-imposed, prudential limitations on\nstanding. The injury that she claims, for\nexample, may be one that is indistinct from\neffects felt by many or all citizens, depriving\nher of a unique stake in the controversy. See\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S. Ct.\n2197, 2205 (1975). Her claim may rest on the\nlegal rights of third parties, rather than her\nown. Id. at 499, 95 S. Ct. at 2205; see Singleton\nv. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 2874\n(1976). Or her interest, although real, may not\nfall within the zone of interests protected by\nthe statute she invokes. See Simon v. Eastern\nKentucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 39\nn.19, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 1925 n.19 (1976), citing\nAssociation of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc.\nv. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S. Ct. 827, 830\n(1970). Using these prudential considerations,\n\f\"the judiciary seeks to avoid deciding questions\nof broad social import where no individual rights\nwould be vindicated and to limit access to the\nfederal courts to those litigants best suited to\nassert a particular claim.\" Gladstone, Realtors\nv. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99-100, 99\nS. Ct. 1601, 1608 (1979); see also Massey v.\nHelman, 196 F.3d 727, 739 (7th Cir. 1999),\npetition for cert. filed (May 30, 2000) (No. 99-\n1918).\n\n  Where federal statutory rights are at issue,\nhowever, Congress has considerable authority to\nshape the assessment of standing. First, although\nit may not lower the threshold for standing below\nthe minimum requirements imposed by the\nConstitution, Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820\nn.3, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 2318 n.3 (1997), Congress\ncan extend standing to the outermost limits of\nArticle III. For example, it may permit an\nindividual who suffers an injury-in-fact to bring\nsuit for a statutory violation even if one\nnormally would not think of that person as an\nintended beneficiary of the statute; or it can\npermit someone to seek relief based on the legal\nrights of individuals other than himself. See\nWarth, 422 U.S. at 500-01, 95 S. Ct. at 2206;\nNorth Shore Gas Co. v. E.P.A., 930 F.2d 1239,\n1243-44 (7th Cir. 1991). When Congress confers\nsuch a broad right to sue, the judiciary may not\nclose the doors to the courthouse by invoking\nprudential considerations. See Raines, 521 U.S.\nat 820 n.3, 117 S.Ct. at 2318 n.3; Havens Realty\nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372, 102 S. Ct.\n1114, 1121 (1982). Second, Congress has the power\nto \"enact statutes creating legal rights, the\ninvasion of which creates standing, even though\nno injury would exist without the statute.\" Linda\nR. S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 617 n.3, 93 S.\nCt. 1146, 1148 n.3 (1973).\n\n  As we shall see, then, whether a person has\nArticle III standing to sue under either Title\nVII or section 1981 depends in great measure on\nthe particular rights conferred by those\nstatutes. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 500-01, 95 S.\nCt. at 2206. Family & Children’s Center, Inc. v.\nSchool City of Mishawaka, 13 F.3d 1052, 1059-60\n(7th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 961, 115 S. Ct.\n420 (1994). We will proceed to examine each\nstatute in turn.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\n  Title VII provides that \"[i]t shall be an\nunlawful employment practice for an employer--(1)\nto fail or refuse to hire . . . any individual .\n. . because of such individual’s race . . . ; or\n(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n\femployees or applicants for employment in any way\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities or\notherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of such individual’s race. . .\n.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 2000e-2(a). Congress granted\nthe EEOC authority to enforce the provisions of\nthe statute, but it did not stop there; it also\nenabled individuals to act as \"private attorneys\ngeneral\" by pursuing their own claims of\nemployment discrimination. Newman v. Piggie Park\nEnters., Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S. Ct. 964,\n966 (1968) (per curiam). The statute thus\nexpressly permits a charge to be filed with the\nCommission \"by or on behalf of a person claiming\nto be aggrieved,\" sec. 2000e-5(b), and likewise\na civil action in court \"by the person claiming\nto be aggrieved,\" sec. 2000e-5(f)(1). That\nlanguage signals a congressional intent to extend\nstanding to the outermost limits of Article III.\nSee Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,\n409 U.S. 205, 209, 93 S. Ct. 364, 366-67 (1972),\nciting Hackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F.2d\n442, 446 (3d Cir. 1971); Anjelino v. New York\nTimes Co., 200 F.3d 73, 91 & n.25 (3d Cir. 1999);\nStewart v. Hannon, 675 F.2d 846, 849 (7th Cir.\n1982); E.E.O.C. v. Mississippi College, 626 F.2d\n477, 482-83 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied,\n453 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 3143 (1981); E.E.O.C. v.\nBailey Co., 563 F.2d 439, 452-54 (6th Cir. 1977),\ncert. denied, 435 U.S. 915, 98 S. Ct. 1468\n(1978); Waters v. Heublein, Inc., 547 F.2d 466,\n469-70 (9th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 433 U.S.\n915, 97 S. Ct. 2988 (1977); Gray v. Greyhound\nLines, East, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C. Cir. 1976).\nThe essential question before us, then, is\nwhether a tester \"claiming to be aggrieved\" by an\nemployment practice that Title VII proscribes has\nsuffered the injury-in-fact that Article III\ndemands.\n\n  For guidance in answering this question, we\nturn first to case law concerning Title VIII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n3601, et seq., which prohibits discrimination in\nthe housing sector and is more commonly known as\nthe Fair Housing Act. Courts have recognized that\nTitle VIII is the functional equivalent of Title\nVII, Bailey Co., 563 F.2d at 452-53; Waters, 547\nF.2d at 469, and so the provisions of these two\nstatutes are given like construction and\napplication. See Stewart, 675 F.2d at 849;\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of\nArlington Heights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1289 (7th Cir.\n1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1025, 98 S. Ct. 752\n(1978); see also Anjelino, 200 F.3d at 90-91 &\nnn. 23, 25; Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., 736\nF.2d 983, 987 (4th Cir. 1984); Mississippi\nCollege, 626 F.2d at 482-83 & n.7; Bailey Co.,\n563 F.2d at 452-53; Waters, 547 F.2d at 469-70.\n\fLike its companion, Title VIII permits a charge\nand a civil action to be filed by any person\n\"aggrieved\" by a violation of the statute. 42\nU.S.C. sec.sec. 3610(a)(1)(A)(i), 3602(i); see\nTrafficante, 409 U.S. at 209, 95 S. Ct. at 366-67\n(1972). Courts have construed those provisions to\nconfer standing on testers challenging a variety\nof unlawful housing practices.\n\n  In Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, the Supreme\nCourt held that testers have standing to bring\nsuit for alleged violations of section 804(d) of\nthe Fair Housing Act, which makes it an unlawful\npractice \"[t]o represent to any person because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin\nthat any dwelling is not available for\ninspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is\nin fact so available.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 3604(d).\nThe complaint in Havens Realty alleged that the\ndefendant realty firm engaged in racial steering\nby misinforming African-Americans that no\napartments were available in one of its\ncomplexes. The plaintiffs included an African-\nAmerican man who had unsuccessfully sought\nhousing from the defendant, as well as a local\norganization that promoted equal housing\nopportunities and two testers that the\norganization had engaged specifically to\ndetermine whether the defendant was engaging in\nunlawful steering. The district court had\ndismissed the testers from the case, but the\nSupreme Court concluded that one of them had\nstanding to sue.\n\n  Citing its earlier decision in Gladstone,\nRealtors v. Village of Bellwood, supra, 441 U.S.\n91, 99 S. Ct. 1601, the Court at the outset\nemphasized:\n\n\"Congress intended standing under [the Fair\nHousing Act] to extend to the full limits of Art.\nIII\" and . . . the courts accordingly lack the\nauthority to create prudential barriers to\nstanding in suits brought under that section. Id.\nat 103, n.9, 109, 99 S. Ct. at 1609, n.9, 1612.\nThus the sole requirement for standing to sue\nunder [the Fair Housing Act] is the Art. III\nminima of injury in fact: that the plaintiff\nallege that as a result of the defendant’s\nactions he has suffered \"a distinct and palpable\ninjury,\" Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95\nS. Ct. 2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975).\n\n455 U.S. at 372, 102 S. Ct. at 1121. When\nCongress enacted the Fair Housing Act, the Court\nwent on to explain, it conferred upon \"any\nperson\" a right to truthful information about the\navailability of housing; and it made that and the\nother provisions of the Act enforceable by means\nof a private civil suit. Id. at 373, 102 S. Ct.\n\fat 1121, citing 42 U.S.C. sec. 3604(d).\n\n  In this way, Congress had created a legal\nright, the denial of which would, in and of\nitself, give rise to the type of injury necessary\nto establish standing in conformance with Article\nIII. Ibid. Thus, any person given false\ninformation about the availability of housing has\nstanding to sue, irrespective of her intent in\ninquiring about the housing in question.\n\nA tester who has been the object of a\nmisrepresentation made unlawful under sec. 804(d)\nhas suffered injury in precisely the form the\nstatute was intended to guard against, and\ntherefore has standing to maintain a claim for\ndamages under the Act’s provisions. That the\ntester may have approached the real estate agent\nfully expecting that he would receive false\ninformation, and without any intention of buying\nor renting a home, does not negate the simple\nfact of injury within the meaning of sec. 804(d).\nSee Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 558, 87 S. Ct.\n1213, 1219, 18 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1967); Evers v.\nDwyer, 358 U.S. 202, 204, 79 S. Ct. 178, 179, 3\nL. Ed. 2d 222 (1985) (per curiam).\n\n455 U.S. at 373-74, 102 S.Ct. at 1121-22./4 The\nCourt thus concluded that one--but not both--of\nthe testers had standing to sue under the\nstatute. The African-American tester alleged that\nshe had been wrongly informed on four separate\noccasions that an apartment was unavailable at\nthe defendant’s properties; whereas her Caucasian\ncounterpart had been told that apartments were\navailable. The former thus suffered an injury\ncognizable under the statute, while the latter\ndid not. Id. at 374-75; 102 S. Ct. at 1122.\n\n  Following Havens, this court concluded in\nVillage of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521 (7th\nCir. 1990), that testers have standing to sue\nunder other provisions of the Fair Housing Act.\nAlthough section 804(d) forbids false statements\nthat housing is unavailable, as we noted above,\nsection 804(a) makes it illegal, inter alia, for\none to make housing unavailable to a person\nbecause of his race (see n.6, infra), and section\n804(b) proscribes racial discrimination in the\nprovision of services in connection with the sale\nof a dwelling. The plaintiffs in Dwivedi, who\nagain included testers, alleged that a real\nestate brokerage firm, its owner, and two of its\nemployees had engaged in racial steering by\nencouraging African-American home seekers toward\nareas with a substantial African-American\npopulation while encouraging Caucasian buyers\ntoward areas that did not. Although we thought\nthe standing of the testers, \"as an original\nmatter,\" to be \"dubious,\" 895 F.2d at 1526, we\n\facknowledged Havens’ holding that testers have\nstanding to sue for violations of section 804(d).\nNo misrepresentations as the availability of\nhousing actionable under that section were proven\nin Dwivedi. But the essential point of Havens was\nthat \"Congress can create new substantive rights,\nsuch as a right to be free from\nmisrepresentations, and if that right is invaded\nthe holder of the right can sue without running\nafoul of Article III, even if he incurs no other\ninjury (for example, the loss of a home-buying\nopportunity).\" Id. at 1526-27. We were therefore\nconvinced that testers had standing to sue, not\njust for receipt of false information in\nviolation of section 804(d), but for other\nviolations of the statute as well:\n\n[T]he logic of Havens embraces discrimination in\nthe provision of services, forbidden explicitly\nby section [804(b)] and implicitly by section\n[804(a)]. If the plaintiffs’ evidence is\nbelieved, the testers were treated in a racially\ndiscriminatory fashion, even though they\nsustained no harm beyond the discrimination\nitself, just as testers are not fooled by the\nmisrepresentations made to them.\n\nId. at 1527.\n\n  Since Dwivedi was decided, we have twice\nconfirmed its holding expressly. See United\nStates v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916, 929 (7th Cir.\n1992) (\"offering black testers apartments at\nhigher rental rates than those offered to white\ntesters discriminates in the terms of rentals and\nviolates the Act\"), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 812,\n114 S. Ct. 58 (1993); City of Chicago v.\nMatchmaker Real Estate Sales Center, Inc., 982\nF.2d 1086, 1095 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"the testers were\ntreated in a ’racially discriminatory fashion,\neven though they sustained no harm beyond the\ndiscrimination itself’\") (quoting Dwivedi, 895\nF.2d at 1527), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 972, 113 S.\nCt. 2961 (1993). Notwithstanding our initial\nskepticism on the subject, then, it is now well\nestablished in this circuit that testers who\nexperience housing discrimination suffer a\ncognizable injury that gives them standing to sue\nfor a variety of Fair Housing Act violations. See\nid. at 1095 (finding that testers have standing\nto sue for violations of sections 804(a), (b),\nand (d) of the Fair Housing Act); Balistrieri,\n981 F.2d at 929 (showing black testers fewer\napartments, and quoting them higher rents and/or\nlater dates of availability, constituted\ncognizable violations of sections 804(b) and (d)\nof the Fair Housing Act, notwithstanding the fact\nthat testers were not bona fide apartment\nseekers); see also Timm v. Progressive Steel\nTreating, Inc., 137 F.3d 1008, 1010 (7th Cir.\n\f1998) (\"’Testers’ in housing discrimination cases\nare allowed to recover exemplary damages even\nthough they do not want to occupy the apartments\nfor which they apply . . . .\").\n\n  Title VII contains no provision comparable to\nsection 804(d) of the Fair Housing Act. The\ndistrict court seized upon that point of\ndistinction as a basis for holding that testers\nlack standing to complain of employment\ndiscrimination under Title VII. 1998 WL 677165,\nat *3. In the other key respects we have\nmentioned, however, the statutes are quite\nsimilar: Both take broad aim at discrimination in\ntheir respective sectors and in that sense are\nthe functional equivalents of one another;\nE.E.O.C. v. Bailey Co., supra, 563 F.2d at 453,\n454; both authorize individuals to bring suit for\nstatutory violations and in this way to act as\n\"private attorneys general,\" Trafficante v.\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. at 209, 93\nS. Ct. at 366-67; Bailey Co., 563 F.2d at 453;\nand in permitting any person aggrieved by a\nviolation to file a charge and suit, both reflect\na congressional intent to extend standing to the\nfullest extent permitted by Article III of the\nConstitution, see Trafficante, 409 U.S. at 209,\n93 S. Ct. at 366-67; Anjelino v. New York Times\nCo., supra, 200 F.3d at 90-91 & n.25; Stewart v.\nHannon, supra, 675 F.2d at 849; E.E.O.C. v.\nMississippi College, supra, 626 F.2d at 482-83 &\nn.7; Bailey Co., 563 F.2d at 453; Waters v.\nHeublein, Inc., supra, 547 F.2d at 469-70; Gray\nv. Greyhound Lines, East, supra, 545 F.2d at 176;\nHackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., supra, 445 F.2d\nat 446.\n\n  Havens and Dwivedi guide us to the conclusion\nthat testers who experience discrimination as\nthey apply for jobs have standing to sue under\nTitle VII. When Congress made it unlawful for an\nemployer \"to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees or applicants in any way which would\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his status as an employee . . . because of\nsuch individual’s race. . . .,\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(a)(2), it created a broad substantive\nright that extends far beyond the simple refusal\nor failure to hire. Cf. sec. 2000e-2(a)(1). When\na job applicant is not considered for a job\nsimply because she is African-American, she has\nbeen limited, segregated or classified in a way\nthat would tend to deprive not only her, but any\nother individual who happens to be a person of\ncolor, of employment opportunities. In other\nwords, she suffers an injury \"in precisely the\nform the statute was intended to guard against,\"\njust as she would if, as a housing tester, she\nwere falsely informed that a vacant apartment was\n\funavailable. Havens, 455 U.S. at 373, 102 S. Ct.\nat 1121. She therefore has standing to sue, even\nif she has not been harmed apart from the\nstatutory violation--even if, for example, she\nwas not genuinely interested in the job she\napplied for and in that sense was not harmed by\nthe employer’s refusal to hire her. See Dwivedi,\n895 F.2d at 1526-27; see also Molovinsky v. Fair\nEmployment Council of Greater Washington, Inc.,\n683 A.2d 142, 146 (D.C.1996) (per curiam)\n(testers have standing to sue for sexual\nharassment under local ordinance, akin to Title\nVII, prohibiting sex discrimination in\nemployment). But see Sledge v. J.P. Stevens &\nCo., 585 F.2d 625, 641 (4th Cir. 1978) (\"’tester’\nplaintiffs are not, of course, harmed by a\nrefusal to hire since they are not seriously\ninterested in the job for which they apply\"),\ncert. denied, 440 U.S. 981, 99 S. Ct. 1789\n(1979); Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins.\nSoc’y, 657 F. Supp. 1022, 1032-33 (M.D. Ga. 1987)\n(plaintiff who had no genuine interest in\nemployment with defendant could not make prima\nfacie case of employment discrimination); Allen\nv. Prince George’s County, Maryland, 538 F. Supp.\n833, 841-43 (D. Md. 1982) (same), judgment aff’d\non other grounds, 737 F.2d 1299 (4th Cir. 1984).\n\n  Recognizing tester standing is consistent with\nthe statute’s purpose. Title VII reflects the\nstrong public interest in eradicating\ndiscrimination from the workplace. E.g., Franks\nv. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 763, 96 S.\nCt. 1251, 1263 (1976). Individuals serve that\nend, as well as their own interest in\ncompensation for the wrongs done to them, when\nthey file suit to challenge discriminatory\nemployment practices--that is why the Supreme\nCourt has described them as \"private attorneys\ngeneral.\" Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc.,\nsupra, 390 U.S. at 402, 88 S. Ct. at 966; see\nalso McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publ’g Co., 513\nU.S. 352, 358, 115 S. Ct. 879, 884 (1995);\nE.E.O.C. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 449 U.S.\n590, 602, 101 S. Ct. 817, 824 (1981); Alexander\nv. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 45, 94 S. Ct.\n1011, 1018 (1974). Testers advance that same\npublic interest. Indeed, because proof of\ndiscrimination is often quite difficult to\nmuster--especially so in the hiring process--\ntesters provide evidence that, we have\nrecognized, \"is frequently valuable, if not\nindispensable.\" Richardson v. Howard, 712 F.2d\n319, 321 (7th Cir. 1983). The fact that testers\nhave no interest in a job does not diminish the\ndeterrent role they play by filing suit under\nTitle VII. In that regard, testers are situated\nsimilarly to unlawfully discharged employees who\nare ineligible for reinstatement because of\nwrongdoing discovered after they were fired.\n\fEvidence of such wrongdoing limits the relief\nthey may obtain under Title VII, but it does not\nbar them from bringing suit. McKennon, 513 U.S.\nat 358-59, 115 S. Ct. at 884-85.\n\n  For these very reasons, the EEOC has likewise\nconcluded that employment testers have standing\nto pursue relief under the statute. In 1990, and\nagain in 1996, the Commission issued policy\nguidance statements to that effect. See EEOC,\nPolicy Guidance No. 915-062 (\"Policy Guide on Use\nof ’Testers’ in Employment Selection Process\")\n(Nov. 20, 1990), superseded by EEOC, Enforcement\nGuidance No. N-915.002 (\"Enforcement Guidance:\nWhether ’Testers’ Can File Charges and Litigate\nClaims of Employment Discrimination\") (May 22,\n1996) <http:// www.eeoc.gov/docs/testers.txt>,\nreprinted in Fair Employment Practices Manual (BNA)\n405:6899 (2000). The EEOC’s analysis, of course,\ndoes not bind us. But as the agency charged with\nenforcing Title VII, the Commission has\nexperience and familiarity in this field which\nbestow upon its judgment an added persuasive\nforce. See Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477\nU.S. 57, 65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404 (1986);\nHendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp., 154 F.3d 685,\n693 n.7 (7th Cir. 1998) (collecting cases). The\nCommission’s view that testers have standing to\npursue Title VII claims both informs and supports\nour holding today.\n\n  Before concluding our discussion of Title VII,\nwe must address one other aspect of the decision\nbelow. As we noted earlier, Judge Conlon found\nthat the plaintiffs failed to meet the standing\nrequirements imposed not only by Article III, but\nby Title VII itself. 1998 WL 677165, at *3-*4.\nUnless the plaintiff can establish that she was\na bona fide applicant for employment, the judge\nreasoned, she lacks standing to make a claim\nunder either Title VII or section 1981. Id. at\n*3. We make two brief points in that regard.\n   First, although the district judge addressed the\nbona fide application as a statutory prerequisite\nfor standing, it really goes to the merits of the\nplaintiffs’ claim. Indeed, the two cases Judge\nConlon cited in support of this requirement--\nAllen v. Prince George’s County, Maryland, 538 F.\nSupp. at 841-43, and Parr v. Woodmen of the World\nLife Ins. Soc’y, 657 F. Supp. at 1032-33,\ndiscussed the bona fide application as an element\nof the plaintiff’s prima facie case, not\nstanding. We addressed the distinction in Fry v.\nUAL Corp., 84 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 519 U.S. 987, 117 S. Ct. 447 (1996),\nexplaining that when a statute clearly does not\nconfer rights upon a particular class of\nindividuals, \"a suit under the statute by a\nmember of that class does not engage the\njurisdiction of the federal courts,\" citing\n\fMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478\nU.S. 804, 814, 106 S. Ct. 3229, 3235 (1986). But\nwhere the reach of the statute is not so clear,\nwe explained, \"the question whether a particular\nclass is protected by it becomes just another\nissue concerning the merits of the suit . . . .\"\n84 F.3d at 939. In this case, Kyles and Pierce\nhave asserted the injury-in-fact that Article III\nrequires. Whether they can establish a prima\nfacie case of employment discrimination is a\nquestion that implicates the merits of their\nclaim rather than their standing to make it. See\nWhitlock v. Johnson, 153 F.3d 380, 385 (7th Cir.\n1998).\n\n  Second, we find no support in Title VII for a\nrequirement that a job applicant must have a bona\nfide interest in working for a particular\nemployer if she is to make out a prima facie case\nof employment discrimination. In contrast to\nsection 804(a) of the Fair Housing Act, which\nmakes it unlawful, inter alia, \"[t]o refuse to\nsell or rent after the making of a bona fide\noffer,\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 3604(a),/5 Title VII does\nnot limit its protection to bona fide job\nseekers. Rather, as we noted at the outset of our\nanalysis, the statute proscribes employment\npractices which \"in any way . . . would deprive\nor tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities,\" sec. 2000e-2(a)(2) (emphasis\nours), and authorizes a charge \"by or on behalf\nof a person claiming to be aggrieved,\" sec.\n2000e-5(b). Kyles and Pierce both claim to be\naggrieved by the discriminatory practices they\nattribute to Guardian. The fact that they had no\ninterest in actually working for the company\ncertainly speaks to the nature and extent of\ntheir injuries as well as the appropriate relief.\nSee McKennon, 513 U.S. at 360-62, 115 S. Ct. at\n885-86. But it does not rule out the prospect\nthat they were injured. We have long recognized\nthat humiliation, embarrassment, and like\ninjuries--the very type of injuries that Kyles\nand Pierce allege they suffered (see R. 1 at 11\npara. 42)--constitute cognizable and compensable\nharms stemming from discrimination. See, e.g.,\nSeaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F.2d 634, 636-38\n(7th Cir. 1974); Tyus v. Urban Search Management,\n102 F.3d 256, 265 (7th Cir. 1996), cert. denied,\n520 U.S. 1251, 117 S. Ct. 2409 (1997).\n  As individuals who applied for work with\nGuardian Security and allege that they were\ntreated in a discriminatory fashion, Kyles and\nPierce have standing to sue the firm under Title\nVII. The statute confers upon all individuals a\nright to be free from racial discriminatory\npractices in employment. If the plaintiffs’\nallegations are true, then Guardian violated that\nright and the plaintiffs suffered an actual\ninjury that gave them the right to sue, whether\n\for not Kyles or Pierce were truly interested in\nemployment.\n\nB.\n\n  Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866\nforbids discrimination on the basis of race in\nthe making and enforcement of private as well as\npublic contracts. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.\n160, 168, 96 S. Ct. 2586, 2593 (1976). In\nrelevant part, the statute provides:\n\nAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United\nStates shall have the same right in every State\nand Territory to make and enforce contracts . .\n. as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 1981. Insofar as the statute\nreaches private conduct, it reflects the exercise\nof congressional authority under the Thirteenth\nAmendment to relieve African-Americans of the\n\"badges and incidents\" of slavery. Runyon, 427\nU.S. at 179, 96 S. Ct. at 2598-99; see also Jones\nv. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439, 88 S.\nCt. 2186, 2203 (1968).\n\n  Relatively few courts have considered whether\ntesters have standing to challenge discriminatory\nemployment practices pursuant to section 1981.\nThe Supreme Court has yet to address the\nquestion. Two circuits, the Third and the\nEleventh, have held that testers have standing to\nchallenge discriminatory housing practices under\nanother provision dating back to the\nReconstruction era, 42 U.S.C. sec.1982. Watts v.\nBoyd Properties, Inc., 758 F.2d 1482, 1485 (11th\nCir. 1985); Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home\nOwnership Ass’n, 559 F.2d 894, 898 (3d Cir.\n1977), overruled on other grounds by Goodman v.\nLukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir. 1985),\naff’d, 482 U.S. 656, 107 S. Ct. 2617 (1987)./6\nThat statute provides:\n\nAll citizens of the United States shall have the\nsame right, in every State and Territory, as is\nenjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and\npersonal property.\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 1982. Given the similarity in\npurpose and phrasing between the two provisions,\nwe may assume that these circuits would have\nreached the same conclusion with respect to\nsection 1981./7 See also Coel v. Rose Tree Manor\nApartments, Inc., No. 84 C 1521, 1987 WL 18393,\nat *6 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 13, 1987) (finding that\ntesters have standing to challenge housing\ndiscrimination under section 1981); Pumphrey v.\nStephen Homes, Inc., No. 93 C 1329, 1994 WL\n150947, at *4 (D. Md.

Corp., 152 F.R.D.\n472 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (holding that testers could\nserve as class representatives in suit alleging\nviolations of sec.sec. 1981 and 1982, as well as\nFair Housing Act); City of Evanston v.

(finding that tester has standing\nto sue under civil rights laws, including sec.\n1981); Biggus v. Southmark Mgmnt. Corp., No. 83\nC 4024, 1985 WL 1751, at *5-6 (N.D. Ill. June 13,\n1985) (Marshall, J.) (finding tester standing\nunder sec.sec. 1981 and 1982).\n  More recently, however, the D.C. Circuit has\nconfronted the question head-on and concluded\nthat testers lack standing to sue under section\n1981 for employment discrimination. Fair\nEmployment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v.\nBMC Marketing Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1270-72 (D.C.\nCir. 1994). As in this case, the two plaintiff\ntesters in BMC were African-American college\nstudents employed by the Fair Employment Council\nof Greater Washington. In conjunction with white\ntesters, they sought job referrals from the\ndefendant BMC, which operated an employment\nagency. The white testers both received\nreferrals, while the black testers did not;\nindeed, the agency refused even to accept an\napplication from one of the African Americans.\nThe African-American testers contended that BMC\nhad violated their rights under section 1981 by\ndepriving them of the opportunity to enter into\ncontracts with the employment agency itself, as\nwell as the employers to which the agency would\nhave referred them.\n\n  The court concluded that the testers suffered\nno cognizable loss of contractual rights vis a\nvis either the employment agency or prospective\nemployers. When they approached BMC, the court\npointed out, the testers had misrepresented their\ninterest in employment and presented fictitious\ncredentials. Id. at 1270-71. In view of those\nmisrepresentations, any contract that the testers\nmight have entered into with the agency could\nhave been voided at the agency’s option. Id. at\n1271. Being deprived of the chance to enter a\nvoidable contract was not, in the court’s view,\nan injury cognizable under section 1981. Id. As\n\ffor prospective employers:\n\n[T]he testers concededly had no interest in\nsecuring a job through BMC. Indeed, they had\npromised the Council to refuse any offer of\nemployment that they received in conjunction with\ntheir testing activities. . . . In depositions,\nboth of the tester plaintiffs confirmed that they\nwould have rejected any job offer obtained\nthrough a referral from BMC. . . . At most, then,\nBMC deprived the tester plaintiffs of the\nopportunity to refuse to enter into an employment\ncontract with BMC’s clients. This too is not an\ninjury cognizable under sec. 1981.\n\nId.\n\n  Kyles and Pierce, of course, are in the same\nposition as the testers in BMC. They had no\ngenuine interest in employment with Guardian, and\nneither would have accepted an offer of\nemployment had one been extended. Indeed, both\nhad signed agreements with LAF promising not to\naccept employment with any of the firms whose\nemployment practices they were directed to test.\nThe women do allege that they suffered\nhumiliation and other emotional distress as a\nresult of Guardian’s asserted discrimination. R.\n1 at 9 para. 36. But in terms of the essential\nright that section 1981 protects--the right to\nmake and enforce a contract--Kyles and Pierce\nsuffered no injury. Their goal in approaching\nGuardian was not to enter into a contract with\nthe company. At most, as the court recognized in\nBMC, Kyles and Pierce were seeking the\nopportunity to decline an offer of employment. 28\nF.3d at 1271. Given the terms of the statute,\nthat interest is not sufficient to confer\nstanding to sue for asserted violations of\nsection 1981./8\n\n  Although, insofar as employment contracts are\nconcerned, section 1981 and Title VII share the\nsame purpose, the two statutes are different in\nimportant respects. Title VII takes aim at a wide\nrange of racially discriminatory practices which,\namong other things, either \"deprive or tend to\ndeprive any individual of employment\nopportunities . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 2000e-\n2(a)(2) (emphasis supplied). It also bestows on\nany person \"aggrieved\" by a violation of the\nstatute the right to initiate a charge, sec.\n2000e-5(b), signaling that Congress meant to\nextend standing to the outer boundaries laid down\nby Article III of the Constitution. See\nTrafficante, 407 U.S. at 209, 93 S. Ct. at 366-\n67, and the other authorities collected above at\npages 8-9 and 13. Title VII thus creates a\nsubstantive and enforceable right to be free from\nany attempt \"to limit, segregate, or classify\"\n\fapplicants for employment on the basis of race in\na way that might tend to deprive the applicant,\nor any individual, of employment opportunities.\nsec. 2000e-2(a)(2). Section 1981, by contrast,\ndoes not proscribe any practice that might tend\nto interfere with one’s ability to enter and\nenforce a contract; it protects the right to\nenter into and preserve a contractual\nrelationship, period. Moreover, there is nothing\nin section 1981’s language suggesting that\nCongress meant to stretch standing to the limits\nof Article III. See BMC, 28 F.3d at 1278-79;\nMaryland Minority Contractor’s Ass’n, Inc. v.\nMaryland Stadium Auth., 70 F. Supp. 2d 580, 588\n(D. Md. 1998), aff’d without published op., 198\nF.3d 237, text in Westlaw, 1999 WL 827553 (4th\nCir. Oct. 18, 1999); City of Evanston v. Baird &\nWarner, Inc., supra, No. 89 C 1098, 1990 WL\n186575, at *4; Saunders v. General Servs. Corp.,\n659 F. Supp. 1042, 1054 (E.D. Va. 1987).\n\n  Havens and Dwivedi reveal these to be key\ndistinctions. As both cases recognize, Congress\nhas the authority to create a substantive right,\nthe denial of which alone gives rise to a\ncognizable injury and the right to sue, even if\nthe plaintiff does not suffer the type of core\ninjury that the statute protects. In Havens, the\nright was one not to be falsely informed that\nhousing was unavailable. A tester given such\ninformation would suffer an injury\nnotwithstanding the fact that she was not\nactually in need or desire of housing. In\nDwivedi, the right that Congress created was the\nbroad right not to be subjected to discriminatory\nservices related to the sale of a home. Any\nperson subjected to such discrimination would\nthus incur a cognizable injury even if she had no\ngenuine interest in purchasing a home.\n\n  The terms of 1981 are more narrow, however--it\nprotects the contractual relationship itself. The\nclass of persons who may bring suit is therefore\nlimited to persons who actually wish to enter\ninto (or remain in) that relationship. Because\nthey were not genuinely interested in employment\nwith Guardian, and indeed were obliged to turn\ndown any offer of employment that Guardian might\nhave extended to them, Kyles and Pierce do not\nfall within this class.\n\n  To be sure, there are two Supreme Court\nprecedents that lend partial support to the\nplaintiffs’ case for standing. In Evers v. Dwyer,\n358 U.S. 202, 79 S. Ct. 178 (1958), Evers, an\nAfrican-American resident of Memphis, asked a\nfederal court to declare invalid a Tennessee\nstatute requiring segregated seating on public\nconveyances. Evers himself had been evicted from\na Memphis bus under threat of arrest after he\n\frefused to take a seat in the rear. The district\ncourt dismissed his complaint, reasoning that\nthere was no \"actual controversy\" as required by\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. sec.\n2201, because the evidence revealed that Evers\nhad boarded the bus solely for the purpose of\ninitiating litigation. However, the Supreme Court\nfound Evers’ motive for boarding the bus to be\nimmaterial.\n\nWe do not believe that appellant, in order to\ndemonstrate the existence of an \"actual\ncontroversy\" over the validity of the statute\nhere challenged, was bound to continue to ride\nthe Memphis buses at the risk of arrest if he\nrefused to seat himself in the space in such\nvehicles assigned to colored passengers. A\nresident of a municipality who cannot use\ntransportation facilities therein without being\nsubjected by statute to special disabilities\nnecessarily has, we think, a substantial,\nimmediate, and real interest in the validity of\nthe statute which imposes the disability. That\nthe appellant may have boarded this particular\nbus for the purpose of instituting this\nlitigation is not significant.\n\nId. at 204, 79 S. Ct. at 179-80 (citations\nomitted). Similarly, in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S.\n547, 558, 87 S. Ct. 1213, 1219-20 (1967), the\nCourt did not think that damages under 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 1983 were foreclosed to a group of white and\nblack clergymen who were arrested after they\nattempted to integrate a bus terminal in Jackson,\nMississippi, notwithstanding that the plaintiffs’\npurpose in entering the terminal had been to test\ntheir rights to unsegregated public\naccommodations. \"The petitioners had the right to\nuse the waiting room of the Jackson bus terminal,\nand their deliberate exercise of that right in a\npeaceful, orderly, and inoffensive manner does\nnot disqualify them from seeking damages under\nsec. 1983.\" Id. at 558, 87 S. Ct. at 1220. The\nThird Circuit in Meyers, 559 F.2d at 898, and the\nEleventh Circuit in Watts, 758 F.2d at 1485, both\nrelied heavily on Evers and Pierson in concluding\nthat testers have standing to bring suit under\nsection 1982.\n\n  These two cases cannot bear the full weight of\nthe plaintiffs’ burden on standing, however.\nEvers makes clear that a plaintiff’s status as a\ntester does not render a controversy illusory.\nAnd Pierson confirms that a tester can suffer a\ncognizable and compensable injury even if she\nseeks to exercise her rights with the full\nexpectation that the defendant will violate them.\nYet, as with Havens, what distinguishes these\ncases from the one at hand is the nature of the\nright involved. When a person pays her fare and\n\fboards a bus, or orders a meal in a restaurant,\nshe is actually using (or attempting to use)\nthose public accommodations irrespective of her\nreasons for doing so; in a contractual sense, she\nactually is attempting to enter into a contract.\nTherefore, when she is evicted or arrested for\nrefusing to honor a racial barrier, she suffers\na deprivation of her rights whether she was\npresent to ferret out discriminatory practices or\nbecause she genuinely needed a ride or a meal.\nSee Pierson, 386 U.S. at 558, 87 S. Ct. at 1220;\nsee also Smith v. Y.M.C.A. of Montgomery, Inc.,\n462 F.2d 634, 645-46 (5th Cir. 1972). Kyles and\nPierce would be similarly situated if they\nactually wanted a job with Guardian (for whatever\nreason). But when someone solicits an offer of\nemployment with absolutely no intent to accept in\nthe event one is extended to her, she is not\nattempting to exercise the particular right\nprotected by section 1981. She has no interest in\nforming a contract; to put it in Evers’ context,\nshe would never set foot on the bus. It is for\nthat reason that a tester who encounters race\ndiscrimination in the process of applying for\nemployment cannot sue under section 1981. The\ndiscrimination may be altogether real, and the\ntester may have suffered an identifiable injury;\nbut the employer has not deprived the tester of\nher right to make or enforce contracts. The\ntester’s injury, if any, is one that lies outside\nthe zone of interests that section 1981 protects.\nSee Morris v. Office Max, Inc., 89 F.3d 411, 414-\n15 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n  Congress, as we have emphasized throughout our\nanalysis, has the power to define the right more\nbroadly, and in so doing to bestow standing on a\nlarger class of individuals. If, in section 1981,\nit had proscribed practices that would deprive or\ntend to deprive any individual of the opportunity\nto make a contract, for example, then testers\nmight have standing to sue under this statute as\nthey do under Title VII. See Addisu v. Fred\nMeyer, Inc., 198 F.3d 1130, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000).\nBut, in view of the more confined reach of\nsection 1981 as Congress actually did frame it,\nwe do not believe that Kyles and Pierce meet the\ncriteria that Article III imposes.\n\nIV.\n\n  Having concluded that employment testers have\nstanding to sue under Title VII but not section\n1981, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE IN PART the district\ncourt’s judgment, and we REMAND the case to the\ncourt below for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion. The parties shall bear their\nown costs of appeal. We thank both of the amici--\nthe EEOC, and the Fair Employment Council of\nGreater Washington--for their briefs; and we\n\fcommend all parties on the superior caliber of\nthe briefing in this case.\n\n\n\n\n/1 In the employment context, a \"tester\" is an\nindividual who, without the intent to accept an\noffer of employment, poses as a job applicant in\norder to gather evidence of discriminatory hiring\npractices. See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,\n455 U.S. 363, 370, 374, 102 S. Ct. 1114, 1119,\n1121 (1982) (discussing housing testers).\n\n/2 For example, the resume of the minority candidate\nmight reflect superior work experience in terms\nof the length of her prior employment or the\nlevel of responsibility she enjoyed.\n\n/3 The EEOC found \"reasonable cause\" to support\ntheir charges of race discrimination. R. 52 Exs.\n7, 8. Efforts at conciliation were unsuccessful.\n\n/4 See Biggus v. Southmark Mgmnt. Corp., No. 83 C\n4024, 1985 WL 1751, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 13,\n1985) (Marshall, J.) (\"It is not the plaintiff’s\nintent in seeking the information, but rather the\ndefendants’[intent] in making the allegedly false\nstatement which is important in a sec. [804(d)]\naction.\").\n\n/5 Section 804(a) proscribes a variety of\ndiscriminatory housing practices. See 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 3604(a). The ban on refusals to sell or rent\non the basis of race, etc. is the only clause of\nthis subsection that includes the bona fide offer\nrequirement. Consequently, the other activities\naddressed by subsection (a)--refusing to\nnegotiate for the sale or rental of housing,\nmaking housing unavailable, and denying someone\nhousing on the basis of race, etc.--are\nprohibited irrespective of whether there was a\nbona fide offer. That is why we concluded in\nDwivedi that Havens’ rationale as to tester\nstanding extends to section 804(a) as well as the\nother subsections of the statute. 895 F.2d at\n1527. See Grant v. Smith, 574 F.2d 252, 255 (5th\nCir. 1978); Zuch v. Hussey, 394 F. Supp. 1028,\n1050-51 (E.D. Mich. 1975), aff’d & remanded\nwithout published op., 547 F.2d 1168 (6th Cir.\n1977); United States v.

Matchmaker Real Estate\nSales Center, Inc., supra, 982 F.2d 1086, the\ndefendants were sued for racial steering under\nboth the Fair Housing Act and section 1982. We\nheld that testers do have standing to sue, but we\n\fframed our holding in terms of the Fair Housing\nAct alone. See id. at 1095.\n\n/7 Indeed, the Third Circuit indicated that it\nintended to address standing under both statutory\nprovisions. See 559 F.2d at 898 (\"we are required\nto review the district court’s holding as it\napplies to sections 1981 and 1982\"). However, as\nworded, the court’s actual holding is limited to\nsection 1982 alone. See id. (\"We therefore hold\nthat Meyers has standing to maintain his action\nunder section 1982.\").\n\n/8 As our discussion makes plain, we are relying on\nBMC’s rationale only insofar as it concerns the\ntesters’ lack of genuine interest in employment.\nWe find it unnecessary to consider what impact,\nif any, the tester’s presentation of fictitious\ncredentials to an employer might have on her\nsection 1981 claim.\n\f",

Kyra Kyles and Lolita\nPierce worked for the Legal Assistance Foundation\nof Chicago (\"LAF\") as employment testers./1 In\nthat capacity, they applied for work as a\nreceptionist with Guardian Security Services\n(\"Guardian\"). Although each of their white\ncounterparts was offered the job, neither Kyles\nnor Pierce, both of whom are African-American,\ngot past the initial interview. They sued\nGuardian for race discrimination under Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e, as well as section 1 of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866, 42 U.S.C. sec. 1981. The district\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of\nGuardian, reasoning that, as testers with no\ngenuine interest in employment with Guardian,\nKyles and Pierce lacked standing to sue. We\nconclude that testers do have standing to sue for\nviolations of Title VII, but not section 1981.\n\nI.\n\n  Because the district court entered summary\njudgment in favor of Guardian, we owe Kyles and\nPierce a favorable summary of the facts. See\nFrobose v. American Sav. & Loan Ass’n of\nDanville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757067\"><a href=\"/opinion/757067/rosemary-frobose-v-american-savings-and-loan-association-of-danville-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 604 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n  LAF is a public-interest law firm that provides\n\flegal assistance to individuals who lack the\nmeans to retain counsel privately. Its employment\ntesting project aims to detect discrimination in\nthe employment sector using testing methods that\nhave been used for years to assess compliance\nwith the nation’s fair housing laws.\nSpecifically, in order to detect racial\ndiscrimination, LAF pairs a white tester with one\nof color, provides them both with fictitious\ncredentials designed to be comparable in all\npertinent respects (and perhaps somewhat more\nfavorable to the non-white tester/2), trains\nthem to interview similarly, and then sends them\nto apply for work with the same employer. The\ntesters later prepare detailed reports of their\nexperiences. The project director reviews the\ndata, and when it appears that an employer is\nengaged in discrimination, informs the testers.\nAlone or in conjunction with bona fide job\napplicants, the testers who were rejected for\nemployment may then pursue administrative and\njudicial remedies, as they did in this case. In\norder to remove questions about their objectivity\nand neutrality, however, the testers assigned\ntheir right to damages to LAF, and later to the\nChicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under\nLaw and the Public Interest Law Initiative.\n\n  Kyles and Pierce were college students in 1995\nwhen they took summer jobs with the LAF’s\nemployment testing project. As a condition of\ntheir employment with the project, they agreed to\nrefuse any job offer extended to them in the\ncourse of their testing activities. With the help\nof LAF staff members, Kyles and Pierce then\nprepared fictitious resumes that supplemented\ntheir actual experiences with additional\nemployment, education, and other data aimed at\nmaking them attractive to prospective employers.\n\n  In the Spring of 1995, Guardian placed an\nadvertisement in the Chicago Tribune soliciting\napplications for the position of receptionist.\nLAF sent a pair of resumes to Guardian in\nresponse to the advertisement--one on behalf of\na white candidate and one on behalf of an\nAfrican-American candidate. Each of the resumes\nincluded information that permitted the reader to\ndiscern the race of the applicant. The African-\nAmerican’s resume reflected credentials that were\ncomparable to, if not better than, the white\napplicant. Guardian did not respond to the\nAfrican-American’s application at all, but\ntelephoned three times for the white candidate.\n\n  LAF subsequently sent Kyles and Pierce to\nGuardian to apply in person for the receptionist\nopening. Each was paired with a white tester.\nAlthough Kyles and Pierce were assigned\ncredentials that were comparable or superior to\n\fthose of their white counterparts, neither one of\nthem fared as well in the application process.\n\n  Kyles had an interview with Guardian’s director\nof human resources, Martin Labno, who told her\nthat after consulting with Guardian’s president\nand vice-president, he would ultimately select a\ngroup of three to four individuals to call back\nfor a second interview. When Kyles’ white\ncounterpart applied for the job the following\nday, she interviewed not only with Labno but with\nGuardian’s vice-president, Michael Malinowski,\nreturned a day later for a typing test, and was\noffered the job on the spot. Soon after the white\ntester turned the offer down, Kyles called\nGuardian to check on the status of her\napplication and was told that Labno had not yet\ndecided whom to summon for a second interview.\nShe never heard from Guardian again.\n\n  Within a few days, Pierce applied for the job.\nLabno interviewed her and told her that, after\nconsulting with the company’s president or its\nvice-president, he would be conducting follow-up\ninterviews over the next few days. He promised to\ncall her within a day or two. Pierce’s white\npartner applied for the job on the same day,\ninterviewed with Labno, and took a typing test.\nOne week later, Guardian summoned the white\ntester for a second interview and offered her the\njob. When Pierce telephoned around that time to\ninquire about the status of the selection\nprocess, Labno told her that the company was\n\"running behind.\" The white tester turned down\nthe job offer, but Guardian never followed up\nwith Pierce.\n\n  After securing right-to-sue letters from the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission\n(\"EEOC\"),/3 Kyles and Pierce filed suit against\nGuardian alleging that the company had engaged in\nracial discrimination in violation of both Title\nVII and section 1981. Guardian counterclaimed,\nalleging that Kyles and Pierce had fraudulently\nmisrepresented their interest in employment with\nthe company. On summary judgment, Judge Conlon\nheld that, as testers, Kyles and Pierce lacked\nstanding to maintain the suit. Kyles v. J.K.\nGuardian Security Servs., Inc., 77 Fair Empl. Prac.\nCas.

Coleman, the Supreme\nCourt held that testers have standing to bring\nsuit for alleged violations of section 804(d) of\nthe Fair Housing Act, which makes it an unlawful\npractice \"[t]o represent to any person because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin\nthat any dwelling is not available for\ninspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is\nin fact so available.\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 3604(d).\nThe complaint in Havens Realty alleged that the\ndefendant realty firm engaged in racial steering\nby misinforming African-Americans that no\napartments were available in one of its\ncomplexes. The plaintiffs included an African-\nAmerican man who had unsuccessfully sought\nhousing from the defendant, as well as a local\norganization that promoted equal housing\nopportunities and two testers that the\norganization had engaged specifically to\ndetermine whether the defendant was engaging in\nunlawful steering. The district court had\ndismissed the testers from the case, but the\nSupreme Court concluded that one of them had\nstanding to sue.\n\n  Citing its earlier decision in Gladstone,\nRealtors v.

The African-American tester alleged that\nshe had been wrongly informed on four separate\noccasions that an apartment was unavailable at\nthe defendant’s properties; whereas her Caucasian\ncounterpart had been told that apartments were\navailable. The former thus suffered an injury\ncognizable under the statute, while the latter\ndid not. Id. at 374-75; 102 S. Ct. at 1122.\n\n  Following Havens, this court concluded in\nVillage of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536509\"><a href=\"/opinion/536509/village-of-bellwood-v-chandra-dwivedi/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1990), that testers have standing to sue\nunder other provisions of the Fair Housing Act.\nAlthough section 804(d) forbids false statements\nthat housing is unavailable, as we noted above,\nsection 804(a) makes it illegal, inter alia, for\none to make housing unavailable to a person\nbecause of his race (see n.6, infra), and section\n804(b) proscribes racial discrimination in the\nprovision of services in connection with the sale\nof a dwelling. The plaintiffs in Dwivedi, who\nagain included testers, alleged that a real\nestate brokerage firm, its owner, and two of its\nemployees had engaged in racial steering by\nencouraging African-American home seekers toward\nareas with a substantial African-American\npopulation while encouraging Caucasian buyers\ntoward areas that did not. Although we thought\nthe standing of the testers, \"as an original\nmatter,\" to be \"dubious,\" 895 F.2d at 1526, we\n\facknowledged Havens’ holding that testers have\nstanding to sue for violations of section 804(d).\nNo misrepresentations as the availability of\nhousing actionable under that section were proven\nin Dwivedi. But the essential point of Havens was\nthat \"Congress can create new substantive rights,\nsuch as a right to be free from\nmisrepresentations, and if that right is invaded\nthe holder of the right can sue without running\nafoul of Article III, even if he incurs no other\ninjury (for example, the loss of a home-buying\nopportunity).\" Id. at 1526-27. We were therefore\nconvinced that testers had standing to sue, not\njust for receipt of false information in\nviolation of section 804(d), but for other\nviolations of the statute as well:\n\n[T]he logic of Havens embraces discrimination in\nthe provision of services, forbidden explicitly\nby section [804(b)] and implicitly by section\n[804(a)]. If the plaintiffs’ evidence is\nbelieved, the testers were treated in a racially\ndiscriminatory fashion, even though they\nsustained no harm beyond the discrimination\nitself, just as testers are not fooled by the\nmisrepresentations made to them.\n\nId. at 1527.\n\n  Since Dwivedi was decided, we have twice\nconfirmed its holding expressly.

When Congress made it unlawful for an\nemployer \"to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees or applicants in any way which would\ndeprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his status as an employee . . . because of\nsuch individual’s race. . . .,\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n2000e-2(a)(2), it created a broad substantive\nright that extends far beyond the simple refusal\nor failure to hire. Cf. sec. 2000e-2(a)(1). When\na job applicant is not considered for a job\nsimply because she is African-American, she has\nbeen limited, segregated or classified in a way\nthat would tend to deprive not only her, but any\nother individual who happens to be a person of\ncolor, of employment opportunities. In other\nwords, she suffers an injury \"in precisely the\nform the statute was intended to guard against,\"\njust as she would if, as a housing tester, she\nwere falsely informed that a vacant apartment was\n\funavailable. Havens, 455 U.S. at 373, 102 S. Ct.\nat 1121. She therefore has standing to sue, even\nif she has not been harmed apart from the\nstatutory violation--even if, for example, she\nwas not genuinely interested in the job she\napplied for and in that sense was not harmed by\nthe employer’s refusal to hire her.

The fact that testers\nhave no interest in a job does not diminish the\ndeterrent role they play by filing suit under\nTitle VII. In that regard, testers are situated\nsimilarly to unlawfully discharged employees who\nare ineligible for reinstatement because of\nwrongdoing discovered after they were fired.\n\fEvidence of such wrongdoing limits the relief\nthey may obtain under Title VII, but it does not\nbar them from bringing suit. McKennon, 513 U.S.\nat 358-59, 115 S. Ct. at 884-85.\n\n  For these very reasons, the EEOC has likewise\nconcluded that employment testers have standing\nto pursue relief under the statute. In 1990, and\nagain in 1996, the Commission issued policy\nguidance statements to that effect. See EEOC,\nPolicy Guidance No. 915-062 (\"Policy Guide on Use\nof ’Testers’ in Employment Selection Process\")\n(Nov. 20, 1990), superseded by EEOC, Enforcement\nGuidance No. N-915.002 (\"Enforcement Guidance:\nWhether ’Testers’ Can File Charges and Litigate\nClaims of Employment Discrimination\") (May 22,\n1996) <http:// www.eeoc.gov/docs/testers.txt>,\nreprinted in Fair Employment Practices Manual (BNA)\n405:6899 (2000). The EEOC’s analysis, of course,\ndoes not bind us.

The\nCommission’s view that testers have standing to\npursue Title VII claims both informs and supports\nour holding today.\n\n  Before concluding our discussion of Title VII,\nwe must address one other aspect of the decision\nbelow. As we noted earlier, Judge Conlon found\nthat the plaintiffs failed to meet the standing\nrequirements imposed not only by Article III, but\nby Title VII itself. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">677165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3-*4.\nUnless the plaintiff can establish that she was\na bona fide applicant for employment, the judge\nreasoned, she lacks standing to make a claim\nunder either Title VII or section 1981. Id. at\n*3. We make two brief points in that regard.\n   First, although the district judge addressed the\nbona fide application as a statutory prerequisite\nfor standing, it really goes to the merits of the\nplaintiffs’ claim. Indeed, the two cases Judge\nConlon cited in support of this requirement--\nAllen v. Prince George’s County, Maryland, 538 F.\nSupp. at 841-43, and Parr v. Woodmen of the World\nLife Ins. Soc’y, 657 F. Supp. at 1032-33,\ndiscussed the bona fide application as an element\nof the plaintiff’s prima facie case, not\nstanding.

Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111758\"><a href=\"/opinion/111758/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111758\"><a href=\"/opinion/111758/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But\nwhere the reach of the statute is not so clear,\nwe explained, \"the question whether a particular\nclass is protected by it becomes just another\nissue concerning the merits of the suit . . . .\"\n84 F.3d at 939. In this case, Kyles and Pierce\nhave asserted the injury-in-fact that Article III\nrequires. Whether they can establish a prima\nfacie case of employment discrimination is a\nquestion that implicates the merits of their\nclaim rather than their standing to make it. See\nWhitlock v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757327\"><a href=\"/opinion/757327/herbert-whitlock-stanley-wrice-and-bennie-lopez-v-adrienne-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (7th Cir.\n1998).\n\n  Second, we find no support in Title VII for a\nrequirement that a job applicant must have a bona\nfide interest in working for a particular\nemployer if she is to make out a prima facie case\nof employment discrimination. In contrast to\nsection 804(a) of the Fair Housing Act, which\nmakes it unlawful, inter alia, \"[t]o refuse to\nsell or rent after the making of a bona fide\noffer,\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 3604(a),/5 Title VII does\nnot limit its protection to bona fide job\nseekers. Rather, as we noted at the outset of our\nanalysis, the statute proscribes employment\npractices which \"in any way . . . would deprive\nor tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities,\" sec. 2000e-2(a)(2) (emphasis\nours), and authorizes a charge \"by or on behalf\nof a person claiming to be aggrieved,\" sec.\n2000e-5(b). Kyles and Pierce both claim to be\naggrieved by the discriminatory practices they\nattribute to Guardian. The fact that they had no\ninterest in actually working for the company\ncertainly speaks to the nature and extent of\ntheir injuries as well as the appropriate relief.\nSee McKennon, 513 U.S. at 360-62, 115 S. Ct. at\n885-86. But it does not rule out the prospect\nthat they were injured. We have long recognized\nthat humiliation, embarrassment, and like\ninjuries--the very type of injuries that Kyles\nand Pierce allege they suffered (see R. 1 at 11\npara. 42)--constitute cognizable and compensable\nharms stemming from discrimination.

Circuit has\nconfronted the question head-on and concluded\nthat testers lack standing to sue under section\n1981 for employment discrimination. Fair\nEmployment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v.\nBMC Marketing Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673802\"><a href=\"/opinion/673802/fair-employment-council-of-greater-washington-inc-v-bmc-marketing/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1270-72 (D.C.\nCir. 1994). As in this case, the two plaintiff\ntesters in BMC were African-American college\nstudents employed by the Fair Employment Council\nof Greater Washington. In conjunction with white\ntesters, they sought job referrals from the\ndefendant BMC, which operated an employment\nagency. The white testers both received\nreferrals, while the black testers did not;\nindeed, the agency refused even to accept an\napplication from one of the African Americans.\nThe African-American testers contended that BMC\nhad violated their rights under section 1981 by\ndepriving them of the opportunity to enter into\ncontracts with the employment agency itself, as\nwell as the employers to which the agency would\nhave referred them.\n\n  The court concluded that the testers suffered\nno cognizable loss of contractual rights vis a\nvis either the employment agency or prospective\nemployers. When they approached BMC, the court\npointed out, the testers had misrepresented their\ninterest in employment and presented fictitious\ncredentials. Id. at 1270-71. In view of those\nmisrepresentations, any contract that the testers\nmight have entered into with the agency could\nhave been voided at the agency’s option. Id. at\n1271. Being deprived of the chance to enter a\nvoidable contract was not, in the court’s view,\nan injury cognizable under section 1981. Id. As\n\ffor prospective employers:\n\n[T]he testers concededly had no interest in\nsecuring a job through BMC. Indeed, they had\npromised the Council to refuse any offer of\nemployment that they received in conjunction with\ntheir testing activities. . . . In depositions,\nboth of the tester plaintiffs confirmed that they\nwould have rejected any job offer obtained\nthrough a referral from BMC. . . . At most, then,\nBMC deprived the tester plaintiffs of the\nopportunity to refuse to enter into an employment\ncontract with BMC’s clients. This too is not an\ninjury cognizable under sec. 1981.\n\nId.\n\n  Kyles and Pierce, of course, are in the same\nposition as the testers in BMC. They had no\ngenuine interest in employment with Guardian, and\nneither would have accepted an offer of\nemployment had one been extended. Indeed, both\nhad signed agreements with LAF promising not to\naccept employment with any of the firms whose\nemployment practices they were directed to test.\nThe women do allege that they suffered\nhumiliation and other emotional distress as a\nresult of Guardian’s asserted discrimination. R.\n1 at 9 para. 36. But in terms of the essential\nright that section 1981 protects--the right to\nmake and enforce a contract--Kyles and Pierce\nsuffered no injury. Their goal in approaching\nGuardian was not to enter into a contract with\nthe company. At most, as the court recognized in\nBMC, Kyles and Pierce were seeking the\nopportunity to decline an offer of employment. 28\nF.3d at 1271. Given the terms of the statute,\nthat interest is not sufficient to confer\nstanding to sue for asserted violations of\nsection 1981./8\n\n  Although, insofar as employment contracts are\nconcerned, section 1981 and Title VII share the\nsame purpose, the two statutes are different in\nimportant respects. Title VII takes aim at a wide\nrange of racially discriminatory practices which,\namong other things, either \"deprive or tend to\ndeprive any individual of employment\nopportunities . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. sec. 2000e-\n2(a)(2) (emphasis supplied). It also bestows on\nany person \"aggrieved\" by a violation of the\nstatute the right to initiate a charge, sec.\n2000e-5(b), signaling that Congress meant to\nextend standing to the outer boundaries laid down\nby Article III of the Constitution. See\nTrafficante, 407 U.S. at 209, 93 S. Ct. at 366-\n67, and the other authorities collected above at\npages 8-9 and 13. Title VII thus creates a\nsubstantive and enforceable right to be free from\nany attempt \"to limit, segregate, or classify\"\n\fapplicants for employment on the basis of race in\na way that might tend to deprive the applicant,\nor any individual, of employment opportunities.\nsec. 2000e-2(a)(2). Section 1981, by contrast,\ndoes not proscribe any practice that might tend\nto interfere with one’s ability to enter and\nenforce a contract; it protects the right to\nenter into and preserve a contractual\nrelationship, period. Moreover, there is nothing\nin section 1981’s language suggesting that\nCongress meant to stretch standing to the limits\nof Article III.

As both cases recognize, Congress\nhas the authority to create a substantive right,\nthe denial of which alone gives rise to a\ncognizable injury and the right to sue, even if\nthe plaintiff does not suffer the type of core\ninjury that the statute protects. In Havens, the\nright was one not to be falsely informed that\nhousing was unavailable. A tester given such\ninformation would suffer an injury\nnotwithstanding the fact that she was not\nactually in need or desire of housing. In\nDwivedi, the right that Congress created was the\nbroad right not to be subjected to discriminatory\nservices related to the sale of a home. Any\nperson subjected to such discrimination would\nthus incur a cognizable injury even if she had no\ngenuine interest in purchasing a home.\n\n  The terms of 1981 are more narrow, however--it\nprotects the contractual relationship itself. The\nclass of persons who may bring suit is therefore\nlimited to persons who actually wish to enter\ninto (or remain in) that relationship. Because\nthey were not genuinely interested in employment\nwith Guardian, and indeed were obliged to turn\ndown any offer of employment that Guardian might\nhave extended to them, Kyles and Pierce do not\nfall within this class.\n\n  To be sure, there are two Supreme Court\nprecedents that lend partial support to the\nplaintiffs’ case for standing. In Evers v. Dwyer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1958), Evers, an\nAfrican-American resident of Memphis, asked a\nfederal court to declare invalid a Tennessee\nstatute requiring segregated seating on public\nconveyances. Evers himself had been evicted from\na Memphis bus under threat of arrest after he\n\frefused to take a seat in the rear. The district\ncourt dismissed his complaint, reasoning that\nthere was no \"actual controversy\" as required by\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. sec.\n2201, because the evidence revealed that Evers\nhad boarded the bus solely for the purpose of\ninitiating litigation. However, the Supreme Court\nfound Evers’ motive for boarding the bus to be\nimmaterial.\n\nWe do not believe that appellant, in order to\ndemonstrate the existence of an \"actual\ncontroversy\" over the validity of the statute\nhere challenged, was bound to continue to ride\nthe Memphis buses at the risk of arrest if he\nrefused to seat himself in the space in such\nvehicles assigned to colored passengers. A\nresident of a municipality who cannot use\ntransportation facilities therein without being\nsubjected by statute to special disabilities\nnecessarily has, we think, a substantial,\nimmediate, and real interest in the validity of\nthe statute which imposes the disability. That\nthe appellant may have boarded this particular\nbus for the purpose of instituting this\nlitigation is not significant.\n\nId. at 204, 79 S. Ct. at 179-80 (citations\nomitted).

Ct. at 1220. The\nThird Circuit in Meyers, 559 F.2d at 898, and the\nEleventh Circuit in Watts, 758 F.2d at 1485, both\nrelied heavily on Evers and Pierson in concluding\nthat testers have standing to bring suit under\nsection 1982.\n\n  These two cases cannot bear the full weight of\nthe plaintiffs’ burden on standing, however.\nEvers makes clear that a plaintiff’s status as a\ntester does not render a controversy illusory.\nAnd Pierson confirms that a tester can suffer a\ncognizable and compensable injury even if she\nseeks to exercise her rights with the full\nexpectation that the defendant will violate them.\nYet, as with Havens, what distinguishes these\ncases from the one at hand is the nature of the\nright involved. When a person pays her fare and\n\fboards a bus, or orders a meal in a restaurant,\nshe is actually using (or attempting to use)\nthose public accommodations irrespective of her\nreasons for doing so; in a contractual sense, she\nactually is attempting to enter into a contract.\nTherefore, when she is evicted or arrested for\nrefusing to honor a racial barrier, she suffers\na deprivation of her rights whether she was\npresent to ferret out discriminatory practices or\nbecause she genuinely needed a ride or a meal.\nSee Pierson, 386 U.S. at 558, 87 S. Ct. at 1220;\nsee also Smith v. Y.M.C.A. of Montgomery, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304244\"><a href=\"/opinion/304244/vincent-leonard-smith-v-the-young-mens-christian-association-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645-46 (5th Cir. 1972). Kyles and\nPierce would be similarly situated if they\nactually wanted a job with Guardian (for whatever\nreason). But when someone solicits an offer of\nemployment with absolutely no intent to accept in\nthe event one is extended to her, she is not\nattempting to exercise the particular right\nprotected by section 1981. She has no interest in\nforming a contract; to put it in Evers’ context,\nshe would never set foot on the bus. It is for\nthat reason that a tester who encounters race\ndiscrimination in the process of applying for\nemployment cannot sue under section 1981. The\ndiscrimination may be altogether real, and the\ntester may have suffered an identifiable injury;\nbut the employer has not deprived the tester of\nher right to make or enforce contracts. The\ntester’s injury, if any, is one that lies outside\nthe zone of interests that section 1981 protects.\nSee Morris v.

If, in section 1981,\nit had proscribed practices that would deprive or\ntend to deprive any individual of the opportunity\nto make a contract, for example, then testers\nmight have standing to sue under this statute as\nthey do under Title VII. See Addisu v. Fred\nMeyer, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767076\"><a href=\"/opinion/767076/taye-addisu-mokhtar-al-saeed-ghassan-abu-hemdeh-v-fred-meyer-inc-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000).\nBut, in view of the more confined reach of\nsection 1981 as Congress actually did frame it,\nwe do not believe that Kyles and Pierce meet the\ncriteria that Article III imposes.\n\nIV.\n\n  Having concluded that employment testers have\nstanding to sue under Title VII but not section\n1981, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE IN PART the district\ncourt’s judgment, and we REMAND the case to the\ncourt below for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.
