Following a November 2003 dissolution hearing, the Second Judicial District\n\nCourt approved a stipulated Final Parenting Plan and Property Settlement Agreement. As\n\npart of the Agreement, John paid $600 per month in child support for the couple’s two\n\nminor children.    In November 2013, Stephanie requested modification of the child\n\nsupport arrangement. Following a hearing in November 2014, the District Court granted\n\nmodification of the Agreement and increased John’s child support to $2,048 per month.\n\nJohn appeals. We affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2     Stephanie and John Healy were married in Butte, Montana, on September 26,\n\n1998. A daughter was born in June 1999, and a son was born in November 2000. On\n\nJuly 10, 2002, Stephanie filed a petition for dissolution. The parties participated in a\n\nsettlement conference on November 12, 2003, at the conclusion of which they entered\n\ninto a Final Parenting Plan and Property Settlement Agreement (the Agreement). The\n\nAgreement was presented to and approved by the District Court.\n\n¶3     The Agreement provided, in relevant part:\n\n       1. Stephanie and John would share parenting but Stephanie would be the\n       primary custodial parent.\n\n       2. John would pay child support in the amount of $600/month\n       ($300/child/month).\n\n       3. John would establish an irrevocable college trust account (College Trust)\n       and deposit $1,000/year into the trust effective June 1, 2004.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       4. Stephanie would deposit $300/year into the College Trust effective June\n       1, 2005.\n\n       5. John would provide health insurance for the children and both parents\n       would divide any uninsured expenses.\n\n¶4     Following the dissolution, John consistently made timely child support payments;\n\nhowever, he neglected to establish the College Trust. Rather, he deposited the mandated\n\nannual funds into his employment-related 401(k) plan for a period of time prior to\n\ntransferring it to a segregated account at a federal credit union. Stephanie established two\n\nsavings accounts in the children’s names and deposited her annual contributions into\n\nthose accounts.\n\n¶5     During the marriage, John worked, and continues to work, as a transmission\n\noperator at NorthWestern Energy. Stephanie was, and continues to be, employed as an\n\nelementary school teacher at Butte Central Catholic School (BCCS).           As a teacher,\n\nStephanie’s children may attend BCCS at a 50% discounted tuition. Upon reaching\n\nschool age, the children began attending BCCS and John and Stephanie cooperatively\n\npaid the annual tuitions for the school. John paid approximately 60% and Stephanie paid\n\nthe remainder. In 2008, after Stephanie remarried, she and John agreed that John would\n\npay their daughter’s school tuition and Stephanie would pay their son’s. This practice\n\ncontinued until 2012 when their daughter got braces. John agreed to pay for the braces\n\nand Stephanie agreed to pay both tuitions for school year 2012/2013 with the\n\nunderstanding that the tuitions for the 2013/2014 school year would revert to the 50/50\n\narrangement and remain so thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f¶6     In November 2013, Stephanie applied to the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices (DPHHS) Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) for review and\n\nmodification of the ten-year-old Agreement. In January 2014, after obtaining relevant\n\ninformation from both parties and applying the Montana Child Support Guidelines,\n\nCSED calculated a monthly child support amount of $571/child/month, for a total of\n\n$1,142/month. John was to begin making these payments in February 2014. CSED\n\nserved the modification notice and order on Stephanie and John, informing them that they\n\nhad 20 days in which to object to the new terms. If neither objected, the modification\n\nwould be submitted to the district court for approval and would become final. Neither\n\nparty objected within 20 days and on March 24, 2014, CSED filed its modification\n\nmotion with the District Court.\n\n¶7     On April 2, 2014, John filed an objection in District Court arguing that CSED used\n\nhis 12-month salary to calculate his annual income but used only a 9-month salary for\n\nStephanie. He asserted that some income should be imputed to Stephanie for the summer\n\nmonths.    CSED defended its calculation asserting that Stephanie worked only 9\n\nmonths/year and did not, and had not historically, earned income during the summer\n\nmonths so no imputation of additional income was required. CSED moved the District\n\nCourt to adopt the modified child support order while John urged the court to reject it and\n\nremand the matter to CSED for recalculation. In accordance with § 40-5-277(8)(b),\n\nMCA, the District Court scheduled a hearing for May 30, 2014. This hearing was\n\nrepeatedly continued before being held on November 17, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f¶8    In June 2014, Stephanie learned that John had not paid their daughter’s tuition for\n\nschool year 2013/2014. Consequently, in July 2014, while the modification hearing was\n\npending, Stephanie asked CSED to recalculate John’s child support to include school\n\ntuition and submit a revised modification order for the court’s approval. In August 2014,\n\nCSED submitted a revised modification order that included John’s recalculated child\n\nsupport of $1,024/child/month, or a total of $2,048/month. John objected.\n\n¶9    The District Court conducted a hearing on November 17, 2014. John initially\n\nargued that the court did not have jurisdiction over CSED’s August 2014 proposed\n\nmodification because that proposal had not been subject to the administrative process.\n\nThe District Court concluded it had jurisdiction to hear all issues raised before it and\n\ncommenced the hearing. Both John and Stephanie testified.\n\n¶10   John challenged the salary upon which CSED based his child support obligation.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that the annual salary CSED relied upon was derived from his\n\nyear-end or near-year-end employment pay stubs from 2010-2013, he explained that\n\nduring those years as well as in 2014, he worked considerable overtime hours at\n\ndouble-pay. However, he claimed that NorthWestern intended to eliminate all overtime\n\nopportunities beginning in 2015. He argued that CSED should have calculated his child\n\nsupport obligation using his regular hourly wage multiplied by a maximum annual hours\n\nof 2,080. Stephanie testified that John had told her in 2003, when they were negotiating\n\nJohn’s initial child support, that he would “probably not be getting any more overtime.”\n\n¶11   On April 16, 2015, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of\n\nLaw and Final Order (Final Order).       The court found that the evidence presented\n\n\n                                            5\n\fsupported CSED’s use of past earnings to calculate John’s child support. The court\n\nstated that John’s “assertions that he will not continue to earn overtime and that his wages\n\nwould decrease in the future should not be considered by child support because they are\n\nspeculative in nature.” The District Court ordered John to pay child support in the\n\namount of $2,048/month, retroactive to February 2014.\n\n¶12      The District Court further concluded that John’s failure to pay school tuition in\n\naccordance with the parties’ past practices constituted a substantial change in\n\ncircumstances which justified modification of the 2003 Agreement.               The court\n\ndetermined that a modification addressing, among other things, school tuition was\n\nnecessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of the children. Turning to the College\n\nTrust, the District Court ordered the parties to establish a 529 plan account for each minor\n\nchild.     John was ordered to deposit $17,531.18, constituting his annual $1,000\n\ncontribution from June 1, 2004 through June 1, 2013, with 10% interest per annum.\n\nStephanie was ordered to deposit $4,481.23, constituting $300 per year plus 10% interest\n\nper annum. The parties were to make their respective deposits within 60 days of the date\n\nof the court’s order.\n\n¶13      John appeals.\n\n                                         ISSUES\n\n¶14      The issues on appeal are:\n\n¶15      Did the District Court have jurisdiction to decide the CSED motion when there\n\nwas no showing of changed circumstances so as to make the existing child support\n\nobligation unconscionable?\n\n\n                                             6\n\f¶16    Did the District Court misapprehend the evidence when it made findings with\n\nrespect to John’s future income potential?\n\n¶17    Did the District Court err when it imposed a 10% interest penalty on the parents’\n\nrequired College Trust contributions?\n\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶18    We review a district court’s findings of fact in parenting plans and child support\n\norders to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. A finding of fact is clearly\n\nerroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court\n\nmisapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us\n\nthat the district court made a mistake. In re the Parenting of M.C., 2015 MT 57, ¶ 10,\n\n378 Mont. 305, 343 P.3d 569.        We review a district court’s conclusions of law to\n\ndetermine if they are correct. M.C., ¶ 10.\n\n¶19    Whether a party is entitled to post-judgment interest is a conclusion of law which\n\nwe review de novo. In re Marriage of Debuff, 2002 MT 159, ¶ 15, 310 Mont. 382, 50\n\nP.3d 1070.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\n¶20    Did the District Court have jurisdiction to decide the CSED motion when there\n       was no showing of changed circumstances so as to make the existing child support\n       obligation unconscionable?\n\n¶21    The District Court in its Final Order indicated its jurisdiction derived from\n\n§ 40-4-208, MCA, addressing modification of child support, and § 40-4-219, MCA,\n\naddressing amendments to a parenting plan.       Section 40-4-208, MCA, provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       (1) Except as otherwise provided in 40-4-201(6), a decree may be modified\n            by a court as to maintenance or support only as to installments accruing\n            subsequent to actual notice to the parties of the motion for\n            modification.\n                                             . . .\n       (2)(b) Except as provided in 40-4-251 through 40-4-258, whenever the\n                decree proposed for modification contains provisions relating to . . .\n                support, modification under subsection (1) may only be made:\n           (i) upon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and\n                continuing as to make the terms unconscionable;\n           (ii) upon written consent of the parties; or\n           (iii) upon application by [DPHHS], whenever [DPHHS] is providing\n                services under Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act. . . .\n\n¶22    Section 40-4-219, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that the district court “may in\n\nits discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have\n\narisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the\n\nprior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the\n\namendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.”\n\n¶23    John argues that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to hear CSED’s\n\nMotion to Approve Proposed Modification because Stephanie did not establish\n\nsubstantial and continuing changed circumstances that rendered the terms of the original\n\nAgreement unconscionable as required by § 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA.               In opposing\n\nCSED’s assertion that the District Court has jurisdiction under § 40-4-208(2)(b)(iii),\n\nMCA, John maintains that neither he nor Stephanie have been receiving Title IV-D\n\nservices, or any other services, from CSED.\n\n¶24    CSED argues that the District Court gained jurisdiction over the matter under both\n\nsections of § 40-4-208, MCA. Under § 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, CSED recounts multiple\n\nchanged circumstances between the parties including, but not limited to, the passage of\n\n\n                                              8\n\f10 years, the admission of the children into a tuition school, the changes in tuition over\n\nthe years, the changes in the salaries of the parties, and John’s failure to pay the\n\nagreed-upon tuition. Under § 40-4-208(2)(b)(iii), MCA, CSED claims it was providing\n\nTitle IV-D services to the couple.\n\n¶25    Lastly, the agency claims that the court has jurisdiction under the statutory\n\nprovisions of the administrative process set forth in § 40-5-201, et seq., MCA. While\n\nChapter 4 of Title 40 (cited above) addresses the court’s role in the termination of\n\nmarriage, child custody, and support, Chapter 5 of Title 40 addresses, among other\n\nthings, the CSED’s regulatory and administrative role in establishing and enforcing court-\n\napproved or agency-issued child support orders. CSED notes that Stephanie’s application\n\nfor modification was filed with CSED under § 40-5-272, MCA. As required by the\n\nstatute, the agency reviewed the application to determine if it met the criteria for\n\nmodification. The relevant sections of § 40-5-272, MCA, are:\n\n       (1) Upon the application of the department, the obligor, or the obligee, a\n       support order issued by a district court of this state . . . may be reviewed by\n       the department to determine whether the support order should be modified\n       in accordance with the guidelines.\n                                            . . .\n       (4) Criteria constituting sufficient grounds for review of a child support\n       order include:\n       (a) a substantial change in circumstances as defined by administrative rules;\n       [or]\n                                            . . .\n       (c) a lapse of 36 months from the date that:\n       (i) the order was entered. . . .\n\n¶26    The CSED accepted review of the order under § 40-5-272(4)(c), MCA, based\n\nupon the 10-year lapse from the date the order was entered.           Subsequently, and in\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\faccordance with § 40-5-273, MCA, CSED requested information from both parties for\n\nthe purpose of calculating child support in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.\n\nCSED then served both parties with the proposed modification order, informing them that\n\nthey had 20 days in which to request a hearing. When no timely request for hearing was\n\nfiled, the administrative law judge signed the modification and CSED submitted it to the\n\nDistrict Court for approval. Section 40-5-277, MCA.\n\n¶27    Section 40-5-277(8)(a), MCA, mandates, with exceptions and alternatives\n\ninapplicable to this case, that the original district court that approved the initial child\n\nsupport order must also approve the modified order. Section 40-5-277(8)(c), MCA,\n\ninstructs that the district court may adopt, modify, or reject an administrative modified\n\nchild support order. It may also remand the modified order to CSED with instructions.\n\nCSED posits that the District Court undertook review of this case specifically under the\n\nmandate set forth in § 40-5-277, MCA.\n\n¶28    As § 40-5-277(8)(c), MCA, mandates that a district court review a\n\nCSED-modified child support order, the District Court unequivocally had the authority to\n\nadjudicate the issues before it. The record indicates that the District Court considered\n\nand acknowledged changes in the circumstances of the parties and the passage of time\n\nresulting in the children reaching school age and attending a tuition-required school. The\n\nDistrict Court fulfilled its obligation to review CSED’s modification actions taken under\n\n§ 40-5-272, MCA.\n\n¶29    We therefore conclude the District Court had jurisdiction to decide the CSED\n\nmotion under the authority granted by § 40-5-277, MCA.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f¶30   Did the District Court misapprehend the evidence when it made findings with\n      respect to John’s future income potential?\n\n¶31   John argues that the District Court ignored his direct and uncontradicted testimony\n\nthat he would no longer be earning overtime wages. We see no evidence that the court\n\nignored relevant evidence or misapprehended the effect of the evidence before it. Rather,\n\nthe District Court was presented with substantial and reasonable evidence of John’s\n\nactual earning power for the previous five years.       Based upon John’s documented\n\nearnings and other factors, CSED calculated John’s child support obligation. Other than\n\nhis oral testimony, John produced no evidence at the hearing to support his claim that his\n\nemployer intended to eliminate all overtime opportunities beginning in 2015. Moreover,\n\nevidence was presented that in both 2003 and 2013 John stated he would no longer have\n\novertime opportunities; however, he continued to earn substantial overtime pay\n\nsubsequent to both such announcements. It is the District Court’s function to determine\n\n“the credibility of the witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony.”\n\nTubaugh v. Jackson, (In re C.J.), 2016 MT 93, ¶ 19, 383 Mont. 197, 369 P.3d 1028,\n\nciting In re the Parenting of N.S., 2011 MT 98, ¶ 25, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863. Our\n\nreview of the record confirms that the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of\n\nthe evidence or clearly make a mistake in adopting CSED’s calculation of John’s child\n\nsupport. The District Court’s reliance on John’s past pay stubs to establish his child\n\nsupport obligation was not clearly erroneous.\n\n¶32   However, the District Court abused its discretion by requiring John to pay\n\n$2,048/month retroactively to February 2014. Section 40-4-208(1), MCA, expressly\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fstates that increased child support payments may only be required “subsequent to actual\n\nnotice . . . of the motion for modification.” John received the notice of modification from\n\nCSED in mid-January 2014, in which he was informed that his child support may be\n\nincreased to $1,142/month, and in accordance with Admin. R. M. 37.62.2119(5), would\n\nbecome effective in February 2014.        John challenged the notice in District Court.\n\nFollowing numerous continuances to the scheduled hearing, and the discovery of new\n\ninformation, Stephanie requested a revision to her initial request for modification seeking\n\nthe inclusion of school tuition into the calculation. CSED filed a Notice to Court on\n\nAugust 15, 2014, requesting the court’s approval of a child support modification\n\nincreasing John’s monthly child support obligation to $2,048/month. In accordance with\n\n§ 40-4-208(1), MCA, the District Court was authorized to impose child support of\n\n$1,142/month effective in February 2014 and collectible through August 2014. Based\n\nupon CSED’s recalculation and re-notice in August 2014, the court was authorized to\n\nrequire a child support payment of $2,048/month beginning in September 2014. We\n\ntherefore vacate the District Court’s order requiring John to pay $2,048/month retroactive\n\nto February 2014 and remand for an amended order in accordance with this Opinion.\n\n¶33    Did the District Court err when it imposed a 10% interest penalty on the parents’\n       required College Trust contributions?\n\n¶34    Section 25-9-205, MCA, provides a statutory right to post-judgment interest,\n\nstating, in relevant part: “(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), interest is payable on\n\njudgments recovered in the courts of this state and on the cost incurred to obtain or\n\nenforce a judgment at the rate of 10% per year. The interest may not be compounded.”\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fThis statute has been applied repeatedly in marital dissolution cases involving support\n\nand maintenance. In In re Marriage of Gibson, 206 Mont. 460, 671 P.2d 629 (1983),\n\nHusband agreed in the parties’ settlement agreement to pay Wife $7,500 on a given date.\n\nWhen Husband failed to pay, Wife sought enforcement of the agreement. Gibson, 206\n\nMont. at 461-62, 671 P.2d at 630-31. On appeal, we held that Husband was liable for\n\nstatutory interest under § 25-9-205, MCA, from the date payment was due through the\n\ndate payment was made. Gibson, 206 Mont. at 467, 671 P.2d at 633. See also In re\n\nMarriage of Pospisil, 2000 MT 132, 299 Mont. 527, 1 P.3d 364. The District Court\n\ndetermined that under the 2003 Parenting Agreement both John and Stephanie were\n\nobligated to make annual deposits into the College Trust on specific dates. However,\n\nbecause the College Trust was not established, neither party made timely payments into\n\nit. As a consequence, the delinquent payments became a money judgment subject to the\n\nstatutory interest established in § 25-9-205, MCA.           The District Court correctly\n\ninterpreted and applied that statute and did not err in requiring both parties to pay interest\n\ninto the delinquently-established College Trust.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶35    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court’s rulings with the\n\nexception of the court’s retroactive application of $2,048/month child support beginning\n\nin February 2014. John is required to pay $1,142/month retroactive to February 2014 and\n\nthrough the month of August 2014. He is required to pay $2,048/month retroactive to\n\nSeptember 2014. We remand this matter to the District Court for the issuance of a\n\nrevised order in accordance with this Opinion.\n\n\n                                             13\n\f                           /S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n\n\nWe Concur:\n\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ BETH BAKER\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ JIM RICE\n\n\n\n\n                      14\n\f",

Following a November 2003 dissolution hearing, the Second Judicial District\n\nCourt approved a stipulated Final Parenting Plan and Property Settlement Agreement. As\n\npart of the Agreement, John paid $600 per month in child support for the couple’s two\n\nminor children.    In November 2013, Stephanie requested modification of the child\n\nsupport arrangement. Following a hearing in November 2014, the District Court granted\n\nmodification of the Agreement and increased John’s child support to $2,048 per month.\n\nJohn appeals. We affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2     Stephanie and John Healy were married in Butte, Montana, on September 26,\n\n1998. A daughter was born in June 1999, and a son was born in November 2000. On\n\nJuly 10, 2002, Stephanie filed a petition for dissolution. The parties participated in a\n\nsettlement conference on November 12, 2003, at the conclusion of which they entered\n\ninto a Final Parenting Plan and Property Settlement Agreement (the Agreement). The\n\nAgreement was presented to and approved by the District Court.\n\n¶3     The Agreement provided, in relevant part:\n\n       1. Stephanie and John would share parenting but Stephanie would be the\n       primary custodial parent.\n\n       2. John would pay child support in the amount of $600/month\n       ($300/child/month).\n\n       3. John would establish an irrevocable college trust account (College Trust)\n       and deposit $1,000/year into the trust effective June 1, 2004.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       4. Stephanie would deposit $300/year into the College Trust effective June\n       1, 2005.\n\n       5. John would provide health insurance for the children and both parents\n       would divide any uninsured expenses.\n\n¶4     Following the dissolution, John consistently made timely child support payments;\n\nhowever, he neglected to establish the College Trust. Rather, he deposited the mandated\n\nannual funds into his employment-related 401(k) plan for a period of time prior to\n\ntransferring it to a segregated account at a federal credit union. Stephanie established two\n\nsavings accounts in the children’s names and deposited her annual contributions into\n\nthose accounts.\n\n¶5     During the marriage, John worked, and continues to work, as a transmission\n\noperator at NorthWestern Energy. Stephanie was, and continues to be, employed as an\n\nelementary school teacher at Butte Central Catholic School (BCCS).           As a teacher,\n\nStephanie’s children may attend BCCS at a 50% discounted tuition. Upon reaching\n\nschool age, the children began attending BCCS and John and Stephanie cooperatively\n\npaid the annual tuitions for the school. John paid approximately 60% and Stephanie paid\n\nthe remainder. In 2008, after Stephanie remarried, she and John agreed that John would\n\npay their daughter’s school tuition and Stephanie would pay their son’s. This practice\n\ncontinued until 2012 when their daughter got braces. John agreed to pay for the braces\n\nand Stephanie agreed to pay both tuitions for school year 2012/2013 with the\n\nunderstanding that the tuitions for the 2013/2014 school year would revert to the 50/50\n\narrangement and remain so thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f¶6     In November 2013, Stephanie applied to the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices (DPHHS) Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) for review and\n\nmodification of the ten-year-old Agreement. In January 2014, after obtaining relevant\n\ninformation from both parties and applying the Montana Child Support Guidelines,\n\nCSED calculated a monthly child support amount of $571/child/month, for a total of\n\n$1,142/month. John was to begin making these payments in February 2014. CSED\n\nserved the modification notice and order on Stephanie and John, informing them that they\n\nhad 20 days in which to object to the new terms. If neither objected, the modification\n\nwould be submitted to the district court for approval and would become final. Neither\n\nparty objected within 20 days and on March 24, 2014, CSED filed its modification\n\nmotion with the District Court.\n\n¶7     On April 2, 2014, John filed an objection in District Court arguing that CSED used\n\nhis 12-month salary to calculate his annual income but used only a 9-month salary for\n\nStephanie. He asserted that some income should be imputed to Stephanie for the summer\n\nmonths.    CSED defended its calculation asserting that Stephanie worked only 9\n\nmonths/year and did not, and had not historically, earned income during the summer\n\nmonths so no imputation of additional income was required. CSED moved the District\n\nCourt to adopt the modified child support order while John urged the court to reject it and\n\nremand the matter to CSED for recalculation. In accordance with § 40-5-277(8)(b),\n\nMCA, the District Court scheduled a hearing for May 30, 2014. This hearing was\n\nrepeatedly continued before being held on November 17, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f¶8    In June 2014, Stephanie learned that John had not paid their daughter’s tuition for\n\nschool year 2013/2014. Consequently, in July 2014, while the modification hearing was\n\npending, Stephanie asked CSED to recalculate John’s child support to include school\n\ntuition and submit a revised modification order for the court’s approval. In August 2014,\n\nCSED submitted a revised modification order that included John’s recalculated child\n\nsupport of $1,024/child/month, or a total of $2,048/month. John objected.\n\n¶9    The District Court conducted a hearing on November 17, 2014. John initially\n\nargued that the court did not have jurisdiction over CSED’s August 2014 proposed\n\nmodification because that proposal had not been subject to the administrative process.\n\nThe District Court concluded it had jurisdiction to hear all issues raised before it and\n\ncommenced the hearing. Both John and Stephanie testified.\n\n¶10   John challenged the salary upon which CSED based his child support obligation.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that the annual salary CSED relied upon was derived from his\n\nyear-end or near-year-end employment pay stubs from 2010-2013, he explained that\n\nduring those years as well as in 2014, he worked considerable overtime hours at\n\ndouble-pay. However, he claimed that NorthWestern intended to eliminate all overtime\n\nopportunities beginning in 2015. He argued that CSED should have calculated his child\n\nsupport obligation using his regular hourly wage multiplied by a maximum annual hours\n\nof 2,080. Stephanie testified that John had told her in 2003, when they were negotiating\n\nJohn’s initial child support, that he would “probably not be getting any more overtime.”\n\n¶11   On April 16, 2015, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of\n\nLaw and Final Order (Final Order).       The court found that the evidence presented\n\n\n                                            5\n\fsupported CSED’s use of past earnings to calculate John’s child support. The court\n\nstated that John’s “assertions that he will not continue to earn overtime and that his wages\n\nwould decrease in the future should not be considered by child support because they are\n\nspeculative in nature.” The District Court ordered John to pay child support in the\n\namount of $2,048/month, retroactive to February 2014.\n\n¶12      The District Court further concluded that John’s failure to pay school tuition in\n\naccordance with the parties’ past practices constituted a substantial change in\n\ncircumstances which justified modification of the 2003 Agreement.               The court\n\ndetermined that a modification addressing, among other things, school tuition was\n\nnecessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of the children. Turning to the College\n\nTrust, the District Court ordered the parties to establish a 529 plan account for each minor\n\nchild.     John was ordered to deposit $17,531.18, constituting his annual $1,000\n\ncontribution from June 1, 2004 through June 1, 2013, with 10% interest per annum.\n\nStephanie was ordered to deposit $4,481.23, constituting $300 per year plus 10% interest\n\nper annum. The parties were to make their respective deposits within 60 days of the date\n\nof the court’s order.\n\n¶13      John appeals.\n\n                                         ISSUES\n\n¶14      The issues on appeal are:\n\n¶15      Did the District Court have jurisdiction to decide the CSED motion when there\n\nwas no showing of changed circumstances so as to make the existing child support\n\nobligation unconscionable?\n\n\n                                             6\n\f¶16    Did the District Court misapprehend the evidence when it made findings with\n\nrespect to John’s future income potential?\n\n¶17    Did the District Court err when it imposed a 10% interest penalty on the parents’\n\nrequired College Trust contributions?\n\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶18    We review a district court’s findings of fact in parenting plans and child support\n\norders to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. A finding of fact is clearly\n\nerroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court\n\nmisapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us\n\nthat the district court made a mistake.

Section 40-4-208, MCA, provides in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       (1) Except as otherwise provided in 40-4-201(6), a decree may be modified\n            by a court as to maintenance or support only as to installments accruing\n            subsequent to actual notice to the parties of the motion for\n            modification.\n                                             . . .\n       (2)(b) Except as provided in 40-4-251 through 40-4-258, whenever the\n                decree proposed for modification contains provisions relating to . . .\n                support, modification under subsection (1) may only be made:\n           (i) upon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and\n                continuing as to make the terms unconscionable;\n           (ii) upon written consent of the parties; or\n           (iii) upon application by [DPHHS], whenever [DPHHS] is providing\n                services under Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act. . . .\n\n¶22    Section 40-4-219, MCA, provides, in relevant part, that the district court “may in\n\nits discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have\n\narisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the\n\nprior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the\n\namendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.”\n\n¶23    John argues that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to hear CSED’s\n\nMotion to Approve Proposed Modification because Stephanie did not establish\n\nsubstantial and continuing changed circumstances that rendered the terms of the original\n\nAgreement unconscionable as required by § 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA.               In opposing\n\nCSED’s assertion that the District Court has jurisdiction under § 40-4-208(2)(b)(iii),\n\nMCA, John maintains that neither he nor Stephanie have been receiving Title IV-D\n\nservices, or any other services, from CSED.\n\n¶24    CSED argues that the District Court gained jurisdiction over the matter under both\n\nsections of § 40-4-208, MCA. Under § 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, CSED recounts multiple\n\nchanged circumstances between the parties including, but not limited to, the passage of\n\n\n                                              8\n\f10 years, the admission of the children into a tuition school, the changes in tuition over\n\nthe years, the changes in the salaries of the parties, and John’s failure to pay the\n\nagreed-upon tuition. Under § 40-4-208(2)(b)(iii), MCA, CSED claims it was providing\n\nTitle IV-D services to the couple.\n\n¶25    Lastly, the agency claims that the court has jurisdiction under the statutory\n\nprovisions of the administrative process set forth in § 40-5-201, et seq., MCA. While\n\nChapter 4 of Title 40 (cited above) addresses the court’s role in the termination of\n\nmarriage, child custody, and support, Chapter 5 of Title 40 addresses, among other\n\nthings, the CSED’s regulatory and administrative role in establishing and enforcing court-\n\napproved or agency-issued child support orders. CSED notes that Stephanie’s application\n\nfor modification was filed with CSED under § 40-5-272, MCA. As required by the\n\nstatute, the agency reviewed the application to determine if it met the criteria for\n\nmodification. The relevant sections of § 40-5-272, MCA, are:\n\n       (1) Upon the application of the department, the obligor, or the obligee, a\n       support order issued by a district court of this state . . . may be reviewed by\n       the department to determine whether the support order should be modified\n       in accordance with the guidelines.\n                                            . . .\n       (4) Criteria constituting sufficient grounds for review of a child support\n       order include:\n       (a) a substantial change in circumstances as defined by administrative rules;\n       [or]\n                                            . . .\n       (c) a lapse of 36 months from the date that:\n       (i) the order was entered. . . .\n\n¶26    The CSED accepted review of the order under § 40-5-272(4)(c), MCA, based\n\nupon the 10-year lapse from the date the order was entered.           Subsequently, and in\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\faccordance with § 40-5-273, MCA, CSED requested information from both parties for\n\nthe purpose of calculating child support in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.\n\nCSED then served both parties with the proposed modification order, informing them that\n\nthey had 20 days in which to request a hearing. When no timely request for hearing was\n\nfiled, the administrative law judge signed the modification and CSED submitted it to the\n\nDistrict Court for approval. Section 40-5-277, MCA.\n\n¶27    Section 40-5-277(8)(a), MCA, mandates, with exceptions and alternatives\n\ninapplicable to this case, that the original district court that approved the initial child\n\nsupport order must also approve the modified order. Section 40-5-277(8)(c), MCA,\n\ninstructs that the district court may adopt, modify, or reject an administrative modified\n\nchild support order. It may also remand the modified order to CSED with instructions.\n\nCSED posits that the District Court undertook review of this case specifically under the\n\nmandate set forth in § 40-5-277, MCA.\n\n¶28    As § 40-5-277(8)(c), MCA, mandates that a district court review a\n\nCSED-modified child support order, the District Court unequivocally had the authority to\n\nadjudicate the issues before it. The record indicates that the District Court considered\n\nand acknowledged changes in the circumstances of the parties and the passage of time\n\nresulting in the children reaching school age and attending a tuition-required school. The\n\nDistrict Court fulfilled its obligation to review CSED’s modification actions taken under\n\n§ 40-5-272, MCA.\n\n¶29    We therefore conclude the District Court had jurisdiction to decide the CSED\n\nmotion under the authority granted by § 40-5-277, MCA.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f¶30   Did the District Court misapprehend the evidence when it made findings with\n      respect to John’s future income potential?\n\n¶31   John argues that the District Court ignored his direct and uncontradicted testimony\n\nthat he would no longer be earning overtime wages. We see no evidence that the court\n\nignored relevant evidence or misapprehended the effect of the evidence before it. Rather,\n\nthe District Court was presented with substantial and reasonable evidence of John’s\n\nactual earning power for the previous five years.       Based upon John’s documented\n\nearnings and other factors, CSED calculated John’s child support obligation. Other than\n\nhis oral testimony, John produced no evidence at the hearing to support his claim that his\n\nemployer intended to eliminate all overtime opportunities beginning in 2015. Moreover,\n\nevidence was presented that in both 2003 and 2013 John stated he would no longer have\n\novertime opportunities; however, he continued to earn substantial overtime pay\n\nsubsequent to both such announcements. It is the District Court’s function to determine\n\n“the credibility of the witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony.”\n\nTubaugh v.

Our\n\nreview of the record confirms that the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of\n\nthe evidence or clearly make a mistake in adopting CSED’s calculation of John’s child\n\nsupport. The District Court’s reliance on John’s past pay stubs to establish his child\n\nsupport obligation was not clearly erroneous.\n\n¶32   However, the District Court abused its discretion by requiring John to pay\n\n$2,048/month retroactively to February 2014. Section 40-4-208(1), MCA, expressly\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fstates that increased child support payments may only be required “subsequent to actual\n\nnotice . . . of the motion for modification.” John received the notice of modification from\n\nCSED in mid-January 2014, in which he was informed that his child support may be\n\nincreased to $1,142/month, and in accordance with Admin. R. M. 37.62.2119(5), would\n\nbecome effective in February 2014.        John challenged the notice in District Court.\n\nFollowing numerous continuances to the scheduled hearing, and the discovery of new\n\ninformation, Stephanie requested a revision to her initial request for modification seeking\n\nthe inclusion of school tuition into the calculation. CSED filed a Notice to Court on\n\nAugust 15, 2014, requesting the court’s approval of a child support modification\n\nincreasing John’s monthly child support obligation to $2,048/month. In accordance with\n\n§ 40-4-208(1), MCA, the District Court was authorized to impose child support of\n\n$1,142/month effective in February 2014 and collectible through August 2014. Based\n\nupon CSED’s recalculation and re-notice in August 2014, the court was authorized to\n\nrequire a child support payment of $2,048/month beginning in September 2014. We\n\ntherefore vacate the District Court’s order requiring John to pay $2,048/month retroactive\n\nto February 2014 and remand for an amended order in accordance with this Opinion.\n\n¶33    Did the District Court err when it imposed a 10% interest penalty on the parents’\n       required College Trust contributions?\n\n¶34    Section 25-9-205, MCA, provides a statutory right to post-judgment interest,\n\nstating, in relevant part: “(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), interest is payable on\n\njudgments recovered in the courts of this state and on the cost incurred to obtain or\n\nenforce a judgment at the rate of 10% per year. The interest may not be compounded.”\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fThis statute has been applied repeatedly in marital dissolution cases involving support\n\nand maintenance.

The District Court\n\ndetermined that under the 2003 Parenting Agreement both John and Stephanie were\n\nobligated to make annual deposits into the College Trust on specific dates. However,\n\nbecause the College Trust was not established, neither party made timely payments into\n\nit. As a consequence, the delinquent payments became a money judgment subject to the\n\nstatutory interest established in § 25-9-205, MCA.           The District Court correctly\n\ninterpreted and applied that statute and did not err in requiring both parties to pay interest\n\ninto the delinquently-established College Trust.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n¶35    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court’s rulings with the\n\nexception of the court’s retroactive application of $2,048/month child support beginning\n\nin February 2014. John is required to pay $1,142/month retroactive to February 2014 and\n\nthrough the month of August 2014. He is required to pay $2,048/month retroactive to\n\nSeptember 2014. We remand this matter to the District Court for the issuance of a\n\nrevised order in accordance with this Opinion.\n\n\n                                             13\n\f                           /S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n\n\nWe Concur:\n\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ BETH BAKER\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ JIM RICE\n\n\n\n\n                      14\n\f</pre>",
