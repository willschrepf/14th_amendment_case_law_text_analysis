Code, § 187, subd. (a)),1 and one count of attempted willful, deliberate, and\npremeditated murder (§§ 187, subd. (a), 664). For the murder count, the jury found true a\nspecial circumstance that appellant committed the murder in the course of a robbery\n(§ 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) and found true an allegation that appellant personally and\nintentionally discharged a firearm resulting in the victim’s death (§ 12022.53, subd. (d)).\nFor the attempted murder count, the jury found true an allegation that appellant used a\ndeadly weapon (a shank) (§ 12022, subd. (b)(1)) and caused the victim great bodily injury\n(§ 12022.7, subd. (a)). As to both counts, the jury found true an allegation that appellant\ncommitted the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a\ncriminal street gang. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Appellant was sentenced to a total of 44 years to life in prison plus life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole, which included 25 years to life for the firearm\nenhancement in the murder count, plus life in prison without the possibility of parole for\nthe special circumstances conviction, and 15 years to life for the attempted murder count\nin conjunction with the gang enhancement, plus one year for the deadly weapon\nenhancement and three years for the great bodily injury enhancement. The gang\nenhancement for the murder count was stayed. (§ 654.) Appellant timely appealed.\n                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n1. Count One: Murder of Dominique Dunn in May 2008\n       In May 2008, 19-year-old Dominique Dunn lived with his mother Yvette\nMatthews in an apartment complex on 72nd Street in the City of Paramount. He was not\na gang member, and his mother did not know of any trouble he had with anyone in the\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fneighborhood. Dunn got together daily with his best friend James Simpson, who also\nwas not involved in gang activity.\n       Matthews and Dunn knew a man in the neighborhood named Armando Rodriguez,\nwhom they called “Mando.” Mando2 was known as the “neighborhood grandpa” because\nchildren would go to his house to “hang out” and he would babysit. He babysat Dunn a\nfew times. In May 2008, he lived downstairs from Matthews and Dunn in the same\napartment complex. Before that time, he lived next door in the apartment building where\nDunn was murdered.\n       On May 20, 2008, the day of Dunn’s murder, Matthews left her house for work at\n5:00 a.m. while Dunn was still asleep; he did not have school that day. Dunn and\nSimpson spent the day together. Simpson had a small “iPod Nano” in his jacket pocket\nand he thought Dunn had one, too. Matthews came home at approximately 6:30 p.m. to\nfind Dunn and Simpson sitting together outside near their apartment building. Dunn\nasked Matthews for money, which she gave him, and Dunn and Simpson walked to a\nnearby market. Matthews went into her apartment.\n       Albert Turner lived nearby. On the day of the murder, he had returned home from\nwork around dusk and saw two African-American men, apparently Dunn and Simpson,\nemerge from an alley, cross 72nd Street, and approach a nearby apartment building. He\nthought they looked familiar, but they wore hoodies and he could not be certain if he\nknew them.\n       At around the same time, Mando was working on his car and saw Dunn on the\nstreet in front of his apartment.\n       Dunn and Simpson passed through a wrought iron gate of the building where the\nshooting would occur; Dunn sat on the stairs while Simpson stood against a wall.\nSimpson noticed a Honda pass back and forth on the street in front of them. On the car’s\nthird pass, it stopped in the middle of the street and two Hispanic men exited from the\nfront and back passengerside doors. The back passenger walked up to Dunn and\n\n2      We refer to Rodriguez as “Mando” for clarity only and intend no disrespect.\n\n\n                                            3\n\fSimpson and asked if they “banged,” that is, if they were in a gang. Simpson said no.\nThe front passenger stood near the car with a black semiautomatic gun pointed at them.\nNeither Simpson nor Dunn was armed.\n       The front passenger was about Simpson’s height, but thin, wearing all black\nclothes and a black hat. The back passenger was “[a] little chubby” and had a shaved\nhead. The back passenger lifted up Dunn’s and Simpson’s shirts to check for tattoos. He\nspit in Simpson’s face, checked his pockets, found Simpson’s iPod, and took it. Simpson\nwas afraid.\n       At that point, Dunn started to run up the stairs and screamed, “Mando.” The front\npassenger shot him once. The back passenger yelled “C.V.S.” or “Compton Varrio\nSegundo,” a gang slogan. Simpson ran around the corner of the building because he\nthought he would be shot next. He saw the men run back toward the car, but he did not\nsee what they did after that. He found a back entrance to the building and went inside to\ntell someone Dunn had been shot. He then located Dunn, injured but awake.\n       Simpson ran to tell Dunn’s mother that Dunn had been hurt, and she ran screaming\nto the building where she found neighbors trying to help Dunn. Dunn was awake when\nMatthews got to him. When authorities arrived, they ordered Matthews and others to\nleave the area. Simpson also went home. Matthews learned Dunn later died at the\nhospital.\n       Several Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department deputies responded to the scene.\nArriving first, Deputy Steven Kowaltschuk found Dunn lying conscious at the top of the\nstaircase of the apartment building and being assisted by neighbors. He saw blood on\nDunn’s chest and near his right pants pocket. He asked Dunn what happened and Dunn\ntold him he was in front of the same building when a four-door, dark-colored car pulled\nup and three Hispanic men exited. One asked for his iPod, but he refused to give it to\nhim and ran, at which point he heard a gunshot and felt pain in his chest. He saw the car\ndepart westbound while he fled up the stairs and he heard someone yell, “Compton\nVarrio Segundo.” Deputy Kowaltschuk initiated a crime broadcast for three suspects and\na dark-colored, four-door sedan.\n\n\n                                            4\n\f       Deputy Cesar Quiroz arrived as paramedics rendered aid to Dunn. He saw Dunn’s\nhat and iPod nearby. He searched the surrounding area and found an expended nine-\nmillimeter casing and bullet in front of the building, but no gun.\n       Lieutenant Steven Katz arrived after Dunn had been taken away by paramedics.\nHe spoke to Matthews, and she pointed him toward Simpson, who he interviewed the\nnext morning. He showed Simpson a book containing photographs of Hispanic males,\nbut Simpson did not identify anyone. A few days later, police asked Simpson to look at\nsome six-pack photographic lineups, although he did not want to. When he did, he again\ndid not identify anyone. He did pick out someone who looked similar because officers\nasked him to.\n       Simpson was eventually arrested for disobeying a subpoena to appear at the\npreliminary hearing in this case. At that hearing, he initially identified appellant as the\nshooter, but recanted on cross-examination. At trial, he testified appellant was not\ninvolved in Dunn’s shooting and the reason he identified him initially was because “that\nwas the man the police thought.”3\n       Debra Getts was a resident of the building where Dunn was shot and she witnessed\nparts of the incident. She was sleeping and awoke to the sound of someone running\noutside her apartment. She heard a gunshot and someone yell “help” and “Mando, help.”\nShe opened her door and saw Dunn grasping his right ribcage area; he told her to call\n911. She ran to find Dunn’s mother in the building next door, and some neighbors tried\nto help Dunn before authorities arrived. She later gave a statement to police.\n       Turner, Dunn’s neighbor across the street, also witnessed parts of the shooting\nincident. At approximately 6:30 or 7:00 p.m., he was watching a basketball game on\ntelevision when he saw the same two African-American men walking back the way they\nhad come earlier. Later, while he was still watching the game, he heard arguing or a\ncommotion outside. Someone said, “What set you from[?]” Another person responded,\n\n\n3      Beyond denying appellant was involved in the shooting, Simpson denied seeing\nappellant’s Cadillac at the scene; instead, he saw a dark green Honda.\n\n\n                                              5\n\f“I’m not from no gang.” He then heard a gunshot. He looked outside and saw two\nHispanic men, approximately 20 years old, running from the scene. One of them wore a\nDodgers hat. He recognized them because they had once visited his home with Mando;\non that occasion, he had asked Mando to tell them to leave because they carried blue rags,\nwhich Turner believed was gang attire.\n       On May 27, 2008, Lieutenant Katz received an anonymous tip from Turner, who\ndid not initially identify himself because he was concerned for his safety. Lieutenant\nKatz met with Turner that day and Turner described what he had seen leading up to the\ntime of Dunn’s murder, which was largely consistent with his account of the incident\nduring trial.\n       A few days later on May 30, 2008, Turner identified a photograph of appellant,\nwho he knew as “Bozo,” and said he had seen appellant in front of his house the day\nbefore Dunn’s death. At trial, Turner thought the person in the photograph he had\nidentified was the man in his yard named Bozo, but he could not be sure because the\nperson looked different in the photograph. He denied saying that person was the one he\nsaw running from the scene on the night of Dunn’s murder; he claimed officers told him\nto circle the photograph and write down the name “Bozo.”\n       After interviewing Turner, Lieutenant Katz interviewed Mando, who provided\naddresses for appellant and another suspect, Gilbert Mojica. During his interview,\nMando told officers appellant had said in the past, “[‘]I don’t like blacks. I don’t like\nniggers[,’] that’s what he says all the times he sees them.” At trial, Mando testified he\nknew appellant from around the neighborhood and would invite him over to barbecue or\nplay dominos. Once, he heard appellant say the “F” word with the “N” word, referring to\nAfrican-American people, but it seemed to Mando appellant “didn’t really mean it like in\na bad way.”\n       Mando knew appellant was in a gang. He did not know which one, but he had\nseen appellant’s “Florencia” tattoo and he knew that was a local gang. He saw appellant\nand Mojica together two to three times each week.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      On June 6, 2008, Deputy Pascual Delgadillo and other officers arrested appellant\nand executed a search warrant for his residence. In response to questioning at the scene,\nappellant told Deputy Delgadillo he was in the Florencia 13 gang and he used the\nmoniker Bozo. He had visible tattoos on his arms and a belt buckle with the letter “F” on\nit. The search uncovered items of gang paraphernalia and a box of live .38-caliber\nammunition.\n      Mojica was also arrested on the same day. In exchange for pleading guilty to\nvoluntary manslaughter and being sentenced to 13 years in prison, Mojica testified\nagainst appellant. Mojica associated with Florencia gang members and was known as\n“Youngster.” He knew appellant as “Bozo” and they had been friends since they were 14\nor 15 years old. He explained the apartment complex where Dunn was shot was a “hang-\nout” area in Paramount for Florencia members. He described Mando as an “OG,” or old-\ntime gang member who was known throughout the neighborhood, and he said he and\nappellant would often hang out with him. Mojica and appellant shot pool once with\nMando in Turner’s backyard.\n      Mojica feared for his life and his family as a result of testifying. Nevertheless, he\nidentified appellant as the shooter and a Florencia gang member, and he admitted to\nbeing the back passenger who checked Dunn and Simpson for tattoos. He identified the\ndriver of the car as another gang member known as “Stranger.” He explained on the\nnight of Dunn’s murder, he, appellant, and Stranger had been driving around the\nneighborhood drinking and smoking in appellant’s Cadillac when they noticed Dunn and\nSimpson. Appellant said, “There is some fools right there hanging in front of the\napartment. They got some i-Pods. Let’s go.” Appellant also said, “Let’s go jack them.”\nAfter passing by Dunn and Simpson several times, Mojica and appellant got out of the\ncar. Mojica recognized Dunn, but not Simpson.\n      Mojica asked Dunn and Simpson, “Where you guys from?” They responded, “We\ndon’t gang bang.” Mojica lifted up their shirts to check for gang tattoos and searched\ntheir pockets. He found their iPods and took them. Appellant was three to four feet\naway, pointing a black gun alternately at Dunn and Simpson. Dunn yelled, “Mando.”\n\n\n                                            7\n\fAppellant yelled, “Compton Varrio Segundo” and shot Dunn once as he tried to run up a\nflight of stairs. Mojica and appellant ran back to the car, which had moved further down\nthe street during the confrontation. Mojica was certain he had taken Dunn’s iPod,\nalthough it was found at the scene. Mojica and appellant intended to sell the iPods, and\nMojica gave them to appellant.\n       Mojica was interviewed at the time he was arrested, and a portion of that interview\nwas played for the jury. In the interview, Mojica identified appellant as the shooter,\nwhich was consistent with his trial testimony, but otherwise the account of the shooting\nhe gave to officers differed in certain details from his trial testimony. Those differences\nform the basis for one of appellant’s contentions on appeal, so we will discuss them in\nmore detail below.\n       A Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department criminalist analyzed the nine-millimeter\nbullet and expended cartridge case found at the scene. She determined they were\nconsistent with each other, but she could not say for certain whether they originated\ntogether from the same cartridge.\n       An autopsy on Dunn revealed an entrance and exit bullet wound in his abdomen\nand grazing wounds on his arms. The bullet penetrated or grazed his kidneys, spleen,\npancreas, aorta, liver, and small intestine before exiting his body. The bullet flew from\nleft to right, front to back, and upward. The wound was fatal because of the number of\norgans hit, and Dunn died in surgery, although without surgery he would have bled to\ndeath within hours.\n2. Count Two: Attempted Murder of Inmate Dominic Walker\n       In November 2010, appellant was an inmate in the Men’s Central Jail in Los\nAngeles. He and an African-American inmate named Dominic Walker were “trustees”\nwho had greater freedom to move around the jail in exchange for doing chores, such as\ncleaning. Individuals were typically selected as trustees for their influence over other\ninmates so deputies could use them as liaisons during gang tensions. Trustees could\nleave their cells, walk around the different floors of the jail, and talk to other inmates.\nTrustees were segregated by race, so Walker would have only worked with African-\n\n\n                                               8\n\fAmerican inmates and appellant would have only worked with Hispanic inmates. At the\nend of a trustee’s shift, he can shower apart from the general population.\n       At around 9:20 p.m. on November 4, 2010, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s\nDepartment custody assistant Patricia Cristales was working in the 2400 block of\ndormitories in the jail when she heard a loud yell from the trustees’ shower area. She saw\nWalker walk out of the shower area and approach the officers’ station. Appellant and\nanother inmate named Rivera appeared to stab Walker from behind five or six times,\nalthough Cristales could not see weapons in their hands. Unarmed, Walker appeared to\nbe in excruciating pain and had blood on different parts of his body.4 Cristales yelled,\n“Stop fighting,” but appellant and Rivera did not comply. Appellant and Rivera stopped\nthe attack when backup deputies arrived.\n       Deputy Andrew Lyons responded to the attack on Walker within 10 seconds of\nCristales reporting it. He saw Walker covered in blood from multiple puncture wounds.\nWhen he approached Walker, Walker pointed toward the shower area behind him.\nDeputy Lyons saw appellant and Rivera run from the shower area toward the toilet of a\nnearby “rec” room, yelling “Puro sur trece,” a chant used by southern Hispanic gang\nmembers. Another Hispanic inmate named Mejia was lying down in front of the officer’s\nstation. Deputy Lyons knew Mejia, Rivera, and appellant were all Southsider gang\nmembers.\n       Deputy Lyons followed appellant and Rivera to the toilet area and ordered them to\nlie down on the ground. They did not immediately comply; instead, Deputy Lyons heard\nclanging like someone threw an object into a metal toilet and flushed it. Another deputy,\nAyub Manjra, saw Rivera pass an object to appellant, who then dropped something\nmetallic into the toilet and flushed. Appellant and Rivera then lay down on the ground,\nas ordered. Rivera appeared to have been in a fight, with bruises and redness on his body\nand blood on his face, and appellant had injuries consistent with being in a “brawl.”\n\n\n4     Rivera was five feet six inches and 169 pounds; appellant was six feet two inches\nand 260 pounds; and Walker was around six feet six inches and 340 pounds.\n\n\n                                             9\n\fDeputy Manjra retrieved two jail-made shanks from the toilet, which were consistent\nwith sounds he heard from the toilet. The larger shank was about five inches long.\n       Immediately after the incident, Deputy Lyons spoke with African-American\ntrustee Montay Harbin. Deputy Lyons found Harbin and another African-American\ntrustee locked in the 2400 tier module after the attack. Harbin believed Mejia had locked\nhim in after falsely telling him a black inmate in the module had a problem and needed\nimmediate help. By the time Harbin discovered no one needed help, Mejia shut “B” row\ngate and locked him in. Harbin heard yelling from the shower and saw Walker running\nout, followed by appellant and Rivera.\n       When he testified at trial, Harbin denied telling Deputy Lyons that Mejia had\nlocked him in the module after falsely telling him another inmate needed help. Instead,\nhe said he closed the gate himself when he entered. He also denied telling Deputy Lyons\nhe saw Walker screaming and running out of the shower, followed by two male\nHispanics. He admitted he saw Walker come out of the shower bleeding.\n       Walker suffered six or seven wounds to his back, three to five wounds to his chest,\nand two wounds to his arms and shoulders.5 Immediately after the attack he had\ndifficulty breathing and his eyes were glazed. He had to be taken to the hospital and\ntreated.6\n3. Defense Case\n       Appellant testified. He admitted he was a member of the Florencia 13 Jokers\nclique and he was named Little Bozo after his father, who was known as Bozo when he\nwas active in the gang years earlier. Appellant denied committing crimes with the gang\nor hitting up rival gang members, and his role in the gang diminished when he got a full-\ntime job in 2008. He had friends inside and outside of the gang, including African-\nAmericans.\n\n\n5      Ten photographs of Walker’s injuries were introduced at trial.\n6      The prosecution also called a gang expert witness, but because no issue is raised\nwith regard to the gang allegations, we omit that witness’s testimony.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       As for Dunn’s murder, he testified he knew Dunn from elementary school and\ndenied shooting him. On the day of Dunn’s death, he drove his Cadillac to his job at a\ncleaning company and got off at 4:30 p.m. Around 5:00 p.m., he went with his girlfriend\nand their infant son to a furniture store to make a payment on a line of credit. Due to a\ncomputer problem, they went to another branch of the furniture store and made the\npayment at 7:05 p.m., and then returned to the first store to buy a fan. They then went to\na birthday party for his cousin in Pico Rivera, where they stayed until 9:00 or 10:00 p.m.\n       Appellant’s girlfriend and several of his family members corroborated appellant’s\nalibi testimony at trial. Of note, however, appellant’s aunt, who hosted the birthday\nparty, learned of appellant’s arrest from his parents, but they did not encourage her to call\nthe police with appellant’s alibi. Also, while appellant’s father corroborated appellant’s\nbirthday party alibi at trial, he previously told police in an interview on May 27, 2008,\nthat appellant returned home from paying bills at 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. on the night of\nDunn’s murder and had fallen asleep there.\n       Appellant eventually heard about Dunn’s death through neighborhood talk. When\nhe was arrested for the murder, he was carrying an iPod he recently received as a gift. In\nan interview with police, he said he was in Lancaster at the time of Dunn’s death,\nalthough he explained at trial he was nervous and confused about the date.\n       A neighbor, Donnell Tinsley, Jr., testified on behalf of appellant. The night of\nDunn’s murder Tinsley was in his apartment two units away from Dunn’s home when he\nheard a gunshot. He ran outside and saw Dunn at the top of the stairs. Dunn said, “I was\nshot.” Tinsley saw a dark green Honda with tinted windows in front of the apartment\nbuilding heading west. Tinsley called the police and waited with Dunn until authorities\narrived. At trial, Tinsley recognized appellant as Bozo and had seen him occasionally\nhanging around the apartments near the area of Dunn’s death. Tinsley also knew Mando\nand would barbecue and socialize with him.\n       As for the attack on Dominic Walker, appellant admitted he stabbed Walker with a\nshank. Before the attack, appellant and Rivera entered the shower and were surprised to\nfind Walker there, apparently urinating. They were concerned because they had heard\n\n\n                                             11\n\fabout guards letting inmates out to attack other inmates. Appellant thought he was being\nset up for an attack, so he got “paranoid,” “overreacted,” and “panicked,” and went after\nWalker with the shank. Appellant claimed he overreacted and was paranoid because he\nhad been attacked in jail a year earlier, leaving him unconscious and hospitalized.\nGuards did not come to his aid then, so he believed he needed to protect himself. He was\nalso paranoid because a week prior to the attack on Walker several riots between African-\nAmerican and Hispanic inmates had broken out.\n       Appellant claimed he did not intend to kill Walker, avoided stabbing his neck and\nface, and stopped stabbing him when appellant no longer felt in danger. He also claimed\nhe was the only one in the shower area with a shank. After the attack, he ran into the\ndayroom and tried to flush the shank. When interviewed after the incident, he claimed he\ndid not know what happened.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n1. Count One: Playing of Mojica’s Police Interview at Trial\n       Appellant contends the trial court violated his constitutional due process rights by\nplaying for the jury portions of the interview Mojica gave to officers at the time he was\narrested because the evidence was unnecessary, cumulative, and confusing. We disagree.\nA. Factual Background\n       As discussed above, on direct examination at trial Mojica identified appellant as\nthe shooter, admitted to being the back passenger who checked Dunn and Simpson for\ntattoos, and described details of the incident. On cross-examination, he admitted some of\nthose details differed from the account he gave to Lieutenant Katz and Detective Richard\nRamirez during his interview after his arrest. For example, while he identified appellant\nas the shooter, he did not say a person named Stranger was with them during the time of\nthe murder. He also claimed he and appellant parked appellant’s Cadillac across the\nstreet from Dunn, and as they crossed the street, Mojica stopped to tie his shoelace while\nappellant walked up to Dunn by himself and shot him. Afterward, Mojica and appellant\nran toward the east, leaving appellant’s car parked at the scene.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       Mojica testified his trial account of the incident was truthful and the details\ndiffered from his interview because at that time of his interview he was scared for his life\nand his family. Defense counsel’s cross-examination suggested Mojica had a motive to\nlie in light of his plea deal, a point counsel reiterated in closing arguments.\n       After Mojica testified, the prosecutor sought permission to play the audio\nrecording of his interview, arguing Mojica’s prior consistent statements, particularly his\nidentification of appellant, were admissible to rebut the defense’s suggestion Mojica’s\ntestimony was influenced by his plea deal, and Mojica’s prior inconsistent statements\nwere admissible for impeachment. Defense counsel objected on several grounds,\nincluding that a large portion of Mojica’s interview was irrelevant; Detective Ramirez\ncould testify to Mojica’s statements without admitting the recording of the interview;\nMojica had already testified about his prior consistent statements on cross-examination;\nand any prior consistent statements were admissible only to rebut later inconsistent\nstatements.\n       After indicating the prosecutor could not introduce the entire interview under any\ncircumstances, the trial court tentatively prohibited the prosecutor from introducing any\nportion of the recording because Mojica could be recalled as a witness and the prosecutor\ncould directly elicit the prior consistent statements rather than playing the recording. The\ncourt also tentatively denied the prosecution’s request to call Detective Ramirez to testify\nto Mojica’s interview statements for the same reason.\n       In a later hearing, the prosecutor asked the trial court to reconsider its ruling and\npresented a redacted transcript of the recording reducing the full 50-minute interview to\nfour minutes and five transcript pages. Defense counsel once again objected, suggesting\nthe recording would require calling additional witnesses, including recalling Mojica.\nFurther, while defense counsel did not necessarily take issue with the content of the\nrecording, he believed “it’s not necessary in this case because the People have already\nestablished . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . the prior consistent statement through the testimony of\nMr. Mojica, and that all this . . . is cumulative . . . .”\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f         The trial court pressed the prosecutor to identify which statements from Mojica’s\ninterview he believed were consistent with Mojica’s trial testimony, and the prosecutor\npointed out the following (all errors in original):7\n         (1) “He [appellant] shot him [Dunn].”\n         (2) In response to the question, “Did he take the iPod from him?,” Mojica said, “I\nremember because when I was there, but I’m fuck that, that ain’t my shit, you know,” and\n“And then I was walking away then with it, fucking running and shit.”\n         (3) He was asked, “You ran, bro, because you were scared. You didn’t know that\nwas gonna happen, right?” He responded, “I didn’t. He killed him and I guess he killed\nhim right there on the spot.”\n         (4) He was asked, “Who killed him, bro?” and “We’re talking Bozo? Is that a\n‘yes,’ Gilbert?” He responded, “Yeah.”\n         (5) “And for reals if I am telling you guys I don’t want Bozo to know cause . . . I\ngotta protect my family and shit, you know my little brother start riding and everything.”\n         (6) “I was barely walking -- like, a few houses [¶] . . . [¶] [a]nd when that shit\nhappens, I’m like, ‘What the fuck?’ And I just ran a little bit. And then I just -- ‘cause I\ncan’t even run a lot, you know . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . ‘cause my weight. [¶] . . . [¶]\n. . . And I just ran over, and I just like, ‘Damn, fool just shot,’ like, ‘damn.’ I seen what I\nseen.”\n         The trial court also pressed the prosecutor to identify the inconsistent statements,\nand he pointed out the following (all errors in original):\n         (1) Mojica was asked, “How was it that you guys wound up there together, bro?\nHow is that? How did that happen?” He responded, “He picked me up and shit. And the\ncar -- we parked, like, on the block and shit. We’re right there kicking it. He didn’t told\nme shit. You know where shit, fuck we gonna be able to park.” He was asked, “Where\n\n\n\n\n7     For clarity, we quote the transcript of the interview rather than the trial transcript\nbecause some of the statements were not precisely quoted during the hearing.\n\n\n                                               14\n\fwas the car parked, bro?” He responded, “Right there by 72nd, right in front of the\napartment” and “A couple, few houses away, you know.”\n       (2) When asked, “When do you know that he’s got a gun in the car?,” he\nresponded, “I never seen it. That’s why I tripped out like, ‘What the fuck?’”\n       (3) “He just, like, ‘Let’s take a walk fool. Let’s go see the apartments.’ All right.\nWe got out of the car, and then we were right there. And then I started tying my\nshoelaces . . . just started walking, tying my shoe. And then I just heard, like, ‘Hey,’\n‘Where you from?’ and he was on one. And he knew he didn’t bang.” He was asked,\n“[S]o you saw him approach the guys on the stairs?” He responded, “[H]e know he\ndidn’t bang . . . .” He was asked, “[S]o, he knew it was Dominique? He knew he didn’t\nbang?” He responded, “He knew he didn’t bang, but I guess he was just so fucking that\nway, he fuckin’ -- ‘cause he’s stupid.”\n       (4) He said he was “maybe, 20 feet, 30 feet” away when he heard the shot.\n       The prosecutor also identified statements he believed were both consistent and\ninconsistent with Mojica’s trial testimony (all errors in original):\n       (1) He was asked, “Okay, you see him go up to these vatos and ask ‘em where\nthey’re from; is that right? Is that a ‘yes’?” He responded, “Yeah.”\n       (2) He was asked, “And you saw him say what?” He responded, “He like,\n‘Where you from?’ And then I just heard them say, ‘I don’t bang.’ I’m like, What?\n(Inaudible) give me your iPod. And then like, What. I don’t know how he knew they\nhad an iPod cause by the time that was already getting over when I heard the shot, when I\nwas tying my shoe, by the time -- that shit happened, like, everything, like, I was --\n(inaudible), you know.”\n       The trial court took the matter under submission and ultimately overruled the\ndefense objections, permitting the prosecution to call Detective Ramirez and play the\nredacted recording for the jury. The redacted recording and transcript were admitted into\nevidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fB. Analysis\n       Appellant concedes the redacted recording and transcript of Mojica’s interview\nwere admissible as either prior consistent or inconsistent statements. (Evid. Code,\n§§ 770, 791, 1235, 1236;8 see People v. Homick (2012) 55 Cal.4th 816C.M., 859 [prior\ninconsistent statements]; People v. Riccardi (2012) 54 Cal.4th 758C.M., 802 [prior\nconsistent statements].) So appellant argues the interview excerpts were cumulative,\nunnecessary, and risked confusing the jury in light of CALCRIM No. 318, an instruction\nread to the jury. This is essentially an argument that the trial court abused its discretion\nin finding this evidence admissible under Evidence Code section 352.9 We “‘will not\ndisturb a trial court’s exercise of discretion under Evidence Code section 352 unless it is\nshown the trial court exercised its discretion “‘in an arbitrary, capricious or patently\n\n\n\n\n8       Evidence Code section 1236 states, “Evidence of a statement previously made by\na witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is consistent with\nhis testimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section\n791.” Evidence Code section 791 states in relevant part, “Evidence of a statement\npreviously made by a witness that is consistent with his testimony at the hearing is\ninadmissible to support his credibility unless it is offered after: [¶] . . . [¶] (b) An\nexpress or implied charge has been made that his testimony at the hearing is recently\nfabricated or is influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the statement was made\nbefore the bias, motive for fabrication, or other improper motive is alleged to have\narisen.” Evidence Code section 1235 states, “Evidence of a statement made by a witness\nis not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is inconsistent with his\ntestimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section 770.”\nEvidence Code section 770 states, “Unless the interests of justice otherwise require,\nextrinsic evidence of a statement made by a witness that is inconsistent with any part of\nhis testimony at the hearing shall be excluded unless: [¶] (a) The witness was so\nexamined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the\nstatement; or [¶] (b) The witness has not been excused from giving further testimony in\nthe action.”\n9     Evidence Code section 352 states, “The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.”\n\n\n                                             16\n\fabsurd manner.’” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Homick, supra, at p. 865.) Appellant has\nnot shown an abuse of discretion here.\n       Appellant first argues admission of Mojica’s prior consistent statements was\nunnecessary because, although those statements rebutted defense counsel’s suggestion\nthat Mojica fabricated his trial testimony in light of his plea deal, it did not rebut defense\ncounsel’s other suggestion that Mojica also had a motive to lie to officers in light of his\narrest itself.10 We cannot see why a secondary attack on Mojica’s credibility would\nrender the prior consistent statements unnecessary to rebut defense counsel’s primary\nattack. Indeed, “a prior consistent statement is admissible as long as the statement is\nmade before the existence of any one of the motives that the opposing party expressly or\nimpliedly suggests may have influenced the witness’s testimony.” (People v. Noguera\n(1992) 4 Cal.4th 599C.M., 629 (Noguera), italics added.) The prosecutor could have\nreasonably concluded defense counsel’s primary attack based on the plea deal was a\nserious threat to Mojica’s credibility and it was well within the trial court’s discretion to\nallow the prosecutor to introduce the interview excerpts to rebut that attack.\n       Appellant next cites Noguera to argue that so many details in Mojica’s interview\ndiffered from his trial testimony that the interview had no “corroborative and\nrehabilitative potential.” Noguera, however, did not address the degree to which the\ndetails of the prior and current statements must be consistent in order for the prior\nstatement to be admissible; the court simply found the recording and transcript of a\nwitness’s prior interview corroborated the “origin and details” of a conspiracy to commit\nmurder and “tended to reinforce in the jurors’ minds the impression that [the witness] was\ntruthful.” (Noguera, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 628.) Here, Mojica’s interview corroborated\nhis trial testimony on the key issue in the case: appellant shot Dunn. Beyond that, it was\nhardly unusual that a prior statement by an accomplice-turned-prosecution-witness\n\n\n\n10     We assume, without deciding, defense counsel’s cross-examination in fact implied\nMojica had a motive to lie based on his arrest itself, although the portions of the record\nappellant cites are far from clear on the point.\n\n\n                                              17\n\fcontained both consistencies and inconsistencies, and the degree to which those points\nundermined or rehabilitated his credibility was a matter properly left to the jury.\n       Appellant argues the admission of Mojica’s prior inconsistent statements was\nunnecessary because Mojica acknowledged at trial that his previous account of the\nshooting differed from his current account. While conceding Mojica’s interview was\nindeed cumulative of his trial testimony, the Attorney General argues playing the\ninterview was nevertheless necessary for several reasons: it provided “context” for\nMojica’s earlier story; it would have been difficult to edit the transcript and recording to\neliminate all the inconsistent statements but preserve the consistent statements; and the\njury was entitled to hear Mojica’s own voice giving the false account during his interview\nto weigh his credibility.\n       We need not decide whether these reasons justified introducing Mojica’s prior\ninconsistent statements because we can identify no conceivable prejudice from their\nadmission under either Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 (Chapman)\n(harmless beyond a reasonable doubt) or People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836\n(Watson) (reasonable probability of a more favorable outcome). As appellant\nacknowledges, the inconsistencies were already presented to the jury through Mojica’s\ntrial testimony, none of which involved material points, as appellant himself\nacknowledges. Perhaps more to the point, Mojica’s prior inconsistent statements\nundermined his credibility, so having them repeated for the jury by way of his interview\nserved only to benefit appellant. Thus, the outcome would not have differed had the trial\ncourt excluded the interview.\n       Finally, appellant contends the interview should have been excluded because it\nlikely confused the jury when it applied CALCRIM No. 318, which instructed the jury as\nfollows: “You have heard evidence of statements that a witness made before the trial. If\nyou decide that the witness made those statements, you may use those statements in two\nways: one, to evaluate whether the witness’ testimony in court is believable; and two, as\nevidence that the information in those earlier statements is true.” Appellant has not\nchallenged the substance of this instruction, and we find no possibility the jury was\n\n\n                                             18\n\fconfused in using it to evaluate Mojica’s interview. There was nothing particularly\ncomplicated about the consistencies and inconsistencies between Mojica’s trial testimony\nand his statements during the interview, or the testimony from any other witness, and\nnothing in the record suggests the jury had any trouble evaluating Mojica’s credibility\nand the truthfulness of his prior statements. As appellant aptly notes, “it is hardly\nuncommon for evidence of this nature to present jurors with complex credibility\nchoices,” especially in gang cases in which witnesses might fear for their safety. There is\nno basis to suspect the jury was confused by the trial court’s admission of Mojica’s\ninterview.\n2. Count Two: Attempted Voluntary Manslaughter Instruction\n       Appellant contends the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional\nrights by refusing to give an attempted voluntary manslaughter instruction for count two.\nWe disagree.\n       For count two, defense counsel requested CALCRIM No. 604, which would have\ninstructed the jury on attempted voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense,\na lesser included offense of attempted murder. He argued appellant testified he had\n“panicked” due to the prior attacks on him and had “react[ed] to an environment where\nhe thought he was in danger.” According to defense counsel, “the testimony shows that\nhe had been severely beaten in the past; that he had been subject to a variety of attacks;\nand that the environment in the county jail was one where both guards and inmates . . .\nwere setting people up. That in the week just prior to this, there had been gang or racial\nviolence. [I]t would suffice to create the environment in which voluntary manslaughter\ninstruction would be allowed.”\n       The prosecutor responded the evidence did not support the instruction because\nappellant “walked in, lights were out, and that there is no sudden quarrel. There is no\ndefending himself. It’s just him walking in -- as per him, he panicked and started\nstabbing Dominic Walker.”\n       The court refused to give the instruction, reasoning that it “requires evidence that\nthe defendant believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great\n\n\n                                             19\n\fbodily injury. And there is nothing to support that element of it. He said he was afraid,\nbut we don’t know what he was afraid of, or what he thought was going to happen to him.\nBecause he didn’t say that. He was very vague on that part.” The court noted appellant\nused the word “panicked,” but “that’s totally different from believing he’s in imminent\ndanger of death or great bodily injury.”\n       “‘“The trial court is obligated to instruct the jury on all general principles of law\nrelevant to the issues raised by the evidence, whether or not the defendant makes a formal\nrequest.”’ [Citation.] ‘Conversely, even on request, the court “has no duty to instruct on\nany lesser offense unless there is substantial evidence to support such instruction.”’\n[Citation.] This substantial evidence requirement is not satisfied by ‘“any evidence . . .\nno matter how weak,”’ but rather by evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable\npersons could conclude ‘that the lesser offense, but not the greater, was committed.’\n[Citation.] ‘On appeal, we review independently the question whether the trial court\nfailed to instruct on a lesser included offense.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Avila (2009) 46\nCal.4th 680C.M., 704-705.)\n       A jury may convict a defendant of voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect\nself-defense “‘“when the trier of fact finds that a defendant killed another person because\nthe defendant actually, but unreasonably, believed he was in imminent danger of death or\ngreat bodily injury . . . .” [Citation.]’” (People v. Manriquez (2005) 37 Cal.4th 547C.M.,\n581 (Manriquez).) This theory “‘requires without exception that the defendant must have\nhad an actual belief in the need for self-defense’” and “‘[f]ear of future harm -- no matter\nhow great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm -- will not suffice.\nThe defendant’s fear must be of imminent danger to life or great bodily injury. “‘[T]he\nperil must appear to the defendant as immediate and present and not prospective or even\nin the near future. An imminent peril is one that, from appearances, must be instantly\ndealt with.’”’” (Ibid.)\n       Although appellant testified that prior attacks and incidents made him paranoid\nand he “panicked” when he saw Walker in the shower, appellant offered no evidence he\nactually feared an imminent attack from Walker when he and Rivera entered the shower.\n\n\n                                              20\n\f(Manriquez, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 582.) Walker was alone in the shower and apparently\nunarmed, and there was no evidence Walker did anything to suggest he was about to\nattack appellant. To the contrary, uncontroverted facts demonstrated a brutal,\ncoordinated attack by appellant and Rivera, with assistance from Mejia locking inmate\nHarbin in the 2400 tier module, followed by appellant’s attempt to dispose of the\nweapons, all against a backdrop of racial tensions between Southsider gang members and\nAfrican-American inmates. Even if appellant had actually believed he might be attacked\nat some point in the future, nothing in this record suggests he was faced with an\n“‘“‘imminent peril . . . that, from appearances, must be instantly dealt with.’”’” (Id. at p.\n581.) The trial court did not err in refusing to give the attempted voluntary manslaughter\ninstruction.\n3. Count Two: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n        Appellant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking him on cross-\nexamination whether he was aware of a “kite,” or note, passed between inmates that gave\na “green light” on Walker.11 Appellant has forfeited the argument, and even if not, we\nreject it.\n        During cross-examination, the prosecutor and appellant had the following\nexchange:\n        “Q     Were you aware that there was a kite that was passed between Southsider\ninmates that gave a green light on Scrilla [i.e., Walker]?\n        “A     I wasn’t aware of that.\n        “Q     Is that news to you?\n        “A     That’s news.\n        “Q     Isn’t it true that you as a Southsider knew that there was a green light on\nDominique [sic] Walker?”\n\n11     The prosecution’s gang expert witness explained to the jury a “green light” means\n“someone is marked for death” and that “[t]here will be messages sent within the jail,\ntypically, that someone is no good. There is a green light on someone, and that it’s okay\nfor that person to be hit wherever that person is at.”\n\n\n                                             21\n\f       At that point defense counsel objected and asked to approach the bench. At\nsidebar, he argued appellant already answered he was not aware of the kite and argued\nthis line of questioning was irrelevant. The prosecutor responded he had “a right to ask\nhim . . . what he knows. He says it was just a shock that this guy was in the shower, and\nhe just overreacted, when there is evidence to the contrary.” The court asked the\nprosecutor how far he would delve into the topic, and the prosecutor said, “He’s denying\nit. So that’s all I’m doing. I’m questioning him and moving on.” The court said,\n“Okay,” and defense counsel said, “Okay. Well, whatever.”\n       Back on the record, the prosecutor resumed the questioning briefly:\n       “Q      Let me ask you, Mr. Guerrero, you were aware that there was a green light\non Scrilla; isn’t that true?\n       “A      I wasn’t.\n       “Q      I’m sorry?\n       “A      I wasn’t.\n       “Q      As a Southsider, you have no idea that that was -- that was set; right? Is\nthat what you’re saying?\n       “A      That’s exactly what I’m saying.”\n       A prosecutor commits misconduct in violation of the federal Constitution when he\nor she engages in conduct so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to\nmake the conviction a denial of due process. (People v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th\n622C.M., 679 (Fuiava).) Under state law, a prosecutor commits misconduct if he or she\nuses deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the\njury. (Ibid.) Because the single instance of prosecutorial misconduct alleged in this case\nwas not so egregious it violated due process, we must determine if it was reasonably\nprobable a result more favorable to the defendant would have resulted absent the\nmisconduct. (People v. Bordelon (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1311C.M., 1323-1324, citing\nWatson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)\n       “A defendant generally ‘“‘may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial\nmisconduct unless in a timely fashion -- and on the same ground -- the defendant made an\n\n\n                                             22\n\fassignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the\nimpropriety. [Citation.]’” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Fuiava, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 679.)\nThe failure to timely object may be excused if objecting would have been futile or a jury\nadmonition would not have cured the harm caused by the misconduct. (Ibid.)\n       Appellant has forfeited his misconduct challenge by not objecting to the\nprosecutor’s line of questioning on the basis of misconduct, or at the very least, on the\nbasis that the prosecutor did not have the evidence to support his questions. (See People\nv. Young (2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1186 (Young) [finding no forfeiture of misconduct\nclaim based on prosecutor’s questions when defendant objected that the questions were\nirrelevant in the absence of evidence to substantiate them].) Contrary to appellant’s\nsuggestion, defense counsel’s relevance objection did not alert the trial court to this\nspecific issue; defense counsel merely complained appellant had already answered the\nquestions by denying any knowledge of a “kite” putting a “green light” on Walker.\n       We also disagree with appellant that the trial court prevented defense counsel from\nfully articulating his objection when the discussion of the issue concluded on defense\ncounsel’s comment, “Okay. Well, whatever.” Defense counsel had ample opportunity to\nobject that the prosecutor lacked a good faith basis for his line of questioning, and had he\ndone so, we have little doubt the trial court could have addressed the issue and properly\nadmonished the jury.\n       In any case, appellant’s claim fails on the merits. He is correct that “a prosecutor\nmay not ‘“ask questions of a witness that suggest facts harmful to a defendant, absent a\ngood faith belief that such facts exist.”’” (Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1186.) As noted\nabove, the prosecutor argued appellant “says it was just a shock that this guy was in the\nshower, and he just overreacted, when there is evidence to the contrary.” (Italics added.)\nAlthough that ambiguous statement alone did not necessarily mean the prosecutor had\nspecific evidence a “kite” existed that put a “green light” on Walker, appellant never\nrequested further elaboration or an offer of proof. Not having done so, he cannot now\ncomplain the statement was too vague to demonstrate the prosecutor’s good faith belief.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       Appellant relies on People v. Wagner (1975) 13 Cal.3d 612C.M. and People v.\nEvans (1952) 39 Cal.2d 242C.M., but both cases are inapposite. “In Wagner, the\nprosecutor failed to make an offer of proof or to introduce any evidence to substantiate\nthe implications from his questions that the defendant, who was charged with selling\nmarijuana, had been involved in extensive drug sales. (Wagner, at pp. 616-619.) In\nEvans, the prosecutor, without any evidentiary support, improperly asked the defendant a\nseries of questions insinuating the defendant accosted and molested a girl in a park.\n(Evans, at pp. 247-249.)” (Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1186.) Here, by contrast, the\nprosecutor indicated he had evidence to substantiate his questioning, and without a\nrequest by defense counsel to elaborate, that was enough to provide a good faith basis for\nthe questions.\n       Even if the prosecutor’s questioning had amounted to misconduct, appellant\ncannot show prejudice under either the Chapman or Watson standards. The exchange\nwas only a small part of the trial proceedings (less than one page of the lengthy trial\ntranscript) and did not imply appellant had originated the “kite” that put a “green light”\non Walker, but only that appellant might have known one existed. And the existence of a\n“kite” would have been at best cumulative of the significant evidence that the attack on\nWalker was coordinated and planned. Under these circumstances, appellant would not\nhave obtained a more favorable outcome absent the alleged misconduct.\n4. Count Two: Great Bodily Injury Enhancement\n       Appellant contends his state and federal constitutional rights were violated\nbecause insufficient evidence supported the jury’s finding that he inflicted great bodily\ninjury on Walker as required for the enhancement under section 12022.7, subdivision (a).\nWe disagree.\n       Section 12022.7, subdivision (a) states, “Any person who personally inflicts great\nbodily injury on any person other than an accomplice in the commission of a felony or\nattempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of\nimprisonment in the state prison for three years.” “Great bodily injury” is defined as “a\nsignificant or substantial physical injury” (§ 12022.7, subd. (f)), which requires\n\n\n                                             24\n\f“substantial injury beyond that inherent in the offense,” but not “‘permanent,’\n‘prolonged’ or ‘protracted’ disfigurement, impairment, or loss of bodily function”\n(People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 746, 750 (Escobar); see People v. Cross (2008)\n45 Cal.4th 58, 64). “Proof that a victim’s bodily injury is ‘great’ -- that is, significant or\nsubstantial within the meaning of section 12022.7 -- is commonly established by\nevidence of the severity of the victim’s physical injury, the resulting pain, or the medical\ncare required to treat or repair the injury.” (Cross, supra, at p. 66.) This is an issue of\nfact that we review for substantial evidence, and we must accept the jury’s determination\neven if the circumstances might reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding.\n(Escobar, supra, at p. 750; People v. Le (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 54C.M., 59 (Le).)\n       The evidence readily supported the jury’s finding Walker suffered great bodily\ninjury under section 12022.7. He had been stabbed multiple times with prison-made\nshanks, one at least five inches long, and he appeared to be in excruciating pain and had\nblood on different parts of his body immediately after the attack. Upon examination,\ndeputies observed he had suffered six or seven wounds to his back, three to five wounds\nto his chest, and two wounds to his arms and shoulders. He had difficulty breathing and\nhis eyes were glazed. He had to be taken to the hospital and treated.\n       Walker’s injuries fell well within the universe of similar injuries courts have found\nconstituted great bodily injury. (Escobar, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 750 [extensive bruises\nand abrasions, neck pain, and vaginal soreness impairing victim’s ability to walk]; Le,\nsupra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 59 [soft tissue damage from a gunshot rendering the victim\n“unable to walk, stand, or sit unassisted for weeks”]; People v. Bustos (1994) 23\nCal.App.4th 1747C.M., 1755 [multiple abrasions, lacerations, and contusions]; People v.\nHarvey (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 823C.M., 827-828 [blistering second degree burns with\nvisible discoloration and disfigurement for at least a month requiring repeated medical\ntreatments]; People v. Muniz (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1508C.M., 1520 [bruised and\nswollen eye, loss of consciousness, and severe blows that “‘felt like splinters going\nthrough [victim’s] skull’”]; People v. Sanchez (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 718C.M., 733\n[multiple abrasions, lacerations, bruises, and swelling]; People v. Jaramillo (1979) 98\n\n\n                                              25\n\fCal.App.3d 830C.M., 836 [multiple contusions, swelling, and sever discoloration painful\nto the touch and visible a day later].)\n       Although appellant cites Walker’s medical records to question the severity of\nWalker’s injuries, he is essentially urging us to reweigh the evidence, which we cannot\ndo. Nor are we persuaded by his reliance on People v. Martinez (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d\n727C.M., the only case he cites finding evidence insufficient to demonstrate great bodily\ninjury. It involved only a minor laceration inflicted on the victim through two shirts and\na heavy coat, and it did not require the victim to be taken to the hospital. (Id. at p. 735.)\nThe prosecutor had even agreed the injury did not satisfy section 12022.7 and asked the\nallegation be stricken. (Martinez, at pp. 735-736.) Here, in sharp contrast, Walker was\nstabbed multiple times, appeared to be in excruciating pain, and had to be taken to the\nhospital.12 Sufficient evidence supported the jury’s finding that the great bodily injury\nrequirement of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) had been met.\n5. Incorrect Court Operations Fee\n       The oral pronouncement of judgment, the sentencing minutes, and the abstract of\njudgment reflect the trial court imposed a $200 court operations fee on each count, for a\ntotal fee of $400, pursuant to section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1). Appellant contends this\nwas error and the maximum statutory fee was $40 per count, for a total of $80. The\nAttorney General agrees, as do we. (§ 1465.8, subd. (a)(1) [“To assist in funding court\noperations, an assessment of forty dollars ($40) shall be imposed on every conviction for\na criminal offense,” with certain exceptions not pertinent here]; People v. Sencion (2012)\n211 Cal.App.4th 480C.M., 483-484 [separate court operations fee imposed on each\n\n\n\n12     Appellant also cites People v. Covino (1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 660C.M., in which\nthe court suggested in dicta that the victim appeared not to suffer great bodily injury\nbased on a “momentary interruption of breathing and slight reddening of the skin without\nany substantial damage to bodily tissues.” (Id. at p. 667.) But the case did not involve\nsection 12022.7; it involved assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury under\nsection 245, subdivision (a), which does not require any injury at all. (Covino, at p. 667.)\nIn any case, Walker’s injuries easily surpassed those inflicted on the victim in Covino.\n\n\n                                              26\n\fcount].) Therefore, we will modify the judgment to reflect the proper court operations\nfee of $80.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is modified to impose the correct court operations fee of $80.\n(§ 1465.8, subd. (a)(1).) The clerk of the superior court is ordered to issue an amended\nabstract of judgment reflecting the correct court operations fee and forward a copy of the\namended abstract of judgment to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n       In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  FLIER, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n       BIGELOW, P.

Code, § 187, subd. (a)),1 and one count of attempted willful, deliberate, and\npremeditated murder (§§ 187, subd. (a), 664). For the murder count, the jury found true a\nspecial circumstance that appellant committed the murder in the course of a robbery\n(§ 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) and found true an allegation that appellant personally and\nintentionally discharged a firearm resulting in the victim’s death (§ 12022.53, subd. (d)).\nFor the attempted murder count, the jury found true an allegation that appellant used a\ndeadly weapon (a shank) (§ 12022, subd. (b)(1)) and caused the victim great bodily injury\n(§ 12022.7, subd. (a)). As to both counts, the jury found true an allegation that appellant\ncommitted the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in association with a\ncriminal street gang. (§ 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(C).)\n       Appellant was sentenced to a total of 44 years to life in prison plus life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole, which included 25 years to life for the firearm\nenhancement in the murder count, plus life in prison without the possibility of parole for\nthe special circumstances conviction, and 15 years to life for the attempted murder count\nin conjunction with the gang enhancement, plus one year for the deadly weapon\nenhancement and three years for the great bodily injury enhancement. The gang\nenhancement for the murder count was stayed. (§ 654.) Appellant timely appealed.\n                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n1. Count One: Murder of Dominique Dunn in May 2008\n       In May 2008, 19-year-old Dominique Dunn lived with his mother Yvette\nMatthews in an apartment complex on 72nd Street in the City of Paramount. He was not\na gang member, and his mother did not know of any trouble he had with anyone in the\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fneighborhood. Dunn got together daily with his best friend James Simpson, who also\nwas not involved in gang activity.\n       Matthews and Dunn knew a man in the neighborhood named Armando Rodriguez,\nwhom they called “Mando.” Mando2 was known as the “neighborhood grandpa” because\nchildren would go to his house to “hang out” and he would babysit. He babysat Dunn a\nfew times. In May 2008, he lived downstairs from Matthews and Dunn in the same\napartment complex. Before that time, he lived next door in the apartment building where\nDunn was murdered.\n       On May 20, 2008, the day of Dunn’s murder, Matthews left her house for work at\n5:00 a.m. while Dunn was still asleep; he did not have school that day. Dunn and\nSimpson spent the day together. Simpson had a small “iPod Nano” in his jacket pocket\nand he thought Dunn had one, too. Matthews came home at approximately 6:30 p.m. to\nfind Dunn and Simpson sitting together outside near their apartment building. Dunn\nasked Matthews for money, which she gave him, and Dunn and Simpson walked to a\nnearby market. Matthews went into her apartment.\n       Albert Turner lived nearby. On the day of the murder, he had returned home from\nwork around dusk and saw two African-American men, apparently Dunn and Simpson,\nemerge from an alley, cross 72nd Street, and approach a nearby apartment building. He\nthought they looked familiar, but they wore hoodies and he could not be certain if he\nknew them.\n       At around the same time, Mando was working on his car and saw Dunn on the\nstreet in front of his apartment.\n       Dunn and Simpson passed through a wrought iron gate of the building where the\nshooting would occur; Dunn sat on the stairs while Simpson stood against a wall.\nSimpson noticed a Honda pass back and forth on the street in front of them. On the car’s\nthird pass, it stopped in the middle of the street and two Hispanic men exited from the\nfront and back passengerside doors. The back passenger walked up to Dunn and\n\n2      We refer to Rodriguez as “Mando” for clarity only and intend no disrespect.\n\n\n                                            3\n\fSimpson and asked if they “banged,” that is, if they were in a gang. Simpson said no.\nThe front passenger stood near the car with a black semiautomatic gun pointed at them.\nNeither Simpson nor Dunn was armed.\n       The front passenger was about Simpson’s height, but thin, wearing all black\nclothes and a black hat. The back passenger was “[a] little chubby” and had a shaved\nhead. The back passenger lifted up Dunn’s and Simpson’s shirts to check for tattoos. He\nspit in Simpson’s face, checked his pockets, found Simpson’s iPod, and took it. Simpson\nwas afraid.\n       At that point, Dunn started to run up the stairs and screamed, “Mando.” The front\npassenger shot him once. The back passenger yelled “C.V.S.” or “Compton Varrio\nSegundo,” a gang slogan. Simpson ran around the corner of the building because he\nthought he would be shot next. He saw the men run back toward the car, but he did not\nsee what they did after that. He found a back entrance to the building and went inside to\ntell someone Dunn had been shot. He then located Dunn, injured but awake.\n       Simpson ran to tell Dunn’s mother that Dunn had been hurt, and she ran screaming\nto the building where she found neighbors trying to help Dunn. Dunn was awake when\nMatthews got to him. When authorities arrived, they ordered Matthews and others to\nleave the area. Simpson also went home. Matthews learned Dunn later died at the\nhospital.\n       Several Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department deputies responded to the scene.\nArriving first, Deputy Steven Kowaltschuk found Dunn lying conscious at the top of the\nstaircase of the apartment building and being assisted by neighbors. He saw blood on\nDunn’s chest and near his right pants pocket. He asked Dunn what happened and Dunn\ntold him he was in front of the same building when a four-door, dark-colored car pulled\nup and three Hispanic men exited. One asked for his iPod, but he refused to give it to\nhim and ran, at which point he heard a gunshot and felt pain in his chest. He saw the car\ndepart westbound while he fled up the stairs and he heard someone yell, “Compton\nVarrio Segundo.” Deputy Kowaltschuk initiated a crime broadcast for three suspects and\na dark-colored, four-door sedan.\n\n\n                                            4\n\f       Deputy Cesar Quiroz arrived as paramedics rendered aid to Dunn. He saw Dunn’s\nhat and iPod nearby. He searched the surrounding area and found an expended nine-\nmillimeter casing and bullet in front of the building, but no gun.\n       Lieutenant Steven Katz arrived after Dunn had been taken away by paramedics.\nHe spoke to Matthews, and she pointed him toward Simpson, who he interviewed the\nnext morning. He showed Simpson a book containing photographs of Hispanic males,\nbut Simpson did not identify anyone. A few days later, police asked Simpson to look at\nsome six-pack photographic lineups, although he did not want to. When he did, he again\ndid not identify anyone. He did pick out someone who looked similar because officers\nasked him to.\n       Simpson was eventually arrested for disobeying a subpoena to appear at the\npreliminary hearing in this case. At that hearing, he initially identified appellant as the\nshooter, but recanted on cross-examination. At trial, he testified appellant was not\ninvolved in Dunn’s shooting and the reason he identified him initially was because “that\nwas the man the police thought.”3\n       Debra Getts was a resident of the building where Dunn was shot and she witnessed\nparts of the incident. She was sleeping and awoke to the sound of someone running\noutside her apartment. She heard a gunshot and someone yell “help” and “Mando, help.”\nShe opened her door and saw Dunn grasping his right ribcage area; he told her to call\n911. She ran to find Dunn’s mother in the building next door, and some neighbors tried\nto help Dunn before authorities arrived. She later gave a statement to police.\n       Turner, Dunn’s neighbor across the street, also witnessed parts of the shooting\nincident. At approximately 6:30 or 7:00 p.m., he was watching a basketball game on\ntelevision when he saw the same two African-American men walking back the way they\nhad come earlier. Later, while he was still watching the game, he heard arguing or a\ncommotion outside. Someone said, “What set you from[?]” Another person responded,\n\n\n3      Beyond denying appellant was involved in the shooting, Simpson denied seeing\nappellant’s Cadillac at the scene; instead, he saw a dark green Honda.\n\n\n                                              5\n\f“I’m not from no gang.” He then heard a gunshot. He looked outside and saw two\nHispanic men, approximately 20 years old, running from the scene. One of them wore a\nDodgers hat. He recognized them because they had once visited his home with Mando;\non that occasion, he had asked Mando to tell them to leave because they carried blue rags,\nwhich Turner believed was gang attire.\n       On May 27, 2008, Lieutenant Katz received an anonymous tip from Turner, who\ndid not initially identify himself because he was concerned for his safety. Lieutenant\nKatz met with Turner that day and Turner described what he had seen leading up to the\ntime of Dunn’s murder, which was largely consistent with his account of the incident\nduring trial.\n       A few days later on May 30, 2008, Turner identified a photograph of appellant,\nwho he knew as “Bozo,” and said he had seen appellant in front of his house the day\nbefore Dunn’s death. At trial, Turner thought the person in the photograph he had\nidentified was the man in his yard named Bozo, but he could not be sure because the\nperson looked different in the photograph. He denied saying that person was the one he\nsaw running from the scene on the night of Dunn’s murder; he claimed officers told him\nto circle the photograph and write down the name “Bozo.”\n       After interviewing Turner, Lieutenant Katz interviewed Mando, who provided\naddresses for appellant and another suspect, Gilbert Mojica. During his interview,\nMando told officers appellant had said in the past, “[‘]I don’t like blacks. I don’t like\nniggers[,’] that’s what he says all the times he sees them.” At trial, Mando testified he\nknew appellant from around the neighborhood and would invite him over to barbecue or\nplay dominos. Once, he heard appellant say the “F” word with the “N” word, referring to\nAfrican-American people, but it seemed to Mando appellant “didn’t really mean it like in\na bad way.”\n       Mando knew appellant was in a gang. He did not know which one, but he had\nseen appellant’s “Florencia” tattoo and he knew that was a local gang. He saw appellant\nand Mojica together two to three times each week.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      On June 6, 2008, Deputy Pascual Delgadillo and other officers arrested appellant\nand executed a search warrant for his residence. In response to questioning at the scene,\nappellant told Deputy Delgadillo he was in the Florencia 13 gang and he used the\nmoniker Bozo. He had visible tattoos on his arms and a belt buckle with the letter “F” on\nit. The search uncovered items of gang paraphernalia and a box of live .38-caliber\nammunition.\n      Mojica was also arrested on the same day. In exchange for pleading guilty to\nvoluntary manslaughter and being sentenced to 13 years in prison, Mojica testified\nagainst appellant. Mojica associated with Florencia gang members and was known as\n“Youngster.” He knew appellant as “Bozo” and they had been friends since they were 14\nor 15 years old. He explained the apartment complex where Dunn was shot was a “hang-\nout” area in Paramount for Florencia members. He described Mando as an “OG,” or old-\ntime gang member who was known throughout the neighborhood, and he said he and\nappellant would often hang out with him. Mojica and appellant shot pool once with\nMando in Turner’s backyard.\n      Mojica feared for his life and his family as a result of testifying. Nevertheless, he\nidentified appellant as the shooter and a Florencia gang member, and he admitted to\nbeing the back passenger who checked Dunn and Simpson for tattoos. He identified the\ndriver of the car as another gang member known as “Stranger.” He explained on the\nnight of Dunn’s murder, he, appellant, and Stranger had been driving around the\nneighborhood drinking and smoking in appellant’s Cadillac when they noticed Dunn and\nSimpson. Appellant said, “There is some fools right there hanging in front of the\napartment. They got some i-Pods. Let’s go.” Appellant also said, “Let’s go jack them.”\nAfter passing by Dunn and Simpson several times, Mojica and appellant got out of the\ncar. Mojica recognized Dunn, but not Simpson.\n      Mojica asked Dunn and Simpson, “Where you guys from?” They responded, “We\ndon’t gang bang.” Mojica lifted up their shirts to check for gang tattoos and searched\ntheir pockets. He found their iPods and took them. Appellant was three to four feet\naway, pointing a black gun alternately at Dunn and Simpson. Dunn yelled, “Mando.”\n\n\n                                            7\n\fAppellant yelled, “Compton Varrio Segundo” and shot Dunn once as he tried to run up a\nflight of stairs. Mojica and appellant ran back to the car, which had moved further down\nthe street during the confrontation. Mojica was certain he had taken Dunn’s iPod,\nalthough it was found at the scene. Mojica and appellant intended to sell the iPods, and\nMojica gave them to appellant.\n       Mojica was interviewed at the time he was arrested, and a portion of that interview\nwas played for the jury. In the interview, Mojica identified appellant as the shooter,\nwhich was consistent with his trial testimony, but otherwise the account of the shooting\nhe gave to officers differed in certain details from his trial testimony. Those differences\nform the basis for one of appellant’s contentions on appeal, so we will discuss them in\nmore detail below.\n       A Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department criminalist analyzed the nine-millimeter\nbullet and expended cartridge case found at the scene. She determined they were\nconsistent with each other, but she could not say for certain whether they originated\ntogether from the same cartridge.\n       An autopsy on Dunn revealed an entrance and exit bullet wound in his abdomen\nand grazing wounds on his arms. The bullet penetrated or grazed his kidneys, spleen,\npancreas, aorta, liver, and small intestine before exiting his body. The bullet flew from\nleft to right, front to back, and upward. The wound was fatal because of the number of\norgans hit, and Dunn died in surgery, although without surgery he would have bled to\ndeath within hours.\n2. Count Two: Attempted Murder of Inmate Dominic Walker\n       In November 2010, appellant was an inmate in the Men’s Central Jail in Los\nAngeles. He and an African-American inmate named Dominic Walker were “trustees”\nwho had greater freedom to move around the jail in exchange for doing chores, such as\ncleaning. Individuals were typically selected as trustees for their influence over other\ninmates so deputies could use them as liaisons during gang tensions. Trustees could\nleave their cells, walk around the different floors of the jail, and talk to other inmates.\nTrustees were segregated by race, so Walker would have only worked with African-\n\n\n                                               8\n\fAmerican inmates and appellant would have only worked with Hispanic inmates. At the\nend of a trustee’s shift, he can shower apart from the general population.\n       At around 9:20 p.m. on November 4, 2010, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s\nDepartment custody assistant Patricia Cristales was working in the 2400 block of\ndormitories in the jail when she heard a loud yell from the trustees’ shower area. She saw\nWalker walk out of the shower area and approach the officers’ station. Appellant and\nanother inmate named Rivera appeared to stab Walker from behind five or six times,\nalthough Cristales could not see weapons in their hands. Unarmed, Walker appeared to\nbe in excruciating pain and had blood on different parts of his body.4 Cristales yelled,\n“Stop fighting,” but appellant and Rivera did not comply. Appellant and Rivera stopped\nthe attack when backup deputies arrived.\n       Deputy Andrew Lyons responded to the attack on Walker within 10 seconds of\nCristales reporting it. He saw Walker covered in blood from multiple puncture wounds.\nWhen he approached Walker, Walker pointed toward the shower area behind him.\nDeputy Lyons saw appellant and Rivera run from the shower area toward the toilet of a\nnearby “rec” room, yelling “Puro sur trece,” a chant used by southern Hispanic gang\nmembers. Another Hispanic inmate named Mejia was lying down in front of the officer’s\nstation. Deputy Lyons knew Mejia, Rivera, and appellant were all Southsider gang\nmembers.\n       Deputy Lyons followed appellant and Rivera to the toilet area and ordered them to\nlie down on the ground. They did not immediately comply; instead, Deputy Lyons heard\nclanging like someone threw an object into a metal toilet and flushed it. Another deputy,\nAyub Manjra, saw Rivera pass an object to appellant, who then dropped something\nmetallic into the toilet and flushed. Appellant and Rivera then lay down on the ground,\nas ordered. Rivera appeared to have been in a fight, with bruises and redness on his body\nand blood on his face, and appellant had injuries consistent with being in a “brawl.”\n\n\n4     Rivera was five feet six inches and 169 pounds; appellant was six feet two inches\nand 260 pounds; and Walker was around six feet six inches and 340 pounds.\n\n\n                                             9\n\fDeputy Manjra retrieved two jail-made shanks from the toilet, which were consistent\nwith sounds he heard from the toilet. The larger shank was about five inches long.\n       Immediately after the incident, Deputy Lyons spoke with African-American\ntrustee Montay Harbin. Deputy Lyons found Harbin and another African-American\ntrustee locked in the 2400 tier module after the attack. Harbin believed Mejia had locked\nhim in after falsely telling him a black inmate in the module had a problem and needed\nimmediate help. By the time Harbin discovered no one needed help, Mejia shut “B” row\ngate and locked him in. Harbin heard yelling from the shower and saw Walker running\nout, followed by appellant and Rivera.\n       When he testified at trial, Harbin denied telling Deputy Lyons that Mejia had\nlocked him in the module after falsely telling him another inmate needed help. Instead,\nhe said he closed the gate himself when he entered. He also denied telling Deputy Lyons\nhe saw Walker screaming and running out of the shower, followed by two male\nHispanics. He admitted he saw Walker come out of the shower bleeding.\n       Walker suffered six or seven wounds to his back, three to five wounds to his chest,\nand two wounds to his arms and shoulders.5 Immediately after the attack he had\ndifficulty breathing and his eyes were glazed. He had to be taken to the hospital and\ntreated.6\n3. Defense Case\n       Appellant testified. He admitted he was a member of the Florencia 13 Jokers\nclique and he was named Little Bozo after his father, who was known as Bozo when he\nwas active in the gang years earlier. Appellant denied committing crimes with the gang\nor hitting up rival gang members, and his role in the gang diminished when he got a full-\ntime job in 2008. He had friends inside and outside of the gang, including African-\nAmericans.\n\n\n5      Ten photographs of Walker’s injuries were introduced at trial.\n6      The prosecution also called a gang expert witness, but because no issue is raised\nwith regard to the gang allegations, we omit that witness’s testimony.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       As for Dunn’s murder, he testified he knew Dunn from elementary school and\ndenied shooting him. On the day of Dunn’s death, he drove his Cadillac to his job at a\ncleaning company and got off at 4:30 p.m. Around 5:00 p.m., he went with his girlfriend\nand their infant son to a furniture store to make a payment on a line of credit. Due to a\ncomputer problem, they went to another branch of the furniture store and made the\npayment at 7:05 p.m., and then returned to the first store to buy a fan. They then went to\na birthday party for his cousin in Pico Rivera, where they stayed until 9:00 or 10:00 p.m.\n       Appellant’s girlfriend and several of his family members corroborated appellant’s\nalibi testimony at trial. Of note, however, appellant’s aunt, who hosted the birthday\nparty, learned of appellant’s arrest from his parents, but they did not encourage her to call\nthe police with appellant’s alibi. Also, while appellant’s father corroborated appellant’s\nbirthday party alibi at trial, he previously told police in an interview on May 27, 2008,\nthat appellant returned home from paying bills at 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. on the night of\nDunn’s murder and had fallen asleep there.\n       Appellant eventually heard about Dunn’s death through neighborhood talk. When\nhe was arrested for the murder, he was carrying an iPod he recently received as a gift. In\nan interview with police, he said he was in Lancaster at the time of Dunn’s death,\nalthough he explained at trial he was nervous and confused about the date.\n       A neighbor, Donnell Tinsley, Jr., testified on behalf of appellant. The night of\nDunn’s murder Tinsley was in his apartment two units away from Dunn’s home when he\nheard a gunshot. He ran outside and saw Dunn at the top of the stairs. Dunn said, “I was\nshot.” Tinsley saw a dark green Honda with tinted windows in front of the apartment\nbuilding heading west. Tinsley called the police and waited with Dunn until authorities\narrived. At trial, Tinsley recognized appellant as Bozo and had seen him occasionally\nhanging around the apartments near the area of Dunn’s death. Tinsley also knew Mando\nand would barbecue and socialize with him.\n       As for the attack on Dominic Walker, appellant admitted he stabbed Walker with a\nshank. Before the attack, appellant and Rivera entered the shower and were surprised to\nfind Walker there, apparently urinating. They were concerned because they had heard\n\n\n                                             11\n\fabout guards letting inmates out to attack other inmates. Appellant thought he was being\nset up for an attack, so he got “paranoid,” “overreacted,” and “panicked,” and went after\nWalker with the shank. Appellant claimed he overreacted and was paranoid because he\nhad been attacked in jail a year earlier, leaving him unconscious and hospitalized.\nGuards did not come to his aid then, so he believed he needed to protect himself. He was\nalso paranoid because a week prior to the attack on Walker several riots between African-\nAmerican and Hispanic inmates had broken out.\n       Appellant claimed he did not intend to kill Walker, avoided stabbing his neck and\nface, and stopped stabbing him when appellant no longer felt in danger. He also claimed\nhe was the only one in the shower area with a shank. After the attack, he ran into the\ndayroom and tried to flush the shank. When interviewed after the incident, he claimed he\ndid not know what happened.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n1. Count One: Playing of Mojica’s Police Interview at Trial\n       Appellant contends the trial court violated his constitutional due process rights by\nplaying for the jury portions of the interview Mojica gave to officers at the time he was\narrested because the evidence was unnecessary, cumulative, and confusing. We disagree.\nA. Factual Background\n       As discussed above, on direct examination at trial Mojica identified appellant as\nthe shooter, admitted to being the back passenger who checked Dunn and Simpson for\ntattoos, and described details of the incident. On cross-examination, he admitted some of\nthose details differed from the account he gave to Lieutenant Katz and Detective Richard\nRamirez during his interview after his arrest. For example, while he identified appellant\nas the shooter, he did not say a person named Stranger was with them during the time of\nthe murder. He also claimed he and appellant parked appellant’s Cadillac across the\nstreet from Dunn, and as they crossed the street, Mojica stopped to tie his shoelace while\nappellant walked up to Dunn by himself and shot him. Afterward, Mojica and appellant\nran toward the east, leaving appellant’s car parked at the scene.\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f       Mojica testified his trial account of the incident was truthful and the details\ndiffered from his interview because at that time of his interview he was scared for his life\nand his family. Defense counsel’s cross-examination suggested Mojica had a motive to\nlie in light of his plea deal, a point counsel reiterated in closing arguments.\n       After Mojica testified, the prosecutor sought permission to play the audio\nrecording of his interview, arguing Mojica’s prior consistent statements, particularly his\nidentification of appellant, were admissible to rebut the defense’s suggestion Mojica’s\ntestimony was influenced by his plea deal, and Mojica’s prior inconsistent statements\nwere admissible for impeachment. Defense counsel objected on several grounds,\nincluding that a large portion of Mojica’s interview was irrelevant; Detective Ramirez\ncould testify to Mojica’s statements without admitting the recording of the interview;\nMojica had already testified about his prior consistent statements on cross-examination;\nand any prior consistent statements were admissible only to rebut later inconsistent\nstatements.\n       After indicating the prosecutor could not introduce the entire interview under any\ncircumstances, the trial court tentatively prohibited the prosecutor from introducing any\nportion of the recording because Mojica could be recalled as a witness and the prosecutor\ncould directly elicit the prior consistent statements rather than playing the recording. The\ncourt also tentatively denied the prosecution’s request to call Detective Ramirez to testify\nto Mojica’s interview statements for the same reason.\n       In a later hearing, the prosecutor asked the trial court to reconsider its ruling and\npresented a redacted transcript of the recording reducing the full 50-minute interview to\nfour minutes and five transcript pages. Defense counsel once again objected, suggesting\nthe recording would require calling additional witnesses, including recalling Mojica.\nFurther, while defense counsel did not necessarily take issue with the content of the\nrecording, he believed “it’s not necessary in this case because the People have already\nestablished . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . the prior consistent statement through the testimony of\nMr. Mojica, and that all this . . . is cumulative . . . .”\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f         The trial court pressed the prosecutor to identify which statements from Mojica’s\ninterview he believed were consistent with Mojica’s trial testimony, and the prosecutor\npointed out the following (all errors in original):7\n         (1) “He [appellant] shot him [Dunn].”\n         (2) In response to the question, “Did he take the iPod from him?,” Mojica said, “I\nremember because when I was there, but I’m fuck that, that ain’t my shit, you know,” and\n“And then I was walking away then with it, fucking running and shit.”\n         (3) He was asked, “You ran, bro, because you were scared. You didn’t know that\nwas gonna happen, right?” He responded, “I didn’t. He killed him and I guess he killed\nhim right there on the spot.”\n         (4) He was asked, “Who killed him, bro?” and “We’re talking Bozo? Is that a\n‘yes,’ Gilbert?” He responded, “Yeah.”\n         (5) “And for reals if I am telling you guys I don’t want Bozo to know cause . . . I\ngotta protect my family and shit, you know my little brother start riding and everything.”\n         (6) “I was barely walking -- like, a few houses [¶] . . . [¶] [a]nd when that shit\nhappens, I’m like, ‘What the fuck?’ And I just ran a little bit. And then I just -- ‘cause I\ncan’t even run a lot, you know . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . ‘cause my weight. [¶] . . . [¶]\n. . . And I just ran over, and I just like, ‘Damn, fool just shot,’ like, ‘damn.’ I seen what I\nseen.”\n         The trial court also pressed the prosecutor to identify the inconsistent statements,\nand he pointed out the following (all errors in original):\n         (1) Mojica was asked, “How was it that you guys wound up there together, bro?\nHow is that? How did that happen?” He responded, “He picked me up and shit. And the\ncar -- we parked, like, on the block and shit. We’re right there kicking it. He didn’t told\nme shit. You know where shit, fuck we gonna be able to park.” He was asked, “Where\n\n\n\n\n7     For clarity, we quote the transcript of the interview rather than the trial transcript\nbecause some of the statements were not precisely quoted during the hearing.\n\n\n                                               14\n\fwas the car parked, bro?” He responded, “Right there by 72nd, right in front of the\napartment” and “A couple, few houses away, you know.”\n       (2) When asked, “When do you know that he’s got a gun in the car?,” he\nresponded, “I never seen it. That’s why I tripped out like, ‘What the fuck?’”\n       (3) “He just, like, ‘Let’s take a walk fool. Let’s go see the apartments.’ All right.\nWe got out of the car, and then we were right there. And then I started tying my\nshoelaces . . . just started walking, tying my shoe. And then I just heard, like, ‘Hey,’\n‘Where you from?’ and he was on one. And he knew he didn’t bang.” He was asked,\n“[S]o you saw him approach the guys on the stairs?” He responded, “[H]e know he\ndidn’t bang . . . .” He was asked, “[S]o, he knew it was Dominique? He knew he didn’t\nbang?” He responded, “He knew he didn’t bang, but I guess he was just so fucking that\nway, he fuckin’ -- ‘cause he’s stupid.”\n       (4) He said he was “maybe, 20 feet, 30 feet” away when he heard the shot.\n       The prosecutor also identified statements he believed were both consistent and\ninconsistent with Mojica’s trial testimony (all errors in original):\n       (1) He was asked, “Okay, you see him go up to these vatos and ask ‘em where\nthey’re from; is that right? Is that a ‘yes’?” He responded, “Yeah.”\n       (2) He was asked, “And you saw him say what?” He responded, “He like,\n‘Where you from?’ And then I just heard them say, ‘I don’t bang.’ I’m like, What?\n(Inaudible) give me your iPod. And then like, What. I don’t know how he knew they\nhad an iPod cause by the time that was already getting over when I heard the shot, when I\nwas tying my shoe, by the time -- that shit happened, like, everything, like, I was --\n(inaudible), you know.”\n       The trial court took the matter under submission and ultimately overruled the\ndefense objections, permitting the prosecution to call Detective Ramirez and play the\nredacted recording for the jury. The redacted recording and transcript were admitted into\nevidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\fB. Analysis\n       Appellant concedes the redacted recording and transcript of Mojica’s interview\nwere admissible as either prior consistent or inconsistent statements. (Evid. Code,\n§§ 770, 791, 1235, 1236;8 see People v. Homick (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">816C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., 859 [prior\ninconsistent statements]; People v.

So appellant argues the interview excerpts were cumulative,\nunnecessary, and risked confusing the jury in light of CALCRIM No. 318, an instruction\nread to the jury. This is essentially an argument that the trial court abused its discretion\nin finding this evidence admissible under Evidence Code section 352.9 We “‘will not\ndisturb a trial court’s exercise of discretion under Evidence Code section 352 unless it is\nshown the trial court exercised its discretion “‘in an arbitrary, capricious or patently\n\n\n\n\n8       Evidence Code section 1236 states, “Evidence of a statement previously made by\na witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is consistent with\nhis testimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section\n791.” Evidence Code section 791 states in relevant part, “Evidence of a statement\npreviously made by a witness that is consistent with his testimony at the hearing is\ninadmissible to support his credibility unless it is offered after: [¶] . . . [¶] (b) An\nexpress or implied charge has been made that his testimony at the hearing is recently\nfabricated or is influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the statement was made\nbefore the bias, motive for fabrication, or other improper motive is alleged to have\narisen.” Evidence Code section 1235 states, “Evidence of a statement made by a witness\nis not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is inconsistent with his\ntestimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with [Evidence Code] Section 770.”\nEvidence Code section 770 states, “Unless the interests of justice otherwise require,\nextrinsic evidence of a statement made by a witness that is inconsistent with any part of\nhis testimony at the hearing shall be excluded unless: [¶] (a) The witness was so\nexamined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the\nstatement; or [¶] (b) The witness has not been excused from giving further testimony in\nthe action.”\n9     Evidence Code section 352 states, “The court in its discretion may exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger\nof undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.”\n\n\n                                             16\n\fabsurd manner.’” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Homick, supra, at p. 865.) Appellant has\nnot shown an abuse of discretion here.\n       Appellant first argues admission of Mojica’s prior consistent statements was\nunnecessary because, although those statements rebutted defense counsel’s suggestion\nthat Mojica fabricated his trial testimony in light of his plea deal, it did not rebut defense\ncounsel’s other suggestion that Mojica also had a motive to lie to officers in light of his\narrest itself.10 We cannot see why a secondary attack on Mojica’s credibility would\nrender the prior consistent statements unnecessary to rebut defense counsel’s primary\nattack. Indeed, “a prior consistent statement is admissible as long as the statement is\nmade before the existence of any one of the motives that the opposing party expressly or\nimpliedly suggests may have influenced the witness’s testimony.” (People v. Noguera\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">599C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., 629 (Noguera), italics added.) The prosecutor could have\nreasonably concluded defense counsel’s primary attack based on the plea deal was a\nserious threat to Mojica’s credibility and it was well within the trial court’s discretion to\nallow the prosecutor to introduce the interview excerpts to rebut that attack.\n       Appellant next cites Noguera to argue that so many details in Mojica’s interview\ndiffered from his trial testimony that the interview had no “corroborative and\nrehabilitative potential.” Noguera, however, did not address the degree to which the\ndetails of the prior and current statements must be consistent in order for the prior\nstatement to be admissible; the court simply found the recording and transcript of a\nwitness’s prior interview corroborated the “origin and details” of a conspiracy to commit\nmurder and “tended to reinforce in the jurors’ minds the impression that [the witness] was\ntruthful.” (Noguera, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 628.) Here, Mojica’s interview corroborated\nhis trial testimony on the key issue in the case: appellant shot Dunn. Beyond that, it was\nhardly unusual that a prior statement by an accomplice-turned-prosecution-witness\n\n\n\n10     We assume, without deciding, defense counsel’s cross-examination in fact implied\nMojica had a motive to lie based on his arrest itself, although the portions of the record\nappellant cites are far from clear on the point.\n\n\n                                              17\n\fcontained both consistencies and inconsistencies, and the degree to which those points\nundermined or rehabilitated his credibility was a matter properly left to the jury.\n       Appellant argues the admission of Mojica’s prior inconsistent statements was\nunnecessary because Mojica acknowledged at trial that his previous account of the\nshooting differed from his current account. While conceding Mojica’s interview was\nindeed cumulative of his trial testimony, the Attorney General argues playing the\ninterview was nevertheless necessary for several reasons: it provided “context” for\nMojica’s earlier story; it would have been difficult to edit the transcript and recording to\neliminate all the inconsistent statements but preserve the consistent statements; and the\njury was entitled to hear Mojica’s own voice giving the false account during his interview\nto weigh his credibility.\n       We need not decide whether these reasons justified introducing Mojica’s prior\ninconsistent statements because we can identify no conceivable prejudice from their\nadmission under either Chapman v. California (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (Chapman)\n(harmless beyond a reasonable doubt) or People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836\n(Watson) (reasonable probability of a more favorable outcome). As appellant\nacknowledges, the inconsistencies were already presented to the jury through Mojica’s\ntrial testimony, none of which involved material points, as appellant himself\nacknowledges. Perhaps more to the point, Mojica’s prior inconsistent statements\nundermined his credibility, so having them repeated for the jury by way of his interview\nserved only to benefit appellant. Thus, the outcome would not have differed had the trial\ncourt excluded the interview.\n       Finally, appellant contends the interview should have been excluded because it\nlikely confused the jury when it applied CALCRIM No. 318, which instructed the jury as\nfollows: “You have heard evidence of statements that a witness made before the trial. If\nyou decide that the witness made those statements, you may use those statements in two\nways: one, to evaluate whether the witness’ testimony in court is believable; and two, as\nevidence that the information in those earlier statements is true.” Appellant has not\nchallenged the substance of this instruction, and we find no possibility the jury was\n\n\n                                             18\n\fconfused in using it to evaluate Mojica’s interview. There was nothing particularly\ncomplicated about the consistencies and inconsistencies between Mojica’s trial testimony\nand his statements during the interview, or the testimony from any other witness, and\nnothing in the record suggests the jury had any trouble evaluating Mojica’s credibility\nand the truthfulness of his prior statements. As appellant aptly notes, “it is hardly\nuncommon for evidence of this nature to present jurors with complex credibility\nchoices,” especially in gang cases in which witnesses might fear for their safety. There is\nno basis to suspect the jury was confused by the trial court’s admission of Mojica’s\ninterview.\n2. Count Two: Attempted Voluntary Manslaughter Instruction\n       Appellant contends the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional\nrights by refusing to give an attempted voluntary manslaughter instruction for count two.\nWe disagree.\n       For count two, defense counsel requested CALCRIM No. 604, which would have\ninstructed the jury on attempted voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense,\na lesser included offense of attempted murder. He argued appellant testified he had\n“panicked” due to the prior attacks on him and had “react[ed] to an environment where\nhe thought he was in danger.” According to defense counsel, “the testimony shows that\nhe had been severely beaten in the past; that he had been subject to a variety of attacks;\nand that the environment in the county jail was one where both guards and inmates . . .\nwere setting people up. That in the week just prior to this, there had been gang or racial\nviolence. [I]t would suffice to create the environment in which voluntary manslaughter\ninstruction would be allowed.”\n       The prosecutor responded the evidence did not support the instruction because\nappellant “walked in, lights were out, and that there is no sudden quarrel. There is no\ndefending himself. It’s just him walking in -- as per him, he panicked and started\nstabbing Dominic Walker.”\n       The court refused to give the instruction, reasoning that it “requires evidence that\nthe defendant believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great\n\n\n                                             19\n\fbodily injury. And there is nothing to support that element of it. He said he was afraid,\nbut we don’t know what he was afraid of, or what he thought was going to happen to him.\nBecause he didn’t say that. He was very vague on that part.” The court noted appellant\nused the word “panicked,” but “that’s totally different from believing he’s in imminent\ndanger of death or great bodily injury.”\n       “‘“The trial court is obligated to instruct the jury on all general principles of law\nrelevant to the issues raised by the evidence, whether or not the defendant makes a formal\nrequest.”’ [Citation.] ‘Conversely, even on request, the court “has no duty to instruct on\nany lesser offense unless there is substantial evidence to support such instruction.”’\n[Citation.] This substantial evidence requirement is not satisfied by ‘“any evidence . . .\nno matter how weak,”’ but rather by evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable\npersons could conclude ‘that the lesser offense, but not the greater, was committed.’\n[Citation.] ‘On appeal, we review independently the question whether the trial court\nfailed to instruct on a lesser included offense.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Avila (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">680C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., 704-705.)\n       A jury may convict a defendant of voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect\nself-defense “‘“when the trier of fact finds that a defendant killed another person because\nthe defendant actually, but unreasonably, believed he was in imminent danger of death or\ngreat bodily injury . . . .” [Citation.]’” (People v. Manriquez (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">547C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.,\n581 (Manriquez).) This theory “‘requires without exception that the defendant must have\nhad an actual belief in the need for self-defense’” and “‘[f]ear of future harm -- no matter\nhow great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm -- will not suffice.\nThe defendant’s fear must be of imminent danger to life or great bodily injury. “‘[T]he\nperil must appear to the defendant as immediate and present and not prospective or even\nin the near future. An imminent peril is one that, from appearances, must be instantly\ndealt with.’”’” (Ibid.)\n       Although appellant testified that prior attacks and incidents made him paranoid\nand he “panicked” when he saw Walker in the shower, appellant offered no evidence he\nactually feared an imminent attack from Walker when he and Rivera entered the shower.\n\n\n                                              20\n\f(Manriquez, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 582.) Walker was alone in the shower and apparently\nunarmed, and there was no evidence Walker did anything to suggest he was about to\nattack appellant. To the contrary, uncontroverted facts demonstrated a brutal,\ncoordinated attack by appellant and Rivera, with assistance from Mejia locking inmate\nHarbin in the 2400 tier module, followed by appellant’s attempt to dispose of the\nweapons, all against a backdrop of racial tensions between Southsider gang members and\nAfrican-American inmates. Even if appellant had actually believed he might be attacked\nat some point in the future, nothing in this record suggests he was faced with an\n“‘“‘imminent peril . . . that, from appearances, must be instantly dealt with.’”’” (Id. at p.\n581.) The trial court did not err in refusing to give the attempted voluntary manslaughter\ninstruction.\n3. Count Two: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n        Appellant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking him on cross-\nexamination whether he was aware of a “kite,” or note, passed between inmates that gave\na “green light” on Walker.11 Appellant has forfeited the argument, and even if not, we\nreject it.\n        During cross-examination, the prosecutor and appellant had the following\nexchange:\n        “Q     Were you aware that there was a kite that was passed between Southsider\ninmates that gave a green light on Scrilla [i.e., Walker]?\n        “A     I wasn’t aware of that.\n        “Q     Is that news to you?\n        “A     That’s news.\n        “Q     Isn’t it true that you as a Southsider knew that there was a green light on\nDominique [sic] Walker?”\n\n11     The prosecution’s gang expert witness explained to the jury a “green light” means\n“someone is marked for death” and that “[t]here will be messages sent within the jail,\ntypically, that someone is no good. There is a green light on someone, and that it’s okay\nfor that person to be hit wherever that person is at.”\n\n\n                                             21\n\f       At that point defense counsel objected and asked to approach the bench. At\nsidebar, he argued appellant already answered he was not aware of the kite and argued\nthis line of questioning was irrelevant. The prosecutor responded he had “a right to ask\nhim . . . what he knows. He says it was just a shock that this guy was in the shower, and\nhe just overreacted, when there is evidence to the contrary.” The court asked the\nprosecutor how far he would delve into the topic, and the prosecutor said, “He’s denying\nit. So that’s all I’m doing. I’m questioning him and moving on.” The court said,\n“Okay,” and defense counsel said, “Okay. Well, whatever.”\n       Back on the record, the prosecutor resumed the questioning briefly:\n       “Q      Let me ask you, Mr. Guerrero, you were aware that there was a green light\non Scrilla; isn’t that true?\n       “A      I wasn’t.\n       “Q      I’m sorry?\n       “A      I wasn’t.\n       “Q      As a Southsider, you have no idea that that was -- that was set; right? Is\nthat what you’re saying?\n       “A      That’s exactly what I’m saying.”\n       A prosecutor commits misconduct in violation of the federal Constitution when he\nor she engages in conduct so egregious that it infects the trial with such unfairness as to\nmake the conviction a denial of due process. (People v. Fuiava (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">622C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., 679 (Fuiava).) Under state law, a prosecutor commits misconduct if he or she\nuses deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the\njury. (Ibid.) Because the single instance of prosecutorial misconduct alleged in this case\nwas not so egregious it violated due process, we must determine if it was reasonably\nprobable a result more favorable to the defendant would have resulted absent the\nmisconduct. (People v. Bordelon (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1311C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., 1323-1324, citing\nWatson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)\n       “A defendant generally ‘“‘may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial\nmisconduct unless in a timely fashion -- and on the same ground -- the defendant made an\n\n\n                                             22\n\fassignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to disregard the\nimpropriety. [Citation.]’” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Fuiava, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 679.)\nThe failure to timely object may be excused if objecting would have been futile or a jury\nadmonition would not have cured the harm caused by the misconduct. (Ibid.)\n       Appellant has forfeited his misconduct challenge by not objecting to the\nprosecutor’s line of questioning on the basis of misconduct, or at the very least, on the\nbasis that the prosecutor did not have the evidence to support his questions. (See People\nv. Young (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581568\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581568/people-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1186 (Young) [finding no forfeiture of misconduct\nclaim based on prosecutor’s questions when defendant objected that the questions were\nirrelevant in the absence of evidence to substantiate them].) Contrary to appellant’s\nsuggestion, defense counsel’s relevance objection did not alert the trial court to this\nspecific issue; defense counsel merely complained appellant had already answered the\nquestions by denying any knowledge of a “kite” putting a “green light” on Walker.\n       We also disagree with appellant that the trial court prevented defense counsel from\nfully articulating his objection when the discussion of the issue concluded on defense\ncounsel’s comment, “Okay. Well, whatever.” Defense counsel had ample opportunity to\nobject that the prosecutor lacked a good faith basis for his line of questioning, and had he\ndone so, we have little doubt the trial court could have addressed the issue and properly\nadmonished the jury.\n       In any case, appellant’s claim fails on the merits. He is correct that “a prosecutor\nmay not ‘“ask questions of a witness that suggest facts harmful to a defendant, absent a\ngood faith belief that such facts exist.”’” (Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1186.) As noted\nabove, the prosecutor argued appellant “says it was just a shock that this guy was in the\nshower, and he just overreacted, when there is evidence to the contrary.” (Italics added.)\nAlthough that ambiguous statement alone did not necessarily mean the prosecutor had\nspecific evidence a “kite” existed that put a “green light” on Walker, appellant never\nrequested further elaboration or an offer of proof. Not having done so, he cannot now\ncomplain the statement was too vague to demonstrate the prosecutor’s good faith belief.\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\f       Appellant relies on People v. Wagner (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">612C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. and People v.\nEvans (1952) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., but both cases are inapposite. “In Wagner, the\nprosecutor failed to make an offer of proof or to introduce any evidence to substantiate\nthe implications from his questions that the defendant, who was charged with selling\nmarijuana, had been involved in extensive drug sales. (Wagner, at pp. 616-619.) In\nEvans, the prosecutor, without any evidentiary support, improperly asked the defendant a\nseries of questions insinuating the defendant accosted and molested a girl in a park.\n(Evans, at pp. 247-249.)” (Young, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 1186.) Here, by contrast, the\nprosecutor indicated he had evidence to substantiate his questioning, and without a\nrequest by defense counsel to elaborate, that was enough to provide a good faith basis for\nthe questions.\n       Even if the prosecutor’s questioning had amounted to misconduct, appellant\ncannot show prejudice under either the Chapman or Watson standards. The exchange\nwas only a small part of the trial proceedings (less than one page of the lengthy trial\ntranscript) and did not imply appellant had originated the “kite” that put a “green light”\non Walker, but only that appellant might have known one existed. And the existence of a\n“kite” would have been at best cumulative of the significant evidence that the attack on\nWalker was coordinated and planned. Under these circumstances, appellant would not\nhave obtained a more favorable outcome absent the alleged misconduct.\n4. Count Two: Great Bodily Injury Enhancement\n       Appellant contends his state and federal constitutional rights were violated\nbecause insufficient evidence supported the jury’s finding that he inflicted great bodily\ninjury on Walker as required for the enhancement under section 12022.7, subdivision (a).\nWe disagree.\n       Section 12022.7, subdivision (a) states, “Any person who personally inflicts great\nbodily injury on any person other than an accomplice in the commission of a felony or\nattempted felony shall be punished by an additional and consecutive term of\nimprisonment in the state prison for three years.” “Great bodily injury” is defined as “a\nsignificant or substantial physical injury” (§ 12022.7, subd. (f)), which requires\n\n\n                                             24\n\f“substantial injury beyond that inherent in the offense,” but not “‘permanent,’\n‘prolonged’ or ‘protracted’ disfigurement, impairment, or loss of bodily function”\n(People v. Escobar (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1179773\"><a href=\"/opinion/1179773/people-v-escobar/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746, 750 (Escobar); see People v. Cross (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640323\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640323/people-v-cross/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64). “Proof that a victim’s bodily injury is ‘great’ -- that is, significant or\nsubstantial within the meaning of section 12022.7 -- is commonly established by\nevidence of the severity of the victim’s physical injury, the resulting pain, or the medical\ncare required to treat or repair the injury.” (Cross, supra, at p. 66.) This is an issue of\nfact that we review for substantial evidence, and we must accept the jury’s determination\neven if the circumstances might reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding.\n(Escobar, supra, at p. 750; People v. Le (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">54C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., 59 (Le).)\n       The evidence readily supported the jury’s finding Walker suffered great bodily\ninjury under section 12022.7. He had been stabbed multiple times with prison-made\nshanks, one at least five inches long, and he appeared to be in excruciating pain and had\nblood on different parts of his body immediately after the attack. Upon examination,\ndeputies observed he had suffered six or seven wounds to his back, three to five wounds\nto his chest, and two wounds to his arms and shoulders. He had difficulty breathing and\nhis eyes were glazed. He had to be taken to the hospital and treated.\n       Walker’s injuries fell well within the universe of similar injuries courts have found\nconstituted great bodily injury.

Nor are we persuaded by his reliance on People v. Martinez (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">727C.M</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">., the only case he cites finding evidence insufficient to demonstrate great bodily\ninjury. It involved only a minor laceration inflicted on the victim through two shirts and\na heavy coat, and it did not require the victim to be taken to the hospital. (Id. at p. 735.)\nThe prosecutor had even agreed the injury did not satisfy section 12022.7 and asked the\nallegation be stricken. (Martinez, at pp. 735-736.) Here, in sharp contrast, Walker was\nstabbed multiple times, appeared to be in excruciating pain, and had to be taken to the\nhospital.12 Sufficient evidence supported the jury’s finding that the great bodily injury\nrequirement of section 12022.7, subdivision (a) had been met.\n5. Incorrect Court Operations Fee\n       The oral pronouncement of judgment, the sentencing minutes, and the abstract of\njudgment reflect the trial court imposed a $200 court operations fee on each count, for a\ntotal fee of $400, pursuant to section 1465.8, subdivision (a)(1). Appellant contends this\nwas error and the maximum statutory fee was $40 per count, for a total of $80. The\nAttorney General agrees, as do we. (§ 1465.8, subd. (a)(1) [“To assist in funding court\noperations, an assessment of forty dollars ($40) shall be imposed on every conviction for\na criminal offense,” with certain exceptions not pertinent here]; People v. Sencion (2012)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

But the case did not involve\nsection 12022.7; it involved assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury under\nsection 245, subdivision (a), which does not require any injury at all. (Covino, at p. 667.)\nIn any case, Walker’s injuries easily surpassed those inflicted on the victim in Covino.\n\n\n                                              26\n\fcount].) Therefore, we will modify the judgment to reflect the proper court operations\nfee of $80.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is modified to impose the correct court operations fee of $80.\n(§ 1465.8, subd.
