(Kelley), appeals, and The Cote Corporation\n\n(Cote) cross-appeals, from an amended summary judgment entered by the Superior\n\nCourt (Kennebec County, Murphy, J.) awarding Cote a money judgment of\n\n$29,990, plus interest and attorney fees, in satisfaction of a mechanic’s lien that the\n\ncourt found Cote held on Kelley’s real property. Kelley contends that the court\n\nerred in (1) granting summary judgment to Cote after Kelley did not respond to\n\neither Cote’s complaint or its motion for summary judgment; (2) awarding interest\n\nand attorney fees as part of the judgment; and (3) denying in part Kelley’s motion\n\nfor relief pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 60(b), filed after the court entered a final\n\njudgment in favor of Cote. Cote, citing 10 M.R.S. § 3265 (2013), contends that the\n\ncourt erred in amending its original judgment by striking a provision ordering the\n\nsale of Kelley’s real property to satisfy the mechanic’s lien and instead awarding a\n\f2\n\nmoney judgment. Because we agree that the court erred in striking the provision of\n\nits order requiring a sale of the property, we vacate the judgment and remand for\n\nentry of an order for the sale of at least a portion of Kelley’s land.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n        [¶2] In June 2012, Cote filed a mechanic’s lien in the Kennebec County\n\nRegistry of Deeds against real property owned by Kelley. On August 9, Cote\n\nbrought a complaint to enforce the lien against defendants Kelley and RC & Sons\n\nPaving, Inc. (RC), and party-in-interest Rent-It, Inc. Only Kelley is a party to this\n\nappeal. 1    Kelley’s clerk/registered agent was served with the complaint on\n\nAugust 30. The complaint alleged that Kelley leased land to RC, and that pursuant\n\nto a contract with RC, and with Kelley’s consent, Cote constructed an asphalt plant\n\non Kelley’s land. It further alleged that Cote worked on the project through\n\nApril 2012 but was not paid in full.\n\n        [¶3] Kelley did not respond to the complaint, and on November 9 the court\n\nentered its default. In January 2013, Cote moved for summary judgment and\n\nrequested an order that Kelley’s property be sold to satisfy the lien. Kelley did not\n\nrespond to the motion, which the court granted on April 4. It entered judgment for\n\nCote in the amount of $29,990, plus interest and attorney fees, and ordered that the\n\n\n    1\n    RC defaulted and the court entered judgment against it. It has not appealed. Rent-It, Inc., filed a\nmechanic’s lien against Kelley but failed to perfect it; the court found its lien to be “void and invalid.”\n\f                                                                                    3\n\nproperty be sold to satisfy the judgment if it was not redeemed by Kelley within\n\nninety days.\n\n      [¶4] On April 19, ten days after the judgment was entered on the docket,\n\nKelley appeared for the first time and filed motions to set aside its default pursuant\n\nto M.R. Civ. P. 55(c) and for relief from the judgment pursuant to M.R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b). Following a hearing, the court declined to set aside the default. It\n\ndid, however, grant Kelley relief by treating its Rule 60(b) motion as a motion to\n\nalter or amend the judgment pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 59(e), and striking its order\n\nto sell what Kelley represented was a property worth more than $1 million and\n\nawarding Cote a money judgment in its place.\n\n      [¶5] Kelley’s appeal and Cote’s cross-appeal followed.\n\n                                 II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    The Summary Judgment Granted to Cote\n\n      [¶6] The statute governing the creation of a mechanic’s lien provides, in\n\nthe part relevant here, that\n\n      [w]hoever performs labor or furnishes labor or materials . . . used in\n      erecting, altering, moving or repairing a . . . building or appurtenances\n      . . . by consent of the owner, has a lien thereon and on the land on\n      which it stands and on any interest such owner has in the same, to\n      secure payment thereof, with costs. If the owner of the building has\n      no legal interest in the land on which the building is erected . . . the\n      lien attaches to the building, and . . . may be enforced as provided.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3251 (2013).\n\f4\n\n      [¶7] Kelley contends that the court erred in finding that on the summary\n\njudgment record there was no genuine issue of fact concerning three of\n\nsection 3251’s requirements, namely that (1) Cote built the asphalt plant with\n\nKelley’s consent; (2) RC, the owner of the plant, had a legal interest in the Kelley\n\nland on which it was constructed; and (3) concerning the measure of damages, that\n\nKelley’s property was improved by Cote’s work.\n\n      [¶8] We will\n\n      review the grant of a summary judgment de novo, viewing the\n      summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the\n      nonprevailing party to determine whether it demonstrates that there is\n      no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n      judgment as a matter of law. When, as here, the plaintiff has moved\n      for summary judgment, the plaintiff has the burden to demonstrate\n      that each element of its claim is established without dispute as to\n      material fact within the summary judgment record.\n\nCach, LLC v. Kulas, 2011 ME 70 ¶ 8, 21 A.3d 1015 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nEven when the nonmoving party’s response is inadequate, or, as here, nonexistent,\n\nthe moving party has the burden to show why summary judgment is appropriate:\n\n      A moving party’s factual assertions may not be deemed admitted\n      because of an improper response unless those factual assertions are\n      properly supported. As we have explained, a party who moves for a\n      summary judgment must properly put the motion and, most\n      importantly, the material facts before the court, or the motion will not\n      be granted, regardless of the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the\n      nonmoving party’s response.\n\nId. ¶ 9 (alteration, citation, and quotation marks omitted).\n\f                                                                                     5\n\n       1.        Consent\n\n       [¶9] Cote’s mechanic’s lien stated that the work it performed was done with\n\nKelley’s knowledge and consent. Cote made the same assertion in its statement of\n\nmaterial facts, and supported that statement with the affidavit of its controller,\n\nDaniel Gagne. The affidavit was not challenged, and the statement of material\n\nfacts was uncontroverted and is thus deemed admitted. M.R. Civ. P. 56(h)(4).\n\nAccordingly, in entering a summary judgment for Cote, the court had a sufficient\n\nbasis to find that Kelley consented and therefore “Cote is entitled to Judgment . . .\n\nand is entitled to enforce its lien.” See Platz Assocs. v. Finley, 2009 ME 55, ¶ 24,\n\n973 A.2d 743 (“[Defendant’s] failure to respond to [plaintiff’s] request for\n\nadmission establishes as fact that [defendant] knew about and consented to the\n\nwork. . . .”).\n\n       2.        RC’s Legal Interest in Kelley’s Land\n\n       [¶10]       Kelley argues that the summary judgment record contained\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that RC had a “legal interest in the land on which\n\nthe building is erected,” 10 M.R.S. § 3251, a showing necessary to allow Cote’s\n\nmechanic’s lien to attach to the land and not just the asphalt plant itself. Kelley did\n\nnot raise that argument in its Rule 60(b) motion in the trial court. Accordingly, it\n\nhas waived the issue on appeal. See Thayer Corp. v. Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. 61,\n\n2012 ME 37, ¶ 4 n.4, 38 A.3d 1263.\n\f6\n\n      [¶11]    Even if it were not waived, the argument fails because Cote’s\n\nuncontroverted statement of material facts, supported by the unchallenged Gagne\n\naffidavit, states that the site of the plant was “owned by Defendant Kelley . . . and\n\nleased by RC.” Beyond the four corners of the summary judgment record, an\n\naffidavit executed by Peter Kelley, an officer of Kelley Earthworks, Inc., filed in\n\nsupport of Kelley’s Rule 60(b) motion, states that “Kelley, Inc. entered into a lease\n\nwith RC” and “[t]he lessee was to pay to Kelley Inc. rent of at least $80,000 per\n\nyear.” Furthermore, the Rule 60(b) motion itself refers to “claimed acts of [Cote]\n\non behalf of Kelley’s lessee.” RC’s leasehold interest is a sufficient “legal interest\n\nin the land” to support the court’s judgment. 10 M.R.S. § 3251; see Benham v.\n\nMorton & Furbish Agency, 2007 ME 83, ¶ 17, 929 A.2d 471 (“It is clear that a\n\nlease conveys a possessory interest in the land to another for a period of time.”\n\n(quotation marks omitted)); Stewart v. Aldrich, 2002 ME 16, ¶ 14, 788 A.2d 603\n\n(“A bedrock principle of our jurisprudence has been that a lease . . . is equivalent to\n\na conveyance for almost all purposes . . . .”); Fischbach & Moore, Inc. v. Presteel\n\nCorp., 398 A.2d 397 (Me. 1979) (affirming a mechanic’s lien filed against a\n\nbuilding owner when the leaseholder arranged for work to be done with the\n\nowner’s consent).\n\f                                                                                                    7\n\n         3.    Calculation of Damages\n\n         [¶12] The uncontroverted statement of material facts states that Cote was\n\nowed $29,990 plus interest, costs, and attorney fees. The Gagne affidavit reflects\n\nthat amount, and it includes as an exhibit copies of invoices from Cote to RC. The\n\ncourt, without comment, awarded Cote the amount that it requested in its entry of\n\nsummary judgment and again in granting Kelley Rule 59(e) relief.2\n\n         [¶13] A bill for the cost of improvements is evidence, albeit not dispositive\n\nevidence, of enhanced value to the property owner. A.F.A.B., Inc. v. Town of Old\n\nOrchard Beach, 657 A.2d 323, 325 (Me. 1995). Here, by failing to oppose Cote’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, Kelley ensured that the invoices were the only\n\nevidence of damages. “Although an award must be supported by some evidence of\n\nthe amount of loss, damages need not be proved to a mathematical certainty.”\n\nGraham v. Brown, 2011 ME 93, ¶ 12, 26 A.3d 823 (quotation marks omitted). The\n\ncourt did not err in relying on the only competent evidence of Cote’s damages that\n\nwas before it.\n\nB.       Denial of Rule 60(b) Relief\n\n         [¶14] Kelley contends that the court erred in denying it relief from summary\n\njudgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)3 because Cote committed a fraud against the court\n\n     2\n      We have considered Kelley’s argument that the court erred in awarding Cote interest and attorney\nfees as part of its judgment, find it to be unpersuasive, and do not discuss it further.\n\f8\n\nin several representations it made in its statement of material facts and in\n\nsupporting documents. We review the denial of Rule 60(b) relief for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion that “works a plain and unmistakable injustice against the defendant.”\n\nIn re David H., 2009 ME 131, ¶ 41, 985 A.2d 490 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n          [¶15] As an initial matter, the trial court did not find sufficient proof to\n\nconclude that Cote had worked a fraud against it, nor do we. In all of Kelley’s\n\npleadings, it does not dispute that Cote built an asphalt plant on land owned by\n\nKelley.        Furthermore, Kelley cannot meet its burden on this issue because\n\n“Rule 60(b) presupposes that a party has performed [its] duty to take legal steps to\n\nprotect [its] own interests in the original litigation.” Id. (quotation marks omitted);\n\nsee also McKeen & Assocs. v. Dep’t of Transp., 1997 ME 73, ¶ 4, 692 A.2d 924\n\n(same). By defaulting on Cote’s complaint and then taking no steps to oppose\n\nsummary judgment until ten days after a final judgment was entered, Kelley failed\n\nto protect its own interests. It was not a “plain and unmistakable injustice” for the\n\n\n    3\n        Maine Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) provides, in part:\n\n          On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or the party’s\n          legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\n          (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence\n          which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial\n          under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic),\n          misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;\n          (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon\n          which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that\n          the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief\n          from the operation of the judgment.\n\f                                                                                                     9\n\ntrial court to hold Kelley to the consequences of that failure. In re David H.,\n\n2009 ME 131, ¶ 41, 985 A.2d 490 (quotation marks omitted).\n\nC.         Cote’s Cross-Appeal\n\n           [¶16]     In its cross-appeal, Cote contends that the court was statutorily\n\nrequired to order a sale of Kelley’s real property upon finding that Cote was\n\nentitled to enforce its mechanic’s lien, and that it did not have the authority to\n\namend the remedy to a money judgment. In striking its original order that the\n\nproperty be sold, the court found that (1) Kelley’s equity argument, namely that its\n\nreal property was worth more than $1 million, was insufficient to warrant setting\n\naside Cote’s lien altogether pursuant to Rule 60(b); but (2) that information did,\n\npursuant to Rule 59(e),4 warrant relief from a forced sale of the property. We\n\nreview the amended judgment for “a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.”\n\nRinguette v. Ringuette, 594 A.2d 1076, 1078 (Me. 1991) (quotation marks\n\nomitted).5 A court abuses its discretion if it enters a judgment contrary to a\n\ncontrolling statute. See Scott v. St. Pierre, 137 Me. 331, 331, 16 A.2d 473 (1940)\n\n\n\n\n     4\n         Maine Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) concerns motions to alter or amend a judgment.\n     5\n      Ringuette v. Ringuette, 594 A.2d 1076 (Me. 1991), cited by the trial court as authority for its\namended judgment, is distinguishable from facts presented here. In Ringuette, a divorce case, the court\nreopened the evidence and subsequently amended its divorce judgment. 594 A.2d at 1076-77. We\naffirmed, recognizing the divorce court’s “wide discretion in determining a just division of marital\nproperty.” Id. at 1078. Here, the issue is the remedy required by the mechanic’s lien statutes, not the\nbroad discretion of a divorce court.\n\f10\n\n(“When . . . the case is barren of proof of the statutory requirements . . . the ruling\n\nbelow is one contrary to law and is an abuse of discretion.”).\n\n      [¶17]   We conclude that the mechanic’s lien statutes require a sale of\n\nKelley’s property in order to satisfy Cote’s lien, but they do not necessarily require\n\na sale of the entire parcel. In its original judgment, the court ordered a sale\n\npursuant to 10 M.R.S. § 3259 (2013). That section provides, in part:\n\n      If it is determined that the parties or any of them . . . have a lien upon\n      said building and land . . . the court may decree that said property . . .\n      shall be sold, and shall prescribe the place, time, terms, manner and\n      conditions of such sale. . . . If justice requires, the court may provide\n      in the order of sale that the owner shall have a right to redeem the\n      property from such sale within a time fixed in the order of sale. If the\n      court shall determine that the whole of the land on which the lien\n      exists is not necessary therefor, it shall describe in the order of sale a\n      suitable lot therefor; and only so much shall be sold.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3259. After the sale of the entire property or “a suitable lot,” id., the\n\nstatutory scheme then allows a money judgment to satisfy any remaining\n\ndeficiency:\n\n      If the proceeds of the sale after payment of costs and expenses of sale\n      are insufficient to pay the lien claims and costs in full, the court may\n      render judgment against the debtor in favor of each individual lienor\n      for the balance of his claim and costs remaining unpaid, and may\n      issue executions therefor.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3260 (2013).\n\n      [¶18] The plain language of the statutory scheme formed by sections 3259\n\nand 3260 does not contemplate a money judgment as an alternative to the sale of\n\f                                                                                 11\n\nproperty subject to a lien; rather, a money judgment is authorized only when\n\nproceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the lien. See Hickson v. Vescom\n\nCorp., 2014 ME 27, ¶ 15, 87 A.3d 704 (stating that the Law Court “examine[s] the\n\nplain meaning of the statutory language seeking to give effect to the legislative\n\nintent” (quotation marks omitted)). This construction is supported by 10 M.R.S.\n\n§ 3265, which is the statutory provision cited by Cote on its cross-appeal. That\n\nsection provides that\n\n        [w]hen a judgment is rendered in any action authorized by chapters\n        601 to 6316 against any . . . building or appurtenances, . . . and the\n        land on which it stands . . . said property shall be taken and sold on\n        execution in the same manner that rights of redeeming mortgaged real\n        estate may be taken and sold.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3265 (2013).\n\n        [¶19] Sections 3259 and 3265 both require a sale of property that is subject\n\nto a lien. See Hickson, 2014 ME 27, ¶ 15, 87 A.3d 704 (stating that the Law Court\n\n“construe[s] the whole statutory scheme of which the section at issue forms a part\n\nso that a harmonious result, presumably the intent of the Legislature, may be\n\nachieved” (quotation marks omitted)).      Accordingly, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in setting aside the remedy of a sale altogether and substituting a money\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n  6\n      10 M.R.S. §§ 3201-4012 (2013).\n\f12\n\n        [¶20] The court was, however, authorized to include in its judgment a right\n\nof redemption, as it did. Furthermore, going forward, it is authorized to partition\n\noff a “suitable lot” in lieu of ordering a sale of the entire property if it deems that\n\ncourse of action to be appropriate. In Twin Island Dev. Corp. v. Ross, we modified\n\nand then affirmed a judgment entered by the Superior Court finding that a\n\nmechanic’s lien existed and ordering the debtor to segregate and sell a fifty-acre\n\nparcel of the property subject to the lien. 522 A.2d 901, 901-03 (Me. 1987). At\n\nthe Superior Court’s discretion, a similar remedy could be employed in this case to\n\nbalance the requirements of the mechanic’s lien statutes with the equities that the\n\ncourt found to exist.\n\n        The entry is:\n\n                           Judgment vacated. Remanded for entry of a\n                           judgment in favor of The Cote Corporation\n                           consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\nOn the briefs and at oral argument:\n\n       C.H.

(Kelley), appeals, and The Cote Corporation\n\n(Cote) cross-appeals, from an amended summary judgment entered by the Superior\n\nCourt (Kennebec County, Murphy, J.) awarding Cote a money judgment of\n\n$29,990, plus interest and attorney fees, in satisfaction of a mechanic’s lien that the\n\ncourt found Cote held on Kelley’s real property. Kelley contends that the court\n\nerred in (1) granting summary judgment to Cote after Kelley did not respond to\n\neither Cote’s complaint or its motion for summary judgment; (2) awarding interest\n\nand attorney fees as part of the judgment; and (3) denying in part Kelley’s motion\n\nfor relief pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 60(b), filed after the court entered a final\n\njudgment in favor of Cote. Cote, citing 10 M.R.S. § 3265 (2013), contends that the\n\ncourt erred in amending its original judgment by striking a provision ordering the\n\nsale of Kelley’s real property to satisfy the mechanic’s lien and instead awarding a\n\f2\n\nmoney judgment. Because we agree that the court erred in striking the provision of\n\nits order requiring a sale of the property, we vacate the judgment and remand for\n\nentry of an order for the sale of at least a portion of Kelley’s land.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n        [¶2] In June 2012, Cote filed a mechanic’s lien in the Kennebec County\n\nRegistry of Deeds against real property owned by Kelley. On August 9, Cote\n\nbrought a complaint to enforce the lien against defendants Kelley and RC & Sons\n\nPaving, Inc. (RC), and party-in-interest Rent-It, Inc. Only Kelley is a party to this\n\nappeal. 1    Kelley’s clerk/registered agent was served with the complaint on\n\nAugust 30. The complaint alleged that Kelley leased land to RC, and that pursuant\n\nto a contract with RC, and with Kelley’s consent, Cote constructed an asphalt plant\n\non Kelley’s land. It further alleged that Cote worked on the project through\n\nApril 2012 but was not paid in full.\n\n        [¶3] Kelley did not respond to the complaint, and on November 9 the court\n\nentered its default. In January 2013, Cote moved for summary judgment and\n\nrequested an order that Kelley’s property be sold to satisfy the lien. Kelley did not\n\nrespond to the motion, which the court granted on April 4. It entered judgment for\n\nCote in the amount of $29,990, plus interest and attorney fees, and ordered that the\n\n\n    1\n    RC defaulted and the court entered judgment against it. It has not appealed. Rent-It, Inc., filed a\nmechanic’s lien against Kelley but failed to perfect it; the court found its lien to be “void and invalid.”\n\f                                                                                    3\n\nproperty be sold to satisfy the judgment if it was not redeemed by Kelley within\n\nninety days.\n\n      [¶4] On April 19, ten days after the judgment was entered on the docket,\n\nKelley appeared for the first time and filed motions to set aside its default pursuant\n\nto M.R. Civ. P. 55(c) and for relief from the judgment pursuant to M.R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b). Following a hearing, the court declined to set aside the default. It\n\ndid, however, grant Kelley relief by treating its Rule 60(b) motion as a motion to\n\nalter or amend the judgment pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 59(e), and striking its order\n\nto sell what Kelley represented was a property worth more than $1 million and\n\nawarding Cote a money judgment in its place.\n\n      [¶5] Kelley’s appeal and Cote’s cross-appeal followed.\n\n                                 II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    The Summary Judgment Granted to Cote\n\n      [¶6] The statute governing the creation of a mechanic’s lien provides, in\n\nthe part relevant here, that\n\n      [w]hoever performs labor or furnishes labor or materials . . . used in\n      erecting, altering, moving or repairing a . . . building or appurtenances\n      . . . by consent of the owner, has a lien thereon and on the land on\n      which it stands and on any interest such owner has in the same, to\n      secure payment thereof, with costs. If the owner of the building has\n      no legal interest in the land on which the building is erected . . . the\n      lien attaches to the building, and . . . may be enforced as provided.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3251 (2013).\n\f4\n\n      [¶7] Kelley contends that the court erred in finding that on the summary\n\njudgment record there was no genuine issue of fact concerning three of\n\nsection 3251’s requirements, namely that (1) Cote built the asphalt plant with\n\nKelley’s consent; (2) RC, the owner of the plant, had a legal interest in the Kelley\n\nland on which it was constructed; and (3) concerning the measure of damages, that\n\nKelley’s property was improved by Cote’s work.\n\n      [¶8] We will\n\n      review the grant of a summary judgment de novo, viewing the\n      summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the\n      nonprevailing party to determine whether it demonstrates that there is\n      no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n      judgment as a matter of law. When, as here, the plaintiff has moved\n      for summary judgment, the plaintiff has the burden to demonstrate\n      that each element of its claim is established without dispute as to\n      material fact within the summary judgment record.\n\nCach, LLC v. Kulas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2558559\"><a href=\"/opinion/2558559/cach-llc-v-kulas/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> ¶ 8, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2558559\"><a href=\"/opinion/2558559/cach-llc-v-kulas/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quotation marks omitted).\n\nEven when the nonmoving party’s response is inadequate, or, as here, nonexistent,\n\nthe moving party has the burden to show why summary judgment is appropriate:\n\n      A moving party’s factual assertions may not be deemed admitted\n      because of an improper response unless those factual assertions are\n      properly supported. As we have explained, a party who moves for a\n      summary judgment must properly put the motion and, most\n      importantly, the material facts before the court, or the motion will not\n      be granted, regardless of the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the\n      nonmoving party’s response.\n\nId. ¶ 9 (alteration, citation, and quotation marks omitted).\n\f                                                                                     5\n\n       1.        Consent\n\n       [¶9] Cote’s mechanic’s lien stated that the work it performed was done with\n\nKelley’s knowledge and consent. Cote made the same assertion in its statement of\n\nmaterial facts, and supported that statement with the affidavit of its controller,\n\nDaniel Gagne. The affidavit was not challenged, and the statement of material\n\nfacts was uncontroverted and is thus deemed admitted. M.R. Civ. P. 56(h)(4).\n\nAccordingly, in entering a summary judgment for Cote, the court had a sufficient\n\nbasis to find that Kelley consented and therefore “Cote is entitled to Judgment . . .\n\nand is entitled to enforce its lien.” See Platz Assocs. v. Finley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2085191\"><a href=\"/opinion/2085191/platz-associates-v-finley/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 24,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2085191\"><a href=\"/opinion/2085191/platz-associates-v-finley/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“[Defendant’s] failure to respond to [plaintiff’s] request for\n\nadmission establishes as fact that [defendant] knew about and consented to the\n\nwork. . . .”).\n\n       2.        RC’s Legal Interest in Kelley’s Land\n\n       [¶10]       Kelley argues that the summary judgment record contained\n\ninsufficient evidence to establish that RC had a “legal interest in the land on which\n\nthe building is erected,” 10 M.R.S. § 3251, a showing necessary to allow Cote’s\n\nmechanic’s lien to attach to the land and not just the asphalt plant itself. Kelley did\n\nnot raise that argument in its Rule 60(b) motion in the trial court. Accordingly, it\n\nhas waived the issue on appeal. See Thayer Corp. v. Me. Sch. Admin. Dist. 61,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300761\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300761/thayer-corp-v-maine-school-administrative/\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 4 n.4, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300761\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300761/thayer-corp-v-maine-school-administrative/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\f6\n\n      [¶11]    Even if it were not waived, the argument fails because Cote’s\n\nuncontroverted statement of material facts, supported by the unchallenged Gagne\n\naffidavit, states that the site of the plant was “owned by Defendant Kelley . . . and\n\nleased by RC.” Beyond the four corners of the summary judgment record, an\n\naffidavit executed by Peter Kelley, an officer of Kelley Earthworks, Inc., filed in\n\nsupport of Kelley’s Rule 60(b) motion, states that “Kelley, Inc. entered into a lease\n\nwith RC” and “[t]he lessee was to pay to Kelley Inc. rent of at least $80,000 per\n\nyear.” Furthermore, the Rule 60(b) motion itself refers to “claimed acts of [Cote]\n\non behalf of Kelley’s lessee.” RC’s leasehold interest is a sufficient “legal interest\n\nin the land” to support the court’s judgment. 10 M.R.S. § 3251; see Benham v.\n\nMorton & Furbish Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 17, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“It is clear that a\n\nlease conveys a possessory interest in the land to another for a period of time.”\n\n(quotation marks omitted)); Stewart v.

Calculation of Damages\n\n         [¶12] The uncontroverted statement of material facts states that Cote was\n\nowed $29,990 plus interest, costs, and attorney fees. The Gagne affidavit reflects\n\nthat amount, and it includes as an exhibit copies of invoices from Cote to RC. The\n\ncourt, without comment, awarded Cote the amount that it requested in its entry of\n\nsummary judgment and again in granting Kelley Rule 59(e) relief.2\n\n         [¶13] A bill for the cost of improvements is evidence, albeit not dispositive\n\nevidence, of enhanced value to the property owner.

Cote’s Cross-Appeal\n\n           [¶16]     In its cross-appeal, Cote contends that the court was statutorily\n\nrequired to order a sale of Kelley’s real property upon finding that Cote was\n\nentitled to enforce its mechanic’s lien, and that it did not have the authority to\n\namend the remedy to a money judgment. In striking its original order that the\n\nproperty be sold, the court found that (1) Kelley’s equity argument, namely that its\n\nreal property was worth more than $1 million, was insufficient to warrant setting\n\naside Cote’s lien altogether pursuant to Rule 60(b); but (2) that information did,\n\npursuant to Rule 59(e),4 warrant relief from a forced sale of the property.

In Ringuette, a divorce case, the court\nreopened the evidence and subsequently amended its divorce judgment. 594 A.2d at 1076-77. We\naffirmed, recognizing the divorce court’s “wide discretion in determining a just division of marital\nproperty.” Id. at 1078. Here, the issue is the remedy required by the mechanic’s lien statutes, not the\nbroad discretion of a divorce court.\n\f10\n\n(“When . . . the case is barren of proof of the statutory requirements . . . the ruling\n\nbelow is one contrary to law and is an abuse of discretion.”).\n\n      [¶17]   We conclude that the mechanic’s lien statutes require a sale of\n\nKelley’s property in order to satisfy Cote’s lien, but they do not necessarily require\n\na sale of the entire parcel. In its original judgment, the court ordered a sale\n\npursuant to 10 M.R.S. § 3259 (2013). That section provides, in part:\n\n      If it is determined that the parties or any of them . . . have a lien upon\n      said building and land . . . the court may decree that said property . . .\n      shall be sold, and shall prescribe the place, time, terms, manner and\n      conditions of such sale. . . . If justice requires, the court may provide\n      in the order of sale that the owner shall have a right to redeem the\n      property from such sale within a time fixed in the order of sale. If the\n      court shall determine that the whole of the land on which the lien\n      exists is not necessary therefor, it shall describe in the order of sale a\n      suitable lot therefor; and only so much shall be sold.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3259. After the sale of the entire property or “a suitable lot,” id., the\n\nstatutory scheme then allows a money judgment to satisfy any remaining\n\ndeficiency:\n\n      If the proceeds of the sale after payment of costs and expenses of sale\n      are insufficient to pay the lien claims and costs in full, the court may\n      render judgment against the debtor in favor of each individual lienor\n      for the balance of his claim and costs remaining unpaid, and may\n      issue executions therefor.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3260 (2013).\n\n      [¶18] The plain language of the statutory scheme formed by sections 3259\n\nand 3260 does not contemplate a money judgment as an alternative to the sale of\n\f                                                                                 11\n\nproperty subject to a lien; rather, a money judgment is authorized only when\n\nproceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the lien.

That\n\nsection provides that\n\n        [w]hen a judgment is rendered in any action authorized by chapters\n        601 to 6316 against any . . . building or appurtenances, . . . and the\n        land on which it stands . . . said property shall be taken and sold on\n        execution in the same manner that rights of redeeming mortgaged real\n        estate may be taken and sold.\n\n10 M.R.S. § 3265 (2013).\n\n        [¶19] Sections 3259 and 3265 both require a sale of property that is subject\n\nto a lien.

Accordingly, the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in setting aside the remedy of a sale altogether and substituting a money\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n  6\n      10 M.R.S. §§ 3201-4012 (2013).\n\f12\n\n        [¶20] The court was, however, authorized to include in its judgment a right\n\nof redemption, as it did. Furthermore, going forward, it is authorized to partition\n\noff a “suitable lot” in lieu of ordering a sale of the entire property if it deems that\n\ncourse of action to be appropriate. In Twin Island Dev. Corp. v. Ross, we modified\n\nand then affirmed a judgment entered by the Superior Court finding that a\n\nmechanic’s lien existed and ordering the debtor to segregate and sell a fifty-acre\n\nparcel of the property subject to the lien. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 901-03 (Me. 1987). At\n\nthe Superior Court’s discretion, a similar remedy could be employed in this case to\n\nbalance the requirements of the mechanic’s lien statutes with the equities that the\n\ncourt found to exist.\n\n        The entry is:\n\n                           Judgment vacated.
