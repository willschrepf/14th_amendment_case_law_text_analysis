The plaintiffs, Virginia Cole and Frank Cottrell, were school bus drivers for the defendants, Choctaw County Board of Education.  Neither have been re-employed since June 1968.  Both are Negroes.  Mrs. Cole had been driving a school bus in Choctaw County since 1948; Mr. Cottrell, since 1961.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Both plaintiffs contend they were not rehired because of their civil rights activity in Choctaw County, with particular reference to the school boycott in 1967.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Frank Cottrell was not rehired because he had many delinquent debts and his debtors frequently sought assistance from James H. Hutchinson, the supervisor of transportation, in collecting them.  His debts gave rise to an incident on school grounds where he threatened another driver with a shotgun.  While Mr. Cottrell may have been a civil rights activist, the sole reason for his discharge<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was his indebtedness and the problems resulting therefrom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4.

Mr. Hutchinson did not mention reasons (a) and (d) as reasons for discharging Mrs. Cole in his June 1970 deposition.  Mr. Hutchinson prepared a typewritten list of drivers that he recommended the Board hire and Mrs. Cole's name was scratched out with pen and replaced with the name Herbie James, also with pen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The Court finds that Mrs. Cole was discharged because she discussed racial segregation in Choctaw County Schools with the FBI and she had actively supported the 1967 school boycott.  While the reasons in paragraph 4 above may be valid reasons to discharge a driver, these were not the reasons for which Mrs. Cole was discharged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.
