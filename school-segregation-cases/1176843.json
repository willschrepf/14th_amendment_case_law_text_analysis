Prior to the sale,\nAppellants failed to disclose previous flooding in the Ranch’s two houses, the\nreceipt of an insurance settlement for hailstorm damage to metal roofs on the\n\n       1\n        Patsy Birdwell, Gaylon’s wife, was a plaintiff as well, but she passed away approximately six\nmonths before trial.\n\fRanch’s buildings, and the use of the settlement funds for purposes other than to\nreplace the damaged roofs. The jury awarded Birdwell damages under multiple\ntheories of liability. At Birdwell’s election, the trial court entered a judgment in\nhis favor for $306,087.77 against Appellants for negligent misrepresentation. 2\nAppellants assert eleven issues on appeal. We affirm.\n                           I. Background Facts and Trial Evidence\n        The Ranch is a 120-acre estate located in the Texas Hill Country near\nMarble Falls. The Ranch has high perimeter fencing; a 6,000 square foot main\nhouse with a four-car garage; an infinity pool with a hot tub; a six-stall horse stable\nwith a wash and tack area; a walker and separate hay barn; a 17,000 square foot,\nlighted riding arena; and an 1,800 square foot guest or foreman’s house.3 The\nRanch also has numerous trees, several head of exotic game, and two lakes stocked\nwith Florida bass.\n        Appellants engaged Michael King Waite, a real estate broker, as their listing\nagent and listed the Ranch for sale in 2008, after they had lived there for several\nyears, because they wanted to live closer to their Austin businesses. After Waite\nlooked at the Ranch, he suggested that Appellants list the Ranch for $3 million\nbecause he thought its value was in the range of $2.4 million to $2.85 million.\nAppellants decided to list the Ranch for $3.2 million in 2008 but lowered the price\nin April 2009 to $2.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n         The judgment included $264,926 in damages, plus $67,000 in attorneys’ fees, $19,161.77 in\nprejudgment interest, and postjudgment interest of five percent per annum with a settlement credit for\n$45,000. Birdwell settled his claims against codefendant, Derris William Lanier d/b/a Lanier Inspections,\nfor $45,000. Lanier Inspections was the property inspection company that Birdwell had hired to inspect\nthe Ranch prior to the sale.\n        3\n        The Ranch also had a tractor and storage barn and a small one-car garage that was connected by\na breezeway to the guest or foreman’s house.\n\n                                                   2\n\f      Waite had Appellants fill out the Seller’s Disclosure Notice (the Notice),\nsign it, and then return it to him. 4 Both Waite and Appellants acknowledged that\nthe Notice indicated that Appellants agreed to amend any applicable notices and\ndisclosures during the listing. The Notice was the only one that Appellants filled\nout and gave to Waite. Waite testified that Appellants never told him about a\nhailstorm in March 2009 at the Ranch and did not mention any insurance\nsettlements for roof repair or replacement. Waite also said that he was not told of\nprior flooding inside the main house or the attached guest house.\n      Waite said that the Notice was given to Birdwell. After some negotiation,\nBirdwell agreed to pay $2.6 million for the Ranch and deposited $25,000 earnest\nmoney.       Birdwell said that he received Appellants’ Notice and relied on the\nstatements that there had been no prior flooding in the structures, that there had\nbeen no prior insurance settlements, and that there had been no prior damage to the\nroofs on the Ranch’s buildings.                Birdwell had Lanier Inspections inspect the\nproperty. Birdwell said that they negotiated some additional items for purchase\nand some repairs to chimney flashing. Birdwell asked Waite when the flashing\nrepair would be done, and Birdwell agreed to Waite’s suggestion that it could be\ndone after closing. Later, Waite hired Cornerstone Roofing and Remodeling to\nrepair the flashing. Juan Reyes, the owner of Cornerstone Roofing, testified that he\nis a member of the National Roofing Contractors Association, a member of the\nBetter Business Bureau, and a certified GAF master elite contractor. Reyes does\nnew construction roofs and does repair and replacement of roofs, including metal,\nshingle, and tile.\n      Reyes testified that he noticed a problem with the roof and told the Ranch’s\nnew owner, Birdwell, that the roof was “totaled” and needed to be replaced. Reyes\ninspected all of the roofs at the Ranch and said that all of them needed to be\n      4\n          Kim Domel initialed each page of the Notice but did not sign on the signature line.\n\n                                                     3\n\freplaced, which would cost $280,000. Reyes said he was unaware that Appellants\nhad made a hailstorm damage claim for the roofs, but he was not surprised that\nthere had been a hailstorm damage claim and a settlement for roof damage. He\nsaid that the hailstorm was the probable cause of the roof damage. Reyes said\nBirdwell called Waite and told him about the roofs, and Birdwell said Waite was\nsurprised. Waite said that the first time he heard about roof damage from a\nhailstorm was when Reyes and Birdwell called him.\n      Upon being contacted by Waite, Kim Domel did not deny that an insurance\nclaim had been filed, but Gary Domel said that the roofs were not damaged\nseverely enough to need replacement and that Appellants had dropped the price\nsignificantly. Gary Domel testified that the roof of the main house was nine years\nold and that he had tightened some of the loose screws on the roof. He admitted\nthat he had checked “no” on the Notice to indicate that he had not received any\ninsurance settlements for damages to the Ranch.\n      Gary Domel testified that he was not at the Ranch when the hailstorm\noccurred. He said that there was hail damage to the pool deck, siding, and the\nscreen porch and that some windows were broken. He also said that, after the\nhailstorm, he could not tell whether the roof of the main house was damaged but\nthat he saw “nothing” that required repair or replacement and did not make any\nrepairs because “there [were] no leaks.” Gary Domel said the roof “looked better\nthan every other roof [he had] ever seen.” He admitted that he made an insurance\nclaim for hailstorm damage and that he received a check for $114,650.04. The\namount for the replacement cost coverage for the roofs was $139,926.83. Gary\nDomel said that he did not need to spend the $114,650.04 on the roofs because the\nroof of the main house was “sound” and “bulletproof.”\n      Gary Domel also said that the Notice was true on the date of closing in\nNovember 2009 and that he did not think that the insurance settlement was\n                                        4\n\fsomething that had to be disclosed to Birdwell. Gary Domel said that he “didn’t\nthink about it. [He] had no reason to think about it.” He said he checked “no” on\nthe maintenance part of the Notice because he could not think of anything that was\nin need of repair or replacement.                  Gary Domel testified that the insurance\nsettlement for the roofs was for “cosmetic damage” and that he did not use the\nsettlement funds to repair or replace the roofs.\n      Kim Domel testified that she relied on her husband and followed his\ndirections when asked to sign documents; she did not review or read them. She\nsaid that sellers should let buyers know if something, like a dishwasher, does not\nwork, but she did not think that a seller had to disclose an insurance settlement if\neverything had been repaired. Kim Domel said that she was not at the Ranch when\nthe hailstorm occurred and that her employees were wrong when they said that she\nwas; she also denied telling her employees that she had received a $150,000\ninsurance check for roof damage and that she was going to buy a new Mercedes.\n      Ginny Dean Dukes was the ranch hand who took care of horses and game at\nthe Ranch, and he lived in the foreman’s house. 5 Dukes said that he was at the\nRanch when the hailstorm hit in March 2009, that Appellants were also there, and\nthat the storm was severe. According to Dukes, everyone hid in one of the master\nbedroom closets in the main house. He said that he saw the adjusters at the Ranch\nlooking at the hail damage on the roofs, buildings, pool deck, and siding.\n      Mary Jo Callaway was a nanny for Appellants’ children and lived for a time\nat the Ranch. She said that Appellants were there when the hailstorm hit in 2009\nand that everyone hid in the closet.\n      Rita Kay Kirby worked as a housekeeper for Appellants and helped look\nafter Appellants’ children. Dukes, Kirby, and Callaway all testified that Kim\nDomel said that she had received an insurance check for $150,000 and that she was\n      5\n          Dukes previously worked for Appellants, but at the time of trial, he worked for Birdwell.\n\n                                                     5\n\fgoing to buy a new Mercedes. Dukes and Kirby said that Kim Domel had the\ncheck in her hand and made the comments in front of them while everyone was out\non the porch.\n      Gary Domel admitted that he had also made an insurance claim for water\ndamage inside the main house, but on the Notice, he indicated that there had been\nno flooding inside the structures. Gary Domel said that, in 2007 when nineteen\ninches of rain fell in a matter of hours, he had four stock tanks that were breached\nand had to be rebuilt, as did part of the high perimeter fencing. He said that he also\nlost some animals. Gary Domel admitted that there was water penetration at the\nbaseboard level of the wall studs, which happened when eaves or drains clogged\nup with leaves and caused water to come in, but he said that this was from water\n“runoff,” not a flood. Gary Domel said he did not amend the Notice because he did\nnot think of it and no one asked him to amend it. Gary Domel also said that he had\nbeen “insulted” by the $2.4 million offer on a property that had been listed at $3.2\nmillion and that he accepted the lower price only because the sale was “as is” and\nin its “present condition.” He also believed the prior flooding did not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the use of the Ranch.\n      Birdwell testified that, after he talked to Reyes and Waite, he checked with\nhis insurance company and discovered that Appellants had a prior insurance claim\nand settlement on the roofs for hail damage. Birdwell said he learned about prior\nflooding in the main and guest houses from Dukes and Callaway. Dukes said that\nthere was flooding in both the main and guest houses during a rainstorm in 2007;\nhe helped clean it up. Callaway said that, in 2007, there was a flood and that there\nwas about two inches of water on the floor of the main house and the attached\nguest house; she also helped clean up the water.\n      Birdwell said that he would have liked to have known about the roofs,\ninsurance settlement, and prior flooding beforehand and that, had he known, he\n                                          6\n\fwould not have purchased the Ranch. Birdwell said that he had trouble getting\ninsurance for the Ranch because of the condition of the roofs, that the Ranch was\nworth $280,000 less because of the damaged roofs, that he could not recoup the\nadditional $240,000 in improvements that he had made, 6 and that he planned to sell\nthe property. Birdwell said that Appellants never told him about the prior flooding,\nthe insurance settlement, or the roof damage. Birdwell said there was flooding in\nthe house after he took possession.\n        Lanier, a real estate inspector, inspected the Ranch on Birdwell’s behalf.\nLanier said that he did not get on the roofs during the first inspection and that he\nonly viewed the roofs from a ladder. Lanier testified that Gary Domel had said\nnothing about a hailstorm and had told Lanier that the roofs were fine, that they\nhad been fixed, that nothing was wrong with them, and that there was nothing to\nworry about in connection with the roofs. Lanier also said that Appellants never\nmentioned the $114,650.04 settlement check. Lanier said that Gary Domel was\nvery upset and defensive with Lanier’s property inspection reports because of the\nnumber of things that Lanier listed that needed to be repaired. Dukes said that\nGary Domel was frustrated by Lanier’s inspection. Further, Dukes testified that,\njust prior to closing, Kim Domel told Dukes and other workers not to say anything\nif they saw something wrong with the Ranch while they were cleaning it.\n        Donald Raymond Putnam, who was retained by Appellants, testified as an\nexpert on roofs and roof construction. 7 Putnam said that he inspected the roofs at\nthe Ranch and that, although the roofs had some loose screws, algae and rust, some\nminor panel kinks, oil-canning, dents, flashing problems, and a few crushed panels,\n\n        6\n         Birdwell said that, once he and his wife took possession, they removed and replaced the cabinets\nin the main house, had the entire house retextured and repainted, covered the concrete floors, and replaced\nthe window treatments—for a total renovation cost of approximately $240,000.\n        7\n         Putnam indicated that he had been paid more than $15,000 for his opinions in this case, but he\nhad not done a cost estimate on the replacement of roofs at the Ranch.\n\n                                                    7\n\fthe roofs did not need repair or replacement. Putnam said that the crushed panels\nwere not from hail and that, except for a few shallow dents, the dents did not look\nlike they were caused by hail.\n      This case was ultimately tried to a jury on breach of contract, negligent\nmisrepresentation, DTPA, and fraud claims. Several written admissions made by\nAppellants were read at trial. Appellants admitted that they were aware of a\nhailstorm that hit the Ranch after they had signed their Notice, that there were\ndamaged roof panels at the residence of the Ranch, and that they made an\ninsurance claim for damaged metal roof panels. They also admitted that the\nresidence sustained roof damage while they owned the Ranch, that there was hail\ndamage that occurred after they signed the Notice but before they closed on the\nsale of the Ranch, and that they received an insurance settlement check for a\ncovered loss for metal roof panels at the Ranch. Appellants further admitted that\nthey did not use the insurance settlement check to replace the metal roof panels on\nthe residence or complete any repairs to the metal roof panels.\n                                 II. Issues Presented\n      Appellants assert eleven issues on appeal. In their first issue, Appellants\nassert that they had no duty to update their Notice. In their second issue, they\nassert that there was factually insufficient evidence to support reliance and\ncausation. In their third issue, Appellants assert that there is no evidence of market\nvalue of the Ranch. Appellants assert in their fourth issue that the State Farm\nclaim file was improperly admitted as evidence. Appellants argue in their fifth\nissue that there was no evidence to support an award of future damages, and in\ntheir sixth issue, they complain that the award for roof replacement and future\ndamages was an impermissible double recovery. In their seventh issue, Appellants\ncomplain that attorneys’ fees are not recoverable in a negligent misrepresentation\nclaim. Appellants argue in their eighth issue that the trial court erred when it\n                                          8\n\fawarded prejudgment interest on future damages. Appellants take the position in\ntheir ninth issue that Birdwell’s tort claims are barred by the economic loss rule.\nThe basis of Appellants’ tenth issue is that that there was factually insufficient\nevidence to award damages to replace the roofs. Finally, in Appellants’ eleventh\nissue, they maintain that Birdwell’s claims for DTPA and fraud fail because they\nowed no duty to Birdwell and because there is factually insufficient evidence to\nsupport reliance and causation.\n                              III. Standard of Review\n      Appellants assert both legal and factual sufficiency challenges. When we\nconduct a legal sufficiency review, we review the evidence in a light that tends to\nsupport the disputed finding and disregard all evidence and inferences to the\ncontrary. Bradford v. Vento, 48 S.W.3d 749, 754 (Tex. 2001). We “assess all the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, indulging every\nreasonable inference in favor of the judgment.” City of Austin Police Dep’t v.\nBrown, 96 S.W.3d 588, 593 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, pet. dism’d) (citing\nAssociated Indem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 276, 285–86 (Tex.\n1998)). If more than a scintilla of evidence supports the challenged finding, the\nno-evidence challenge must fail. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Canchola, 121\nS.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003); Gen. Motors Corp. v. Sanchez, 997 S.W.2d 584, 588\n(Tex. 1999). We may sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only when (1) the\nrecord discloses a complete absence of a vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules\nof law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital\nfact, (3) the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere\nscintilla, or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite of a vital fact.\nCity of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex. 2005) (citing Robert W.\nCalvert, “No Evidence” and “Insufficient Evidence” Points of Error, 38 TEX. L.\nREV. 361, 362–63 (1960)).\n                                          9\n\f      For a factual sufficiency review, we examine all the evidence in the record,\nboth for and against the lower court’s findings. Ortiz v. Jones, 917 S.W.2d 770,\n772 (Tex. 1996). We must consider and weigh all such evidence in a neutral light.\nGolden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003). But\n“[j]urors are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to\ngive their testimony. They may choose to believe one witness and disbelieve\nanother.” City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819 (footnote omitted). If the evidence at\ntrial would enable reasonable minds to differ in their conclusions, we do not\nsubstitute our judgment, so long as the evidence falls within a zone of reasonable\ndisagreement. Id. at 822. In considering and weighing all of the evidence, we will\nset aside the judgment only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\nevidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176\n(Tex. 1986).\n                            IV. Discussion and Analysis\n      A. Issue Number I: Duty to Disclose or Update Information\n      Appellants assert in their first issue that the trial court erred in ruling that\nAppellants had a duty to update their Notice. The Seller’s Disclosure of Property\nCondition Notice is a document used to apprise a potential buyer of the condition\nof real property that is for sale. See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 5.008 (West Supp.\n2014). Section 5.008(a) of the Texas Property Code provides:\n             A seller of residential real property comprising not more than\n      one dwelling unit located in this state shall give to the purchaser of the\n      property a written notice as prescribed by this section or a written\n      notice substantially similar to the notice prescribed by this section\n      which contains, at a minimum, all of the items in the notice prescribed\n      by this section.\n\nSection 5.008(b) outlines the content that the disclosure notice must cover.\nAppellants correctly state that Section 5.008 does not create, in itself, a continuing\n\n                                         10\n\fduty or obligation to update matters within the form after the date the notice was\ncompleted. See Bynum v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P’ship, 129 S.W.3d\n781, 795 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied). We note that the\nTexas Supreme Court has held that a seller has no duty to disclose facts that he\ndoes not know. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Jefferson Assocs., Ltd., 896 S.W.2d\n156, 162 (Tex. 1995) (citing Robinson v. Preston Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 633\nS.W.2d 500, 502 (Tex.1982)).\n      However, a seller of real estate is under a duty to disclose material facts that\nwould not be discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence on the\npart of the purchaser or that a reasonable investigation and inquiry would not\nuncover. Myre v. Meletio, 307 S.W.3d 839, 843 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, pet.\ndenied) (citing Smith v. Nat’l Resort Cmtys., Inc., 585 S.W.2d 655, 658 (Tex.\n1979)). In addition, a duty to disclose may arise in four other situations: (1) when\nthere is a confidential or fiduciary relationship; (2) when one voluntarily discloses\ninformation, the whole truth must be disclosed; (3) when one makes a\nrepresentation, new information must be disclosed when that new information\nmakes the earlier representation misleading or untrue; and (4) when one makes a\npartial disclosure and conveys a false impression. Brown & Brown of Tex., Inc. v.\nOmni Metals, Inc., 317 S.W.3d 361, 384 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010,\npet. denied); Omni Metals, Inc. v. Poe & Brown of Texas, Inc., No. 14-00-01081-\nCV, 2002 WL 1331720 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] June 13, 2002, pet.\ndenied) (not designated for publication); Ralston Purina Co. v. McKendrick, 850\nS.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1993, writ denied).\n      Even in the absence of a confidential relationship, when one makes a\nrepresentation, he has a duty to disclose new information when he is aware the new\ninformation makes the earlier representation misleading or untrue.           Cone v.\nFagadau Energy Corp., 68 S.W.3d 147, 168 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2001, pet.\n                                         11\n\fdenied) (citing Susanoil, Inc. v. Cont’l Oil Co., 519 S.W.2d 230, 236 n.6 (Tex. Civ.\nApp.—San Antonio 1975, writ ref’d n.r.e.)). In addition, as the Prudential court\nand several other Texas courts have noted, a general duty to disclose information\nin an arm’s-length business transaction may arise when a party makes a partial\ndisclosure that, although true, conveys a false impression. Prudential Ins., 896\nS.W.2d at 162; see, e.g., Bradford, 48 S.W.3d at 755–56; Hoggett v. Brown, 971\nS.W.2d 472, 487 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet. denied); Ralston\nPurina, 850 S.W.2d at 636.\n          A corollary principle is that, when there is a duty to speak, silence may be as\nmisleading as a positive misrepresentation of existing facts. Smith, 585 S.W.2d at\n658 (citing Rowntree v. Rice, 426 S.W.2d 890 (Tex. Civ. App.—San Antonio\n1968, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).        Silence, therefore, can be equivalent to a false\nrepresentation when there is a duty to speak and the party deliberately remains\nsilent.     Bradford, 48 S.W.3d at 755; SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Doe, 903\nS.W.2d 347, 353 (Tex. 1995); Smith, 585 S.W.2d at 658.\n          Appellants filled out their Notice when they first listed the Ranch for sale in\n2008. They relisted it in April 2009. When Birdwell received the Notice in\nOctober 2009, there had been a hailstorm at the Ranch that resulted in roof and\nother damages, and Appellants had filed a hailstorm damage claim and received a\nsettlement but had not replaced the roofs. Appellants never updated the Notice or\ndisclosed any of this information to Birdwell.           Notably, Appellants had not\ninformed their broker, Waite, of the hailstorm and settlement. Appellants’ delivery\nto Birdwell of the nearly one-year-old Notice without clarification or comment was\nmisleading and left a false impression, and Appellants had a duty to correct that\nmisleading and false impression.\n          In addition, Appellants reported that there had been prior flooding at the\nRanch, but they failed to disclose that it had occurred in both the main house and in\n                                             12\n\fthe guest house. This was both an affirmative misrepresentation and a partial\ndisclosure; Appellants failed to provide the whole truth. As such, the Notice was\nboth false and misleading. In addition, there was testimony at trial from Lanier\nthat he had tried to inspect the roofs on two occasions and that Appellants had told\nhim that the roofs were fine and were not leaking. Given that the statements\ncontained in the Notice were no longer true when the Notice was given to\nBirdwell, Appellants had a common-law duty to disclose the whole truth, correct\nany misstatements or false impressions, and disclose material information—like\nthe insurance claim and payment for roof damage—that would not have been\ndiscoverable through ordinary and reasonable diligence. We overrule Appellants’\nfirst issue.\n       B. Issue Number II: Reliance and Causation\n       In their second issue, Appellants assert that there was factually insufficient\nevidence to support the jury’s findings on the elements of reliance and causation.\nThe elements of negligent misrepresentation are the following:\n       (1)     the representation is made by a defendant in the course of his\n               business, or in a transaction in which he has a pecuniary\n               interest;\n\n       (2)     the defendant supplies “false information” for the guidance of\n               others in their business;\n\n       (3)     the defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in\n               obtaining or communicating the information; and\n\n       (4)     the plaintiff suffers pecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the\n               representation.\nFed. Land Bank Ass’n of Tyler v. Sloane, 825 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1991)\n(adopting RESTATEMENT (SECOND)          OF    TORTS § 552 (1977)); see McCamish,\nMartin, Brown & Loeffler v. F.E. Appling Interests, 991 S.W.2d 787, 791 (Tex.\n\n\n                                             13\n\f1999). Appellants argue that Birdwell could not justifiably rely on their\nrepresentations in the Notice in light of the “as is” disclaimer in it.\n      Reliance has two elements. See Grant Thornton LLP v. Prospect High\nIncome Fund, 314 S.W.3d 913, 923 (Tex. 2010). First, the plaintiff must actually\nrely on the misinformation to his detriment by either basing his conduct on it or\nrefraining from action because of it. Id. Second, reliance must have been justified\nor reasonable. Id.; Am. Tobacco Co., Inc. v. Grinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 436 (Tex.\n1997).   Justifiable reliance is proven when the injured party would not have\ncompleted the purchase absent the misrepresentation. Ferguson v. DRG/Colony\nN., Ltd., 764 S.W.2d 874, 884–85 (Tex. App.—Austin 1989, writ denied).\n      Birdwell also must prove that Appellants’ misrepresentation was a\nproximate cause of his damages. Larsen v. Carlene Langford & Assocs., Inc., 41\nS.W.3d 245, 250 (Tex. App.—Waco 2001, pet. denied). Proximate cause is both\n(1) cause in fact and (2) foreseeability. Id. (citing Travis v. City of Mesquite, 830\nS.W.2d 94, 98 (Tex. 1992)). This requires proof that an act or omission was a\nsubstantial factor in bringing about injury that would not otherwise have occurred.\nPrudential Ins., 896 S.W.2d at 161 (citing McClure v. Allied Stores of Tex., Inc.,\n608 S.W.2d 901, 903 (Tex. 1980)).\n      In Ferguson, the buyer of an apartment complex sued the seller for failing to\nrepair or replace the roof on an apartment complex. 764 S.W.2d at 877. The seller\nhad promised to make them watertight. Id. at 881. Without that representation, the\nbuyer would not have purchased the property. Id. at 884–85. The jury found that\nthe buyer relied on the seller’s promise to repair the roofs. Id. at 884. There was\nunequivocal testimony from the buyer that he would not have gone through with\nthe purchase of the apartment complex without the agreement to make the roofs\nwatertight. Id. at 884–85. The Ferguson court held this was sufficient to prove\n\n\n                                           14\n\fthat the promise to repair the roofs was an inducing cause of the seller’s\ncompletion of the purchase. Id. at 885.\n      In this case, there was unequivocal testimony from Birdwell that he would\nnot have purchased the Ranch had he been told about the prior flooding and the\nunrepaired hail damage to the roofs. The jury found that Birdwell justifiably relied\non the representations of Appellants that (1) the roofs were fine, were not leaking,\nand needed no repair; (2) Appellants had not received an insurance claim payment\nfor hail damage to the roofs; (3) Appellants had not received any insurance claim\npayments for hail damage that had not been fully used to repair the damage; and\n(4) when Appellants disclosed the fact that certain flooding had occurred, they\nfailed to disclose that the main house and guest house also had flooded. In\naddition, it was foreseeable to Appellants that a potential buyer would want to\nknow about both of the prior instances of flooding, as well as the hail damage to\nthe buildings on the Ranch. Appellants’ misrepresentations were a substantial\nfactor or inducing cause and, thus, constitute the cause-in-fact of Birdwell’s\ndamages.\n      Appellants point to the disclaimer in the Notice and the “as is” language in\nthe contract and argue that the responsibility, and liability, for determining the\ncondition of the property lies with Birdwell. A valid “as is” agreement can prevent\na buyer from holding a seller liable if the thing sold turns out to be worth less than\nthe price paid because it is impossible for the buyer’s injury on account of this\ndisparity to have been caused by the seller. Prudential Ins., 896 S.W.2d at 161\n(citing Mid Continent Aircraft Corp. v. Curry Cnty. Spraying Serv. Inc., 572\nS.W.2d 308, 313 (Tex. 1978) (the buyer “has taken the entire risk as to the quality\nof the [property] and the resulting loss”)). But this statement of the law is not\napplicable where the seller has actual knowledge of information material to the\ntransaction and withholds that information from the buyer. The Prudential court\n                                          15\n\fpointed out that, in such a situation, the “as is” clause is not a shield from liability.\nId.\n      Appellants withheld the information about the insurance claim settlement\nand their failure to use it to repair or replace the roofs, which is not something that\nBirdwell would have discovered in the ordinary course of inspecting the property.\nThat is especially true when Appellants affirmatively represented that the opposite\nhad occurred: there had been no hail damage, no insurance claims or payments,\nand no damage to the roofs.         We have reviewed the record, and we cannot\nconclude that the jury’s findings—that Birdwell justifiably relied on Appellants’\nmisrepresentations and that those misrepresentations proximately caused his\ndamages—were against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. We\noverrule Appellants’ second issue.\n      C. Issue Number III: Market Value\n      Appellants assert in their third issue that, because there is no evidence of\nmarket value, the jury was not able to award damages for the difference in value\nbetween what was given and what was received. In negligent misrepresentation\ncases, two types of damages are recoverable to compensate a plaintiff for a legal\ninjury caused by the defendant’s misrepresentation:\n       (a)   the difference between the value of what he has received in the\n             transaction and its purchase price or other value given for it;\n             and\n      (b)    pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a consequence of the\n             plaintiff’s reliance upon the misrepresentation.\n\nAirborne Freight Corp. v. C.R. Lee Enters., Inc., 847 S.W.2d 289, 295 (Tex.\nApp.—El Paso 1992, writ denied).             Damages recoverable for a negligent\nmisrepresentation do not include the benefit of the plaintiff’s contract with the\ndefendant. Sloane, 825 S.W.2d at 442 (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS\n\n\n                                           16\n\f§ 552B (1977)). Negligent misrepresentation is restricted to the out-of-pocket\nmeasure of damages because it “implicates only the duty of care in supplying\ncommercial information; honesty or good faith is no defense.” D.S.A., Inc. v.\nHillsboro Indep. Sch. Dist., 973 S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex. 1998).\n      A property owner is qualified to testify to the value of his property even if he\nis not an expert and would not be qualified to testify to the value of other property.\nReid Rd. Mun. Util. Dist. No. 2 v. Speedy Stop Food Stores, Ltd., 337 S.W.3d 846,\n852–53 (Tex. 2011) (citing Porras v. Craig, 675 S.W.2d 503, 504 (Tex. 1984)).\nThe rule is based on the presumption that an owner will be familiar with his own\nproperty and know its value. See id. But in order for a property owner to qualify\nas a witness to discuss damages to his property or its decline in market value, “his\ntestimony must show that it refers to market, rather than intrinsic or some other\nvalue of the property. This requirement is usually met by asking the witness if he\nis familiar with the market value of his property.” Porras, 675 S.W.2d at 504–05.\n      Birdwell testified that he was familiar with the Ranch and that he had paid\n$2.6 million for the Ranch. The contract and final settlement statement reflected\nthat purchase price. Birdwell testified that the Ranch he received was worth\n$280,000 less than what he paid for it. The jury determined that the difference\nbetween the value of what Birdwell paid and what he received was $139,926. The\njury has broad discretion to award damages within the range of evidence presented\nat trial. Drury Sw., Inc. v. Louie Ledeaux #1, Inc., 350 S.W.3d 287, 292 (Tex.\nApp.—San Antonio 2011, pet. denied) (citing Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Low, 79\nS.W.3d 561, 566 (Tex. 2002)). And we may not set aside a jury’s findings merely\nbecause they are unclear. Vela v. Wagner & Brown, Ltd., 203 S.W.3d 37, 49 (Tex.\nApp.—San Antonio 2006, no pet.). When the jury’s award is within the range of\ndamages supported by the trial evidence, we are not permitted to speculate on how\nthe jury arrived at its award. Id. We hold that there was some evidence to support\n                                         17\n\fthe jury award of $139,926 for the difference in value received versus value paid.\nWe overrule Appellants’ third issue.\n      D. Issue Number IV: Admission of Plaintiff’s Exhibit 55\n      Appellants assert in Issue Four that the trial court erred when it admitted\nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 55, an insurance document, into evidence. We review a trial\ncourt’s decision on the admission or exclusion of evidence under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard because evidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of\nthe trial court. U-Haul Int’l, Inc. v. Waldrip, 380 S.W.3d 118, 132 (Tex. 2012)\n(citing Bay Area Healthcare Grp., Ltd. v. McShane, 239 S.W.3d 231, 234 (Tex.\n2007) (per curiam)). But when the trial court acts without regard for guiding rules\nor principles, it abuses its discretion. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone,\n972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998). We reverse only when the trial court’s error in\nadmitting or excluding evidence probably resulted in an improper judgment. See\nNissan Motor Co. v. Armstrong, 145 S.W.3d 131, 144 (Tex. 2004).\n      Reversible error does not usually occur on the erroneous admission or\nexclusion of evidence unless the complaining party can demonstrate that the whole\ncase turns on the excluded or admitted evidence. Riggs v. Sentry Ins., 821 S.W.2d\n701, 708–09 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied) (citing\nStevenson v. Koutzarov, 795 S.W.2d 313, 318 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n1990, writ denied)); see Univ. of Tex. at Austin v. Hinton, 822 S.W.2d 197, 203\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1991, no writ). In this case, the trial court admitted, as\nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 55, a collection of documents from a State Farm insurance claim\nfile in which the prior hail damage was noted, as well as the estimate for repair of\nthe hail damage. The exhibit also contained a copy of the check that had been\nissued in payment of the claim. The total estimated replacement cost for the roofs\nwas $139,926.83.     Appellants argue that this exhibit was hearsay and was\nimproperly admitted and resulted in an improper judgment because the jury’s\n                                        18\n\faward for roof repairs and diminution in value was the same amount as the State\nFarm estimate in the exhibit. Birdwell contends that the exhibit was admissible as\nproof that Appellants had prior knowledge of roof damage.\n      One element of negligent misrepresentation is that the defendant supplied\nfalse information for the guidance of the plaintiff in deciding whether to purchase\nthe subject property. Sloane, 825 S.W.2d at 442. The information in Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 55 was evidence of what Appellants knew about the damage to the roofs of\nthe buildings on the Ranch. In their Notice, Appellants did not disclose the prior\nhail damage; they only noted that some sheet metal screws needed to be replaced.\nThe information in the exhibit could have been used to question Appellants and to\nimpeach them, and the exhibit could have been admitted as a business record with\na sponsoring witness.\n      We note, however, that the exhibit was admitted prior to trial, as part of the\npretrial review of the exhibits, and that no sponsoring witness or affidavit was used\nto lay a business records foundation for admission. We hold that the exhibit was\ninadmissible without the business records foundation. TEX. R. EVID. 803(6); see\nGood v. Baker, 339 S.W.3d 260, 273 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2011, pet. denied).\n      But the jury heard witnesses describe the hailstorm and heard Appellants\ntestify about their involvement with State Farm and the specifics of their hailstorm\ndamage claim. The jury also saw pictures of the hailstorm damage and heard\ntestimony about Appellants’ receipt of the insurance claim check, their failure to\nuse it to repair hailstorm roof damage, and their comments on how they intended to\nand did use the settlement funds. Furthermore, the jury heard conflicting evidence\non the condition of the roofs and the costs for repair or replacement: Appellants\ndescribed the roofs as absolutely “bulletproof” with “no damage” and no needed\nrepair, but Reyes told Birdwell that the roofs were “totaled” and needed to be\nreplaced. In light of all the evidence adduced at trial, the contents of the claim file\n                                          19\n\fwere cumulative, and any error in its admittance was harmless. Puentes v. Fannie\nMae, 350 S.W.3d 732, 738 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, pet. dism’d w.o.j.) (citing\nState v. Cent. Expressway Sign Assocs., 302 S.W.3d 866, 870 (Tex. 2009)). We\noverrule Appellants’ fourth issue.\n      E. Issue Number V: Future Damages\n      Appellants complain in their fifth issue that there was no evidence to support\nthe jury’s award of future damages.        For future damages, Texas follows the\nreasonable probability rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff must (1) present evidence\nthat, in reasonable probability, it will incur expenses in the future and (2) prove the\nprobable reasonable amount of the future expenses. MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Tex.\nUtils. Elec. Co., 995 S.W.2d 647, 654–55 (Tex. 1999); Securitycomm Grp., Inc. v.\nBrocail, No. 14-09-00295-CV, 2010 WL 5514333 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] Dec. 28, 2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.).\n      The jury heard evidence that Birdwell would not have purchased the\nproperty had he been told of the prior hail damage and flooding. The jury saw\ndocuments in which Appellants failed to disclose both the full extent of prior\nflooding and the fact that they had received insurance payments to repair the roofs\nbut did not use the payments to complete repairs. Furthermore, the jury heard\nevidence that Birdwell intended to sell the Ranch. In addition, the jury heard\ntestimony that Birdwell paid $2.6 million for the Ranch, but Birdwell said he\nwould not have bought it had he known of the roof and flooding issues. Birdwell\nalso said that he intended to sell it, which would involve a sales transaction cost,\nsuch as a broker’s fee, on any future sale. The jury awarded $125,000 in future\ndamages.    The total broker’s fee on the sale of the Ranch to Birdwell was\n$156,000; Birdwell could expect that a similar, although smaller, fee would be\nincurred on his future sale.     After reviewing the record and indulging every\ninference in favor of the judgment, we hold that there was some evidence that\n                                          20\n\fBirdwell would incur expenses in the future when he sold the Ranch and that there\nwas also evidence of the amount of future damages. We overrule Appellants’ fifth\nissue.\n         F. Issue Number VII: Attorneys’ Fees\n         Appellants’ seventh issue complains that attorneys’ fees are not recoverable\nin a negligent misrepresentation claim. Attorneys’ fees may be recovered from an\nopposing party only when permitted by statute or by contract.              Williams v.\nColthurst, 253 S.W.3d 353, 362 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2008, no pet.) (citing\nHolland v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 95 (Tex. 1999)). In this case,\nAppellants signed a contract that provided in part: “A Buyer, Seller, Listing\nBroker, Other Broker, or escrow agent who prevails in any legal proceeding related\nto this contract is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and all costs of such\nproceeding.” “Whether a party prevails turns on whether the party prevails upon\nthe court to award it something, either monetary or equitable.” Intercontinental\nGrp. P’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P., 295 S.W.3d 650, 655 (Tex. 2009).\n         Birdwell sought and recovered money damages and has prevailed in this\naction. As the prevailing party, Birdwell was entitled to recover attorneys’ fees\nbecause the parties’ contract provided for such recovery. See Podder v. Funding\nPartners L.P., No. 03-09-00458-CV, 2010 WL 850175, at *5 (Tex. App.—Austin\nMar. 12, 2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (recovery of attorneys’ fees permitted when\ncontract provided for fee recovery for any legal proceeding related to contract); see\nalso Sierra Assoc. Grp., Inc. v. Hardeman, No. 03-08-00324-CV, 2009 WL\n416465 (Tex. App.—Austin Feb. 20, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.) (attorneys’ fees\nrecoverable for tort claims that dealt with contract when contract provided for\nrecovery of attorneys’ fees in any legal action related to contract). Appellants\nargue that Birdwell had to segregate the fees for the various claims advanced, but\n\n\n                                          21\n\fthe parties’ contract did not impose such a requirement. We overrule Appellants’\nseventh issue.\n         G. Issue Number VIII: Prejudgment Interest\n         Appellants, by their eighth issue, assert that the trial court erred when it\nawarded prejudgment interest on future damages. Under Texas law, prejudgment\ninterest is an additional damage award for the loss of use of money between the\ntime of the accrual of the claim and the date of the judgment. Johnson & Higgins\nof Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy, Inc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 528 (Tex. 1998). Two\nseparate grounds exist in Texas for prejudgment interest: (1) an enabling statute\nand (2) general principles of equity. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Stahl Petroleum\nCo., 569 S.W.2d 480, 485 (Tex. 1978). The former applies to judgments for credit\ntransactions, wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, and condemnation\ncases, while the latter applies, under common law, to a breach of contract claim.\nTEX. FIN. CODE ANN. §§ 302.002, 304.102, 304.201 (West 2006); Kenneco, 962\nS.W.2d at 530; Adams v. H & H Meat Prods., Inc., 41 S.W.3d 762, 780 (Tex.\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.). However, prejudgment interest may not be\nassessed or recovered on an award of future damages.              FIN. § 304.1045.\nCompensation other than for the lost use of money is a windfall, penalty, or fine,\nnot “interest.” Carl J. Battaglia, M.D., P.A. v. Alexander, 177 S.W.3d 893, 907\n(Tex. 2005). In this case, the trial court calculated prejudgment interest on the\ndamages award, and Appellants did not object to the calculation. Appellants have\nwaived this issue on appeal. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1; see, e.g., Larrumbide v. Doctors\nHealth Facilities, 734 S.W.2d 685, 694 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied)\n(failure to object to trial court concerning its error in judgment in failing to award\nprejudgment interest waived error on appeal). We overrule Appellants’ eighth\nissue.\n\n\n                                          22\n\f      H. Issue Number IX: Independent Injury Doctrine\n      In their ninth issue, Appellants assert that Birdwell’s tort claims are barred\nby the economic loss rule. The economic loss rule, also known as the independent\ninjury doctrine, precludes a tort cause of action when (1) the claim is for breach of\na duty created solely by contract instead of a duty imposed by law and (2) the only\ninjury is the economic loss to the subject of the contract itself. See Formosa\nPlastics Corp. v. Presidio Eng’rs & Contractors, Inc., 960 S.W.2d 41, 46 (Tex.\n1998) (required inquiry is whether source of the duty arises from the contract or\nfrom common law along with analysis of remedy sought by plaintiff). Texas\njurisprudence has long recognized the coexistence of obligations and duties\nseparately imposed by contract and tort. Carousel’s Creamery, L.L.C. v. Marble\nSlab Creamery, Inc., 134 S.W.3d 385, 392 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004,\npet. dism’d by agr.) (citing MCN Energy Enters., Inc. v. Omagro de Colombia,\nL.D.C., 98 S.W.3d 766, 772 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, pet. denied)); see Jim\nWalter Homes, Inc. v. Reed, 711 S.W.2d 617, 618 (Tex. 1986); see also\nMcCamish, 991 S.W.2d at 792 (Section 552 imposes a duty to avoid negligent\nmisrepresentation, irrespective of privity).\n      Birdwell advanced negligent misrepresentation claims against Appellants\nbased on their common-law duty to fully disclose material facts when making\nvoluntary representations about prior flooding, roof damage, insurance payments\nfor hail damage, and the lack of roof repairs after the insurance settlement, all of\nwhich were relied upon by Birdwell and were misleading or left a false impression\nbecause they were either at one time true, but no longer true, or they were simply\nfalse. Also, Birdwell’s damages were not limited to economic loss from the\noriginal contract. Birdwell’s damages arise not from the contract but, as we have\npreviously explained, from the common-law duty of disclosure that Appellants\nbreached when they made misleading or false representations that resulted in\n                                          23\n\fdamages independent of the sales price of the Ranch. We overrule Appellants’\nninth issue.\n\n      I. Issues X, VI & XI: Roof Damages, Double Recovery, and Other Claims\n      In their tenth, sixth, and eleventh issues, Appellants complain that there was\nfactually insufficient evidence to support the award for roof replacement damages;\nthat roof replacement damages and future damages for roof repair constituted a\ndouble recovery; and that there was legally and factually insufficient evidence to\nsupport the duty, reliance, and causation elements of Birdwell’s DTPA and other\nclaims. Birdwell did not elect to recover under the DTPA or the other theories, and\nthe final judgment did not award either current or future cost of repair for the roofs.\nThe final judgment did not include recovery under the alternate theories; Birdwell\nelected to recover under negligent misrepresentation and obtained damages under\nthat theory, including damages computed as the difference in the value received\nversus the value paid and also future damages. Because we have found that\nBirdwell’s recovery under negligent misrepresentation was supported by the\nevidence, as explained above, we need not address these remaining issues raised by\nAppellants.

Prior to the sale,\nAppellants failed to disclose previous flooding in the Ranch’s two houses, the\nreceipt of an insurance settlement for hailstorm damage to metal roofs on the\n\n       1\n        Patsy Birdwell, Gaylon’s wife, was a plaintiff as well, but she passed away approximately six\nmonths before trial.\n\fRanch’s buildings, and the use of the settlement funds for purposes other than to\nreplace the damaged roofs. The jury awarded Birdwell damages under multiple\ntheories of liability. At Birdwell’s election, the trial court entered a judgment in\nhis favor for $306,087.77 against Appellants for negligent misrepresentation. 2\nAppellants assert eleven issues on appeal. We affirm.\n                           I. Background Facts and Trial Evidence\n        The Ranch is a 120-acre estate located in the Texas Hill Country near\nMarble Falls. The Ranch has high perimeter fencing; a 6,000 square foot main\nhouse with a four-car garage; an infinity pool with a hot tub; a six-stall horse stable\nwith a wash and tack area; a walker and separate hay barn; a 17,000 square foot,\nlighted riding arena; and an 1,800 square foot guest or foreman’s house.3 The\nRanch also has numerous trees, several head of exotic game, and two lakes stocked\nwith Florida bass.\n        Appellants engaged Michael King Waite, a real estate broker, as their listing\nagent and listed the Ranch for sale in 2008, after they had lived there for several\nyears, because they wanted to live closer to their Austin businesses. After Waite\nlooked at the Ranch, he suggested that Appellants list the Ranch for $3 million\nbecause he thought its value was in the range of $2.4 million to $2.85 million.\nAppellants decided to list the Ranch for $3.2 million in 2008 but lowered the price\nin April 2009 to $2.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n         The judgment included $264,926 in damages, plus $67,000 in attorneys’ fees, $19,161.77 in\nprejudgment interest, and postjudgment interest of five percent per annum with a settlement credit for\n$45,000. Birdwell settled his claims against codefendant, Derris William Lanier d/b/a Lanier Inspections,\nfor $45,000. Lanier Inspections was the property inspection company that Birdwell had hired to inspect\nthe Ranch prior to the sale.\n        3\n        The Ranch also had a tractor and storage barn and a small one-car garage that was connected by\na breezeway to the guest or foreman’s house.\n\n                                                   2\n\f      Waite had Appellants fill out the Seller’s Disclosure Notice (the Notice),\nsign it, and then return it to him. 4 Both Waite and Appellants acknowledged that\nthe Notice indicated that Appellants agreed to amend any applicable notices and\ndisclosures during the listing. The Notice was the only one that Appellants filled\nout and gave to Waite. Waite testified that Appellants never told him about a\nhailstorm in March 2009 at the Ranch and did not mention any insurance\nsettlements for roof repair or replacement. Waite also said that he was not told of\nprior flooding inside the main house or the attached guest house.\n      Waite said that the Notice was given to Birdwell. After some negotiation,\nBirdwell agreed to pay $2.6 million for the Ranch and deposited $25,000 earnest\nmoney.       Birdwell said that he received Appellants’ Notice and relied on the\nstatements that there had been no prior flooding in the structures, that there had\nbeen no prior insurance settlements, and that there had been no prior damage to the\nroofs on the Ranch’s buildings.                Birdwell had Lanier Inspections inspect the\nproperty. Birdwell said that they negotiated some additional items for purchase\nand some repairs to chimney flashing. Birdwell asked Waite when the flashing\nrepair would be done, and Birdwell agreed to Waite’s suggestion that it could be\ndone after closing. Later, Waite hired Cornerstone Roofing and Remodeling to\nrepair the flashing. Juan Reyes, the owner of Cornerstone Roofing, testified that he\nis a member of the National Roofing Contractors Association, a member of the\nBetter Business Bureau, and a certified GAF master elite contractor. Reyes does\nnew construction roofs and does repair and replacement of roofs, including metal,\nshingle, and tile.\n      Reyes testified that he noticed a problem with the roof and told the Ranch’s\nnew owner, Birdwell, that the roof was “totaled” and needed to be replaced. Reyes\ninspected all of the roofs at the Ranch and said that all of them needed to be\n      4\n          Kim Domel initialed each page of the Notice but did not sign on the signature line.\n\n                                                     3\n\freplaced, which would cost $280,000. Reyes said he was unaware that Appellants\nhad made a hailstorm damage claim for the roofs, but he was not surprised that\nthere had been a hailstorm damage claim and a settlement for roof damage. He\nsaid that the hailstorm was the probable cause of the roof damage. Reyes said\nBirdwell called Waite and told him about the roofs, and Birdwell said Waite was\nsurprised. Waite said that the first time he heard about roof damage from a\nhailstorm was when Reyes and Birdwell called him.\n      Upon being contacted by Waite, Kim Domel did not deny that an insurance\nclaim had been filed, but Gary Domel said that the roofs were not damaged\nseverely enough to need replacement and that Appellants had dropped the price\nsignificantly. Gary Domel testified that the roof of the main house was nine years\nold and that he had tightened some of the loose screws on the roof. He admitted\nthat he had checked “no” on the Notice to indicate that he had not received any\ninsurance settlements for damages to the Ranch.\n      Gary Domel testified that he was not at the Ranch when the hailstorm\noccurred. He said that there was hail damage to the pool deck, siding, and the\nscreen porch and that some windows were broken. He also said that, after the\nhailstorm, he could not tell whether the roof of the main house was damaged but\nthat he saw “nothing” that required repair or replacement and did not make any\nrepairs because “there [were] no leaks.” Gary Domel said the roof “looked better\nthan every other roof [he had] ever seen.” He admitted that he made an insurance\nclaim for hailstorm damage and that he received a check for $114,650.04. The\namount for the replacement cost coverage for the roofs was $139,926.83. Gary\nDomel said that he did not need to spend the $114,650.04 on the roofs because the\nroof of the main house was “sound” and “bulletproof.”\n      Gary Domel also said that the Notice was true on the date of closing in\nNovember 2009 and that he did not think that the insurance settlement was\n                                        4\n\fsomething that had to be disclosed to Birdwell. Gary Domel said that he “didn’t\nthink about it. [He] had no reason to think about it.” He said he checked “no” on\nthe maintenance part of the Notice because he could not think of anything that was\nin need of repair or replacement.                  Gary Domel testified that the insurance\nsettlement for the roofs was for “cosmetic damage” and that he did not use the\nsettlement funds to repair or replace the roofs.\n      Kim Domel testified that she relied on her husband and followed his\ndirections when asked to sign documents; she did not review or read them. She\nsaid that sellers should let buyers know if something, like a dishwasher, does not\nwork, but she did not think that a seller had to disclose an insurance settlement if\neverything had been repaired. Kim Domel said that she was not at the Ranch when\nthe hailstorm occurred and that her employees were wrong when they said that she\nwas; she also denied telling her employees that she had received a $150,000\ninsurance check for roof damage and that she was going to buy a new Mercedes.\n      Ginny Dean Dukes was the ranch hand who took care of horses and game at\nthe Ranch, and he lived in the foreman’s house. 5 Dukes said that he was at the\nRanch when the hailstorm hit in March 2009, that Appellants were also there, and\nthat the storm was severe. According to Dukes, everyone hid in one of the master\nbedroom closets in the main house. He said that he saw the adjusters at the Ranch\nlooking at the hail damage on the roofs, buildings, pool deck, and siding.\n      Mary Jo Callaway was a nanny for Appellants’ children and lived for a time\nat the Ranch. She said that Appellants were there when the hailstorm hit in 2009\nand that everyone hid in the closet.\n      Rita Kay Kirby worked as a housekeeper for Appellants and helped look\nafter Appellants’ children. Dukes, Kirby, and Callaway all testified that Kim\nDomel said that she had received an insurance check for $150,000 and that she was\n      5\n          Dukes previously worked for Appellants, but at the time of trial, he worked for Birdwell.\n\n                                                     5\n\fgoing to buy a new Mercedes. Dukes and Kirby said that Kim Domel had the\ncheck in her hand and made the comments in front of them while everyone was out\non the porch.\n      Gary Domel admitted that he had also made an insurance claim for water\ndamage inside the main house, but on the Notice, he indicated that there had been\nno flooding inside the structures. Gary Domel said that, in 2007 when nineteen\ninches of rain fell in a matter of hours, he had four stock tanks that were breached\nand had to be rebuilt, as did part of the high perimeter fencing. He said that he also\nlost some animals. Gary Domel admitted that there was water penetration at the\nbaseboard level of the wall studs, which happened when eaves or drains clogged\nup with leaves and caused water to come in, but he said that this was from water\n“runoff,” not a flood. Gary Domel said he did not amend the Notice because he did\nnot think of it and no one asked him to amend it. Gary Domel also said that he had\nbeen “insulted” by the $2.4 million offer on a property that had been listed at $3.2\nmillion and that he accepted the lower price only because the sale was “as is” and\nin its “present condition.” He also believed the prior flooding did not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the use of the Ranch.\n      Birdwell testified that, after he talked to Reyes and Waite, he checked with\nhis insurance company and discovered that Appellants had a prior insurance claim\nand settlement on the roofs for hail damage. Birdwell said he learned about prior\nflooding in the main and guest houses from Dukes and Callaway. Dukes said that\nthere was flooding in both the main and guest houses during a rainstorm in 2007;\nhe helped clean it up. Callaway said that, in 2007, there was a flood and that there\nwas about two inches of water on the floor of the main house and the attached\nguest house; she also helped clean up the water.\n      Birdwell said that he would have liked to have known about the roofs,\ninsurance settlement, and prior flooding beforehand and that, had he known, he\n                                          6\n\fwould not have purchased the Ranch. Birdwell said that he had trouble getting\ninsurance for the Ranch because of the condition of the roofs, that the Ranch was\nworth $280,000 less because of the damaged roofs, that he could not recoup the\nadditional $240,000 in improvements that he had made, 6 and that he planned to sell\nthe property. Birdwell said that Appellants never told him about the prior flooding,\nthe insurance settlement, or the roof damage. Birdwell said there was flooding in\nthe house after he took possession.\n        Lanier, a real estate inspector, inspected the Ranch on Birdwell’s behalf.\nLanier said that he did not get on the roofs during the first inspection and that he\nonly viewed the roofs from a ladder. Lanier testified that Gary Domel had said\nnothing about a hailstorm and had told Lanier that the roofs were fine, that they\nhad been fixed, that nothing was wrong with them, and that there was nothing to\nworry about in connection with the roofs. Lanier also said that Appellants never\nmentioned the $114,650.04 settlement check. Lanier said that Gary Domel was\nvery upset and defensive with Lanier’s property inspection reports because of the\nnumber of things that Lanier listed that needed to be repaired. Dukes said that\nGary Domel was frustrated by Lanier’s inspection. Further, Dukes testified that,\njust prior to closing, Kim Domel told Dukes and other workers not to say anything\nif they saw something wrong with the Ranch while they were cleaning it.\n        Donald Raymond Putnam, who was retained by Appellants, testified as an\nexpert on roofs and roof construction. 7 Putnam said that he inspected the roofs at\nthe Ranch and that, although the roofs had some loose screws, algae and rust, some\nminor panel kinks, oil-canning, dents, flashing problems, and a few crushed panels,\n\n        6\n         Birdwell said that, once he and his wife took possession, they removed and replaced the cabinets\nin the main house, had the entire house retextured and repainted, covered the concrete floors, and replaced\nthe window treatments—for a total renovation cost of approximately $240,000.\n        7\n         Putnam indicated that he had been paid more than $15,000 for his opinions in this case, but he\nhad not done a cost estimate on the replacement of roofs at the Ranch.\n\n                                                    7\n\fthe roofs did not need repair or replacement. Putnam said that the crushed panels\nwere not from hail and that, except for a few shallow dents, the dents did not look\nlike they were caused by hail.\n      This case was ultimately tried to a jury on breach of contract, negligent\nmisrepresentation, DTPA, and fraud claims. Several written admissions made by\nAppellants were read at trial. Appellants admitted that they were aware of a\nhailstorm that hit the Ranch after they had signed their Notice, that there were\ndamaged roof panels at the residence of the Ranch, and that they made an\ninsurance claim for damaged metal roof panels. They also admitted that the\nresidence sustained roof damage while they owned the Ranch, that there was hail\ndamage that occurred after they signed the Notice but before they closed on the\nsale of the Ranch, and that they received an insurance settlement check for a\ncovered loss for metal roof panels at the Ranch. Appellants further admitted that\nthey did not use the insurance settlement check to replace the metal roof panels on\nthe residence or complete any repairs to the metal roof panels.\n                                 II. Issues Presented\n      Appellants assert eleven issues on appeal. In their first issue, Appellants\nassert that they had no duty to update their Notice. In their second issue, they\nassert that there was factually insufficient evidence to support reliance and\ncausation. In their third issue, Appellants assert that there is no evidence of market\nvalue of the Ranch. Appellants assert in their fourth issue that the State Farm\nclaim file was improperly admitted as evidence. Appellants argue in their fifth\nissue that there was no evidence to support an award of future damages, and in\ntheir sixth issue, they complain that the award for roof replacement and future\ndamages was an impermissible double recovery. In their seventh issue, Appellants\ncomplain that attorneys’ fees are not recoverable in a negligent misrepresentation\nclaim. Appellants argue in their eighth issue that the trial court erred when it\n                                          8\n\fawarded prejudgment interest on future damages. Appellants take the position in\ntheir ninth issue that Birdwell’s tort claims are barred by the economic loss rule.\nThe basis of Appellants’ tenth issue is that that there was factually insufficient\nevidence to award damages to replace the roofs. Finally, in Appellants’ eleventh\nissue, they maintain that Birdwell’s claims for DTPA and fraud fail because they\nowed no duty to Birdwell and because there is factually insufficient evidence to\nsupport reliance and causation.\n                              III. Standard of Review\n      Appellants assert both legal and factual sufficiency challenges. When we\nconduct a legal sufficiency review, we review the evidence in a light that tends to\nsupport the disputed finding and disregard all evidence and inferences to the\ncontrary. Bradford v.

Discussion and Analysis\n      A. Issue Number I: Duty to Disclose or Update Information\n      Appellants assert in their first issue that the trial court erred in ruling that\nAppellants had a duty to update their Notice. The Seller’s Disclosure of Property\nCondition Notice is a document used to apprise a potential buyer of the condition\nof real property that is for sale. See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 5.008 (West Supp.\n2014). Section 5.008(a) of the Texas Property Code provides:\n             A seller of residential real property comprising not more than\n      one dwelling unit located in this state shall give to the purchaser of the\n      property a written notice as prescribed by this section or a written\n      notice substantially similar to the notice prescribed by this section\n      which contains, at a minimum, all of the items in the notice prescribed\n      by this section.\n\nSection 5.008(b) outlines the content that the disclosure notice must cover.\nAppellants correctly state that Section 5.008 does not create, in itself, a continuing\n\n                                         10\n\fduty or obligation to update matters within the form after the date the notice was\ncompleted.

They relisted it in April 2009. When Birdwell received the Notice in\nOctober 2009, there had been a hailstorm at the Ranch that resulted in roof and\nother damages, and Appellants had filed a hailstorm damage claim and received a\nsettlement but had not replaced the roofs. Appellants never updated the Notice or\ndisclosed any of this information to Birdwell.           Notably, Appellants had not\ninformed their broker, Waite, of the hailstorm and settlement. Appellants’ delivery\nto Birdwell of the nearly one-year-old Notice without clarification or comment was\nmisleading and left a false impression, and Appellants had a duty to correct that\nmisleading and false impression.\n          In addition, Appellants reported that there had been prior flooding at the\nRanch, but they failed to disclose that it had occurred in both the main house and in\n                                             12\n\fthe guest house. This was both an affirmative misrepresentation and a partial\ndisclosure; Appellants failed to provide the whole truth. As such, the Notice was\nboth false and misleading. In addition, there was testimony at trial from Lanier\nthat he had tried to inspect the roofs on two occasions and that Appellants had told\nhim that the roofs were fine and were not leaking. Given that the statements\ncontained in the Notice were no longer true when the Notice was given to\nBirdwell, Appellants had a common-law duty to disclose the whole truth, correct\nany misstatements or false impressions, and disclose material information—like\nthe insurance claim and payment for roof damage—that would not have been\ndiscoverable through ordinary and reasonable diligence. We overrule Appellants’\nfirst issue.\n       B. Issue Number II: Reliance and Causation\n       In their second issue, Appellants assert that there was factually insufficient\nevidence to support the jury’s findings on the elements of reliance and causation.\nThe elements of negligent misrepresentation are the following:\n       (1)     the representation is made by a defendant in the course of his\n               business, or in a transaction in which he has a pecuniary\n               interest;\n\n       (2)     the defendant supplies “false information” for the guidance of\n               others in their business;\n\n       (3)     the defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in\n               obtaining or communicating the information; and\n\n       (4)     the plaintiff suffers pecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the\n               representation.\nFed.

The seller\nhad promised to make them watertight. Id. at 881. Without that representation, the\nbuyer would not have purchased the property. Id. at 884–85. The jury found that\nthe buyer relied on the seller’s promise to repair the roofs. Id. at 884. There was\nunequivocal testimony from the buyer that he would not have gone through with\nthe purchase of the apartment complex without the agreement to make the roofs\nwatertight. Id. at 884–85. The Ferguson court held this was sufficient to prove\n\n\n                                           14\n\fthat the promise to repair the roofs was an inducing cause of the seller’s\ncompletion of the purchase. Id. at 885.\n      In this case, there was unequivocal testimony from Birdwell that he would\nnot have purchased the Ranch had he been told about the prior flooding and the\nunrepaired hail damage to the roofs. The jury found that Birdwell justifiably relied\non the representations of Appellants that (1) the roofs were fine, were not leaking,\nand needed no repair; (2) Appellants had not received an insurance claim payment\nfor hail damage to the roofs; (3) Appellants had not received any insurance claim\npayments for hail damage that had not been fully used to repair the damage; and\n(4) when Appellants disclosed the fact that certain flooding had occurred, they\nfailed to disclose that the main house and guest house also had flooded. In\naddition, it was foreseeable to Appellants that a potential buyer would want to\nknow about both of the prior instances of flooding, as well as the hail damage to\nthe buildings on the Ranch. Appellants’ misrepresentations were a substantial\nfactor or inducing cause and, thus, constitute the cause-in-fact of Birdwell’s\ndamages.\n      Appellants point to the disclaimer in the Notice and the “as is” language in\nthe contract and argue that the responsibility, and liability, for determining the\ncondition of the property lies with Birdwell. A valid “as is” agreement can prevent\na buyer from holding a seller liable if the thing sold turns out to be worth less than\nthe price paid because it is impossible for the buyer’s injury on account of this\ndisparity to have been caused by the seller.

The Prudential court\n                                          15\n\fpointed out that, in such a situation, the “as is” clause is not a shield from liability.\nId.\n      Appellants withheld the information about the insurance claim settlement\nand their failure to use it to repair or replace the roofs, which is not something that\nBirdwell would have discovered in the ordinary course of inspecting the property.\nThat is especially true when Appellants affirmatively represented that the opposite\nhad occurred: there had been no hail damage, no insurance claims or payments,\nand no damage to the roofs.         We have reviewed the record, and we cannot\nconclude that the jury’s findings—that Birdwell justifiably relied on Appellants’\nmisrepresentations and that those misrepresentations proximately caused his\ndamages—were against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. We\noverrule Appellants’ second issue.\n      C. Issue Number III: Market Value\n      Appellants assert in their third issue that, because there is no evidence of\nmarket value, the jury was not able to award damages for the difference in value\nbetween what was given and what was received. In negligent misrepresentation\ncases, two types of damages are recoverable to compensate a plaintiff for a legal\ninjury caused by the defendant’s misrepresentation:\n       (a)   the difference between the value of what he has received in the\n             transaction and its purchase price or other value given for it;\n             and\n      (b)    pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a consequence of the\n             plaintiff’s reliance upon the misrepresentation.\n\nAirborne Freight Corp. v.

App.—Austin 1991, no writ). In this case, the trial court admitted, as\nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 55, a collection of documents from a State Farm insurance claim\nfile in which the prior hail damage was noted, as well as the estimate for repair of\nthe hail damage. The exhibit also contained a copy of the check that had been\nissued in payment of the claim. The total estimated replacement cost for the roofs\nwas $139,926.83.     Appellants argue that this exhibit was hearsay and was\nimproperly admitted and resulted in an improper judgment because the jury’s\n                                        18\n\faward for roof repairs and diminution in value was the same amount as the State\nFarm estimate in the exhibit. Birdwell contends that the exhibit was admissible as\nproof that Appellants had prior knowledge of roof damage.\n      One element of negligent misrepresentation is that the defendant supplied\nfalse information for the guidance of the plaintiff in deciding whether to purchase\nthe subject property. Sloane, 825 S.W.2d at 442. The information in Plaintiff’s\nExhibit 55 was evidence of what Appellants knew about the damage to the roofs of\nthe buildings on the Ranch. In their Notice, Appellants did not disclose the prior\nhail damage; they only noted that some sheet metal screws needed to be replaced.\nThe information in the exhibit could have been used to question Appellants and to\nimpeach them, and the exhibit could have been admitted as a business record with\na sponsoring witness.\n      We note, however, that the exhibit was admitted prior to trial, as part of the\npretrial review of the exhibits, and that no sponsoring witness or affidavit was used\nto lay a business records foundation for admission. We hold that the exhibit was\ninadmissible without the business records foundation. TEX. R. EVID. 803(6); see\nGood v.

The jury also saw pictures of the hailstorm damage and heard\ntestimony about Appellants’ receipt of the insurance claim check, their failure to\nuse it to repair hailstorm roof damage, and their comments on how they intended to\nand did use the settlement funds. Furthermore, the jury heard conflicting evidence\non the condition of the roofs and the costs for repair or replacement: Appellants\ndescribed the roofs as absolutely “bulletproof” with “no damage” and no needed\nrepair, but Reyes told Birdwell that the roofs were “totaled” and needed to be\nreplaced. In light of all the evidence adduced at trial, the contents of the claim file\n                                          19\n\fwere cumulative, and any error in its admittance was harmless.

The jury saw\ndocuments in which Appellants failed to disclose both the full extent of prior\nflooding and the fact that they had received insurance payments to repair the roofs\nbut did not use the payments to complete repairs. Furthermore, the jury heard\nevidence that Birdwell intended to sell the Ranch. In addition, the jury heard\ntestimony that Birdwell paid $2.6 million for the Ranch, but Birdwell said he\nwould not have bought it had he known of the roof and flooding issues. Birdwell\nalso said that he intended to sell it, which would involve a sales transaction cost,\nsuch as a broker’s fee, on any future sale. The jury awarded $125,000 in future\ndamages.    The total broker’s fee on the sale of the Ranch to Birdwell was\n$156,000; Birdwell could expect that a similar, although smaller, fee would be\nincurred on his future sale.     After reviewing the record and indulging every\ninference in favor of the judgment, we hold that there was some evidence that\n                                          20\n\fBirdwell would incur expenses in the future when he sold the Ranch and that there\nwas also evidence of the amount of future damages.

Also, Birdwell’s damages were not limited to economic loss from the\noriginal contract. Birdwell’s damages arise not from the contract but, as we have\npreviously explained, from the common-law duty of disclosure that Appellants\nbreached when they made misleading or false representations that resulted in\n                                          23\n\fdamages independent of the sales price of the Ranch.

Birdwell did not elect to recover under the DTPA or the other theories, and\nthe final judgment did not award either current or future cost of repair for the roofs.\nThe final judgment did not include recovery under the alternate theories; Birdwell\nelected to recover under negligent misrepresentation and obtained damages under\nthat theory, including damages computed as the difference in the value received\nversus the value paid and also future damages.
