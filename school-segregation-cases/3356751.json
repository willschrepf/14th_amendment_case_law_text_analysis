However, the historical record provides some insight into the statute's meaning and purpose.</p>\n<p><h3><strong><em>B. Historical Context</em></strong></h3> <strong>1. Public Accommodations and Demonstrations</strong></p>\n<p>Civil rights demonstrations and protests preceded the enactment of major federal and State civil rights legislation, including Article 49B, during the 1960s. Many of the early protesters were inspired by religious values and were committed to non-violence. Some engaged in non-violent civil disobedience, such as sit-ins, to protest segregation laws. <em>See</em> Taylor Branch, <em>Parting the Waters: America in the King Years</em><em>1954-63</em> (1988) (\"<em>Parting the Waters</em>\") at 204-5, 272-76.</p>\n<p>Protests in the early 1960s targeted racial discrimination in public transportation and public accommodations, such as hotels and restaurants. Those engaging in the protests often received financial support from others. For example, the expenses of participants in the \"freedom rides\" protesting segregated interstate buses and bus stations in several southern states were financed in part by donations.<em>Parting the Waters</em> at 489-90.<sup id=\"ref-fn3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 156</span> </p>\n<p>Demonstrations in support of the movement to desegregate public accommodations also occurred in Maryland. After several incidents in which restaurants in Maryland refused to serve diplomats from newly independent African nations in the early 1960s, various national civil rights groups, including the organizers of the freedom rides, pressured the Maryland Governor and Legislature to enact a statewide law banning racial discrimination in public accommodations. Peter B. Levy, <em>Civil War</em><em>on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland</em> (2003) (\"<em>Civil War on Race Street</em>\") at 36. Veterans of the original freedom rides came to Maryland and focused on facilities along Route 50, particularly in the city of Cambridge. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em>\nat 38-40. In 1962, demonstrations began in Cambridge; among the leaders of those protests were students and other individuals described as \"outside agitators\" by local officials. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 40-41. At least one theater in the town reacted by enforcing a more restrictive segregation policy. In March 1963, students and others led a series of demonstrations from local churches. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 76. Crowds opposed to desegregation confronted the demonstrators and many arrests followed.</p>\n<p>By June 1963, some demonstrations were accompanied by violence. The Governor declared martial law in the town and sent in the National Guard. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 83. In a July 1963 agreement brokered by United States Attorney General Kennedy, town officials pledged to undertake various reforms, including desegregation of public accommodations, in return for a halt to demonstrations. <em>Civil War on</em><em>Race Street</em> at 86-88. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 157</span> \nHowever, a referendum at a special town election later that year repealed the local desegregation measure for public accommodations.<em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 102.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Maryland Public Accommodations Law</strong></p>\n<p>Against this background, the General Assembly dealt with the issue of desegregation of public accommodations. It passed, during its 1963 session, a public accommodations law barring discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin in hotels, restaurants, and other places of public accommodation.<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> Chapters 227, 228, Laws of Maryland 1963, <em>codified at</em> Annotated Code of Maryland, Article 49B, &#167; 11 <em>et seq.</em><sup id=\"ref-fn5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> The new law also gave certain enforcement powers to the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, the predecessor of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations.<sup id=\"ref-fn6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> <em>Id.</em> However, eleven counties, including the entire Eastern Shore, were excepted from the purview of the 1963 law and the Commission's enforcement authority.</p>\n<p>The next year, during a special session, the Legislature amended the new anti-discrimination law to eliminate the geographical exceptions and extend it statewide. Chapter 29, First Special Session, Laws of Maryland 1964. However, as the bill went through the legislative process, a provision concerning \"racial demonstrations\" was added to the bill. In particular, a new &#167; 11A, the predecessor of current &#167; 6, was added to prohibit the receipt of remuneration for participation in \"any racial demonstration.\"<sup id=\"ref-fn7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> A contemporary press account of the legislative negotiations reported that this provision was added at the request of Eastern Shore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 158</span> \nopponents of the statewide public accommodations measure as the Governor and legislative leaders sought to assemble the votes necessary for its passage. <em>See</em> C.

What the Statute Prohibits</em></strong></h3>\nThe first subsection of the statute regulates conduct; the second establishes a criminal penalty for a violation. The statute prohibits receipt of \"remuneration\" for participation in an event characterized as a \"racial demonstration.\" An understanding of the meaning of those terms is necessary to measure the statute against constitutional limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>1. \"Remuneration\"</strong></p>\n<p>The Legislature has used the word \"remuneration\" frequently in the Annotated Code, generally in contexts in which it intends to encompass not only monetary compensation, but also any type of reward or consideration paid to the party in question. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Annotated Code of Maryland, Health-General Article, &#167; <cross_reference>7-1104</cross_reference>(a) (State employee may not receive or solicit \"any remuneration\" other than State compensation for providing certain services); Insurance Article, &#167; <cross_reference>10-503</cross_reference>(b) (insurance adjuster may not accept any \"form of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 159</span> \nremuneration\" from a repair service for recommending that service to an insured); Natural Resources Article, &#167; <cross_reference>4-701</cross_reference>(i)(3)(ii) (fishing license may not be transferred \"for any type of remuneration\"); Article <cross_reference>2B, &#167; 15-112</cross_reference>(d)(6) (members and employees of Baltimore City liquor board may not receive \"any commission, remuneration or gift whatsoever\" from licensees or manufacturers of alcoholic beverages).</p>\n<p>In Article 49B, &#167; 6, the General Assembly eliminated any doubt that it was using the term in its broadest possible meaning by surrounding it w ith expansive adjectives &#8212; <em>i.e.</em>, \"<em>any</em> remuneration of <em>any kind</em><em>whatsoever</em>.\" For example, the term would clearly apply to living expenses or a stipend paid to a student or other \"outside agitator\" who visited the State to participate in a \"racial demonstration.\"</p>\n<p><strong>2. \"Racial Demonstration\"</strong></p>\n<p>The phrase \"racial demonstration\" has fallen out of use in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. An on-line search of the New York Times archive found no use of the phrase in that newspaper after 1971. However, in the early 1960s it was often used as a synonym for \"civil rights protest\" or \"civil rights demonstration\" when the focus of the demonstration or protest was racial segregation or racial discrimination. Court decisions from that period concerning civil rights protests, particularly in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, often use the phrase. <em>See, e.g., Baines v. City of</em><em>Danville</em>, <cross_reference>337 F.2d 579</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>582</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>586</cross_reference> (4<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1964) (in cases \"arising out of racial demonstrations in Danville, Virginia,\" discussing whether demonstrators had exceeded their <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment rights); <em>see also Knight v. State Board of Education</em>, <cross_reference>200 F. Supp. 174</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>181</cross_reference> (M.D.Tenn. 1961) (discussing whether plaintiff college students had been disciplined for engaging in \"racial demonstrations\" &#8212;<em>i.e</em>., freedom rides &#8212; in Mississippi).</p>\n<p>The phrase \"racial demonstration\" relates to the message that the demonstrators intended to convey, as opposed to the manner in which the demonstration was conducted or the identity of the demonstrators. As best we can determine from the contemporary sources, the phrase does not connote a violent demonstration as opposed to a peaceful one, or a demonstration at which civil disobedience was practiced as opposed to one in which the demonstrators acted entirely within the restrictions of the then-current law. Nor does it necessarily refer to the race of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 160</span> \ndemonstrators &#8212; many of the freedom riders were white.<sup id=\"ref-fn10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> Rather, it refers to the subject matter of the protest.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is a fair inference that the General Assembly used the phrase in reference to demonstrations protesting racial discrimination.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In our view, the language of the statute prohibits anyone who participates in a demonstration or protest against racial discrimination from receiving anything of value for that participation. It is evident that its purpose was to limit participation in civil rights demonstrations by individuals who might require some financial support in order to participate &#8212; <em>e.g.</em>, students and other \"outside agitators\" blamed by some for unrest accompanying some demonstrations.</p>\n<p><h3><strong><em>B. Whether the Statute is Constitutional</em></strong></h3> <strong>1. Assessment of Constitutionality in an Attorney General Opinion</strong></p>\n<p>The Committee has asked whether &#167; 6 is constitutional. In undertaking this analysis, we are mindful of the obligation of the Attorney General to defend, in litigation, the constitutionality of statutes enacted by the L egislature. <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc.</em>, <cross_reference>301 Md. 9</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>36-37</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>481 A.2d 785</cross_reference> (1984). However, we also have an obligation under Article V, &#167; 3(a)(4) of the State Constitution to respond to inquiries from the Legislature with our best legal analysis &#8212; an obligation recognized in the <em>Burning Tree</em> decision itself. <cross_reference>301 Md. at 34</cross_reference>. In the current setting where there is neither pending nor imminent litigation concerning &#167; 6, <sup id=\"ref-fn11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> we do not act as the advocate for the provision before a tribunal. Rather, we are asked by an arm of the Legislature to assess the constitutionality of its own enactments, indulging all of the presumptions in favor of, and against, the statute that a court would consider. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 161</span> </p>\n<p>In that regard, &#167; 6 is to be given the benefit of the doubt. There is a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute, <sup id=\"ref-fn12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup> and statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional defects. <em>In re</em><em>Roberto d.B.</em>, 399 M d. 267, 283-84, <cross_reference>923 A.2d 115</cross_reference> (2007). How ever, the canons of statutory construction do not authorize a court, or an opinion of the Attorney General, to rewrite a statute to make it constitutional. Accordingly, any construction of the statute must be reasonable in light of its language and underlying purpose. <em>Davis v. State</em>, <cross_reference>294 Md. 370</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>377-78</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>451 A.2d 107</cross_reference> (1982).</p>\n<p>Of course, even if we conclude that the statute is constitutionally deficient, an Attorney General opinion cannot itself invalidate an act of the General Assembly. <em>Burning Tree</em>, <cross_reference>301 Md. at 36</cross_reference>. However, as the legal counsel for the State, we advise our clients, particularly those who have sworn to uphold the federal and State constitutions, <sup id=\"ref-fn13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup> to administer statutes in compliance with constitutional provisions.<em>See, e.g.</em>, 71 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General</em> 266 (1986) (debarment statute unconstitutional and unenforceable in light of Supreme Court decision concerning similar statute); 62 <em>Opinions of the Attorney</em><em>General</em> 227 (1977) (provision of budget bill restricting State employee speech was unconstitutional and should not be implemented); 56<em>Opinions of the Attorney General</em> 25 (1971) (recommending that the General Assembly amend the Maryland Constitution to delete a provision prohibiting ministers or preachers from serving in Legislature as the provision was invalid under <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendments of the federal constitution); 46 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General</em> 51 (1961) (statutes requiring segregation of three juvenile reform schools should not be implemented in light of Court of Appeals decision holding that segregation pursuant to a different statute at a fourth institution was unconstitutional). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 162</span> \n <strong>2. Freedoms of Speech and Association</strong></p>\n<p>As outlined above, Article 49B, &#167; 6, essentially criminalizes the receipt of funds &#8212; or other remuneration &#8212; by an individual for that individual's participation in a civil rights demonstration. While the action regulated by the statute is the payment of funds or other remuneration, its stated purpose is to restrict that activity only in connection with a particular form of expressive activity &#8212; a demonstration against racial discrimination or, in the parlance of the 1960s, a \"racial demonstration.\"</p>\n<p>The statute must be assessed against the constitutional provisions that protect the freedoms of speech and association. Those rights are based on the <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as Article <cross_reference>40</cross_reference> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<sup id=\"ref-fn14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14</a></sup> Organized expression of views on public issues is on the \"highest rung of . . .<cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment values.\" <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.</em>, <cross_reference>458 U.S. 886</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>913</cross_reference> (1982). Nevertheless, the government may regulate that right if it has \"a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.\" <em>Buckley v.</em><em>Valeo</em>, <cross_reference>424 U.S. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>25</cross_reference> (1976). A statute that is not narrowly tailored and that includes a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct within its prohibition may be struck down on the basis of overbreadth and vagueness.<sup id=\"ref-fn15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15</a></sup> <em>See United States v. Williams</em>, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 163</span> \n1830, 1838, 1845 (2008); <em>Cox v. Louisiana</em>, <cross_reference>379 U.S. 536</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>551-52</cross_reference> (1965);<em>NAACP v. Button</em>, <cross_reference>371 U.S. 415</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>432-33</cross_reference> (1963).</p>\n<p><strong>3. <em>Brookins</em></strong></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals recently assessed the constitutionality of a State statute of similar vintage that criminalized the payment of compensation for participation in speech-related activities. <em>State v.</em><em>Brookins</em>, <cross_reference>380 Md. 345</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>844 A.2d 1162</cross_reference> (2004). That case concerned a statute, most recently codified at Annotated Code of Maryland, Election Law Article (\"EL\"), &#167; 13-245, that prohibited candidates, political committees, political parties, and others from paying \"any sum of money or thing of value\" for \"walk around services\" on election day. The statute defined \"walk around services\" to include such activities as distributing campaign material, electioneering or canvassing, and communicating a voting preference. EL &#167; <cross_reference>13-245</cross_reference>(a). Certain types of payments were excepted from the prohibition, including salaries of campaign personnel, the cost of transporting voters to polling places, meals served to campaign workers, and similar items. EL &#167; <cross_reference>13-245</cross_reference>(b).</p>\n<p><em>Brookins</em> arose out of a criminal prosecution of several individuals who had paid college students and residents of homeless shelters to provide \"walk around services\" on election day in 2002, including the distribution of campaign materials and electioneering with voters near polling places. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, challenging the constitutionality of the statute under both the<cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article <cross_reference>40</cross_reference> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The circuit court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the statute was facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals analyzed the arguments under the federal and State constitutional provisions as a single issue. 380 M d. at 350 n. 2.<sup id=\"ref-fn16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16</a></sup> The Court first observed that, under Supreme Court precedents, a law that burdens \"core political speech\" is subject to \"exacting scrutiny\" and may be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an important State interest. <cross_reference>380 Md. at 355</cross_reference>. The Court described in detail several Supreme Court decisions striking down restrictions on campaign expenditures and similar payments on <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment grounds.<em>See, e.g., Meyer v. Grant</em>, <cross_reference>486 U.S. 414</cross_reference> (1988) (holding that state statute that prohibited compensation of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 164</span> \npetition circulators violated <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment);<sup id=\"ref-fn17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17</a></sup> <em>Buckley v.</em><em>Valeo</em>, <cross_reference>424 U.S. 1</cross_reference> (1976) (striking down federal restrictions on campaign expenditures).</p>\n<p>In defending the statute, the State argued that the statute was directed not at political speech itself, but at the potentially corrupt use of money to influence an election and that, to the extent it affected speech, the statute was content-neutral. The State also argued that the statute was narrowly focused on payments for very specific electioneering activities on a single day &#8212; election day. <em>Id.</em> at 360-61, 370-71.</p>\n<p>The Court held that the statute regulated speech and found none of the State's arguments sufficiently compelling to save the statute. In rejecting the argument that the statute did not regulate speech <em>per</em><em>se</em>, the Court observed that the Supreme Court had applied a stricter standard to regulation of campaign expenditures as opposed to regulation of campaign contributions. <cross_reference>380 Md. at 361-68</cross_reference>. It noted that, as in<em>Buckley</em>, the statutory restriction on payments for \"walk around services\" directly affected a candidate's ability to disseminate a political message, as those activities were part of conveying that message. <em>Id.</em> at 368-69. The Court also rejected the State's argument that the statute was content-neutral, noting that the Supreme Court has stated that \"the <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to a restriction on a particular viewpoint, but also to a prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.\" <cross_reference>380 Md. at 369</cross_reference>\n(<em>quoting Burson v. Freeman</em>, <cross_reference>504 U.S. 191</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>197</cross_reference> (1992)).</p>\n<p>The Court stated that there was no showing that the statute was necessary to accomplish the goal of reducing corruption, and cited other statutes that directly prohibit vote-buying, attempts to influence voters through the use of force or other improper means, and interference with the balloting process. <em>Id.</em> at 373-74. The Court concluded that \"[t]he State's asserted goal of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption does not rise to the level of a compelling state interest in light of the fact that the measure `restricts access to the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse, direct one-on-one communication.'\" <em>Id.</em> at 375-76 (quoting <em>Meyer v. Grant</em>). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 165</span> \n <strong>4. Application to &#167; 6</strong></p>\n<p>As noted above, while &#167; 6 literally prohibits certain payments, like the statute in <em>Brookins</em>, it concerns payments only for certain types of expressive activity &#8212; \"racial demonstrations.\" Thus, like the statute barring payments for \"walk around services,\" it indirectly regulates speech. But it is even more difficult than in <em>Brookins</em> to argue that the restriction on speech in &#167; 6 is content-neutral. While the restrictions on payments for \"walk around services\" applied to all candidates and political parties, regardless of their point of view, &#167; 6 targets demonstrations protesting racial discrimination. There is no similar prohibition on receiving remuneration for participation in a demonstration for or against a war, abortion, other forms of discrimination, or other issues of public policy.</p>\n<p>It might be argued that &#167; 6 was designed not to limit the participation of those who wish to express a particular point of view, but simply to eliminate those who participate in a demonstration for profit without any true interest in the issue of racial discrimination. Assuming that the statutory language could be parsed to reach such a conclusion and that a category of mercenary protesters could be identified, enforcement of the statute would still violate the<cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment. In <em>Meyer</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Supreme Court struck down a statute in a case involving the hiring of petition circulators by proponents of a possible ballot measure; in <em>Brookins</em>, the statute was held unconstitutional when payments were made to residents of an out-of-state homeless shelter recruited to electioneer with voters.</p>\n<p>It might also be urged that &#167; 6 was a prophylactic measure designed to prevent demonstrations that would result in violence or other violations of the law. However, the language of &#167; 6 makes no distinction as to whether the forbidden remuneration is for participation in an entirely lawful demonstration, a protest involving civil disobedience, or one accompanied by violent activity. Nor does it target any particular type of participation &#8212; it covers peaceful presence as well as incitement to violence. As noted above, it would encompass financing the transportation expenses of someone who travels to participate peaceably in a civil rights march. Nor is there any apparent way to limit the reach of the statute by its historical context. In the parlance of the early 1960s, a \"racial demonstration\" could be, and generally was, an entirely lawful activity in which the participants expressed their common political and moral views. The broad reach of the statute not only undermines any argument that it is narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest; it also demonstrates that the statute is fatally overbroad. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 166</span> \nThere is simply no way to parse the broad language of this statute to limit its application to situations in which the compensated \"participation\" is not protected speech. Accordingly, in our view, &#167; 6 cannot be enforced consistently with the <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article <cross_reference>40</cross_reference> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Severability</strong></p>\n<p>In light of our conclusion that &#167; 6 is unconstitutional, we discuss briefly whether the invalidity of &#167; 6 would call into question the validity of the rest of the 1964 act, including the statewide public accommodations law. In other words, is the current &#167; 6 severable from the remainder of the public accommodations law? In our view, the provision is severable.</p>\n<p>At the time &#167; 6 was originally enacted, as now, the courts did not generally invalidate an entire act when a portion of the act was held unconstitutional or preempted by other law. <em>See, e.g., City of Baltimore</em><em>v.

The Legislature has amended and reenacted the public accommodations statute on numerous occasions since 1964. For example, it has reenacted the public accommodations law to expand the types of prohibited discrimination, without making similar changes to &#167; 6.

However, the historical record provides some insight into the statute's meaning and purpose.</p>\n<p><h3><strong><em>B. Historical Context</em></strong></h3> <strong>1. Public Accommodations and Demonstrations</strong></p>\n<p>Civil rights demonstrations and protests preceded the enactment of major federal and State civil rights legislation, including Article 49B, during the 1960s. Many of the early protesters were inspired by religious values and were committed to non-violence. Some engaged in non-violent civil disobedience, such as sit-ins, to protest segregation laws. <em>See</em> Taylor Branch, <em>Parting the Waters: America in the King Years</em><em>1954-63</em> (1988) (\"<em>Parting the Waters</em>\") at 204-5, 272-76.</p>\n<p>Protests in the early 1960s targeted racial discrimination in public transportation and public accommodations, such as hotels and restaurants. Those engaging in the protests often received financial support from others. For example, the expenses of participants in the \"freedom rides\" protesting segregated interstate buses and bus stations in several southern states were financed in part by donations.<em>Parting the Waters</em> at 489-90.<sup id=\"ref-fn3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 156</span> </p>\n<p>Demonstrations in support of the movement to desegregate public accommodations also occurred in Maryland. After several incidents in which restaurants in Maryland refused to serve diplomats from newly independent African nations in the early 1960s, various national civil rights groups, including the organizers of the freedom rides, pressured the Maryland Governor and Legislature to enact a statewide law banning racial discrimination in public accommodations. Peter B. Levy, <em>Civil War</em><em>on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland</em> (2003) (\"<em>Civil War on Race Street</em>\") at 36. Veterans of the original freedom rides came to Maryland and focused on facilities along Route 50, particularly in the city of Cambridge. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em>\nat 38-40. In 1962, demonstrations began in Cambridge; among the leaders of those protests were students and other individuals described as \"outside agitators\" by local officials. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 40-41. At least one theater in the town reacted by enforcing a more restrictive segregation policy. In March 1963, students and others led a series of demonstrations from local churches. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 76. Crowds opposed to desegregation confronted the demonstrators and many arrests followed.</p>\n<p>By June 1963, some demonstrations were accompanied by violence. The Governor declared martial law in the town and sent in the National Guard. <em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 83. In a July 1963 agreement brokered by United States Attorney General Kennedy, town officials pledged to undertake various reforms, including desegregation of public accommodations, in return for a halt to demonstrations. <em>Civil War on</em><em>Race Street</em> at 86-88. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 157</span> \nHowever, a referendum at a special town election later that year repealed the local desegregation measure for public accommodations.<em>Civil War on Race Street</em> at 102.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Maryland Public Accommodations Law</strong></p>\n<p>Against this background, the General Assembly dealt with the issue of desegregation of public accommodations. It passed, during its 1963 session, a public accommodations law barring discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin in hotels, restaurants, and other places of public accommodation.<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> Chapters 227, 228, Laws of Maryland 1963, <em>codified at</em> Annotated Code of Maryland, Article 49B, &#167; 11 <em>et seq.</em><sup id=\"ref-fn5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> The new law also gave certain enforcement powers to the Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, the predecessor of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations.<sup id=\"ref-fn6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> <em>Id.</em> However, eleven counties, including the entire Eastern Shore, were excepted from the purview of the 1963 law and the Commission's enforcement authority.</p>\n<p>The next year, during a special session, the Legislature amended the new anti-discrimination law to eliminate the geographical exceptions and extend it statewide. Chapter 29, First Special Session, Laws of Maryland 1964. However, as the bill went through the legislative process, a provision concerning \"racial demonstrations\" was added to the bill. In particular, a new &#167; 11A, the predecessor of current &#167; 6, was added to prohibit the receipt of remuneration for participation in \"any racial demonstration.\"<sup id=\"ref-fn7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> A contemporary press account of the legislative negotiations reported that this provision was added at the request of Eastern Shore <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 158</span> \nopponents of the statewide public accommodations measure as the Governor and legislative leaders sought to assemble the votes necessary for its passage. <em>See</em> C.

What the Statute Prohibits</em></strong></h3>\nThe first subsection of the statute regulates conduct; the second establishes a criminal penalty for a violation. The statute prohibits receipt of \"remuneration\" for participation in an event characterized as a \"racial demonstration.\" An understanding of the meaning of those terms is necessary to measure the statute against constitutional limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>1. \"Remuneration\"</strong></p>\n<p>The Legislature has used the word \"remuneration\" frequently in the Annotated Code, generally in contexts in which it intends to encompass not only monetary compensation, but also any type of reward or consideration paid to the party in question. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Annotated Code of Maryland, Health-General Article, &#167; <cross_reference>7-1104</cross_reference>(a) (State employee may not receive or solicit \"any remuneration\" other than State compensation for providing certain services); Insurance Article, &#167; <cross_reference>10-503</cross_reference>(b) (insurance adjuster may not accept any \"form of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 159</span> \nremuneration\" from a repair service for recommending that service to an insured); Natural Resources Article, &#167; <cross_reference>4-701</cross_reference>(i)(3)(ii) (fishing license may not be transferred \"for any type of remuneration\"); Article <cross_reference>2B, &#167; 15-112</cross_reference>(d)(6) (members and employees of Baltimore City liquor board may not receive \"any commission, remuneration or gift whatsoever\" from licensees or manufacturers of alcoholic beverages).</p>\n<p>In Article 49B, &#167; 6, the General Assembly eliminated any doubt that it was using the term in its broadest possible meaning by surrounding it w ith expansive adjectives &#8212; <em>i.e.</em>, \"<em>any</em> remuneration of <em>any kind</em><em>whatsoever</em>.\" For example, the term would clearly apply to living expenses or a stipend paid to a student or other \"outside agitator\" who visited the State to participate in a \"racial demonstration.\"</p>\n<p><strong>2. \"Racial Demonstration\"</strong></p>\n<p>The phrase \"racial demonstration\" has fallen out of use in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. An on-line search of the New York Times archive found no use of the phrase in that newspaper after 1971. However, in the early 1960s it was often used as a synonym for \"civil rights protest\" or \"civil rights demonstration\" when the focus of the demonstration or protest was racial segregation or racial discrimination. Court decisions from that period concerning civil rights protests, particularly in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, often use the phrase. <em>See, e.g., Baines v. City of</em><em>Danville</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"265712\"><a href=\"/opinion/265712/bruce-baines-v-city-of-damville-virginia-the-rev-lendell-w-chase-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>582</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>586</cross_reference> (4<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1964) (in cases \"arising out of racial demonstrations in Danville, Virginia,\" discussing whether demonstrators had exceeded their <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment rights); <em>see also Knight v. State Board of Education</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1404815\"><a href=\"/opinion/1404815/knight-v-state-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As best we can determine from the contemporary sources, the phrase does not connote a violent demonstration as opposed to a peaceful one, or a demonstration at which civil disobedience was practiced as opposed to one in which the demonstrators acted entirely within the restrictions of the then-current law. Nor does it necessarily refer to the race of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 160</span> \ndemonstrators &#8212; many of the freedom riders were white.<sup id=\"ref-fn10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> Rather, it refers to the subject matter of the protest.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is a fair inference that the General Assembly used the phrase in reference to demonstrations protesting racial discrimination.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In our view, the language of the statute prohibits anyone who participates in a demonstration or protest against racial discrimination from receiving anything of value for that participation. It is evident that its purpose was to limit participation in civil rights demonstrations by individuals who might require some financial support in order to participate &#8212; <em>e.g.</em>, students and other \"outside agitators\" blamed by some for unrest accompanying some demonstrations.</p>\n<p><h3><strong><em>B. Whether the Statute is Constitutional</em></strong></h3> <strong>1. Assessment of Constitutionality in an Attorney General Opinion</strong></p>\n<p>The Committee has asked whether &#167; 6 is constitutional. In undertaking this analysis, we are mindful of the obligation of the Attorney General to defend, in litigation, the constitutionality of statutes enacted by the L egislature. <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc.</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008869\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008869/state-v-burning-tree-club/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>36-37</cross_reference>,<cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008869\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008869/state-v-burning-tree-club/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1984). However, we also have an obligation under Article V, &#167; 3(a)(4) of the State Constitution to respond to inquiries from the Legislature with our best legal analysis &#8212; an obligation recognized in the <em>Burning Tree</em> decision itself. <cross_reference>301 Md. at 34</cross_reference>. In the current setting where there is neither pending nor imminent litigation concerning &#167; 6, <sup id=\"ref-fn11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> we do not act as the advocate for the provision before a tribunal. Rather, we are asked by an arm of the Legislature to assess the constitutionality of its own enactments, indulging all of the presumptions in favor of, and against, the statute that a court would consider. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 161</span> </p>\n<p>In that regard, &#167; 6 is to be given the benefit of the doubt. There is a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute, <sup id=\"ref-fn12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup> and statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional defects. <em>In re</em><em>Roberto d.B.</em>, 399 M d. 267, 283-84, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2320973\"><a href=\"/opinion/2320973/in-re-roberto-db/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span></cross_reference> (2007). How ever, the canons of statutory construction do not authorize a court, or an opinion of the Attorney General, to rewrite a statute to make it constitutional. Accordingly, any construction of the statute must be reasonable in light of its language and underlying purpose. <em>Davis v. State</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314766\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314766/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span></cross_reference>,<cross_reference>377-78</cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314766\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314766/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1982).</p>\n<p>Of course, even if we conclude that the statute is constitutionally deficient, an Attorney General opinion cannot itself invalidate an act of the General Assembly. <em>Burning Tree</em>, <cross_reference>301 Md. at 36</cross_reference>. However, as the legal counsel for the State, we advise our clients, particularly those who have sworn to uphold the federal and State constitutions, <sup id=\"ref-fn13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup> to administer statutes in compliance with constitutional provisions.<em>See, e.g.</em>, 71 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General</em> 266 (1986) (debarment statute unconstitutional and unenforceable in light of Supreme Court decision concerning similar statute); 62 <em>Opinions of the Attorney</em><em>General</em> 227 (1977) (provision of budget bill restricting State employee speech was unconstitutional and should not be implemented); 56<em>Opinions of the Attorney General</em> 25 (1971) (recommending that the General Assembly amend the Maryland Constitution to delete a provision prohibiting ministers or preachers from serving in Legislature as the provision was invalid under <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendments of the federal constitution); 46 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General</em> 51 (1961) (statutes requiring segregation of three juvenile reform schools should not be implemented in light of Court of Appeals decision holding that segregation pursuant to a different statute at a fourth institution was unconstitutional). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 162</span> \n <strong>2. Freedoms of Speech and Association</strong></p>\n<p>As outlined above, Article 49B, &#167; 6, essentially criminalizes the receipt of funds &#8212; or other remuneration &#8212; by an individual for that individual's participation in a civil rights demonstration.

That case concerned a statute, most recently codified at Annotated Code of Maryland, Election Law Article (\"EL\"), &#167; 13-245, that prohibited candidates, political committees, political parties, and others from paying \"any sum of money or thing of value\" for \"walk around services\" on election day. The statute defined \"walk around services\" to include such activities as distributing campaign material, electioneering or canvassing, and communicating a voting preference. EL &#167; <cross_reference>13-245</cross_reference>(a). Certain types of payments were excepted from the prohibition, including salaries of campaign personnel, the cost of transporting voters to polling places, meals served to campaign workers, and similar items. EL &#167; <cross_reference>13-245</cross_reference>(b).</p>\n<p><em>Brookins</em> arose out of a criminal prosecution of several individuals who had paid college students and residents of homeless shelters to provide \"walk around services\" on election day in 2002, including the distribution of campaign materials and electioneering with voters near polling places. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, challenging the constitutionality of the statute under both the<cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article <cross_reference>40</cross_reference> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The circuit court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the statute was facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals analyzed the arguments under the federal and State constitutional provisions as a single issue. 380 M d. at 350 n. 2.<sup id=\"ref-fn16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16</a></sup> The Court first observed that, under Supreme Court precedents, a law that burdens \"core political speech\" is subject to \"exacting scrutiny\" and may be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an important State interest. <cross_reference>380 Md. at 355</cross_reference>. The Court described in detail several Supreme Court decisions striking down restrictions on campaign expenditures and similar payments on <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment grounds.<em>See, e.g., Meyer v.

The State also argued that the statute was narrowly focused on payments for very specific electioneering activities on a single day &#8212; election day. <em>Id.</em> at 360-61, 370-71.</p>\n<p>The Court held that the statute regulated speech and found none of the State's arguments sufficiently compelling to save the statute. In rejecting the argument that the statute did not regulate speech <em>per</em><em>se</em>, the Court observed that the Supreme Court had applied a stricter standard to regulation of campaign expenditures as opposed to regulation of campaign contributions. <cross_reference>380 Md. at 361-68</cross_reference>. It noted that, as in<em>Buckley</em>, the statutory restriction on payments for \"walk around services\" directly affected a candidate's ability to disseminate a political message, as those activities were part of conveying that message. <em>Id.</em> at 368-69. The Court also rejected the State's argument that the statute was content-neutral, noting that the Supreme Court has stated that \"the <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to a restriction on a particular viewpoint, but also to a prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.\" <cross_reference>380 Md. at 369</cross_reference>\n(<em>quoting Burson v. Freeman</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112736\"><a href=\"/opinion/112736/burson-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>197</cross_reference> (1992)).</p>\n<p>The Court stated that there was no showing that the statute was necessary to accomplish the goal of reducing corruption, and cited other statutes that directly prohibit vote-buying, attempts to influence voters through the use of force or other improper means, and interference with the balloting process. <em>Id.</em> at 373-74. The Court concluded that \"[t]he State's asserted goal of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption does not rise to the level of a compelling state interest in light of the fact that the measure `restricts access to the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse, direct one-on-one communication.'\" <em>Id.</em> at 375-76 (quoting <em>Meyer v. Grant</em>). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 165</span> \n <strong>4. Application to &#167; 6</strong></p>\n<p>As noted above, while &#167; 6 literally prohibits certain payments, like the statute in <em>Brookins</em>, it concerns payments only for certain types of expressive activity &#8212; \"racial demonstrations.\" Thus, like the statute barring payments for \"walk around services,\" it indirectly regulates speech. But it is even more difficult than in <em>Brookins</em> to argue that the restriction on speech in &#167; 6 is content-neutral. While the restrictions on payments for \"walk around services\" applied to all candidates and political parties, regardless of their point of view, &#167; 6 targets demonstrations protesting racial discrimination. There is no similar prohibition on receiving remuneration for participation in a demonstration for or against a war, abortion, other forms of discrimination, or other issues of public policy.</p>\n<p>It might be argued that &#167; 6 was designed not to limit the participation of those who wish to express a particular point of view, but simply to eliminate those who participate in a demonstration for profit without any true interest in the issue of racial discrimination. Assuming that the statutory language could be parsed to reach such a conclusion and that a category of mercenary protesters could be identified, enforcement of the statute would still violate the<cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment. In <em>Meyer</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Supreme Court struck down a statute in a case involving the hiring of petition circulators by proponents of a possible ballot measure; in <em>Brookins</em>, the statute was held unconstitutional when payments were made to residents of an out-of-state homeless shelter recruited to electioneer with voters.</p>\n<p>It might also be urged that &#167; 6 was a prophylactic measure designed to prevent demonstrations that would result in violence or other violations of the law. However, the language of &#167; 6 makes no distinction as to whether the forbidden remuneration is for participation in an entirely lawful demonstration, a protest involving civil disobedience, or one accompanied by violent activity. Nor does it target any particular type of participation &#8212; it covers peaceful presence as well as incitement to violence. As noted above, it would encompass financing the transportation expenses of someone who travels to participate peaceably in a civil rights march. Nor is there any apparent way to limit the reach of the statute by its historical context. In the parlance of the early 1960s, a \"racial demonstration\" could be, and generally was, an entirely lawful activity in which the participants expressed their common political and moral views. The broad reach of the statute not only undermines any argument that it is narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest; it also demonstrates that the statute is fatally overbroad. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 166</span> \nThere is simply no way to parse the broad language of this statute to limit its application to situations in which the compensated \"participation\" is not protected speech. Accordingly, in our view, &#167; 6 cannot be enforced consistently with the <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article <cross_reference>40</cross_reference> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Severability</strong></p>\n<p>In light of our conclusion that &#167; 6 is unconstitutional, we discuss briefly whether the invalidity of &#167; 6 would call into question the validity of the rest of the 1964 act, including the statewide public accommodations law. In other words, is the current &#167; 6 severable from the remainder of the public accommodations law? In our view, the provision is severable.</p>\n<p>At the time &#167; 6 was originally enacted, as now, the courts did not generally invalidate an entire act when a portion of the act was held unconstitutional or preempted by other law. <em>See, e.g., City of Baltimore</em><em>v. Stuyvesant Insurance Co.</em>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2204144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2204144/baltimore-city-v-stuyvesant-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>390-93</cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2204144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2204144/baltimore-city-v-stuyvesant-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span></cross_reference> (1961). Rather, the courts generally looked to whether the remaining valid provisions alone were incomplete or incapable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent &#8212; an approach that was codified in statute in 1973. <em>See</em> Annotated Code of Maryland, Article <cross_reference>1, &#167; 23</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>In this instance, &#167; 6 does not relate directly to the enforcement of the statewide public accommodations law, as it regulates a category of public events rather than a category of accommodations; the public accommodations law functions independently of &#167; 6. While the inclusion of &#167; 6 in the 1964 act may have been important to the passage of that law, the provisions have not been linked in subsequent legislation reaffirming the anti-discrimination measure. The Legislature has amended and reenacted the public accommodations statute on numerous occasions since 1964. For example, it has reenacted the public accommodations law to expand the types of prohibited discrimination, without making similar changes to &#167; 6. It is evident that, whatever purpose &#167; 6 served in the original passage of the public accommodations law, the legislative intent underlying the subsequent reenactments of the antidiscrimination law would require that &#167; 6 be severed.<sup id=\"ref-fn18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18</a></sup> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 167</span> </p>\n<p><center>                                   <strong>III</strong></center><center>                               <strong>Conclusion</strong></center>\nIn our opinion, a court would likely hold that an attempt to enforce Article 49B, &#167; 6, would violate the <cross_reference>First</cross_reference> Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as Article <cross_reference>40</cross_reference> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.
