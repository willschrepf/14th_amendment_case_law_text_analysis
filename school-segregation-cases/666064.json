UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 11–345.      Argued October 10, 2012—Decided June 24, 2013\nThe University of Texas at Austin considers race as one of various fac-\n  tors in its undergraduate admissions process. The University, which\n  is committed to increasing racial minority enrollment, adopted its\n  current program after this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\n  U. S. 306, upholding the use of race as one of many “plus factors” in\n  an admissions program that considered the overall individual contri-\n  bution of each candidate, and decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n  244, holding unconstitutional an admissions program that automati-\n  cally awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.\n     Petitioner, who is Caucasian, was rejected for admission to the\n  University’s 2008 entering class. She sued the University and school\n  officials, alleging that the University’s consideration of race in admis-\n  sions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment to the University. Affirming, the Fifth\n  Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial defer-\n  ence to the University, both in the definition of the compelling inter-\n  est in diversity’s benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan\n  was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal. Applying that\n  standard, the court upheld the University’s admissions plan.\nHeld: Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the de-\n manding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents\n of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, its decision affirming the Dis-\n trict Court’s grant of summary judgment to the University was incor-\n rect. Pp. 5–13.\n    (a) Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question\n considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n In Bakke’s principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state\n university “decisions based on race or ethnic origin . . . are reviewable\n\f2           FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    under the Fourteenth Amendment,” 438 U. S., at 287, using a strict\n    scrutiny standard, id., at 299. He identified as a compelling interest\n    that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educa-\n    tional benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that\n    this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array “of qualifica-\n    tions and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a sin-\n    gle though important element.” Id., at 315\n       In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing\n    that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial\n    review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e.,\n    a university must clearly demonstrate that its “ ‘purpose or interest is\n    both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of\n    the classification is “necessary . . . to the accomplishment” of its pur-\n    pose,’ ” Bakke, supra, at 305. Additional guidance may be found in\n    the Court’s broader equal protection jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rice v.\n    Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 517; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.\n    469, 505. Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the gov-\n    ernment bears the burden to prove “ ‘that the reasons for any [racial]\n    classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.’ ”\n    Ibid. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admis-\n    sions program using racial categories or classifications. A court may\n    give some deference to a university’s “judgment that such diversity is\n    essential to its educational mission,” 539 U. S., at 328, provided that\n    diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a rea-\n    soned, principled explanation for the academic decision. On this\n    point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for\n    deference to the University’s experience and expertise about its edu-\n    cational mission. However, once the University has established that\n    its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University\n    must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are nar-\n    rowly tailored to its goal. On this point, the University receives no\n    deference. Id., at 333. It is at all times the University’s obligation to\n    demonstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that admis-\n    sions processes “ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an indi-\n    vidual and not in a way that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity\n    the defining feature of his or her application.” Id., at 337. Narrow\n    tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is “neces-\n    sary” for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits\n    of diversity. Bakke, supra, at 305. The reviewing court must ulti-\n    mately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would\n    produce the educational benefits of diversity.\n       Rather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit\n    held petitioner could challenge only whether the University’s decision\n\f                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to use race as an admissions factor “was made in good faith.” It pre-\n  sumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the\n  burden of rebutting that presumption. It thus undertook the narrow-\n  tailoring requirement with a “degree of deference” to the school.\n  These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grut-\n  ter’s command that “all racial classifications imposed by government\n  ‘must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539\n  U. S., at 326. Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a\n  school’s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissi-\n  ble way without closely examining how the process works in practice,\n  yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The\n  Court vacates the Fifth Circuit’s judgment. But fairness to the liti-\n  gants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded\n  so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a\n  correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the\n  University’s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess\n  whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that\n  its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational\n  benefits of diversity.

It refers\nto this goal as a “critical mass.” Petitioner, who is Cauca-\nsian, sued the University after her application was re-\njected. She contends that the University’s use of race in\nthe admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   The parties asked the Court to review whether the\njudgment below was consistent with “this Court’s deci-\nsions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU. S. 306 (2003).” Pet. for Cert. i. The Court concludes\nthat the Court of Appeals did not hold the University\nto the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated\nin Grutter and Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S.\n265, 305 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Because the Court\nof Appeals did not apply the correct standard of strict\n\f2       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscrutiny, its decision affirming the District Court’s grant\nof summary judgment to the University was incorrect.\nThat decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Located in Austin, Texas, on the most renowned campus\nof the Texas state university system, the University is one\nof the leading institutions of higher education in the Na-\ntion. Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when\npetitioner sought admission to the University’s entering\nclass, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group\n12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.\nPetitioner was denied admission.\n   In recent years the University has used three different\nprograms to evaluate candidates for admission. The first\nis the program it used for some years before 1997, when\nthe University considered two factors: a numerical score\nreflecting an applicant’s test scores and academic perform-\nance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the\napplicant’s race. In 1996, this system was held unconsti-\ntutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit. It ruled the University’s consideration of\nrace violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did\nnot further any compelling government interest. Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932, 955 (1996).\n   The second program was adopted to comply with the\nHopwood decision. The University stopped considering\nrace in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic\nmetric of a candidate’s potential contribution to the Uni-\nversity, to be used in conjunction with the Academic In-\ndex. This “Personal Achievement Index” (PAI) measures a\nstudent’s leadership and work experience, awards, extra-\ncurricular activities, community service, and other special\ncircumstances that give insight into a student’s back-\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nground. These included growing up in a single-parent\nhome, speaking a language other than English at home,\nsignificant family responsibilities assumed by the appli-\ncant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the stu-\ndent’s family. Seeking to address the decline in minority\nenrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded\nits outreach programs.\n   The Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop­\nwood decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top\nTen Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803\n(West 2009). Also referred to as H. B. 588, the Top\nTen Percent Law grants automatic admission to any pub-\nlic state college, including the University, to all students\nin the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas\nthat comply with certain standards.\n   The University’s revised admissions process, coupled\nwith the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.\nBefore the admissions program at issue in this case, in the\nlast year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did\nnot consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-\nAmerican and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with\nthe 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when\nrace was explicitly considered, and the University’s enter-\ning freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5%\nHispanic.\n   Following this Court’s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger,\nsupra, and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), the\nUniversity adopted a third admissions program, the 2004\nprogram in which the University reverted to explicit con-\nsideration of race. This is the program here at issue. In\nGrutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many\n“plus factors” in an admissions program that considered\nthe overall individual contribution of each candidate. In\nGratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michi-\ngan’s undergraduate admissions program, which automat-\n\f4       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nically awarded points to applicants from certain racial\nminorities.\n   The University’s plan to resume race-conscious admis-\nsions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an in-\nternal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and\nEthnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The\nProposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset\nof undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24\nstudents. It showed that few of these classes had signifi-\ncant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addi-\ntion the Proposal relied on what it called “anecdotal”\nreports from students regarding their “interaction in the\nclassroom.” The Proposal concluded that the University\nlacked a “critical mass” of minority students and that to\nremedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit\nconsideration to race in the undergraduate admissions\nprogram.\n   To implement the Proposal the University included a\nstudent’s race as a component of the PAI score, begin-\nning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University\nasks students to classify themselves from among five\npredefined racial categories on the application. Race is not\nassigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed\nthat race is a meaningful factor.\n   Once applications have been scored, they are plotted\non a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the\nPersonal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid\nstudents are assigned to so-called cells based on their\nindividual scores. All students in the cells falling above a\ncertain line are admitted. All students below the line are\nnot. Each college—such as Liberal Arts or Engineering—\nadmits students separately. So a student is considered\ninitially for her first-choice college, then for her second\nchoice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared\nmajor.\n   Petitioner applied for admission to the University’s 2008\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

She sued the University\nand various University officials in the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged\nthat the University’s consideration of race in admissions\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. The parties cross-\nmoved for summary judgment. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment to the University. The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. It held\nthat Grutter required courts to give substantial deference\nto the University, both in the definition of the compelling\ninterest in diversity’s benefits and in deciding whether its\nspecific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated\ngoal. Applying that standard, the court upheld the Uni-\nversity’s admissions plan. 631 F. 3d 213, 217–218 (2011).\n   Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals\ndenied petitioner’s request for rehearing en banc. See 644\nF. 3d 301, 303 (CA5 2011) (per curiam). Petitioner sought\na writ of certiorari. The writ was granted. 565 U. S. ___\n(2012).\n                              B\n  Among the Court’s cases involving racial classifications\nin education, there are three decisions that directly ad-\ndress the question of considering racial minority status as\na positive or favorable factor in a university’s admissions\nprocess, with the goal of achieving the educational benefits\nof a more diverse student body: Bakke, 438 U. S. 265;\nGratz, supra; and Grutter, 539 U. S. 306. We take those\ncases as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n  We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice\nPowell in Bakke, supra. In Bakke, the Court considered\na system used by the medical school of the University of\nCalifornia at Davis. From an entering class of 100 stu-\ndents the school had set aside 16 seats for minority appli-\ncants. In holding this program impermissible under the\nEqual Protection Clause Justice Powell’s opinion stated\n\f6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain basic premises. First, “decisions based on race\nor ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state\nuniversities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.” Id., at 287 (separate opinion). The principle\nof equal protection admits no “artificial line of a ‘two-\nclass theory’ ” that “permits the recognition of special\nwards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that\naccorded others.” Id., at 295. It is therefore irrelevant\nthat a system of racial preferences in admissions may\nseem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict\nscrutiny, for when government decisions “touch upon an\nindividual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a\njudicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear\non that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernmental interest.” Id., at 299.\n   Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest\nthat could justify the consideration of race: the interest in\nthe educational benefits that flow from a diverse student\nbody. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a\ncompelling interest, because a university’s “broad mission\n[of] education” is incompatible with making the “judicial,\nlegislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or\nstatutory violations” necessary to justify remedial racial\nclassification. Id., at 307–309.\n   The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast,\nserves values beyond race alone, including enhanced class-\nroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and\nstereotypes. The academic mission of a university is\n“a special concern of the First Amendment.” Id., at 312.\nPart of “ ‘the business of a university [is] to provide that\natmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, exper-\niment, and creation,’ ” and this in turn leads to the ques-\ntion of “ ‘who may be admitted to study.’ ” Sweezy v. New\nHampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Justice Powell’s central point, however, was that this\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterest in securing diversity’s benefits, although a per-\nmissible objective, is complex. “It is not an interest in\nsimple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of\nthe student body is in effect guaranteed to be members\nof selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage\nan undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity\nthat furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a\nfar broader array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.” Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (separate\nopinion).\n   In Gratz, 539 U. S. 244, and Grutter, supra, the Court\nendorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell. In Grut­\nter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the\neducational benefits of “student body diversity is a compel-\nling state interest that can justify the use of race in uni-\nversity admissions.” Id., at 325.\n   As Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows\nonly if a clear precondition is met: The particular admis-\nsions process used for this objective is subject to judicial\nreview. Race may not be considered unless the admissions\nprocess can withstand strict scrutiny. “Nothing in Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may\nemploy whatever means it desires to achieve the stated\ngoal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by\nour strict scrutiny analysis.” Gratz, supra, at 275. “To be\nnarrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program\ncannot use a quota system,” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 334, but\ninstead must “remain flexible enough to ensure that each\napplicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way\nthat makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining\nfeature of his or her application,” id., at 337. Strict scru-\ntiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that\nits “purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible\nand substantial, and that its use of the classification is\nnecessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.”\n\f8        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBakke, 438 U. S., at 305 (opinion of Powell, J.) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   While these are the cases that most specifically address\nthe central issue in this case, additional guidance may\nbe found in the Court’s broader equal protection jurispru-\ndence which applies in this context. “Distinctions between\ncitizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very\nnature odious to a free people,” Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U. S.\n495, 517 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\ntherefore “are contrary to our traditions and hence consti-\ntutionally suspect,” Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499\n(1954). “ ‘[B]ecause racial characteristics so seldom pro-\nvide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,’ ” Richmond\nv. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 505 (1989) (quoting\nFullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 533–534 (1980)\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)), “the Equal Protection Clause\ndemands that racial classifications . . . be subjected to the\n‘most rigid scrutiny.’ ” Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11\n(1967).\n   To implement these canons, judicial review must begin\nfrom the position that “any official action that treats a\nperson differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is\ninherently suspect.” Fullilove, supra, at 523 (Stewart, J.,\ndissenting); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192\n(1964). Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and it\nis the government that bears the burden to prove “ ‘that\nthe reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly iden-\ntified and unquestionably legitimate,’ ” Croson, supra, at\n505 (quoting Fullilove, 448 supra, at 533–535 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)).\n                             II\n  Grutter made clear that racial “classifications are consti-\ntutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further com-\npelling governmental interests.” 539 U. S., at 326. And\nGrutter endorsed Justice Powell’s conclusion in Bakke that\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“the attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a consti-\ntutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher\neducation.” 438 U. S., at 311–312 (separate opinion).\nThus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied\nto any admissions program using racial categories or\nclassifications.\n   According to Grutter, a university’s “educational judg-\nment that such diversity is essential to its educational\nmission is one to which we defer.” 539 U. S., at 328.\nGrutter concluded that the decision to pursue “the educa-\ntional benefits that flow from student body diversity,” id.,\nat 330, that the University deems integral to its mission\nis, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which\nsome, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under\nGrutter. A court, of course, should ensure that there is a\nreasoned, principled explanation for the academic deci-\nsion. On this point, the District Court and Court of\nAppeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for de-\nference to the University’s conclusion, “ ‘based on its\nexperience and expertise,’ ” 631 F. 3d, at 230 (quoting 645\nF. Supp. 2d 587, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse stu-\ndent body would serve its educational goals. There is\ndisagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with\nthe principles of equal protection in approving this compel-\nling interest in diversity. See post, at 1 (SCALIA, J., con-\ncurring); post, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., concurring); post, at 1–2\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But the parties here do not\nask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter’s holding.\n   A university is not permitted to define diversity as\n“some specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin.” Bakke, supra, at\n307 (opinion of Powell, J.). “That would amount to out-\nright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.”\nGrutter, supra, at 330. “Racial balancing is not trans-\nformed from ‘patently unconstitutional’ to a compelling\nstate interest simply by relabeling it ‘racial diversity.’ ”\n\f10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School\nDist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 732 (2007).\n  Once the University has established that its goal of di-\nversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there\nmust still be a further judicial determination that the\nadmissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implemen-\ntation. The University must prove that the means chosen\nby the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored\nto that goal. On this point, the University receives no\ndeference. Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not\nfor university administrators, to ensure that “[t]he means\nchosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose\nmust be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish\nthat purpose.” 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). True, a court can take account of a university’s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain\nadmissions processes. But, as the Court said in Grutter, it\nremains at all times the University’s obligation to demon-\nstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that\nadmissions processes “ensure that each applicant is evalu-\nated as an individual and not in a way that makes an\napplicant’s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or\nher application.” Id., at 337.\n  Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court\nverify that it is “necessary” for a university to use race\nto achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Bakke,\nsupra, at 305. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into\nwhether a university could achieve sufficient diversity\nwithout using racial classifications. Although “[n]arrow\ntailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable\nrace-neutral alternative,” strict scrutiny does require a\ncourt to examine with care, and not defer to, a university’s\n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.” See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339–340 (empha-\nsis added). Consideration by the university is of course\nnecessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny:\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no\nworkable race-neutral alternatives would produce the edu-\ncational benefits of diversity. If “ ‘a nonracial approach\n . . . could promote the substantial interest about as well\nand at tolerable administrative expense,’ ” Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (quoting\nGreenawalt, Judicial Scrutiny of “Benign” Racial Prefer-\nence in Law School Admissions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 559,\n578–579 (1975)), then the university may not consider\nrace. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the\nvalidity of a university’s adoption of an affirmative action\nplan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the univer-\nsity the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to\nracial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral\nalternatives do not suffice.\n    Rather than perform this searching examination, how-\never, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge\nonly “whether [the University’s] decision to reintroduce\nrace as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.”\n631 F. 3d, at 236. And in considering such a challenge,\nthe court would “presume the University acted in good\nfaith” and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that\npresumption. Id., at 231–232. The Court of Appeals\nheld that to “second-guess the merits” of this aspect of\nthe University’s decision was a task it was “ill-equipped to\nperform” and that it would attempt only to “ensure that\n[the University’s] decision to adopt a race-conscious ad-\nmissions policy followed from [a process of] good faith\nconsideration.” Id., at 231. The Court of Appeals thus\nconcluded that “the narrow-tailoring inquiry—like the\ncompelling-interest inquiry—is undertaken with a degree\nof deference to the Universit[y].” Id., at 232. Because “the\nefforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of\nhigh purpose,” the Court of Appeals held that the use of\nrace in the admissions program fell within “a constitution-\nally protected zone of discretion.” Id., at 231.\n\f12       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    These expressions of the controlling standard are at\nodds with Grutter’s command that “all racial classifica-\ntions imposed by government ‘must be analyzed by a\nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539 U. S., at 326\n(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S.\n200, 227 (1995)). In Grutter, the Court approved the plan\nat issue upon concluding that it was not a quota, was\nsufficiently flexible, was limited in time, and followed\n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.” 539 U. S., at 339. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 1, the parties do not challenge, and the Court\ntherefore does not consider, the correctness of that\ndetermination.\n    Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an\nimpermissible consideration of race. It must be remem-\nbered that “the mere recitation of a ‘benign’ or legitimate\npurpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no\nweight.” Croson, 488 U. S., at 500. Strict scrutiny does\nnot permit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its\nadmissions process uses race in a permissible way without\na court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the\nprocess works in practice.\n    The higher education dynamic does not change the\nnarrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in\nother contexts. “[T]he analysis and level of scrutiny ap-\nplied to determine the validity of [a racial] classification do\nnot vary simply because the objective appears acceptable\n. . . . While the validity and importance of the objective\nmay affect the outcome of the analysis, the analysis itself\ndoes not change.” Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,\n458 U. S. 718, 724, n. 9 (1982).\n    The District Court and Court of Appeals confined the\nstrict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring\nto the University’s good faith in its use of racial classifica-\ntions and affirming the grant of summary judgment on\nthat basis. The Court vacates that judgment, but fairness\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires\nthat it be remanded so that the admissions process can\nbe considered and judged under a correct analysis. See\nAdarand, supra, at 237. Unlike Grutter, which was decided\nafter trial, this case arises from cross-motions for sum-\nmary judgment. In this case, as in similar cases, in de-\ntermining whether summary judgment in favor of the\nUniversity would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals\nmust assess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence that would prove that its admissions program is\nnarrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of\ndiversity. Whether this record—and not “simple . . . as-\nsurances of good intention,” Croson, supra, at 500—is\nsufficient is a question for the Court of Appeals in the first\ninstance.\n                          *     *    *\n  Strict scrutiny must not be “ ‘strict in theory, but fatal in\nfact,’ ” Adarand, supra, at 237; see also Grutter, supra, at\n326. But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must\nnot be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judi-\ncial review to be meaningful, a university must make a\nshowing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the\nonly interest that this Court has approved in this context:\nthe benefits of a student body diversity that “encompasses\na . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.” Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (opinion of\nPowell, J.). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is va-\ncated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

Ante, at 1. I write sepa-\nrately to explain that I would overrule Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 306 (2003), and hold that a State’s use of race in\nhigher education admissions decisions is categorically\nprohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State\nshall “deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the\nlaws.” The Equal Protection Clause guarantees every\nperson the right to be treated equally by the State, with-\nout regard to race. “At the heart of this [guarantee] lies\nthe principle that the government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic, or reli-\ngious groups.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 120–121\n(1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring). “It is for this reason that\nwe must subject all racial classifications to the strictest of\nscrutiny.” Id., at 121.\n  Under strict scrutiny, all racial classifications are cate-\ngorically prohibited unless they are “ ‘necessary to further\n\f2         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\na compelling governmental interest’ ” and “narrowly tai-\nlored to that end.” Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499,\n514 (2005) (quoting Grutter, supra, at 327). This most\nexacting standard “has proven automatically fatal” in\nalmost every case. Jenkins, supra, at 121 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring). And rightly so. “Purchased at the price of\nimmeasurable human suffering, the equal protection\nprinciple reflects our Nation’s understanding that [racial]\nclassifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the\nindividual and our society.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPeña, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment). “The Constitution\nabhors classifications based on race” because “every time\nthe government places citizens on racial registers and\nmakes race relevant to the provision of burdens or bene-\nfits, it demeans us all.” Grutter, supra, at 353 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n                              B\n                              1\n   The Court first articulated the strict-scrutiny standard\nin Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944).\nThere, we held that “[p]ressing public necessity may some-\ntimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial\nantagonism never can.” Id., at 216.1 Aside from Grutter,\nthe Court has recognized only two instances in which a\n“[p]ressing public necessity” may justify racial discrimina-\ntion by the government. First, in Korematsu, the Court\nrecognized that protecting national security may satisfy\nthis exacting standard. In that case, the Court upheld an\nevacuation order directed at “all persons of Japanese\nancestry” on the grounds that the Nation was at war with\nJapan and that the order had “a definite and close rela-\n\n——————\n  1 The standard of “pressing public necessity” is more frequently called\n\na “compelling governmental interest.” I use the terms interchangeably.\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

Second, the Court has recognized that\nthe government has a compelling interest in remedying\npast discrimination for which it is responsible, but we\nhave stressed that a government wishing to use race must\nprovide “a ‘strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that\nremedial action [is] necessary.’ ” Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., 488 U. S. 469, 500, 504 (1989) (quoting Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality\nopinion)).\n   In contrast to these compelling interests that may, in a\nnarrow set of circumstances, justify racial discrimination,\nthe Court has frequently found other asserted interests\ninsufficient. For example, in Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S.\n429 (1984), the Court flatly rejected a claim that the best\ninterests of a child justified the government’s racial dis-\ncrimination. In that case, a state court awarded custody\nto a child’s father because the mother was in a mixed-race\nmarriage. The state court believed the child might be\nstigmatized by living in a mixed-race household and\nsought to avoid this perceived problem in its custody\ndetermination. We acknowledged the possibility of stigma\nbut nevertheless concluded that “the reality of private\nbiases and the possible injury they might inflict” do not\njustify racial discrimination. Id., at 433. As we explained,\n“The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but\nneither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be out-\nside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or\nindirectly, give them effect.” Ibid.\n   Two years later, in Wygant, supra, the Court held that\neven asserted interests in remedying societal discrimina-\ntion and in providing role models for minority students\ncould not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimi-\nnation. In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement\nbetween a school board and a teacher’s union favored\nteachers who were “ ‘Black, American Indian, Oriental, or\n\f4        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nof Spanish descendancy.’ ” Id., at 270–271, and n. 2 (plu-\nrality opinion). We rejected the interest in remedying\nsocietal discrimination because it had no logical stopping\npoint. Id., at 276. We similarly rebuffed as inadequate\nthe interest in providing role models to minority students\nand added that the notion that “black students are better\noff with black teachers could lead to the very system the\nCourt rejected in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.\n483 (1954).” Ibid.\n                              2\n   Grutter was a radical departure from our strict-scrutiny\nprecedents. In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law\nSchool (Law School) claimed that it had a compelling\nreason to discriminate based on race. The reason it ad-\nvanced did not concern protecting national security or\nremedying its own past discrimination. Instead, the Law\nSchool argued that it needed to discriminate in admissions\ndecisions in order to obtain the “educational benefits that\nflow from a diverse student body.” 539 U. S., at 317.\nContrary to the very meaning of strict scrutiny, the Court\ndeferred to the Law School’s determination that this inter-\nest was sufficiently compelling to justify racial discrimina-\ntion. Id., at 325.\n   I dissented from that part of the Court’s decision. I\nexplained that “only those measures the State must take\nto provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent vio-\nlence, will constitute a ‘pressing public necessity’ ” suffi-\ncient to satisfy strict scrutiny. Id., at 353. Cf. Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (Black, J., concur-\nring) (protecting prisoners from violence might justify\nnarrowly tailored discrimination); J. A. Croson, supra, at\n521 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“At least where\nstate or local action is at issue, only a social emergency\nrising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb . . .\ncan justify [racial discrimination]”).

As should be obvious, there is nothing “pressing” or\n“necessary” about obtaining whatever educational benefits\nmay flow from racial diversity.\n                              II\n\n                               A\n\n   The University claims that the District Court found that\nit has a compelling interest in attaining “a diverse stu-\ndent body and the educational benefits flowing from such\ndiversity.” Brief for Respondents 18. The use of the con-\njunction, “and,” implies that the University believes its\ndiscrimination furthers two distinct interests. The first is\nan interest in attaining diversity for its own sake. The sec-\nond is an interest in attaining educational benefits that\nallegedly flow from diversity.\n   Attaining diversity for its own sake is a nonstarter. As\neven Grutter recognized, the pursuit of diversity as an end\nis nothing more than impermissible “racial balancing.”\n539 U. S., at 329–330 (“The Law School’s interest is not\nsimply ‘to assure within its student body some specified\npercentage of a particular group merely because of its race\nor ethnic origin.’ That would amount to outright racial\nbalancing, which is patently unconstitutional” (quoting\nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 307\n(1978); citation omitted)); see also id., at 307 (“Preferring\nmembers of any one group for no reason other than race or\nethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the\nConstitution forbids”). Rather, diversity can only be the\nmeans by which the University obtains educational benefits;\nit cannot be an end pursued for its own sake. Therefore,\nthe educational benefits allegedly produced by diversity\nmust rise to the level of a compelling state interest in order\nfor the program to survive strict scrutiny.\n   Unfortunately for the University, the educational bene-\nfits flowing from student body diversity—assuming they\nexist—hardly qualify as a compelling state interest. In-\n\f6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ndeed, the argument that educational benefits justify racial\ndiscrimination was advanced in support of racial segrega-\ntion in the 1950’s, but emphatically rejected by this Court.\nAnd just as the alleged educational benefits of segregation\nwere insufficient to justify racial discrimination then, see\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the\nalleged educational benefits of diversity cannot justify\nracial discrimination today.\n                               1\n   Our desegregation cases establish that the Constitution\nprohibits public schools from discriminating based on race,\neven if discrimination is necessary to the schools’ survival.\nIn Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., decided with\nBrown, supra, the school board argued that if the Court\nfound segregation unconstitutional, white students would\nmigrate to private schools, funding for public schools\nwould decrease, and public schools would either decline in\nquality or cease to exist altogether. Brief for Appellees in\nDavis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., O. T. 1952, No.\n191, p. 30 (hereinafter Brief for Appellees in Davis) (“Vir-\nginians . . . would no longer permit sizeable appropriations\nfor schools on either the State or local level; private segre-\ngated schools would be greatly increased in number and\nthe masses of our people, both white and Negro, would\nsuffer terribly. . . . [M]any white parents would withdraw\ntheir children from the public schools and, as a result, the\nprogram of providing better schools would be abandoned”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). The true victims of\ndesegregation, the school board asserted, would be black\nstudents, who would be unable to afford private school.\nSee id., at 31 (“[W]ith the demise of segregation, education\nin Virginia would receive a serious setback.

T. 1952, No. 101, p. 27 (hereinafter Brief for Appellees in\nBriggs) (“[I]t would be impossible to have sufficient acceptance of the\nidea of mixed groups attending the same schools to have public educa-\ntion on that basis at all . . . .

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nmay not be denied enforcement of rights to which he is\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States be-\ncause of action taken or threatened in defiance of such\nrights”). Within a matter of years, the warning became\nreality: After being ordered to desegregate, Prince Edward\nCounty closed its public schools from the summer of 1959\nuntil the fall of 1964. See R. Sarratt, The Ordeal of De-\nsegregation 237 (1966). Despite this fact, the Court never\nbacked down from its rigid enforcement of the Equal\nProtection Clause’s antidiscrimination principle.\n   In this case, of course, Texas has not alleged that the\nUniversity will close if it is prohibited from discriminating\nbased on race. But even if it had, the foregoing cases\nmake clear that even that consequence would not justify\nits use of racial discrimination. It follows, a fortiori, that\nthe putative educational benefits of student body diversity\ncannot justify racial discrimination: If a State does not\nhave a compelling interest in the existence of a university,\nit certainly cannot have a compelling interest in the sup-\nposed benefits that might accrue to that university from\nracial discrimination. See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 361 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J.) (“[A] marginal improvement in legal\neducation cannot justify racial discrimination where the\nLaw School has no compelling interest either in its exis-\ntence or in its current educational and admissions poli-\ncies”). If the Court were actually applying strict scrutiny,\nit would require Texas either to close the University or to\nstop discriminating against applicants based on their race.\nThe Court has put other schools to that choice, and there\nis no reason to treat the University differently.\n                            2\n  It is also noteworthy that, in our desegregation cases,\nwe rejected arguments that are virtually identical to those\nadvanced by the University today. The University asserts,\nfor instance, that the diversity obtained through its dis-\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity “pre-\npares students to become the next generation of leaders in\nan increasingly diverse society”). The segregationists\nlikewise defended segregation on the ground that it pro-\nvided more leadership opportunities for blacks. See, e.g.,\nBrief for Respondents in Sweatt 96 (“[A] very large group\nof Northern Negroes [comes] South to attend separate\ncolleges, suggesting that the Negro does not secure as\nwell-rounded a college life at a mixed college, and that the\nseparate college offers him positive advantages; that there\nis a more normal social life for the Negro in a separate\ncollege; that there is a greater opportunity for full partici-\npation and for the development of leadership; that the\nNegro is inwardly more ‘secure’ at a college of his own\npeople”); Brief for Appellees in Davis 25–26 (“The Negro\nchild gets an opportunity to participate in segregated\nschools that I have never seen accorded to him in non-\nsegregated schools. He is important, he holds offices, he\nis accepted by his fellows, he is on athletic teams, he has\na full place there” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThis argument was unavailing. It is irrelevant under the\nFourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed\nschools produce better leaders. Indeed, no court today\nwould accept the suggestion that segregation is permissi-\nble because historically black colleges produced Booker T.\nWashington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nand other prominent leaders. Likewise, the University’s\nracial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground\nthat it will produce better leaders.\n   The University also asserts that student body diversity\nimproves interracial relations. See, e.g., Brief for Re-\nspondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity promotes\n“cross-racial understanding” and breaks down racial and\nethnic stereotypes). In this argument, too, the University\n\f10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nrepeats arguments once marshaled in support of segrega-\ntion. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Davis 17 (“Virginia\nhas established segregation in certain fields as a part of\nher public policy to prevent violence and reduce resent-\nment. The result, in the view of an overwhelming Virginia\nmajority, has been to improve the relationship between\nthe different races”); id., at 25 (“If segregation be stricken\ndown, the general welfare will be definitely harmed\n. . . there would be more friction developed” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Brief for Respondents in\nSweatt 93 (“Texas has had no serious breaches of the\npeace in recent years in connection with its schools. The\nseparation of the races has kept the conflicts at a mini-\nmum”); id., at 97–98 (“The legislative acts are based not\nonly on the belief that it is the best way to provide educa-\ntion for both races, and the knowledge that separate\nschools are necessary to keep public support for the public\nschools, but upon the necessity to maintain the public\npeace, harmony, and welfare”); Brief for Appellees in\nBriggs 32 (“The southern Negro, by and large, does not\nwant an end to segregation in itself any more than does\nthe southern white man. The Negro in the South knows\nthat discriminations, and worse, can and would multiply\nin such event” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\nflatly rejected this line of arguments in McLaurin v. Okla­\nhoma State Regents for Higher Ed., 339 U. S. 637 (1950),\nwhere we held that segregation would be unconstitutional\neven if white students never tolerated blacks. Id., at 641\n(“It may be argued that appellant will be in no better\nposition when these restrictions are removed, for he may\nstill be set apart by his fellow students. This we think\nirrelevant.

See Brief for Respondents 53–54\n(“Certainly all aspire for a colorblind society in which race\ndoes not matter . . . . But in Texas, as in America, ‘our\nhighest aspirations are yet unfulfilled’ ”). Yet again, the\nUniversity echoes the hollow justifications advanced by\nthe segregationists. See, e.g., Brief for State of Kansas on\nReargument in Brown v. Board of Education, O. T. 1953,\nNo. 1, p. 56 (“We grant that segregation may not be the\nethical or political ideal. At the same time we recognize\nthat practical considerations may prevent realization of\nthe ideal”); Brief for Respondents in Sweatt 94 (“The racial\nconsciousness and feeling which exists today in the minds\nof many people may be regrettable and unjustified. Yet\nthey are a reality which must be dealt with by the State if\nit is to preserve harmony and peace and at the same time\nfurnish equal education to both groups”); id., at 96 (“ ‘[T]he\nmores of racial relationships are such as to rule out, for\nthe present at least, any possibility of admitting white\npersons and Negroes to the same institutions’ ”); Brief for\nAppellees in Briggs 26–27 (“[I]t would be unwise in admin-\nistrative practice . . . to mix the two races in the same\nschools at the present time and under present conditions”);\nBrief for Appellees on Reargument in Briggs v. Elliott,\nO. T. 1953, No. 2, p. 79 (“It is not ‘racism’ to be cognizant\nof the fact that mankind has struggled with race problems\nand racial tensions for upwards of sixty centuries”). But\nthese arguments too were unavailing. The Fourteenth\nAmendment views racial bigotry as an evil to be stamped\nout, not as an excuse for perpetual racial tinkering by\nthe State. See DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312, 342\n(1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (“The Equal Protection\nClause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not\n\f12        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ntheir creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how\nsociety ought to be organized”). The University’s argu-\nments to this effect are similarly insufficient to justify\ndiscrimination.3\n                              3\n  The University’s arguments today are no more persua-\nsive than they were 60 years ago. Nevertheless, despite\nrejecting identical arguments in Brown, the Court in\nGrutter deferred to the University’s determination that\nthe diversity obtained by racial discrimination would yield\neducational benefits. There is no principled distinction\nbetween the University’s assertion that diversity yields\neducational benefits and the segregationists’ assertion\nthat segregation yielded those same benefits. See Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 365–366 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“Con-\ntained within today’s majority opinion is the seed of a new\nconstitutional justification for a concept I thought long\nand rightly rejected—racial segregation”). Educational\nbenefits are a far cry from the truly compelling state\ninterests that we previously required to justify use of racial\nclassifications.\n                            B\n  My view of the Constitution is the one advanced by the\nplaintiffs in Brown: “[N]o State has any authority under\n——————\n   3 While the arguments advanced by the University in defense of dis-\n\ncrimination are the same as those advanced by the segregationists, one\nobvious difference is that the segregationists argued that it was\nsegregation that was necessary to obtain the alleged benefits, whereas\nthe University argues that diversity is the key. Today, the segre-\ngationists’ arguments would never be given serious considera-\ntion. But see M. Plocienniczak, Pennsylvania School Experiments with\n‘Segregation,’ CNN (Jan. 27, 2011), http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/27\n/pennsylvania.segregation/index.html?_s=PM:US (as visited June 21,\n2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). We should be equally\nhostile to the University’s repackaged version of the same arguments in\nsupport of its favored form of racial discrimination.\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

T. 1952, No. 8, p. 7; see also Juris.\nStatement in Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty.,\nO.

Board\nof Education, O. T. 1953, p. 65 (“That the Constitution is\ncolor blind is our dedicated belief ”). The Constitution does\nnot pander to faddish theories about whether race mixing\nis in the public interest. The Equal Protection Clause\nstrips States of all authority to use race as a factor in\nproviding education. All applicants must be treated equally\nunder the law, and no benefit in the eye of the beholder can\njustify racial discrimination.\n   This principle is neither new nor difficult to understand.\nIn 1868, decades before Plessy, the Iowa Supreme Court\nheld that schools may not discriminate against applicants\nbased on their skin color. In Clark v. Board of Directors,\n24 Iowa 266 (1868), a school denied admission to a student\nbecause she was black, and “public sentiment [was] op-\nposed to the intermingling of white and colored children in\nthe same schools.” Id., at 269. The Iowa Supreme Court\nrejected that flimsy justification, holding that “all the\nyouths are equal before the law, and there is no discretion\nvested in the board . . . or elsewhere, to interfere with or\ndisturb that equality.” Id., at 277. “For the courts to\nsustain a board of school directors . . . in limiting the\nrights and privileges of persons by reason of their [race],\n\f14       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nwould be to sanction a plain violation of the spirit of our\nlaws not only, but would tend to perpetuate the national\ndifferences of our people and stimulate a constant strife, if\nnot a war of races.” Id., at 276. This simple, yet funda-\nmental, truth was lost on the Court in Plessy and Grutter.\n  I would overrule Grutter and hold that the University’s\nadmissions program violates the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause the University has not put forward a compelling\ninterest that could possibly justify racial discrimination.\n                              III\n   While I find the theory advanced by the University to\njustify racial discrimination facially inadequate, I also\nbelieve that its use of race has little to do with the alleged\neducational benefits of diversity. I suspect that the Uni-\nversity’s program is instead based on the benighted notion\nthat it is possible to tell when discrimination helps, rather\nthan hurts, racial minorities. See post, at 3 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting) (“[G]overnment actors, including state univer-\nsities, need not be blind to the lingering effects of ‘an\novertly discriminatory past,’ the legacy of ‘centuries of\nlaw-sanctioned inequality’ ”). But “[h]istory should teach\ngreater humility.” Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497\nU. S. 547, 609 (1990) (O’Connor, J., dissenting). The worst\nforms of racial discrimination in this Nation have always\nbeen accompanied by straight-faced representations that\ndiscrimination helped minorities.\n                              A\n  Slaveholders argued that slavery was a “positive good”\nthat civilized blacks and elevated them in every dimension\nof life. See, e.g., Calhoun, Speech in the U. S. Senate,\n1837, in P. Finkelman, Defending Slavery 54, 58–59\n(2003) (“Never before has the black race of Central Africa,\nfrom the dawn of history to the present day, attained a\ncondition so civilized and so improved, not only physically,\n\f                  Cite as: 570 U.

Faust ed. 1981) (“Slavery, as it is said in an\neloquent article published in a Southern periodical work\n. . . ‘has done more to elevate a degraded race in the scale\nof humanity; to tame the savage; to civilize the barbarous;\nto soften the ferocious; to enlighten the ignorant, and to\nspread the blessings of [C]hristianity among the heathen,\nthan all the missionaries that philanthropy and religion\nhave ever sent forth’ ”); Hammond, The Mudsill Speech,\n1858, in Defending Slavery, supra, at 80, 87 (“They are\nelevated from the condition in which God first created\nthem, by being made our slaves”).\n    A century later, segregationists similarly asserted that\nsegregation was not only benign, but good for black stu-\ndents. They argued, for example, that separate schools\nprotected black children from racist white students and\nteachers. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Briggs 33–34 (“ ‘I\nhave repeatedly seen wise and loving colored parents take\ninfinite pains to force their little children into schools\nwhere the white children, white teachers, and white par-\nents despised and resented the dark child, made mock of\nit, neglected or bullied it, and literally rendered its life a\nliving hell. Such parents want their child to “fight” this\nthing out,—but, dear God, at what a cost! . . . We shall get\na finer, better balance of spirit; an infinitely more capable\nand rounded personality by putting children in schools\nwhere they are wanted, and where they are happy and\ninspired, than in thrusting them into hells where they are\nridiculed and hated’ ” (quoting DuBois, Does the Negro\nNeed Separate Schools? 4 J. of Negro Educ. 328, 330–331\n(1935))); Tr. of Oral Arg. in Bolling v. Sharpe, O. T. 1952,\nNo. 413, p. 56 (“There was behind these [a]cts a kindly\nfeeling [and] an intention to help these people who had\n\f16       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nbeen in bondage. And there was and there still is an\nintention by the Congress to see that these children shall\nbe educated in a healthful atmosphere, in a wholesome\natmosphere, in a place where they are wanted, in a place\nwhere they will not be looked upon with hostility, in a\nplace where there will be a receptive atmosphere for learn-\ning for both races without the hostility that undoubtedly\nCongress thought might creep into these situations”). And\nthey even appealed to the fact that many blacks agreed\nthat separate schools were in the “best interests” of both\nraces. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Davis 24–25 (“ ‘It\nhas been my experience, in working with the people of\nVirginia, including both white and Negro, that the cus-\ntoms and the habits and the traditions of Virginia citizens\nare such that they believe for the best interests of both the\nwhite and the Negro that the separate school is best’ ”).\n  Following in these inauspicious footsteps, the University\nwould have us believe that its discrimination is likewise\nbenign. I think the lesson of history is clear enough:\nRacial discrimination is never benign. “ ‘[B]enign’ carries\nwith it no independent meaning, but reflects only ac-\nceptance of the current generation’s conclusion that a\npolitically acceptable burden, imposed on particular citi-\nzens on the basis of race, is reasonable.” See Metro Broad­\ncasting, 497 U. S., at 610 (O’Connor, J., dissenting). It is\nfor this reason that the Court has repeatedly held that\nstrict scrutiny applies to all racial classifications, regard-\nless of whether the government has benevolent motives.\nSee, e.g., Johnson, 543 U. S., at 505 (“We have insisted on\nstrict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called ‘benign’\nracial classifications”); Adarand, 515 U. S., at 227 (“[A]ll\nracial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state,\nor local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a review-\ning court under strict scrutiny”); J. A. Croson, 488 U. S., at\n500 (“Racial classifications are suspect, and that means\nthat simple legislative assurances of good intention cannot\n\f                    Cite as: 570 U.

The University’s professed good intentions can-\nnot excuse its outright racial discrimination any more\nthan such intentions justified the now denounced argu-\nments of slaveholders and segregationists.\n                             B\n  While it does not, for constitutional purposes, matter\nwhether the University’s racial discrimination is benign, I\nnote that racial engineering does in fact have insidious\nconsequences. There can be no doubt that the University’s\ndiscrimination injures white and Asian applicants who are\ndenied admission because of their race. But I believe the\ninjury to those admitted under the University’s discrimi-\nnatory admissions program is even more harmful.\n  Blacks and Hispanics admitted to the University as a\nresult of racial discrimination are, on average, far less\nprepared than their white and Asian classmates. In the\nUniversity’s entering class of 2009, for example, among\nthe students admitted outside the Top Ten Percent plan,\nblacks scored at the 52d percentile of 2009 SAT takers\nnationwide, while Asians scored at the 93d percentile.\nBrief for Richard Sander et al. as Amici Curiae 3–4, and\nn. 4. Blacks had a mean GPA of 2.57 and a mean SAT\nscore of 1524; Hispanics had a mean GPA of 2.83 and a\nmean SAT score of 1794; whites had a mean GPA of 3.04\nand a mean SAT score of 1914; and Asians had a mean\nGPA of 3.07 and a mean SAT score of 1991.4 Ibid.\n  Tellingly, neither the University nor any of the 73 amici\nbriefs in support of racial discrimination has presented a\nshred of evidence that black and Hispanic students are\nable to close this substantial gap during their time at the\nUniversity. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflections on\nthe Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605–1608\n(1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial dis-\n——————\n  4 The lowest possible score on the SAT is 600, and the highest possi-\n\nble score is 2400.\n\f18       FISHER v.

Cole & E. Barber, Increasing Faculty Diversity:\nThe Occupational Choices of High-Achieving Minority\nStudents 124 (2003). There is no reason to believe this is\nnot the case at the University. The University and its\ndozens of amici are deafeningly silent on this point.\n   Furthermore, the University’s discrimination does\nnothing to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics\nwho have access to a college education generally. Instead,\nthe University’s discrimination has a pervasive shifting\neffect. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the\nWorld 145–146 (2004). The University admits minorities\nwho otherwise would have attended less selective colleges\nwhere they would have been more evenly matched. But,\nas a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispan-\nics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are\nplaced in a position where underperformance is all but\ninevitable because they are less academically prepared\nthan the white and Asian students with whom they must\ncompete. Setting aside the damage wreaked upon the self-\nconfidence of these overmatched students, there is no\nevidence that they learn more at the University than they\nwould have learned at other schools for which they were\nbetter prepared. Indeed, they may learn less.\n   The Court of Appeals believed that the University needed\nto enroll more blacks and Hispanics because they remained\n“clustered in certain programs.” 631 F. 3d 213, 240\n(CA5 2011) (“[N]early a quarter of the undergraduate\nstudents in [the University’s] College of Social Work are\nHispanic, and more than 10% are [black].

There is some\nevidence that students admitted as a result of racial dis-\ncrimination are more likely to abandon their initial aspi-\nrations to become scientists and engineers than are\nstudents with similar qualifications who attend less selective\nschools. See, e.g., Elliott, Strenta, Adair, Matier, & Scott,\nThe Role of Ethnicity in Choosing and Leaving Science in\nHighly Selective Institutions, 37 Research in Higher Educ.\n681, 699–701 (1996).5 These students may well drift\ntowards less competitive majors because the mismatch\ncaused by racial discrimination in admissions makes it\ndifficult for them to compete in more rigorous majors.\n   Moreover, the University’s discrimination “stamp[s]\n[blacks and Hispanics] with a badge of inferiority.”\nAdarand, 515 U. S., at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). It\ntaints the accomplishments of all those who are admitted\nas a result of racial discrimination. Cf. J.

In this case, for example, most blacks and Hispanics\nattending the University were admitted without discrimina-\ntion under the Top Ten Percent plan, but no one can\ndistinguish those students from the ones whose race\nplayed a role in their admission. “When blacks [and His-\npanics] take positions in the highest places of government,\nindustry, or academia, it is an open question . . . whether\ntheir skin color played a part in their advancement.” See\nGrutter, 539 U. S., at 373 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). “The\nquestion itself is the stigma—because either racial dis-\ncrimination did play a role, in which case the person may\nbe deemed ‘otherwise unqualified,’ or it did not, in which\ncase asking the question itself unfairly marks those . . .\nwho would succeed without discrimination.” Ibid. Al-\nthough cloaked in good intentions, the University’s racial\ntinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping.\n                      *    *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would overrule Grutter.\nHowever, because the Court correctly concludes that the\nCourt of Appeals did not apply strict scrutiny, I join its\nopinion.\n\f                     Cite as: 570 U.

The University has\nsteered clear of a quota system like the one struck down in\nBakke, which excluded all nonminority candidates from\ncompetition for a fixed number of seats. See id., at 272–\n275, 315, 319–320 (opinion of Powell, J.). See also Gratz v.\nBollinger, 539 U.

And, like so many edu-\ncational institutions across the Nation,1 the University\nhas taken care to follow the model approved by the Court\nin Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003).

Supp. 2d 587, 609 (WD Tex. 2009) (“[T]he parties agree\n[that the University’s] policy was based on the [admis-\nsions] policy [upheld in Grutter].”).\n   Petitioner urges that Texas’ Top Ten Percent Law and\nrace-blind holistic review of each application achieve\nsignificant diversity, so the University must be content\nwith those alternatives. I have said before and reiterate\nhere that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly\nneutral alternatives as race unconscious. See Gratz, 539\nU. S., at 303–304, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). As Justice\nSouter observed, the vaunted alternatives suffer from “the\ndisadvantage of deliberate obfuscation.” Id., at 297–298\n(dissenting opinion).\n   Texas’ percentage plan was adopted with racially segre-\ngated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.\nSee House Research Organization, Bill Analysis, HB 588,\npp. 4–5 (Apr. 15, 1997) (“Many regions of the state, school\ndistricts, and high schools in Texas are still predominantly\ncomposed of people from a single racial or ethnic group.\nBecause of the persistence of this segregation, admitting\nthe top 10 percent of all high schools would provide a\ndiverse population and ensure that a large, well qualified\npool of minority students was admitted to Texas universi-\nties.”). It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that\ndrives such plans.2 As for holistic review, if universities\ncannot explicitly include race as a factor, many may “re-\nsort to camouflage” to “maintain their minority enroll-\nment.” Gratz, 539 U. S., at 304 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n——————\n    2 The\n        notion that Texas’ Top Ten Percent Law is race neutral calls to\nmind Professor Thomas Reed Powell’s famous statement: “If you think\nthat you can think about a thing inextricably attached to something\nelse without thinking of the thing which it is attached to, then you have\na legal mind.” T. Arnold, The Symbols of Government 101 (1935)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Only that kind of legal mind could\nconclude that an admissions plan specifically designed to produce racial\ndiversity is not race conscious.\n\f                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   I have several times explained why government actors,\nincluding state universities, need not be blind to the lin-\ngering effects of “an overtly discriminatory past,” the\nlegacy of “centuries of law-sanctioned inequality.” Id., at\n298 (dissenting opinion). See also Adarand Constructors,\nInc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 272–274 (1995) (dissenting\nopinion). Among constitutionally permissible options, I\nremain convinced, “those that candidly disclose their\nconsideration of race [are] preferable to those that conceal\nit.” Gratz, 539 U. S., at 305, n. 11 (dissenting opinion).\n   Accordingly, I would not return this case for a second\nlook. As the thorough opinions below show, 631 F. 3d 213\n(CA5 2011); 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, the University’s admis-\nsions policy flexibly considers race only as a “factor of a\nfactor of a factor of a factor” in the calculus, id., at 608;\nfollowed a yearlong review through which the University\nreached the reasonable, good-faith judgment that suppos-\nedly race-neutral initiatives were insufficient to achieve,\nin appropriate measure, the educational benefits of student-\nbody diversity, see 631 F. 3d, at 225–226; and is sub-\nject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of\nrace remains necessary and proper to achieve the Uni-\nversity’s educational objectives, see id., at 226.3 Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke and the Court’s decision in\nGrutter require no further determinations. See Grutter,\n——————\n  3 As the Court said in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 339 (2003),\n\n“[n]arrow tailoring . . . require[s] serious, good faith consideration of\nworkable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the\nuniversity seeks.” But, Grutter also explained, it does not “require a\nuniversity to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence\n[and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities\nto members of all racial groups.” Ibid. I do not read the Court to\nsay otherwise. See ante, at 10 (acknowledging that, in determining\nwhether a race-conscious admissions policy satisfies Grutter’s narrow-\ntailoring requirement, “a court can take account of a university’s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions\nprocesses”).\n\f4         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n539 U. S., at 333–343; Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315–320.\n   The Court rightly declines to cast off the equal protec-\ntion framework settled in Grutter. See ante, at 5. Yet it\nstops short of reaching the conclusion that framework\nwarrants. Instead, the Court vacates the Court of Ap-\npeals’ judgment and remands for the Court of Appeals to\n“assess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence [to] prove that its admissions program is narrowly\ntailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”\nAnte, at 13. As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already\ncompleted that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this\nCourt’s Bakke and Grutter pathmarkers, merits our\napprobation.4\n                      *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   4 Because the University’s admissions policy, in my view, is constitu-\n\ntional under Grutter, there is no need for the Court in this case “to\nrevisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether\ndesigned to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group,\nshould be subject to the same standard of judicial review.” 539 U. S., at\n346, n. (GINSBURG, J., concurring). See also Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\nU. S. 244, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“Actions designed to\nburden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly\nranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched\ndiscrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated.”).\n\f",

Pp. 5–13.\n    (a) Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question\n considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n In Bakke’s principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state\n university “decisions based on race or ethnic origin . . . are reviewable\n\f2           FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    under the Fourteenth Amendment,” 438 U. S., at 287, using a strict\n    scrutiny standard, id., at 299. He identified as a compelling interest\n    that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educa-\n    tional benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that\n    this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array “of qualifica-\n    tions and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a sin-\n    gle though important element.” Id., at 315\n       In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing\n    that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial\n    review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e.,\n    a university must clearly demonstrate that its “ ‘purpose or interest is\n    both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of\n    the classification is “necessary . . . to the accomplishment” of its pur-\n    pose,’ ” Bakke, supra, at 305. Additional guidance may be found in\n    the Court’s broader equal protection jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rice v.\n    Cayetano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118340\"><a href=\"/opinion/118340/rice-v-cayetano/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517; Richmond v.

Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the gov-\n    ernment bears the burden to prove “ ‘that the reasons for any [racial]\n    classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.’ ”\n    Ibid. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admis-\n    sions program using racial categories or classifications. A court may\n    give some deference to a university’s “judgment that such diversity is\n    essential to its educational mission,” 539 U. S., at 328, provided that\n    diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a rea-\n    soned, principled explanation for the academic decision. On this\n    point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for\n    deference to the University’s experience and expertise about its edu-\n    cational mission. However, once the University has established that\n    its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University\n    must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are nar-\n    rowly tailored to its goal. On this point, the University receives no\n    deference. Id., at 333. It is at all times the University’s obligation to\n    demonstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that admis-\n    sions processes “ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an indi-\n    vidual and not in a way that makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity\n    the defining feature of his or her application.” Id., at 337. Narrow\n    tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is “neces-\n    sary” for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits\n    of diversity. Bakke, supra, at 305. The reviewing court must ulti-\n    mately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would\n    produce the educational benefits of diversity.\n       Rather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit\n    held petitioner could challenge only whether the University’s decision\n\f                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to use race as an admissions factor “was made in good faith.” It pre-\n  sumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the\n  burden of rebutting that presumption. It thus undertook the narrow-\n  tailoring requirement with a “degree of deference” to the school.\n  These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grut-\n  ter’s command that “all racial classifications imposed by government\n  ‘must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539\n  U. S., at 326. Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a\n  school’s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissi-\n  ble way without closely examining how the process works in practice,\n  yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The\n  Court vacates the Fifth Circuit’s judgment. But fairness to the liti-\n  gants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded\n  so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a\n  correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the\n  University’s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess\n  whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that\n  its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational\n  benefits of diversity.

Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when\npetitioner sought admission to the University’s entering\nclass, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group\n12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.\nPetitioner was denied admission.\n   In recent years the University has used three different\nprograms to evaluate candidates for admission. The first\nis the program it used for some years before 1997, when\nthe University considered two factors: a numerical score\nreflecting an applicant’s test scores and academic perform-\nance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the\napplicant’s race. In 1996, this system was held unconsti-\ntutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit. It ruled the University’s consideration of\nrace violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did\nnot further any compelling government interest. Hopwood\nv.

The University stopped considering\nrace in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic\nmetric of a candidate’s potential contribution to the Uni-\nversity, to be used in conjunction with the Academic In-\ndex.

These included growing up in a single-parent\nhome, speaking a language other than English at home,\nsignificant family responsibilities assumed by the appli-\ncant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the stu-\ndent’s family. Seeking to address the decline in minority\nenrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded\nits outreach programs.\n   The Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop­\nwood decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top\nTen Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §51.803\n(West 2009). Also referred to as H. B. 588, the Top\nTen Percent Law grants automatic admission to any pub-\nlic state college, including the University, to all students\nin the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas\nthat comply with certain standards.\n   The University’s revised admissions process, coupled\nwith the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.\nBefore the admissions program at issue in this case, in the\nlast year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did\nnot consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-\nAmerican and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with\nthe 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when\nrace was explicitly considered, and the University’s enter-\ning freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5%\nHispanic.\n   Following this Court’s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger,\nsupra, and Gratz v.

This is the program here at issue. In\nGrutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many\n“plus factors” in an admissions program that considered\nthe overall individual contribution of each candidate. In\nGratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michi-\ngan’s undergraduate admissions program, which automat-\n\f4       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nically awarded points to applicants from certain racial\nminorities.\n   The University’s plan to resume race-conscious admis-\nsions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an in-\nternal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and\nEthnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The\nProposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset\nof undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24\nstudents. It showed that few of these classes had signifi-\ncant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addi-\ntion the Proposal relied on what it called “anecdotal”\nreports from students regarding their “interaction in the\nclassroom.” The Proposal concluded that the University\nlacked a “critical mass” of minority students and that to\nremedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit\nconsideration to race in the undergraduate admissions\nprogram.\n   To implement the Proposal the University included a\nstudent’s race as a component of the PAI score, begin-\nning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University\nasks students to classify themselves from among five\npredefined racial categories on the application. Race is not\nassigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed\nthat race is a meaningful factor.\n   Once applications have been scored, they are plotted\non a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the\nPersonal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid\nstudents are assigned to so-called cells based on their\nindividual scores. All students in the cells falling above a\ncertain line are admitted. All students below the line are\nnot. Each college—such as Liberal Arts or Engineering—\nadmits students separately. So a student is considered\ninitially for her first-choice college, then for her second\nchoice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared\nmajor.\n   Petitioner applied for admission to the University’s 2008\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.

We take those\ncases as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n  We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice\nPowell in Bakke, supra. In Bakke, the Court considered\na system used by the medical school of the University of\nCalifornia at Davis. From an entering class of 100 stu-\ndents the school had set aside 16 seats for minority appli-\ncants. In holding this program impermissible under the\nEqual Protection Clause Justice Powell’s opinion stated\n\f6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain basic premises. First, “decisions based on race\nor ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state\nuniversities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.” Id., at 287 (separate opinion). The principle\nof equal protection admits no “artificial line of a ‘two-\nclass theory’ ” that “permits the recognition of special\nwards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that\naccorded others.” Id., at 295. It is therefore irrelevant\nthat a system of racial preferences in admissions may\nseem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict\nscrutiny, for when government decisions “touch upon an\nindividual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a\njudicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear\non that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernmental interest.” Id., at 299.\n   Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest\nthat could justify the consideration of race: the interest in\nthe educational benefits that flow from a diverse student\nbody. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a\ncompelling interest, because a university’s “broad mission\n[of] education” is incompatible with making the “judicial,\nlegislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or\nstatutory violations” necessary to justify remedial racial\nclassification. Id., at 307–309.\n   The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast,\nserves values beyond race alone, including enhanced class-\nroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and\nstereotypes. The academic mission of a university is\n“a special concern of the First Amendment.” Id., at 312.\nPart of “ ‘the business of a university [is] to provide that\natmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, exper-\niment, and creation,’ ” and this in turn leads to the ques-\ntion of “ ‘who may be admitted to study.’ ” Sweezy v. New\nHampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105533\"><a href=\"/opinion/105533/sweezy-v-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Justice Powell’s central point, however, was that this\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterest in securing diversity’s benefits, although a per-\nmissible objective, is complex. “It is not an interest in\nsimple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of\nthe student body is in effect guaranteed to be members\nof selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage\nan undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity\nthat furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a\nfar broader array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.” Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (separate\nopinion).\n   In Gratz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Grutter, supra, the Court\nendorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell. In Grut­\nter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the\neducational benefits of “student body diversity is a compel-\nling state interest that can justify the use of race in uni-\nversity admissions.” Id., at 325.\n   As Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows\nonly if a clear precondition is met: The particular admis-\nsions process used for this objective is subject to judicial\nreview. Race may not be considered unless the admissions\nprocess can withstand strict scrutiny. “Nothing in Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may\nemploy whatever means it desires to achieve the stated\ngoal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by\nour strict scrutiny analysis.” Gratz, supra, at 275. “To be\nnarrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program\ncannot use a quota system,” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 334, but\ninstead must “remain flexible enough to ensure that each\napplicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way\nthat makes an applicant’s race or ethnicity the defining\nfeature of his or her application,” id., at 337. Strict scru-\ntiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that\nits “purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible\nand substantial, and that its use of the classification is\nnecessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.”\n\f8        FISHER v.

Florida, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106945\"><a href=\"/opinion/106945/mclaughlin-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192\n(1964). Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and it\nis the government that bears the burden to prove “ ‘that\nthe reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly iden-\ntified and unquestionably legitimate,’ ” Croson, supra, at\n505 (quoting Fullilove, 448 supra, at 533–535 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)).\n                             II\n  Grutter made clear that racial “classifications are consti-\ntutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further com-\npelling governmental interests.” 539 U. S., at 326. And\nGrutter endorsed Justice Powell’s conclusion in Bakke that\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“the attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a consti-\ntutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher\neducation.” 438 U. S., at 311–312 (separate opinion).\nThus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied\nto any admissions program using racial categories or\nclassifications.\n   According to Grutter, a university’s “educational judg-\nment that such diversity is essential to its educational\nmission is one to which we defer.” 539 U. S., at 328.\nGrutter concluded that the decision to pursue “the educa-\ntional benefits that flow from student body diversity,” id.,\nat 330, that the University deems integral to its mission\nis, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which\nsome, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under\nGrutter. A court, of course, should ensure that there is a\nreasoned, principled explanation for the academic deci-\nsion. On this point, the District Court and Court of\nAppeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for de-\nference to the University’s conclusion, “ ‘based on its\nexperience and expertise,’ ” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 230 (quoting </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498468/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse stu-\ndent body would serve its educational goals. There is\ndisagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with\nthe principles of equal protection in approving this compel-\nling interest in diversity. See post, at 1 (SCALIA, J., con-\ncurring); post, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., concurring); post, at 1–2\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But the parties here do not\nask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter’s holding.\n   A university is not permitted to define diversity as\n“some specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin.” Bakke, supra, at\n307 (opinion of Powell, J.). “That would amount to out-\nright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.”\nGrutter, supra, at 330. “Racial balancing is not trans-\nformed from ‘patently unconstitutional’ to a compelling\nstate interest simply by relabeling it ‘racial diversity.’ ”\n\f10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School\nDist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145702\"><a href=\"/opinion/145702/parents-involved-in-community-schools-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (2007).\n  Once the University has established that its goal of di-\nversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there\nmust still be a further judicial determination that the\nadmissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implemen-\ntation. The University must prove that the means chosen\nby the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored\nto that goal. On this point, the University receives no\ndeference. Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not\nfor university administrators, to ensure that “[t]he means\nchosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose\nmust be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish\nthat purpose.” 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). True, a court can take account of a university’s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain\nadmissions processes. But, as the Court said in Grutter, it\nremains at all times the University’s obligation to demon-\nstrate, and the Judiciary’s obligation to determine, that\nadmissions processes “ensure that each applicant is evalu-\nated as an individual and not in a way that makes an\napplicant’s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or\nher application.” Id., at 337.\n  Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court\nverify that it is “necessary” for a university to use race\nto achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Bakke,\nsupra, at 305. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into\nwhether a university could achieve sufficient diversity\nwithout using racial classifications. Although “[n]arrow\ntailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable\nrace-neutral alternative,” strict scrutiny does require a\ncourt to examine with care, and not defer to, a university’s\n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.” See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339–340 (empha-\nsis added). Consideration by the university is of course\nnecessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny:\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no\nworkable race-neutral alternatives would produce the edu-\ncational benefits of diversity. If “ ‘a nonracial approach\n . . . could promote the substantial interest about as well\nand at tolerable administrative expense,’ ” Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280, n. 6 (1986) (quoting\nGreenawalt, Judicial Scrutiny of “Benign” Racial Prefer-\nence in Law School Admissions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 559,\n578–579 (1975)), then the university may not consider\nrace. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the\nvalidity of a university’s adoption of an affirmative action\nplan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the univer-\nsity the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to\nracial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral\nalternatives do not suffice.\n    Rather than perform this searching examination, how-\never, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge\nonly “whether [the University’s] decision to reintroduce\nrace as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 236. And in considering such a challenge,\nthe court would “presume the University acted in good\nfaith” and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that\npresumption. Id., at 231–232. The Court of Appeals\nheld that to “second-guess the merits” of this aspect of\nthe University’s decision was a task it was “ill-equipped to\nperform” and that it would attempt only to “ensure that\n[the University’s] decision to adopt a race-conscious ad-\nmissions policy followed from [a process of] good faith\nconsideration.” Id., at 231. The Court of Appeals thus\nconcluded that “the narrow-tailoring inquiry—like the\ncompelling-interest inquiry—is undertaken with a degree\nof deference to the Universit[y].” Id., at 232. Because “the\nefforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of\nhigh purpose,” the Court of Appeals held that the use of\nrace in the admissions program fell within “a constitution-\nally protected zone of discretion.” Id., at 231.\n\f12       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    These expressions of the controlling standard are at\nodds with Grutter’s command that “all racial classifica-\ntions imposed by government ‘must be analyzed by a\nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.’ ” 539 U. S., at 326\n(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 227 (1995)). In Grutter, the Court approved the plan\nat issue upon concluding that it was not a quota, was\nsufficiently flexible, was limited in time, and followed\n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.” 539 U. S., at 339. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 1, the parties do not challenge, and the Court\ntherefore does not consider, the correctness of that\ndetermination.\n    Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an\nimpermissible consideration of race. It must be remem-\nbered that “the mere recitation of a ‘benign’ or legitimate\npurpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no\nweight.” Croson, 488 U. S., at 500. Strict scrutiny does\nnot permit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its\nadmissions process uses race in a permissible way without\na court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the\nprocess works in practice.\n    The higher education dynamic does not change the\nnarrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in\nother contexts. “[T]he analysis and level of scrutiny ap-\nplied to determine the validity of [a racial] classification do\nnot vary simply because the objective appears acceptable\n. . . . While the validity and importance of the objective\nmay affect the outcome of the analysis, the analysis itself\ndoes not change.” Mississippi Univ. for Women v.

See\nAdarand, supra, at 237. Unlike Grutter, which was decided\nafter trial, this case arises from cross-motions for sum-\nmary judgment. In this case, as in similar cases, in de-\ntermining whether summary judgment in favor of the\nUniversity would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals\nmust assess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence that would prove that its admissions program is\nnarrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of\ndiversity. Whether this record—and not “simple . . . as-\nsurances of good intention,” Croson, supra, at 500—is\nsufficient is a question for the Court of Appeals in the first\ninstance.\n                          *     *    *\n  Strict scrutiny must not be “ ‘strict in theory, but fatal in\nfact,’ ” Adarand, supra, at 237; see also Grutter, supra, at\n326. But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must\nnot be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judi-\ncial review to be meaningful, a university must make a\nshowing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the\nonly interest that this Court has approved in this context:\nthe benefits of a student body diversity that “encompasses\na . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.” Bakke, 438 U.

Second, the Court has recognized that\nthe government has a compelling interest in remedying\npast discrimination for which it is responsible, but we\nhave stressed that a government wishing to use race must\nprovide “a ‘strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that\nremedial action [is] necessary.’ ” Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500, 504 (1989) (quoting Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 277 (1986) (plurality\nopinion)).\n   In contrast to these compelling interests that may, in a\nnarrow set of circumstances, justify racial discrimination,\nthe Court has frequently found other asserted interests\ninsufficient. For example, in Palmore v. Sidoti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111160\"><a href=\"/opinion/111160/palmore-v-sidoti/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), the Court flatly rejected a claim that the best\ninterests of a child justified the government’s racial dis-\ncrimination. In that case, a state court awarded custody\nto a child’s father because the mother was in a mixed-race\nmarriage. The state court believed the child might be\nstigmatized by living in a mixed-race household and\nsought to avoid this perceived problem in its custody\ndetermination. We acknowledged the possibility of stigma\nbut nevertheless concluded that “the reality of private\nbiases and the possible injury they might inflict” do not\njustify racial discrimination. Id., at 433. As we explained,\n“The Constitution cannot control such prejudices but\nneither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be out-\nside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or\nindirectly, give them effect.” Ibid.\n   Two years later, in Wygant, supra, the Court held that\neven asserted interests in remedying societal discrimina-\ntion and in providing role models for minority students\ncould not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimi-\nnation. In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement\nbetween a school board and a teacher’s union favored\nteachers who were “ ‘Black, American Indian, Oriental, or\n\f4        FISHER v.

We rejected the interest in remedying\nsocietal discrimination because it had no logical stopping\npoint. Id., at 276. We similarly rebuffed as inadequate\nthe interest in providing role models to minority students\nand added that the notion that “black students are better\noff with black teachers could lead to the very system the\nCourt rejected in Brown v. Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954).” Ibid.\n                              2\n   Grutter was a radical departure from our strict-scrutiny\nprecedents. In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law\nSchool (Law School) claimed that it had a compelling\nreason to discriminate based on race. The reason it ad-\nvanced did not concern protecting national security or\nremedying its own past discrimination. Instead, the Law\nSchool argued that it needed to discriminate in admissions\ndecisions in order to obtain the “educational benefits that\nflow from a diverse student body.” 539 U. S., at 317.\nContrary to the very meaning of strict scrutiny, the Court\ndeferred to the Law School’s determination that this inter-\nest was sufficiently compelling to justify racial discrimina-\ntion. Id., at 325.\n   I dissented from that part of the Court’s decision. I\nexplained that “only those measures the State must take\nto provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent vio-\nlence, will constitute a ‘pressing public necessity’ ” suffi-\ncient to satisfy strict scrutiny.

The use of the con-\njunction, “and,” implies that the University believes its\ndiscrimination furthers two distinct interests. The first is\nan interest in attaining diversity for its own sake. The sec-\nond is an interest in attaining educational benefits that\nallegedly flow from diversity.\n   Attaining diversity for its own sake is a nonstarter. As\neven Grutter recognized, the pursuit of diversity as an end\nis nothing more than impermissible “racial balancing.”\n539 U. S., at 329–330 (“The Law School’s interest is not\nsimply ‘to assure within its student body some specified\npercentage of a particular group merely because of its race\nor ethnic origin.’ That would amount to outright racial\nbalancing, which is patently unconstitutional” (quoting\nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v.

Therefore,\nthe educational benefits allegedly produced by diversity\nmust rise to the level of a compelling state interest in order\nfor the program to survive strict scrutiny.\n   Unfortunately for the University, the educational bene-\nfits flowing from student body diversity—assuming they\nexist—hardly qualify as a compelling state interest.

Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954), the\nalleged educational benefits of diversity cannot justify\nracial discrimination today.\n                               1\n   Our desegregation cases establish that the Constitution\nprohibits public schools from discriminating based on race,\neven if discrimination is necessary to the schools’ survival.\nIn Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., decided with\nBrown, supra, the school board argued that if the Court\nfound segregation unconstitutional, white students would\nmigrate to private schools, funding for public schools\nwould decrease, and public schools would either decline in\nquality or cease to exist altogether. Brief for Appellees in\nDavis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., O. T. 1952, No.\n191, p. 30 (hereinafter Brief for Appellees in Davis) (“Vir-\nginians . . . would no longer permit sizeable appropriations\nfor schools on either the State or local level; private segre-\ngated schools would be greatly increased in number and\nthe masses of our people, both white and Negro, would\nsuffer terribly. . . .

We are up\nagainst the proposition: What does the Negro profit if he\nprocures an immediate detailed decree from this Court\nnow and then impairs or mars or destroys the public\nschool system in Prince Edward County”).2\n   Unmoved by this sky-is-falling argument, we held that\nsegregation violates the principle of equality enshrined in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. See Brown, supra, at 495\n(“[I]n the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate\nbut equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are\ninherently unequal”); see also Allen v.

T. 1952, No. 101, p. 27 (hereinafter Brief for Appellees in\nBriggs) (“[I]t would be impossible to have sufficient acceptance of the\nidea of mixed groups attending the same schools to have public educa-\ntion on that basis at all . . . .

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nmay not be denied enforcement of rights to which he is\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States be-\ncause of action taken or threatened in defiance of such\nrights”). Within a matter of years, the warning became\nreality: After being ordered to desegregate, Prince Edward\nCounty closed its public schools from the summer of 1959\nuntil the fall of 1964. See R. Sarratt, The Ordeal of De-\nsegregation 237 (1966). Despite this fact, the Court never\nbacked down from its rigid enforcement of the Equal\nProtection Clause’s antidiscrimination principle.\n   In this case, of course, Texas has not alleged that the\nUniversity will close if it is prohibited from discriminating\nbased on race. But even if it had, the foregoing cases\nmake clear that even that consequence would not justify\nits use of racial discrimination. It follows, a fortiori, that\nthe putative educational benefits of student body diversity\ncannot justify racial discrimination: If a State does not\nhave a compelling interest in the existence of a university,\nit certainly cannot have a compelling interest in the sup-\nposed benefits that might accrue to that university from\nracial discrimination. See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 361 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J.) (“[A] marginal improvement in legal\neducation cannot justify racial discrimination where the\nLaw School has no compelling interest either in its exis-\ntence or in its current educational and admissions poli-\ncies”). If the Court were actually applying strict scrutiny,\nit would require Texas either to close the University or to\nstop discriminating against applicants based on their race.\nThe Court has put other schools to that choice, and there\nis no reason to treat the University differently.\n                            2\n  It is also noteworthy that, in our desegregation cases,\nwe rejected arguments that are virtually identical to those\nadvanced by the University today.

See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity “pre-\npares students to become the next generation of leaders in\nan increasingly diverse society”). The segregationists\nlikewise defended segregation on the ground that it pro-\nvided more leadership opportunities for blacks. See, e.g.,\nBrief for Respondents in Sweatt 96 (“[A] very large group\nof Northern Negroes [comes] South to attend separate\ncolleges, suggesting that the Negro does not secure as\nwell-rounded a college life at a mixed college, and that the\nseparate college offers him positive advantages; that there\nis a more normal social life for the Negro in a separate\ncollege; that there is a greater opportunity for full partici-\npation and for the development of leadership; that the\nNegro is inwardly more ‘secure’ at a college of his own\npeople”); Brief for Appellees in Davis 25–26 (“The Negro\nchild gets an opportunity to participate in segregated\nschools that I have never seen accorded to him in non-\nsegregated schools. He is important, he holds offices, he\nis accepted by his fellows, he is on athletic teams, he has\na full place there” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThis argument was unavailing. It is irrelevant under the\nFourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed\nschools produce better leaders. Indeed, no court today\nwould accept the suggestion that segregation is permissi-\nble because historically black colleges produced Booker T.\nWashington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nand other prominent leaders. Likewise, the University’s\nracial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground\nthat it will produce better leaders.\n   The University also asserts that student body diversity\nimproves interracial relations. See, e.g., Brief for Re-\nspondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity promotes\n“cross-racial understanding” and breaks down racial and\nethnic stereotypes). In this argument, too, the University\n\f10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nrepeats arguments once marshaled in support of segrega-\ntion. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Davis 17 (“Virginia\nhas established segregation in certain fields as a part of\nher public policy to prevent violence and reduce resent-\nment. The result, in the view of an overwhelming Virginia\nmajority, has been to improve the relationship between\nthe different races”); id., at 25 (“If segregation be stricken\ndown, the general welfare will be definitely harmed\n. . . there would be more friction developed” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Brief for Respondents in\nSweatt 93 (“Texas has had no serious breaches of the\npeace in recent years in connection with its schools.

(“Con-\ntained within today’s majority opinion is the seed of a new\nconstitutional justification for a concept I thought long\nand rightly rejected—racial segregation”).

Today, the segre-\ngationists’ arguments would never be given serious considera-\ntion. But see M.

The Constitution does\nnot pander to faddish theories about whether race mixing\nis in the public interest. The Equal Protection Clause\nstrips States of all authority to use race as a factor in\nproviding education. All applicants must be treated equally\nunder the law, and no benefit in the eye of the beholder can\njustify racial discrimination.\n   This principle is neither new nor difficult to understand.\nIn 1868, decades before Plessy, the Iowa Supreme Court\nheld that schools may not discriminate against applicants\nbased on their skin color. In Clark v. Board of Directors,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1868), a school denied admission to a student\nbecause she was black, and “public sentiment [was] op-\nposed to the intermingling of white and colored children in\nthe same schools.” Id., at 269. The Iowa Supreme Court\nrejected that flimsy justification, holding that “all the\nyouths are equal before the law, and there is no discretion\nvested in the board . . . or elsewhere, to interfere with or\ndisturb that equality.” Id., at 277. “For the courts to\nsustain a board of school directors . . . in limiting the\nrights and privileges of persons by reason of their [race],\n\f14       FISHER v.

This simple, yet funda-\nmental, truth was lost on the Court in Plessy and Grutter.\n  I would overrule Grutter and hold that the University’s\nadmissions program violates the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause the University has not put forward a compelling\ninterest that could possibly justify racial discrimination.\n                              III\n   While I find the theory advanced by the University to\njustify racial discrimination facially inadequate, I also\nbelieve that its use of race has little to do with the alleged\neducational benefits of diversity. I suspect that the Uni-\nversity’s program is instead based on the benighted notion\nthat it is possible to tell when discrimination helps, rather\nthan hurts, racial minorities.

They argued, for example, that separate schools\nprotected black children from racist white students and\nteachers. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Briggs 33–34 (“ ‘I\nhave repeatedly seen wise and loving colored parents take\ninfinite pains to force their little children into schools\nwhere the white children, white teachers, and white par-\nents despised and resented the dark child, made mock of\nit, neglected or bullied it, and literally rendered its life a\nliving hell. Such parents want their child to “fight” this\nthing out,—but, dear God, at what a cost! . . . We shall get\na finer, better balance of spirit; an infinitely more capable\nand rounded personality by putting children in schools\nwhere they are wanted, and where they are happy and\ninspired, than in thrusting them into hells where they are\nridiculed and hated’ ” (quoting DuBois, Does the Negro\nNeed Separate Schools? 4 J. of Negro Educ. 328, 330–331\n(1935))); Tr. of Oral Arg. in Bolling v. Sharpe, O. T. 1952,\nNo. 413, p. 56 (“There was behind these [a]cts a kindly\nfeeling [and] an intention to help these people who had\n\f16       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nbeen in bondage. And there was and there still is an\nintention by the Congress to see that these children shall\nbe educated in a healthful atmosphere, in a wholesome\natmosphere, in a place where they are wanted, in a place\nwhere they will not be looked upon with hostility, in a\nplace where there will be a receptive atmosphere for learn-\ning for both races without the hostility that undoubtedly\nCongress thought might creep into these situations”). And\nthey even appealed to the fact that many blacks agreed\nthat separate schools were in the “best interests” of both\nraces. See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Davis 24–25 (“ ‘It\nhas been my experience, in working with the people of\nVirginia, including both white and Negro, that the cus-\ntoms and the habits and the traditions of Virginia citizens\nare such that they believe for the best interests of both the\nwhite and the Negro that the separate school is best’ ”).\n  Following in these inauspicious footsteps, the University\nwould have us believe that its discrimination is likewise\nbenign. I think the lesson of history is clear enough:\nRacial discrimination is never benign. “ ‘[B]enign’ carries\nwith it no independent meaning, but reflects only ac-\nceptance of the current generation’s conclusion that a\npolitically acceptable burden, imposed on particular citi-\nzens on the basis of race, is reasonable.” See Metro Broad­\ncasting, 497 U. S., at 610 (O’Connor, J., dissenting). It is\nfor this reason that the Court has repeatedly held that\nstrict scrutiny applies to all racial classifications, regard-\nless of whether the government has benevolent motives.\nSee, e.g., Johnson, 543 U. S., at 505 (“We have insisted on\nstrict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called ‘benign’\nracial classifications”); Adarand, 515 U. S., at 227 (“[A]ll\nracial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state,\nor local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a review-\ning court under strict scrutiny”); J. A. Croson, 488 U.

The University’s professed good intentions can-\nnot excuse its outright racial discrimination any more\nthan such intentions justified the now denounced argu-\nments of slaveholders and segregationists.\n                             B\n  While it does not, for constitutional purposes, matter\nwhether the University’s racial discrimination is benign, I\nnote that racial engineering does in fact have insidious\nconsequences. There can be no doubt that the University’s\ndiscrimination injures white and Asian applicants who are\ndenied admission because of their race. But I believe the\ninjury to those admitted under the University’s discrimi-\nnatory admissions program is even more harmful.\n  Blacks and Hispanics admitted to the University as a\nresult of racial discrimination are, on average, far less\nprepared than their white and Asian classmates. In the\nUniversity’s entering class of 2009, for example, among\nthe students admitted outside the Top Ten Percent plan,\nblacks scored at the 52d percentile of 2009 SAT takers\nnationwide, while Asians scored at the 93d percentile.\nBrief for Richard Sander et al. as Amici Curiae 3–4, and\nn. 4. Blacks had a mean GPA of 2.57 and a mean SAT\nscore of 1524; Hispanics had a mean GPA of 2.83 and a\nmean SAT score of 1794; whites had a mean GPA of 3.04\nand a mean SAT score of 1914; and Asians had a mean\nGPA of 3.07 and a mean SAT score of 1991.4 Ibid.\n  Tellingly, neither the University nor any of the 73 amici\nbriefs in support of racial discrimination has presented a\nshred of evidence that black and Hispanic students are\nable to close this substantial gap during their time at the\nUniversity. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflections on\nthe Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605–1608\n(1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial dis-\n——————\n  4 The lowest possible score on the SAT is 600, and the highest possi-\n\nble score is 2400.\n\f18       FISHER v.

Cole & E. Barber, Increasing Faculty Diversity:\nThe Occupational Choices of High-Achieving Minority\nStudents 124 (2003). There is no reason to believe this is\nnot the case at the University. The University and its\ndozens of amici are deafeningly silent on this point.\n   Furthermore, the University’s discrimination does\nnothing to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics\nwho have access to a college education generally. Instead,\nthe University’s discrimination has a pervasive shifting\neffect. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the\nWorld 145–146 (2004). The University admits minorities\nwho otherwise would have attended less selective colleges\nwhere they would have been more evenly matched. But,\nas a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispan-\nics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are\nplaced in a position where underperformance is all but\ninevitable because they are less academically prepared\nthan the white and Asian students with whom they must\ncompete. Setting aside the damage wreaked upon the self-\nconfidence of these overmatched students, there is no\nevidence that they learn more at the University than they\nwould have learned at other schools for which they were\nbetter prepared. Indeed, they may learn less.\n   The Court of Appeals believed that the University needed\nto enroll more blacks and Hispanics because they remained\n“clustered in certain programs.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240\n(CA5 2011) (“[N]early a quarter of the undergraduate\nstudents in [the University’s] College of Social Work are\nHispanic, and more than 10% are [black].

As the thorough opinions below show, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(CA5 2011); </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1498468/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the University’s admis-\nsions policy flexibly considers race only as a “factor of a\nfactor of a factor of a factor” in the calculus, id., at 608;\nfollowed a yearlong review through which the University\nreached the reasonable, good-faith judgment that suppos-\nedly race-neutral initiatives were insufficient to achieve,\nin appropriate measure, the educational benefits of student-\nbody diversity, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 225–226; and is sub-\nject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of\nrace remains necessary and proper to achieve the Uni-\nversity’s educational objectives, see id., at 226.3 Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke and the Court’s decision in\nGrutter require no further determinations. See Grutter,\n——————\n  3 As the Court said in Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (2003),\n\n“[n]arrow tailoring . . . require[s] serious, good faith consideration of\nworkable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the\nuniversity seeks.” But, Grutter also explained, it does not “require a\nuniversity to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence\n[and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities\nto members of all racial groups.” Ibid. I do not read the Court to\nsay otherwise. See ante, at 10 (acknowledging that, in determining\nwhether a race-conscious admissions policy satisfies Grutter’s narrow-\ntailoring requirement, “a court can take account of a university’s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions\nprocesses”).\n\f4         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n539 U. S., at 333–343; Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315–320.\n   The Court rightly declines to cast off the equal protec-\ntion framework settled in Grutter. See ante, at 5. Yet it\nstops short of reaching the conclusion that framework\nwarrants. Instead, the Court vacates the Court of Ap-\npeals’ judgment and remands for the Court of Appeals to\n“assess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence [to] prove that its admissions program is narrowly\ntailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.”\nAnte, at 13. As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already\ncompleted that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this\nCourt’s Bakke and Grutter pathmarkers, merits our\napprobation.4\n                      *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   4 Because the University’s admissions policy, in my view, is constitu-\n\ntional under Grutter, there is no need for the Court in this case “to\nrevisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether\ndesigned to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group,\nshould be subject to the same standard of judicial review.” 539 U. S., at\n346, n. (GINSBURG, J., concurring). See also Gratz v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“Actions designed to\nburden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly\nranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched\ndiscrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated.”).\n\f</pre>",
