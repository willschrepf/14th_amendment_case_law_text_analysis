Introduction\n\n      This case arises from an appeal and cross-appeal from\n\nmonetary decisions in a Divorce Decree.           David Hamilton\n\n(“Husband”) and Dorinda Hamilton (“Wife”) seek review of the\n\nIntermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) September 25, 2014\n\nJudgment on Appeal, filed pursuant to its August 29, 2014\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nMemorandum Opinion.     The ICA affirmed in part and vacated in\n\npart the June 7, 2013 Divorce Decree of the Family Court of the\n\nThird Circuit (“family court”).1\n\n     The parties dispute the impact of a multi-million dollar\n\ninheritance received by Husband on the family court’s\n\ndeterminations of property division, alimony, and attorney’s\n\nfees and costs.    With respect to property division, the family\n\ncourt found that a premarital economic partnership existed and\n\nimplied that proceeds from an illegal marijuana operation may\n\nhave constituted a portion of the marital real estate.            In\n\nultimately dividing and distributing the property, the family\n\ncourt awarded all inheritance funds remaining at trial to\n\nHusband as his marital separate property.         It credited Husband\n\nfor all sums withdrawn from his inheritance funds as a capital\n\ncontribution to the marital estate.        It then deducted these sums\n\nfrom the marital estate, thereby creating marital debt.            That\n\nmarital debt was then equally split between the parties,\n\nresulting in Wife owing Husband a substantial equalization\n\npayment.   The family court then found that equitable\n\nconsiderations justified a deviation from marital partnership\n\nprinciples and credited Wife with an amount equal to her\n\nequalization payment.     The family court awarded Wife spousal\n\nsupport during the pendency of the divorce proceedings and until\n\n     1\n           The Honorable Aley K. Auna, Jr., presided.\n\n                                     2\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nDecember 2016, and the court also awarded her attorney’s fees\n\nand costs.\n\n    On appeal, the ICA ruled that the family court’s premarital\n\neconomic partnership finding was erroneous because it was based\n\nin part on an illegal business enterprise.         The ICA vacated and\n\nremanded the portions of the Divorce Decree pertaining to\n\nproperty division and spousal support to the family court for\n\nrecalculation after segregating proceeds from the illegal\n\nmarijuana operation.\n\n    We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the ICA\n\nerred in vacating the property division and alimony awards to\n\nrequire a recalculation of these awards based on a segregation\n\nof proceeds from the illegal marijuana operation.           We also hold\n\nthat the family court erred, either by characterizing the entire\n\n$1,511,477 expended from Husband’s inheritance account as\n\nMarital Partnership Property or by characterizing the $2,051,293\n\nremaining in his inheritance account as Marital Separate\n\nProperty, because the $1,511,447 expended included payment of\n\ninheritance taxes on Husband’s entire inheritance, and if\n\ninheritance taxes are paid out of Marital Partnership Property,\n\nthe remaining inheritance cannot be classified as Marital\n\nSeparate Property.    We further hold that the family court erred\n\nin summarily ruling before trial that all funds expended by\n\nHusband from his Marital Separate Property inheritance account\n\n                                     3\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nconstituted Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which he\n\nwas entitled to be repaid, without requiring Husband to fulfill\n\nhis burden of establishing that such expenditures were in the\n\nnature of a contribution to or an investment in Marital\n\nPartnership Property, and then compounded the error by failing\n\nto allow and consider evidence of donative intent.           We also hold\n\nthat the family court erred in ordering an equal distribution of\n\nalleged partnership capital losses before deciding whether\n\nequitable considerations justified deviation from an equal\n\ndistribution.   Finally, we hold that the family court improperly\n\napplied marital partnership principles to fashion a property\n\ndivision award that was not just and equitable.          We find no\n\nerror in the award of attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n    We therefore affirm in part the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal to\n\nthe extent that it vacated the property division and alimony\n\nawards and remanded the case to the family court, but vacate the\n\nportion of the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal directing the family\n\ncourt on remand to segregate the proceeds of the alleged\n\nmarijuana operation from the property division.          We remand the\n\ncase to the family court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nII.    Background\n\n       Husband and Wife were married on June 21, 1985 (“date of\n\nmarriage”) and separated in June 2010.            The couple has two adult\n\nchildren.\n\n       The parties met in early 1976 in New Zealand and began\n\nliving together there soon after that.            At the time, Wife had\n\njust finished her final semester at the University of Hawai‘i at\n\nHilo, while Husband worked on repairing a home and a forest\n\nrestoration project.        Approximately four or five months later,\n\nthe parties moved to Massachusetts, where they lived and worked\n\non Husband’s family’s farm and store for about three months.\n\n       After leaving Massachusetts, the parties moved to the\n\nisland of Hawai‘i (“Big Island”) in November 1976, where Husband\n\nbegan working on a county road crew.            While on the Big Island,\n\nthe parties apparently started an illegal marijuana operation.\n\nWife testified that she was involved in the processing and\n\ntransportation of the marijuana.            Husband testified that the\n\nparties did not have a joint or mutual marijuana operation.                He\n\nindicated it was a sideline with a few friends that continued\n\nuntil his son was born in 1987.\n\n       At trial, the parties disputed whether marijuana proceeds\n\nwere used to purchase real property.           Wife testified that\n\nmarijuana proceeds were used to purchase multiple properties\n\nprior to the date of marriage, as well as one additional\n\n                                        5\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nproperty after the date of marriage, while Husband denied that\n\nallegation.    On one of the properties, purchased in 1978 and\n\ntitled in Husband’s name, the parties jointly constructed a two-\n\nstory house.\n\n     In 1990, five years after the date of marriage, Husband\n\nobtained his real estate brokerage license.           In 2003, he opened\n\nhis own real estate firm.       Husband testified that his income\n\ndeclined in 2006 due to a falling market and his father’s\n\npassing.   After Wife’s 2010 divorce filing, Husband reported his\n\ngross monthly income as $1,000.\n\n     Wife performed part-time work or was a housewife not\n\nemployed outside the home for much of the parties’ relationship.\n\nFrom approximately 1996 to 2009, Wife worked part-time at her\n\nchildren’s schools to obtain tuition assistance and health\n\ninsurance.    She also sold hand-painted clothing.          As of the date\n\nof final separation in contemplation of divorce (“date of final\n\nseparation”), she was collecting unemployment benefits.             At the\n\ndate of conclusion of the evidentiary portion of trial\n\n(“conclusion of trial”),2 she earned approximately $1,500 per\n\nmonth as a nanny.\n\n     Between 2007 and 2011, Husband inherited amounts totaling\n\n$3,550,770 from his parents’ estates.         He deposited the monies\n\n      2\n            The family court’s February 13, 2013 Order Re: Divorce Trial Held\non December 22 and 23, 2011 specified that December 22 and 23, 2011 should be\nconsidered the conclusion of trial.\n\n\n                                      6\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\ninto his separate Bank of Hawai‘i account (“inheritance\n\naccount”).      At the conclusion of trial, the inheritance account\n\nhad $2,051,293 remaining.\n\n     Prior to marriage, the parties filed no joint tax returns.\n\n     A.    Family Court Proceedings\n\n           1.     Pre-Trial Proceedings\n\n     On June 23, 2010, Wife filed a Complaint for Divorce.               She\n\nthen filed a motion for temporary relief, seeking, in part,\n\ntemporary spousal support.      In granting this request, the family\n\ncourt made the following finding:\n\n           Husband has historically used his existing inheritance\n           funds for payment of the marital expenses and Wife’s\n           support. Having reviewed Wife’s Income and Expense\n           statement filed, the [family court] finds that it would be\n           just and equitable to order that in addition to the above\n           support orders, Husband shall pay to Wife $2000 per month\n           in temporary spousal support beginning October 1, 2010.\n\n     Wife later moved for an advance of attorney’s fees,\n\nindicating a gross monthly income of $2,080.          Wife contended\n\nthat an advance for fees was necessary because Husband had filed\n\nmultiple pretrial motions for partial summary judgment.            The\n\nfamily court granted the request for attorney’s fees without\n\nprejudice to additional subsequent requests from Wife for good\n\ncause shown, and ordered Husband to advance $25,000 to Wife’s\n\ncounsel.\n\n     One of Husband’s pretrial motions for partial summary\n\njudgment, entitled “Husband’s Motion for Partial Summary\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nJudgment to Strike the Defense and/or Argument that Husband\n\nWasted his Category 3 Assets by Spending Money on Items Not\n\nRelated to the Marriage or the Children” (“Category 3 motion for\n\npartial summary judgment”), asserted that Wife could not provide\n\nadmissible evidence to establish that he “wasted” Category 3\n\nassets.3    In a declaration in support of the motion, Husband\n\nasserted:\n\n           In response to Plaintiff’s Request for Answers to Interrogatories\n     and for Production of Documents and Things, request number 9, I\n     itemized all of the disbursements I made from my inheritance money with\n     the exception of $88,597.80, which was disbursed for the marriage and\n     children’s expenses. This amount was not itemized in Defendant’s\n     response to Plaintiff’s interrogatory number 9, either because it\n     consisted of small dollar transactions too numerous to breakdown [sic],\n     e.g.[sic] $70 to KTA, etc [sic], or the credit card amounts were too\n     difficult to itemize the family or children expenses [sic] without\n     additional extensive effort, i.e.[sic] recreating the complete\n     accounting.\n\n     Although Husband’s motion summarily asserted that all sums\n\nexpended were for marital and children’s expenses, his response\n\nto interrogatory number 9 included amounts such as $111,885.00\n\nto the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Taxes and $326,540.00 to\n\nthe United States Treasury.       In addition, Husband’s heading for\n\nhis interrogatory 9 itemization of alleged Category 3\n\ndisbursements included the following characterization:\n\n“Category 3 Inheritance Account.”         After this heading, he\n\nincluded the inheritance tax payments.\n     3\n            Category 3 property includes the date-of acquisition net market\nvalue, plus or minus, of property separately acquired by one spouse by gift\nor inheritance during the marriage but excluding the net market value\nattributable to property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to\nthe other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party. Tougas v Tougas, 76\nHawai‘i 19, 27, 868 P.2d, 437, 445 (1994) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                      8\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n     Wife objected to the motion based on Husband’s failure to\n\nestablish prima facie entitlement to a grant of the motion and\n\ndue to the existence of genuine issues of material facts as to\n\nwhether all sums were expended for marital purposes.\n\nThe family court nevertheless granted this motion, ruling4 that\n\n“[Husband] spent his Category 3 assets for marital purposes[]\n\n[for] which he is entitled to be repaid.”\n\n           2.    Trial Order and Divorce Decree\n\n     After trial, on February 13, 2013, the family court entered\n\nits Order Re: Divorce Trial Held on December 22 and 23, 2011.\n\nThe family court found that the parties had formed a premarital\n\neconomic partnership in 1976 that lasted until they married in\n\n1985:\n\n                 9.   The parties met in New Zealand in 1976. They\n           began living together soon after they met. They continued\n           to cohabitate uninterrupted until DOM.\n\n                 10. The parties financially supported each other\n           during their cohabitation before DOM.\n\n                 11. They resided and worked together in New Zealand,\n           Massachusetts, and Hawaii prior to DOM.\n\n                 12. Husband worked at various jobs while Wife\n           contributed her services to their living arrangement. Wife\n           did, however, work on Husband’s parents’ farm and store in\n           Massachusetts, which contributed to the parties’ living\n           expenses and support.\n\n                 13. After moving to Hawaii and prior to DOM, Husband\n           worked for the County of Hawaii. The parties received food\n           stamps and Husband received a stipend from the State of\n           Hawaii. Wife was not employed, but contributed to the\n           parties’ living support.\n\n\n      4\n            The family court’s ruling appears in an order denying a different\namended motion for partial summary judgment.\n\n\n                                      9\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n                 14. In 1977, the parties started growing marijuana\n           and both worked on growing, processing, transporting the\n           finished product, and selling it.\n\n                 15. In 1978, the parties jointly purchased property\n           for $17,000. The parties jointly built a two-story house\n           on that property.\n\n                 16. During 1977 and 1978 the parties travelled\n           together to Thailand to look for orchids to establish an\n           orchid company with other business partners. They\n           purchased orchids and shipped them back to Hawaii.\n\n                 17. The parties also bought and sold other real\n           property prior to DOM from the proceeds of their joint\n           earnings.\n\n    From 2007 to 2011, Husband inherited from his parents’\n\nestates amounts totaling $3,550,770, and he deposited these\n\nfunds into his separate inheritance account.          As of the\n\nconclusion of trial, $2,051,293 remained in Husband’s\n\ninheritance account.     The family court found that the parties\n\nhad no written premarital or post-marital agreement, and\n\ncategorized this sum as Husband’s Marital Separate Property,\n\nfinding:\n\n                 24. Husband expressly classified his inherited funds\n           as his separate property by depositing them into the Bank\n           of Hawaii and labeled it “separate.” This account was\n           created solely for the purpose of holding and maintaining\n           Husband’s inheritance. No funds from any other source were\n           deposited into this account and this account was maintained\n           by itself and was funded only by interest earned.\n\n    The family court also found that the entire $1,499,477\n\nwithdrawn by Husband had been used “to invest in a business that\n\neventually failed and has no present value, for the purchase of\n\nthe Kala Cottage office, automobiles, and other assets, to fund\n\nthe Vanguard account in the amount of $50,000, to pay taxes, to\n\npay for the private school and post-high school education of the\n\n                                    10\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nparties’ children, and to support and maintain the family and\n\nthe family’s lifestyle.”      Consistent with its pretrial summary\n\njudgment ruling, the family court then found that the entire\n\namount was a Category 3 capital contribution credit.            With an\n\nadditional $12,000 for a 2009 cash gift from Husband’s mother to\n\nhim that had apparently been spent, the family court found that\n\nHusband’s Category 3 credits totaled $1,511,477.\n\n    As noted earlier, the family court had already ruled before\n\ntrial that Husband was entitled to be repaid all of his Category\n\n3 expenditures as having been used for marital purposes.            After\n\ntrial, the family court found that “[that] Wife did not meet her\n\nburden that Husband specifically intended these funds as a gift\n\nto her.\n\n    By the conclusion of trial, the value of the parties’\n\nassets was $466,522.     Because of its finding of $1,511,477 in\n\nCategory 3 expenditures by Husband, the family court found a\n\nmarital estate valued at negative $1,044.955, for which Wife\n\nwould otherwise have to repay Husband $522,478 as an\n\nequalization payment.     For property division, Wife was awarded\n\n$1,396 in bank accounts, a retirement account worth $13,000, and\n\na used Suzuki valued at $13,000.         Wife’s equalization payment\n\nincreased by half of those amounts, to a total of $549,873.\n\n    In addition to retaining the $2,051,293 remaining in his\n\ninheritance account, for property division, Husband was awarded\n\n                                    11\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n$57,835 in liquid cash accounts, a $8,645 IRA account, a $32,865\n\nChevy Camaro, a $1,000 Jeep Cherokee, the marital residence with\n\nequity of $243,781, and his office cottage then valued at\n\n$95,000.\n\n     With respect to the marital residence and the office\n\ncottage awarded to Husband, the family court found that in 2007,\n\nHusband had purchased it for $180,000 with inheritance funds.\n\nPrior to its purchase, Wife had co-signed a $250,000 equity loan\n\nsecured by the marital residence so that Husband could purchase\n\nthe cottage for his real estate business.          The equity loan was\n\nsupposed to be paid off from the anticipated inheritance, and\n\nWife testified she would not have agreed to co-sign the home\n\nequity loan if she had known that Husband was not going to pay\n\noff the equity loan with his inheritance.\n\n     Both parties were awarded their respective personal and\n\nhousehold property.\n\n     Because of the significant equalization payment that would\n\notherwise be owed by Wife to Husband, the family court then\n                                                                             5\ndetermined that sufficient “valid and relevant considerations”\n\n     5\n            Hawai‘i courts frequently refer to “valid and relevant\nconsiderations”, “valid and relevant circumstances”, and “equitable\nconsiderations” when discussing deviation from partnership principals.\nEquitable considerations permit the family court to deviate from the\npartnership model in dividing the parties’ Marital Partnership Property upon\ndivorce.

It ruled that giving Wife a credit\n\nequal to her equalization payment would be just and equitable.\n\nIn support of this deviation, the family court considered the\n\nfollowing:\n\n                  57. . . . Wife’s equalization payment to Husband is\n            substantial.\n\n                  58. Husband’s marital separate property and Category\n            1 and 3 capital contribution credits far exceed the value\n            of the property that is being allocated between the\n            parties.\n\n                  . . . .\n\n                  60. Wife is 57 years old and has been employed from\n            time to time at little over minimum wage over the years the\n            parties have been together. She needs further assistance\n            to meet her needs at the lifestyle she has been accustomed\n            to during the years the parties resided together.\n\n                  61. Husband is 59 years old, has worked all his\n            life, has owned and operated several businesses, and has\n            sufficient assets to support himself very well for a number\n            of years.\n\n                  62.   Husband’s employability is much better than\n            Wife’s.\n\n                  63. Husband is entitled a substantial capital\n            contribution credit due of his Category 1 and 3 assets.\n            Wife will be left with comparably very nominal assets.\n            Further, Husband has substantial marital separate property\n            he inherited from his parents’ estates.\n\n                  64. The parties started their PEP in 1976 and have\n            resided together for about 34 years. This is a relatively\n            long relationship.\n\n    As to spousal support, the family court made the following\n\nfindings:\n\n                  68. The parties have lived together since 1976 and\n            separated in 2010. Over these approximate 34 years, they\n            have enjoyed a modest life style; raising children\n            together, purchasing and selling real property, operating\n            several businesses, building the marital residence, etc.\n            Husband was the primary bread winner. Although Wife worked\n            from time to time, she remained primarily a homemaker the\n\n                                      13\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n            majority of the time and generally stayed at home to raise\n            the parties’ children and to support the family. The\n            children attended private school and they are now adults.\n\n                  69. When Wife was laid off from Parker School in\n            2009, she began receiving unemployment benefits. In 2011\n            she found work as a nanny and makes approximately $1,600\n            gross a month.\n\n                  70. Husband inherited over 3.5 million dollars from\n            his parents’ estates resulting in the parties enjoying a\n            relatively higher standard of living. Wife enjoyed regular\n            therapy, massages, new clothing, and elective cosmetic\n            dental work. Husband enjoyed an expensive vintage car and\n            multiple trips to Southeast Asia. They built a modest home\n            together.\n\n                  71. Wife has received $2,000 per month in court-\n            ordered temporary spousal support.\n\n                  72.   Wife is employable, albeit limited, because of\n            her age.\n\n                  73. After divorce, Wife will, however, need\n            continued support to pay for her health insurance and other\n            medical expenses as well as to assist her in other daily\n            and monthly expenses.\n\n                  74. Following the divorce, Wife will no longer have\n            the benefit of residing at the marital residence. She will\n            now need further financial assistance.\n\n                  75. Husband currently spends about $12,000 per month\n            for family support. He will now live at the marital\n            residence. His monthly expenses will go down.\n\n                  76. It would be just and equitable to award Wife\n            continued spousal support for a period of five years\n            commencing January 2012 (the month following trial), as\n            follows: $2,000 per month until Wife moves out of the\n            marital residence, then $3,000 per month commencing the\n            first month after Wife moves out of the marital residence\n            and through December 2017.\n\n     Later, in response to Husband’s motion for reconsideration,\n\nthe family court amended finding of fact No. 76 regarding\n\nspousal support to reduce Wife’s alimony award by one year.6\n\n\n     6\n            In addition to reducing the length of Wife’s alimony award,\nthe family court also added the following sentence: “Spousal support\nshall terminate upon Wife’s remarriage or upon the death of either\nHusband or Wife.”\n\n\n                                      14\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n     As to attorney’s fees and costs, the family court concluded\n\nthat because of Husband’s superior financial condition, it would\n\nbe just and equitable to award Wife a portion of her attorney’s\n\nfees and costs up to $5,000.        Wife’s counsel later submitted an\n\nitemized accounting of fees incurred through preparation of the\n\nclosing argument and reply, reflecting fees and costs totaling\n\n$86,126.17.7    On June 7, 2013, the Family Court entered its\n\nDivorce Decree.\n\n     B.    Appeal to the ICA\n\n     Wife appealed and Husband cross-appealed to the ICA.              The\n\nICA first addressed Husband’s cross-appeal.\n\n           1.    Husband’s Cross-Appeal\n\n     In his appeal, Husband argued that the family court erred\n\nwhen it (1) found a premarital economic partnership existed\n\nbased on illegal marijuana sales, (2) denied Husband Category 1\n\ncredits for property in his name at the date of marriage, (3)\n\nfound equitable deviation and waived the equalization payment,\n\nand (4) awarded Wife temporary spousal support and attorney’s\n\nfees before trial based on his inheritance.           Husband requested\n\nthat the family court’s decision be vacated and remanded and\n\nthat the attorneys’ fees and costs award be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n            Wife’s counsel stated that this amount did not include the\nattorney’s fees incurred after the reply, which were still accumulating.\n\n\n                                     15\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n    Noting that “[t]he family court considered the parties’\n\njoint financial acts, cohabitation since 1976, economic and non-\n\neconomic contributions, and other financial arrangements in\n\nfinding that the parties formed a premarital economic\n\npartnership in 1976,” the ICA stated that one basis for the\n\npremarital economic partnership finding was “the parties’\n\n‘growing, processing, transporting the finished product, and\n\nselling’ marijuana in 1977.”       Hamilton v. Hamilton, No. CAAP-13-\n\n1498, at 12 (App. Aug. 29, 2014) (mem.).         The ICA ruled that the\n\nfamily court’s equitable powers to divide marital property\n\npursuant to HRS § 580-47 do “not authorize [the family court] to\n\nprovide relief to parties to an illegal agreement.”           Hamilton,\n\nmem. op. at 13.    The ICA concluded, however, that “[t]he fact\n\nthat the parties’ illegal marijuana operation provided funds for\n\ntheir premarital economic partnership was not determinative of\n\nwhether the partnership was valid.”        Hamilton, mem. op. at 15.\n\nTherefore, the ICA rejected Husband’s argument that the illegal\n\nmarijuana business was the foundation of the premarital economic\n\npartnership on the bases that (1) “[n]o evidence presented\n\nreasonably supported a finding, that the purpose of the parties’\n\npremarital cohabitation and financial arrangements was the\n\ngrowing and sale of marijuana[,]” and (2) evidence of the\n\nparties’ premarital non-marijuana operations sufficiently\n\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nsupport a finding that a premarital economic partnership existed\n\nas a matter of law.     Id.\n\n    Although the ICA determined that the family court’s\n\npremarital economic partnership finding was not in error, it\n\nruled that the “finding that the parties’ marijuana operation\n\nwas part of that premarital economic partnership constitutes an\n\nerror as a matter of law.”      Id.    In this regard, the ICA ruled\n\nthat “[t]he family court should have segregated the illegal\n\nmarijuana operation from its consideration of the parties’\n\nalleged premarital economic partnership.”         Id. (citing 59A Am.\n\nJur. 2d Partnership § 54 at 233 (separation of mixed legal and\n\nillegal purposes)).     Therefore, the ICA concluded that the\n\npremarital economic partnership was “valid to the extent that it\n\nincluded legal partnership activities and its ‘legitimate\n\nobjectives’ can be segregated from the illegal marijuana\n\nbusiness.”   Hamilton, mem. op. at 16.       Noting the parties’\n\nconflicting testimony as to whether marijuana proceeds were used\n\nto purchase real property, the ICA explained that “[s]egregating\n\nthe economic contribution of the marijuana operation to the\n\nparties’ premarital economic partnership, however, would require\n\na credibility determination regarding [the parties’] testimony\n\nas to whether proceeds from the marijuana operations were used\n\nto purchase [certain properties] and, further, ascertaining how\n\nthe proceeds from the subsequent sales of those properties were\n\n                                      17\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nallocated to marital and legitimate premarital assets.”               Id.\n\nThe ICA vacated the family court’s Divorce Decree, in part, and\n\nremanded with instructions to re-assess the property division in\n\nconsideration of a premarital economic partnership excluding the\n\nmarijuana operation.        Hamilton, mem. op. at 16-17.\n\n       Next, as to equitable deviation, the ICA concluded that\n\n“the family court’s application of its finding that a premarital\n\neconomic partnership existed to support deviation from the\n\nPartnership Model constituted reversible error to the extent the\n\ndeviation was based on the illegal marijuana business.”\n\nHamilton, mem. op. at 17.\n\n       With respect to temporary alimony awarded to Wife during\n\nthe pendency of the divorce, the ICA held that “[t]here was no\n\nabuse of discretion in the family court’s consideration of\n\n[Husband’s] financial resources in ordering temporary spousal\n\nsupport for [Wife].”        Hamilton, mem. op. at 18.\n\n       As to attorney’s fees, the ICA rejected Husband’s argument,\n\nnoting a lack of authority in support of Husband’s contention\n\nthat the award would “invade” his inheritance, as well as the\n\nfamily court’s authority to award attorneys’ fees and costs\n\nduring the pendency of divorce proceedings under HRS § 580-9 and\n\ndivide property under HRS § 580-47(a).            Hamilton, mem. op. at\n\n18.    The ICA therefore concluded that the family court did not\n\nerr in “allocating responsibility for attorneys’ fees and costs\n\n                                       18\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\namongst the parties upon granting the divorce.”          Hamilton, mem.\n\nop. at 19.        Accordingly, the ICA held that “[t]he family court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by awarding [Wife] $5,000 in\n\nattorneys’ fees and costs in its Order Re: Divorce Trial.”             Id.\n\n       The ICA also rejected Husband’s argument that the Order Re:\n\nFees and Costs was void for lack of jurisdiction, explaining\n\nthat the “Order Re: Fees and Costs confirmed the $5,000 award\n\nthat had already been set in the [] Order Re: Divorce Trial . .\n\n. .”    Hamilton, mem. op. at 20.\n\n             2.     Wife’s Appeal\n\n       In her appeal, Wife argued that the family court erred when\n\nit (1) treated 60% of Husband’s inheritance as Marital Separate\n\nProperty and 40% as Category 3 assets, (2) subtracted capital\n\ncontributions in excess of the marital assets and found that\n\nWife owed Husband for half of the partnership loss, (3) awarded\n\nWife virtually nothing from the marital estate, and (4) awarded\n\ninsufficient post-divorce alimony.\n\n       The ICA rejected Wife’s arguments regarding Husband’s\n\ninheritance and capital contribution credits, holding that\n\n“[t]he family court did not abuse its discretion in determining\n\nthat [Husband] could be credited for expenditures from the\n\nInheritance Account for household expenses.”          Hamilton, mem. op.\n\nat 23.    Nevertheless, the ICA declined to affirm the family\n\ncourt’s findings in support of the property division on the\n\n                                     19\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nbasis that the court’s “reliance on [an erroneous premarital\n\neconomic partnership finding] to justify equitable deviation\n\nconstitutes reversible error.”       Id.; accord id. at 24.\n\n    Regarding post-divorce alimony, the ICA concluded that\n\n“[t]he family court considered all required factors and\n\ndetermined [Wife] would be able to find employment to support\n\nherself by the end of December 2016.”        Hamilton, mem. op. at 24\n\n(citing HRS § 580-47(a)).      Nevertheless, the ICA “vacate[d] the\n\n[post-divorce] alimony award as reversible error[]” to the\n\nextent that it “may have been premised, in part, on premarital\n\nactivities connected to the illegal marijuana operations,” and\n\ndirected the family court on remand to “exclude from its\n\ndetermination of [Wife’s] alimony award any consideration of\n\nthose premarital economic activities connected to the marijuana\n\noperation.”    Hamilton, mem. op. at 25.\n\n    Accordingly, the ICA vacated Parts Four and Five of the\n\nDivorce Decree regarding alimony and property division, affirmed\n\nall other parts, and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n    C.    Applications for Writs of Certiorari\n\n          1.    Husband’s Application\n\n    In summary, Husband argues that the family court erred in\n\n(1) finding that a premarital economic partnership based on an\n\nillegal marijuana business venture existed, where the parties\n\nkept their finances separate prior to marriage; (2) deviating\n\n                                    20\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nfrom the Marital Partnership Model based on his inheritance; (3)\n\nawarding Wife temporary alimony during the divorce proceeding;\n\n(4) and awarding Wife attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\n          2.    Wife’s Application\n\n    In summary, Wife alleges that the family court erred in its\n\n(1) characterization of all amounts inherited by Husband as\n\nMarital Separate Property, (2) characterization of the entire\n\n$1,511,477 apparently then expended by Husband from his\n\ninheritance as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which\n\nHusband is entitled to be repaid; (3) finding that Wife incurred\n\na debt to Husband payable by an equalization payment when their\n\nmarital partnership assets were insufficient to repay the\n\nalleged Category 3 expenditures; (4) application of equitable\n\ndeviation principles in it property division award; and (5)\n\nfailure to consider altering the amount and duration of alimony\n\nto compensate Wife for the one-sided property division.              Wife\n\nalso challenges the ICA’s decision to remand the case to the\n\nfamily court on the “minor issue” of the illegal marijuana\n\noperation, without addressing Husband’s $3.5 million\n\ninheritance.\n\n    We address the issues on certiorari as follows.\n\nIII. Standards of Review\n\n    A.    Family Court Decisions\n\n          Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in\n          making its decisions and those decisions will not be set\n\n                                    21\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,\n          we will not disturb the family court’s decision on appeal\n          unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of\n          law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party\n          litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of\n          reason.\n\nKakinami v. Kakinami, 127 Hawai‘i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705\n\n(2012) (quoting Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai‘i 41, 46, 137 P.3d\n\n355, 360 (2006)).\n\n          It is well established that a family court abuses its\n          discretion where “(1) the family court disregarded rules or\n          principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment\n          of a party litigant; (2) the family court failed to\n          exercise its equitable discretion; or (3) the family\n          court’s decision clearly exceeds the bounds of reason.”\n\nId. at 155-56, 276 P.3d at 724-25 (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n\nTougas v.

Property Division\n\n     Hawaii’s appellate courts “review the family court’s final\n\ndivision and distribution of the estate of the parties under the\n\nabuse of discretion standard, in view of the factors set forth\n\nin HRS § 580-47 and partnership principles.”          Tougas, 76 Hawai‘i\n\nat 26, 868 P.2d at 444 (quoting Gussin v. Gussin, 73 Haw. 470,\n\n486, 836 P.2d 484, 492 (1992) (footnote omitted)).           “The family\n\ncourt’s determination of whether facts present valid and\n\nrelevant considerations authorizing a deviation from the\n\npartnership model division is a question of law that this court\n\nreviews under the right/wrong standard of appellate review.”\n\nGordon v.

Jackson, 84 Hawai‘i 319, 332–33, 933\n\nP.2d 1353, 1366–67 (App. 1997)).\n\n       C.    Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n             The family court’s FOFs are reviewed on appeal under the\n             “clearly erroneous” standard. A FOF is clearly erroneous\n             when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support\n             the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support\n             of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left\n             with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n             made. “Substantial evidence” is credible evidence which is\n             of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a\n             person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.\n\n                    On the other hand, the family court’s COLs are\n                    reviewed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong\n                    standard.

Discussion\n\n       A.    Illegality and the Premarital Economic Partnership\n\n       The ICA ruled that although there was substantial other\n\nevidence of a premarital economic partnership, the property\n\ndivision and alimony awards needed to be recalculated to exclude\n\nconsideration of premarital economic activities connected to the\n\nmarijuana operation.\n\n       Husband argues that the ICA erred in concluding that (1)\n\nthe fact that the parties’ illegal marijuana operation provided\n\nfunds for their premarital economic partnership was not\n\ndeterminative of whether the partnership was valid; and (2)\n\nlegal partnership activities existed that could be segregated\n\n\n                                       23\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nfrom the marijuana operation.       He contends that “even a partial\n\nreliance on an illegal enterprise would be contrary to public\n\npolicy and would require a finding that no PEP existed.”            In\n\naddition, Husband asserts that insufficient evidence existed to\n\nsupport the premarital economic partnership insofar as “it is\n\nclear that both the parties did not intend to create a PEP.”\n\n    Wife contends that the ICA did not err in affirming the\n\npremarital economic partnership finding because (1) Husband’s\n\n“trial testimony flatly contradicts [his] position asserted on\n\nappeal[]” to the extent that Husband denied having a “joint or\n\nmutual marijuana operation” at trial and testified that\n\npremarital properties held in his name were purchased with\n\n“savings,” “not marijuana money[;]” (2) Husband failed to raise\n\nhis illegality argument below; and (3) Husband “cannot use this\n\ncouple’s marijuana business 25 years ago to eliminate the PEP,\n\nbut also demand $125,000 in Category 1 credits for assets\n\npurchased in his name before DOM with [marijuana proceeds].”                In\n\naddition, Wife asserts that the family court found independent\n\ngrounds for the premarital economic partnership.\n\n    It is true that, generally, courts will not enforce an\n\nillegal agreement.    According to the United States Supreme\n\nCourt, “[i]n case any action is brought in which it is necessary\n\nto prove the illegal contract in order to maintain the action,\n\ncourts will not enforce it, nor will they enforce any alleged\n\n                                    24\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nrights directly springing from such contract.”          McMullen v.\n\nHoffman, 174 U.S. 639, 654 (1899).        With respect to cases that\n\ninvolve partly illegal and partly legal partnership purposes,\n\nhowever, courts are split as to whether recovery is available to\n\nparties to the illegal transaction.        For example, although the\n\nCourt stated in McMullen that “[i]t has been sometimes said that\n\nwhere a contract, although it be illegal, has been fully\n\nexecuted between the parties, so that nothing remains thereof\n\nfor completion, if the plaintiff can recover from the defendant\n\nmoneys received by him without resorting to the contract the\n\ncourt will permit a recovery in such case[,]” 174 U.S. at 654-\n\n55, it held in Bruce’s Juices v. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743\n\n(1947) that “[w]here a contract is outlawed by statute or is\n\notherwise contrary to public policy, the illegality may be set\n\nup as a defense to a suit for enforcement despite the absence of\n\na legislative recognition of that defense.”          330 U.S. at 761.\n\n    The Court has also held, however, that where proceeds from\n\nan illegal operation have changed form, recovery may be possible\n\ndespite the initial illegality.       In Brooks v. Martin, 69 U.S. 70\n\n(1864), the Court held that “[a]fter a partnership contract\n\nconfessedly against public policy has been carried out, and\n\nmoney contributed by one of the partners has passed into other\n\nforms, . . . a partner, in whose hands the profits are, cannot\n\nrefuse to account for and divide them on the ground of the\n\n                                    25\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nillegal character of the original contract.”          69 U.S. at 71\n\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n    Hawai‘i cases have also addressed enforcement of illegal\n\ncontracts.   In Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawai‘i 289,\n\n30 P.3d 895 (2001), this court stated, “the general rule is that\n\nseverance of an illegal provision of a contract is warranted and\n\nthe lawful portion of the agreement is enforceable when the\n\nillegal provision is not central to the parties’ agreement and\n\nthe illegal provision does not involve serious moral turpitude,\n\nunless such a result is prohibited by statute.”          96 Hawai‘i at\n\n311, 30 P.3d at 917.     In analyzing the availability of relief to\n\nparties to an illegal transaction in Rego v. Bergstrom Music\n\nCo., 26 Haw. 407 (Terr. 1922), the territorial court initially\n\nexplained that recovery is not available to a plaintiff who\n\nresorts to an illegal transaction, either in whole or in part,\n\nto establish a prima facie case or defense despite joint\n\nparticipation by the opposing party.        26 Haw. at 410-11\n\n(“Neither a plaintiff nor a defendant may found his case, either\n\nin whole or in part, upon a fraudulent transaction, although his\n\nantagonist may have participated therein.” (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted)).       Despite holding that a party may\n\nnot base his or her case upon an illegal transaction, however,\n\nRego further held that “a plaintiff may recover if he is able to\n\nmake out his case without calling upon the fraud for help[;\n\n                                    26\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nhowever,] he must fail if such help is indispensable.”            26 Haw.\n\nat 411.\n\n     In this case, Wife is not requesting enforcement of an\n\nillegal agreement.    Rather, she requests a division of marital\n\nproperty and an alimony award.       In a divorce case, the family\n\ncourt’s obligation is to rule in a “just and equitable” manner.\n\nHRS § 580-47(a).    At trial, Husband denied that proceeds from\n\nthe marijuana operation were included in any marital property,\n\ndenied keeping records, and denied depositing marijuana proceeds\n\ninto bank accounts.     Thus, it appears that the ICA’s mandate to\n\nexclude consideration of such proceeds to recalculate property\n\ndivision and alimony is impracticable.         In addition, the illegal\n\nenterprise is no longer in existence, and Wife is requesting a\n\nproperty division award from proceeds that have changed form,\n\ninto real estate.\n\n     Furthermore, as the ICA otherwise correctly concluded,\n\nsubstantial other evidence of the parties’ premarital, non-\n\nmarijuana operations sufficiently supports the finding that a\n\npremarital economic partnership existed as a matter of law.\n\nFisher, 111 Hawai‘i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 (quoting In re Doe, 95\n\nHawai‘i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001)) (“‘Substantial\n\nevidence’ is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality\n\nand probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to\n\nsupport a conclusion.”).\n\n                                    27\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n       “[A] premarital economic partnership is formed when, ‘prior\n\nto their subsequent marriage, [two people] cohabit and apply\n\ntheir financial resources as well as their individual energies\n\nto and for the benefit of each other’s person, assets, and\n\nliabilities.’”         Collins v. Wassell, 133 Hawai‘i 34, 45, 323 P.3d\n\n1216, 1227 (2014) (citation omitted).            The formation of a\n\npremarital economic partnership depends upon the parties’\n\nintentions.      Id.     In determining whether the parties intended to\n\nform a premarital economic partnership, in the absence of an\n\nexpress agreement, “the family court must consider the totality\n\nof the circumstances, including both the economic and non-\n\neconomic contributions of the parties.”            133 Hawai‘i at 46, 323\n\nP.3d at 1228 (citation omitted).            “[R]elevant considerations may\n\ninclude, but are not limited to, joint acts of a financial\n\nnature, the duration of cohabitation, whether — and the extent\n\nto which — finances were commingled, economic and non-economic\n\ncontributions to the household for the couple’s mutual benefit,\n\nand how the couple treated finances before and after marriage.”\n\nId.\n\n       First, the family court’s findings that the parties resided\n\nand worked together in New Zealand, Massachusetts, and Hawai‘i\n\nprior to their date of marriage, and financially supported each\n\nother during their cohabitation before marriage are supported by\n\nthe parties’ testimony.         The testimony established that over the\n\n                                       28\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\ncourse of one year, the parties met in New Zealand, flew to\n\nHonolulu where they stayed with Wife’s mother for one to two\n\nweeks, flew to Los Angeles where they purchased a van with funds\n\nprovided by Wife’s mother, drove to Husband’s family’s farm in\n\nMassachusetts where they worked unpaid, and eventually moved to\n\nHawai‘i where they jointly purchased property.          In addition to\n\nworking at Husband’s family’s store, Wife also helped with the\n\nconstruction of a house purchased in 1978 and traveled to\n\nThailand with Husband to research orchids for a prospective\n\nbusiness.   Therefore, as the ICA stated, “[t]he family court\n\nconsidered the parties’ joint financial acts, cohabitation since\n\n1976, economic and non-economic contributions, and other\n\nfinancial arrangements in finding that the parties formed a\n\npremarital economic partnership in 1976[.]”          Accordingly, the\n\nICA correctly concluded that substantial evidence of the\n\nparties’ pre-marital, non-marijuana operations sufficiently\n\nsupported the premarital economic partnership finding.            See\n\nFisher, 111 Hawai‘i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360.\n\n     Thus, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe ICA erred in vacating the property division and alimony\n\nawards because the family court had not excluded possible\n\nproceeds from an illegal marijuana operation.          Although the ICA\n\nerred in setting aside the family court’s property division\n\n\n\n                                    29\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\naward based on illegality, we affirm the vacating of these\n\nawards for the reasons provided below.\n\n     B.    Property Division\n\n           1.    Overview of Hawaii’s Property Division Framework\n\n     In Hawai‘i, “[t]here is . . . no fixed rule for determining\n\nthe amount of property to be awarded each spouse in a divorce\n\naction other than as set forth in HRS § 580–47.”            Gussin, 73\n\nHaw. at 479, 836 P.2d at 489 (citation omitted).            Under HRS §\n\n580-47 (Supp. 2011),8 the family court has wide discretion to\n\ndivide Marital Partnership Property in a manner that is “just\n\nand equitable” under the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\nTougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 26, 868 P.2d 444.          “In addition to HRS §\n\n580–47, Hawai‘i case law has created a framework based on\n\npartnership principles that provides further guidance for family\n\ncourts to use in dividing property upon divorce.”            Kakinami, 127\n\nHawai‘i at 137, 276 P.3d at 706.

In\n\ndivorce proceedings regarding division and distribution of the\n\nparties’ estate, partnership principles guide and limit the\n\nrange of the family court’s choices.”        Gussin, 73 Haw. at 470-\n\n71, 836 P.2d at 485-86.     Moreover, “the family court shall\n\nconsider ‘the respective merits of the parties, the relative\n\nabilities of the parties, the condition in which each party will\n\nbe left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party\n\nfor the benefit of the children of the parties, . . . and all\n\nother circumstances of the case.’”        HRS § 580–47(a).\n\n    The Marital Partnership Model recognizes the following\n\ngeneral classifications of property in a divorce proceeding:\n\n          Premarital Separate Property. This was the property owned\n          by each spouse immediately prior to their marriage or\n          cohabitation that was concluded by their marriage. Upon\n          marriage, this property became either Marital Separate\n          Property or Marital Partnership Property.\n\n          Marital Separate Property. This is the following property\n          owned by one or both of the spouses at the time of the\n          divorce:\n\n                a. All property that was excluded from the marital\n                partnership by an agreement in conformity with the\n                Hawai‘i Uniform Premarital Agreement Act (HUPAA), HRS\n                chapter 572D (Supp. 1992)[;]\n\n                . . . .\n\n                b.

The net market value (NMV), plus or minus, of\n          all property separately owned by one spouse on the date of\n          marriage (DOM) but excluding the NMV attributable to\n          property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner\n          to the other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.\n\n          Category 2. The increase in the NMV of all property whose\n          NMV on the DOM is included in category 1 and that the owner\n          separately owns continuously from the DOM to the DOCOEPOT\n          [date of the conclusion of the evidentiary part of the\n          trial]\n\n          Category 3. The date-of-acquisition NMV, plus or minus, of\n          property separately acquired by gift or inheritance during\n          the marriage but excluding the NMV attributable to property\n          that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to the\n          other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.\n\n          Category 4. The increase in the NMV of all property whose\n          NMV on the date of acquisition during the marriage is\n\n\n\n                                    32\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n            included in category 3 and that the owner separately owns\n            continuously from the date of acquisition to the DOCOEPOT.\n\n            Category 5. The difference between the NMVs, plus or minus,\n            of all property owned by one or both of the spouses on the\n            DOCOEPOT minus the NMVs, plus or minus, includable in\n            categories 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 27, 868 P.2d at 445 (citation omitted).\n\nThe significance of these category classifications is as\n\nfollows:\n\n            the NMVs in Categories 1 and 3 are the parties’ “capital\n            contributions,” and pursuant to general partnership law,\n            they are returned to each spouse. Categories 2 and 4 are\n            the “during-the marriage increase in NMVs of the Categories\n            1 and 3 Properties owned at DOCOEPOT[,]” which similar to\n            partnership profits, are generally to be shared equally. In\n            sum, this court stated, “if there is no agreement between\n            the husband and wife defining the respective property\n            interests, partnership principles dictate an equal division\n            of the marital estate where the only facts proved are the\n            marriage itself and the existence of jointly owned\n            property.”\n\nKakinami, 127 Hawai‘i at 138, 276 P.3d at 707 (internal citations\n\nomitted) (quoting Tougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 27-28, 868 P.2d at 445-\n\n46).\n\n       We recently reaffirmed the manner in which the family court\n\nis to address the division of property, as follows:\n\n                  The partnership model requires the family court to\n            first find all of the facts necessary for categorization of\n            the properties and assignment of the relevant net market\n            values. Second, the court must identify any equitable\n            considerations justifying deviation from an equal\n            distribution. Third, the court must “decide whether or not\n            there will be a deviation,” and in its fourth step, the\n            court decides the extent of any deviation.\n\nGordon, 135 Hawai‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018 (internal citations\n\nomitted) (citing Jackson, 84 Hawai‘i at 332, 933 P.2d at 1367).\n\n“Each partner’s individual contributions to the marriage, i.e.,\n\n\n                                     33\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nthe values of Category 1 and Category 3, are to be repaid to the\n\ncontributing spouse absent equitable considerations justifying a\n\ndeviation.”      135 Hawai‘i at 349, 350 P.3d at 1017 (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n     We address the parties’ arguments in light of these guiding\n\nprinciples.\n\n\n            2.

Funds Remaining in Husband’s Account\n     Wife alleges that the family court erred in characterizing\n\nthe $2,051,293 remaining in Husband’s inheritance account as\n\nMarital Separate Property, instead of characterizing it as\n\nMarital Partnership Property subject to division in this\n\ndivorce.    In Kakinami, this court clarified the distinction\n\nbetween Marital Separate Property and “separately owned” Marital\n\nPartnership Property,9 and addressed the issue of whether Marital\n\n\n     9\n            “Separately owned” Marital Partnership Property is Category 1 or\n3 Marital Partnership Property that may be titled in the name of one spouse.\nAs Marital Partnership Property, such property is subject to division in a\ndivorce proceeding.

Rev. 318, 393 (1984).\n\n\n                                     34\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nSeparate Property can be awarded to the non-owner spouse in\n\ndivorce.   A majority of this court held that Marital Separate\n\nProperty is a narrow category of separate property “that has\n\nbeen excluded from the marital partnership, and thus, not\n\nsubject to division.”     127 Hawai‘i at 142, 276 P.3d at 711.         See\n\nalso 127 Hawai‘i at 141 n.9, 276 P.3d at 710 n.9 (“Marital\n\nSeparate Property is a narrow category of ‘separate property’\n\nthat, in our view, provides a practical means of segregating\n\ncertain property from the marital estate, the segregation of\n\nwhich can influence the equitable distribution of the parties’\n\nother assets.”).    Although Marital Separate Property is not\n\nsubject to division, if marital assets are used to maintain a\n\ngift or inheritance, then the gift or inheritance is subject to\n\ndivision as Marital Partnership Property:\n\n           if a party receives a gift or inheritance during the\n           marriage, but the party does not expressly classify that\n           gift or inheritance as separate property, or uses marital\n           assets or efforts to maintain that gift or inheritance,\n           then the gift or inheritance would be subject to division\n           as Marital Partnership Property.\n\nKakinami, 127 Hawai‘i at 141, 276 P.3d at 710.\n\n     In this case, Husband placed his inheritance funds in a\n\nseparate account, and labelled it as such.         The family court\n\nruled that the $2,051,293 remaining in Husband’s “separate”\n\ninheritance account was Marital Separate Property because the\n\naccount had been created solely for the purpose of holding and\n\nmaintaining his inheritance, no funds from any other source were\n\n                                    35\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\ndeposited into the account, and the account was maintained by\n\nitself and funded only by interest earned.         If, as stated above,\n\nhowever, “marital assets” were used to maintain the inheritance,\n\nthen the inheritance is subject to division as Marital\n\nPartnership Property.\n\n    At trial, Wife’s forensic accounting expert testified\n\npursuant to his report that a total of $463,455 had been paid\n\nfor Husband’s inheritance taxes.         He referenced his report,\n\nwhich included the itemized listing in Husband’s answers to\n\ninterrogatory number 9.     The inheritance taxes were included in\n\nthe amounts that the family court had ruled, before and after\n\ntrial, were “Category 3 assets [used] for marital purposes for\n\nwhich Husband is entitled to be repaid.”\n\n    Thus, those alleged “Category 3” disbursements included the\n\n$463,455 paid by Husband as inheritance taxes for his entire\n\ninheritance.   The entire $2,051,293 remaining in that\n\ninheritance was nonetheless characterized by the family court as\n\n“Marital Separate Property.”       Pursuant to Kakinami, however, if\n\na party uses marital assets to maintain an inheritance, the\n\ninheritance is no longer Marital Separate Property, but becomes\n\nsubject to division as Marital Partnership Property.            Thus, if\n\nthe $463,455 in inheritance taxes for the entire inheritance\n\ncame out of Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which\n\nHusband was entitled to be repaid, as ruled by the family court,\n\n                                    36\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nthen Marital Partnership Property was used to maintain the\n\n“separate” inheritance account, disqualifying the remaining\n\nfunds from being characterized as Marital Separate Property.\n\n    In order for the $2,051.293 remaining in Husband’s\n\ninheritance account to be his Marital Separate Property, as\n\nruled by the family court, the $463,455 paid as inheritance\n\ntaxes had to be excluded from Category 3 Marital Partnership\n\nProperty.   Thus, we hold that the family court erred, either by\n\ncharacterizing the entire $1,511,477 expended from Husband’s\n\ninheritance account as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property\n\nor by characterizing the $2,051,293 remaining in the account as\n\nMarital Separate Property.      To reiterate, if inheritance taxes\n\nare paid out of Marital Partnership Property, the inheritance\n\ncannot be classified as Marital Separate Property.\n\n    We therefore vacate the property division award.             The\n\nfamily court must, on remand, address this inconsistency in its\n\ndecision.\n\n                b.    Funds Expended from Husband’s account\n\n    There are additional issues that must be addressed on\n\nremand with respect to the $1,511,447 expended from Husband’s\n\naccount, which the family court characterized in its entirety as\n\nCategory 3 Marital Partnership Property.\n\n    Under the Marital Partnership Model, each partner is\n\nentitled to be repaid his or her contributions to partnership\n\n                                    37\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nproperty, whether made by way of capital or advances.            Tougas,\n\n76 Hawai‘i at 27, 868 P.2d at 445.       Under partnership principles,\n\nHusband has the burden of proving that he contributed property\n\nto the marital partnership and of establishing the property’s\n\nvalue at the time of contribution.        See Mark IV Pictures, Inc.\n\nv. C.I.R., 969 F.2d 669, 672 (8th Cir. 1992) (“The [partner]\n\nbears the burden of proving that he contributed property to the\n\npartnership and of establishing the property’s value at the time\n\nof contribution.”).     According to Epp v. Epp, 80 Hawai‘i 79, 905\n\nP.2d 54 (App. 1995), “[u]nder the Partnership Model, a spouse’s\n\nCategory 1 and 3 NMVs are that spouse’s ‘partner’s\n\ncontributions’ to the Marital Partnership Property that,\n\nassuming all relevant and valid considerations are equal, are\n\nrepaid to the contributing spouse-partner . . . .”           80 Hawai‘i at\n\n82, 905 P.2d at 57.     In addition, pursuant to Wong v. Wong, 87\n\nHawai‘i 475, 960 P.2d 145 (App. 1998), “a [marital] partner who\n\ninvests money into partnership accounts and/or real and/or\n\npersonal property into the partnership name or the names of the\n\npartners does not thereby gift the invested money and/or real\n\nand/or personal property to his/her partners.”          87 Hawai‘i at\n\n482, 960 P.2d at 152 (emphasis added).\n\n     Therefore, as a threshold issue, in order to be categorized\n\nas Category 3 Marital Partnership Property, Marital Separate\n\nProperty must be expended as a contribution to or an investment\n\n                                    38\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nin Marital Partnership Property.         This would include\n\nexpenditures for down payments, improvements, or toward the\n\nprincipal of loans related to Marital Partnership Property real\n\nestate, expenditures for Marital Partnership Property stock or\n\nbusiness interests, or other advances or payments toward Marital\n\nPartnership real or personal property or Marital Partnership\n\ninvestments.    Accordingly, expenditures for things such as a\n\nspouse’s or children’s educations, meals, trips, socializing,\n\nentertainment, requirements for daily living, etc., do not\n\nqualify, unless they are in the nature of a contribution to or\n\ninvestment in Marital Partnership Property.\n\n    In this case, the family court summarily categorized all\n\nexpenditures made by Husband from his Marital Separate Property\n\naccount as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which he\n\nwas entitled to be repaid upon divorce as a capital\n\ncontribution.    This already improperly included the $463,455\n\npaid as inheritance taxes, as noted in Section IV.B.2.a above.\n\nIt also appears to have included expenditures for Wife and the\n\nchildren’s trips, private school and university tuition and\n\nexpenses, cars, extracurricular activities, restaurant meals,\n\nbirthday and holiday presents, etc.         This does not comport with\n\nour case law, as explained above.        If such sums are\n\nautomatically characterized as Category 3 Marital Partnership\n\nProperty, a wealthy spouse could summarily be entitled to\n\n                                    39\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nreimbursement for half of all sums arguably expended on behalf\n\nof the spouse or children upon divorce.         It would be highly\n\nunusual for a wealthy spouse to make expenditures during a\n\nmarriage with a non-wealthy spouse for items not related to\n\ninvestment funds or assets while expecting to be repaid half of\n\nsuch expenditures upon divorce.       It defies logic to allow a\n\nwealthy spouse to make substantial expenditures that a non-\n\nwealthy spouse would never choose to make, has no control over,\n\nand probably never envisioned having to repay, and then to order\n\nthe non-wealthy spouse to reimburse the wealthy spouse for half\n\nof such expenditures at the time of divorce.          Under our case\n\nlaw, expenditures made from a Marital Separate Property account\n\nqualify for characterization as Category 3 Marital Partnership\n\nProperty only where they are in the nature of a contribution to\n\nor an investment in Marital Partnership Property.\n\n    Even if expenditures pass the threshold of being able to\n\nqualify as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property, the family\n\ncourt must still address the secondary issue of whether they\n\nwere actually contributions or investments with an expectation\n\nof repayment upon divorce.      In this regard,      Category 3 Marital\n\nPartnership Property includes property separately acquired by\n\ngift or inheritance during the marriage, but excludes the net\n\nmarket value attributable to property “that is subsequently\n\nlegally gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to both\n\n                                    40\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nspouses, or to a third party.”       Tougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 27, 868\n\nP.2d at 445 (emphasis added, citation omitted).          To constitute\n\na gift, there must be:     (1) donative intent; (2) delivery; and\n\n(3) acceptance.    76 Hawai‘i at 27, 31, 868 P.2d at 445, 449.\n\n    In this case, the family court first erroneously ruled that\n\nall of Husband’s expenditures from the Marital Separate Property\n\naccount qualified as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property\n\nwithout examining the expenditures to ascertain whether they\n\nwere in the nature of contributions to or investments in Marital\n\nPartnership Property.     The family court then also erred by\n\nruling, before hearing evidence on donative intent, that Husband\n\nwas entitled to be repaid the entire $1,511,447 expended from\n\nhis inheritance account.      Even though Wife briefly attempted to\n\ntestify at trial that Husband had not expected to be paid back\n\nany of this money, the family court had already ruled before\n\ntrial that none of these amounts were gifts, effectively\n\nprecluding evidence and argument on either issue.\n\n    Thus, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe family court erred in ruling before trial that all funds\n\nexpended by Husband from his Marital Separate Property\n\nconstituted Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which he\n\nwas entitled to be repaid.      Upon remand, the family court must\n\nalso address the two issues discussed in this section.\n\n\n\n                                    41\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          3.     Equitable Deviation\n\n    The family court followed an erroneous approach to\n\nequitable deviation.     As stated above, the partnership model\n\nrequires the family court to “identify any equitable\n\nconsiderations justifying deviation from an equal distribution”\n\nof the marital estate before deciding “whether or not there will\n\nbe a deviation[.]”     Gordon, 135 Hawai‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018\n\n(internal citations omitted).      If the family court decides\n\nequitable considerations justify deviation from an equal\n\ndistribution, then it must “decide[] the extent of any\n\ndeviation.”    Id.\n\n    In this case, the family court first ordered an equal\n\ndistribution of alleged partnership losses, to the extent it\n\nruled that Husband was entitled to an equalization payment from\n\nWife of $549,873, before deciding whether equitable\n\nconsiderations justified deviation from such an equal\n\ndistribution.\n\n    Whether equitable considerations exist to justify deviation\n\nmust be determined, however, at the time the family court\n\ndecides whether to credit one partner for all of his or her\n\ncapital contributions, whether and how to distribute marital\n\nassets, and whether to award alimony.        See Gordon, 135 Hawai‘i at\n\n349, 350 P.3d at 1017 (“Each partner’s individual contributions\n\nto the marriage, i.e., the values of Category 1 and Category 3,\n\n                                    42\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nare to be repaid to the contributing spouse absent equitable\n\nconsiderations justifying a deviation.”).         In determining\n\nwhether the circumstances justify deviation from the partnership\n\nmodel, the family court must consider the following:            the\n\nrespective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the\n\nparties, the condition in which each party will be left by the\n\ndivorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit\n\nof the children of the parties, and all other circumstances of\n\nthe case.   135 Hawai‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018.         See also\n\nTougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 32, 868 P.2d at 450 (“The court may,\n\nnevertheless, alter alimony, child support and . . . the\n\nultimate distribution of the marital estate based on the\n\nrespective separate conditions of the spouses.”).\n\n     In this case, the family court should have considered\n\nwhether equitable considerations justifying deviation from an\n\nequal distribution of Marital Partnership Property existed\n\nbefore ordering a 100% credit of Husband’s alleged Category 3\n\ncontributions.    In this regard, Husband’s arguments based on\n\nWong, 87 Hawai‘i 475, 960 P.2d 145, are unpersuasive.           In that\n\ncase, the family court did not award the husband the full value\n\nof his capital contribution.      In Wong, a husband and wife\n\njointly purchased two parcels of real property with $400,000 for\n\ndown payments received from the husband’s parents.           Upon\n\ndivorce, the family court ruled that the $400,000 was the\n\n                                    43\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nhusband’s Category 3 property.       87 Hawai‘i at 480, 960 P.2d at\n\n150.    The family court recognized that “[i]f [the husband] were\n\nto be returned his capital contribution, not only would [the\n\nhusband] be awarded all of the parties’ assets but [the wife]\n\nwould also need to reimburse [the husband] about $109,000,\n\nbecause [] the current net market value of the marital estate”\n\nhad declined.   Id.\n\n       This statement does not require the family court’s\n\ndeduction of capital contributions in excess of the marital\n\nestate, as Husband asserts.      In ultimately dividing the marital\n\nestate, the family court in Wong awarded the husband three out\n\nof four jointly owned properties, one of which had a negative\n\nnet market value.     The value of real property awarded to each\n\nspouse totaled $96,454 to the husband and $81,000 to the wife.\n\nSee id.   In affirming the property division on appeal, the ICA\n\nnoted that the husband left the marriage with less than his\n\ncapital contribution, while the wife left with “much more” than\n\nher negative capital contribution.        Id.   Thus, contrary to\n\nHusband’s assertion, Wong does not stand for the proposition\n\nthat a complete return of capital contributions is always\n\nrequired.    Rather, pursuant to the principles above, the family\n\ncourt must first decide whether equitable considerations justify\n\ndeviation from such an equal distribution of marital assets.\n\n\n\n                                    44\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n    Following the proper process could have significantly\n\ndifferent results for property division.         For example, in this\n\ncase, the family court could have found equitable considerations\n\njustifying departure from an equal distribution of partnership\n\nproperty based on the fact that Wife had virtually no assets and\n\nwould be left without a home in which to reside if an equal\n\ndistribution was made, before ordering a 100% credit of\n\nHusband’s alleged Category 3 contributions.          The family court\n\ncould then have decided the extent of the deviation with a view\n\ntoward reaching a just and equitable result, as more fully\n\ndiscussed in Section IV.B.5 below.        Instead, the family court\n\nordered an equal distribution of the alleged partnership losses.\n\n    Therefore, we also hold that the family court erred in\n\nordering an equal distribution of alleged partnership losses\n\nbefore deciding whether equitable considerations justified\n\ndeviation from an equal distribution.        On remand, the family\n\ncourt must first address whether any equitable considerations\n\njustifying deviation from an equal distribution exist, then\n\naddress whether or not there will be a deviation, then decide\n\nthe extent of any deviation.\n\n          4.    Consideration of Husband’s Inheritance to Deviate\n                from the Marital Partnership Model\n    Husband argues that the ICA erred in affirming the family\n\ncourt’s deviation from the Marital Partnership Model based on\n\n\n\n                                    45\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nhis Marital Separate Property inheritance.         He requests a\n\ndetermination that the family court’s reliance on his\n\ninheritance to justify a deviation was erroneous, or\n\nalternatively, that the property division be vacated and\n\nremanded with instructions to modify the equalization payment to\n\neliminate any consideration of his inheritance.\n\n     In response, Wife argues that Husband unfairly received\n\nboth 100% of his remaining Marital Separate Property inheritance\n\nand 100% of the Marital Partnership Property.          She contends that\n\nshe would have received at least 50% of the approximately\n\n$450,000 marital assets if they had filed for divorce before\n\nHusband received the inheritance.\n\n     Although we have already set aside the family court’s\n\nproperty division, we address these arguments to provide\n\nguidance on remand.     In Kakinami, we affirmed the ICA’s ruling\n\nthat “the mere existence of [] an inheritance does not, without\n\nmore, mandate deviation from the Marital Partnership Model.”\n\n127 Hawai‘i at 143, 276 P.3d at 712 (internal quotation marks and\n\nbrackets omitted) (quoting Kakinami v. Kakinami, No. 29340 (App.\n\nMay 11, 2011) (SDO)).     This court also stated, however, that\n\n“although Marital Separate Property cannot be awarded to the\n\nnon-owner spouse [in divorce], it can influence the division of\n\nMarital Partnership Property.”       127 Hawai‘i at 142, 276 P.3d at\n\n711 (emphasis added).

Thus, the deviation was not based on the mere\n\nexistence of Husband’s inheritance.        127 Hawai‘i at 143, 276 P.3d\n\nat 712.   Therefore, the family court did not err in considering\n\nthe existence of Husband’s Marital Separate Property inheritance\n\nto deviate from partnership principles.\n\n            5.   A Property Division Award Must Be Just and\n                 Equitable\n     Under HRS § 580-47, the family court has wide discretion to\n\ndivide Marital Partnership Property in a manner that is “just\n\nand equitable” under the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\n“In addition to HRS § 580–47, Hawai‘i case law has created a\n\nframework based on partnership principles that provides further\n\nguidance for family courts to use in dividing property upon\n\ndivorce.”    Kakinami, 127 Hawai‘i at 137, 276 P.3d at 706; Gussin,\n\n73 Haw. at 471, 836 P.2d at 486 (“The partnership model of\n\nmarriage provides the necessary guidance to the family court in\n\nexercising its discretion and for appellate review.”).\n\n     Under the Marital Partnership Model, “[m]arriage is a\n\npartnership to which both parties bring their financial\n\nresources as well as their individual energies and efforts.

(emphasis added).\n\n    With respect to Wife’s assertion that the family court\n\nerred in failing to divide and distribute Husband’s inheritance\n\nin a just and equitable manner, she cites to Carson v. Carson,\n\n50 Haw. 182, 436 P.2d 7 (1967), and Cassiday v. Cassiday, 68\n\nHaw. 383, 716 P.2d 1133 (1986), in support of her contention\n\nthat the family court can award separate property to the non-\n\nowning spouse.    The separate property at issue in both cases was\n\nactually Marital Partnership Property, not Marital Separate\n\nProperty that is now clearly governed by Kakinami.           If on\n\nremand, the family court determines that Husband’s remaining\n\ninheritance is actually Marital Partnership Property, then the\n\ninheritance will be subject to division.

This court clarified that “all other\n\ncircumstances of the case” encompass “all other matters which\n\nwould have a bearing on the division and distribution of\n\nproperty.”   50 Haw. at 187, 436 P.2d at 11.\n\n     In Cassiday, this court recognized that other unique\n\nfactors beyond those set out in HRS § 580-47 may come into play,\n\nsuch as “the length of the marriage, the separate financial\n\ncontribution of each party to the upkeep of those assets, and\n\nthe involvement, direct or indirect, in the management and\n\nmaintenance of them.”     68 Haw. at 389, 716 P.2d at 1137.         In\n\nreversing the property division award, this court stated that\n\nthe family court had failed to consider “the extent to which the\n\nmarriage in and of itself affected the accumulation or\n\n                                    50\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\npreservation of [the husband’s] separate property.”           68 Haw. at\n\n387, 716 P.2d at 1137.\n\n    Cases such as Carson and Cassiday demonstrate the manner in\n\nwhich the family court, in its application of the partnership\n\nmodel, can unduly emphasize money or property brought into a\n\nmarriage over other non-economic considerations, such as the\n\ncontribution of services during the marriage, the value of which\n\nis not as readily quantifiable.       These cases demonstrate how one\n\nspouse’s non-economic contributions to the marriage can affect\n\nthe accumulation or preservation of the other spouse’s separate\n\nholdings, whether Marital Separate Property or Marital\n\nPartnership Property, and that the family court must take those\n\nfactors into consideration in fashioning a just and equitable\n\ndistribution of Marital Partnership Property under the\n\ncircumstances of the case.      “[M]arriage is a partnership to\n\nwhich both partners bring their financial resources as well as\n\ntheir individual energies and efforts.”         Collins, 133 Hawai‘i at\n\n43, 323 P.3d at 1225 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n“That one partner brings to the marriage substantially greater\n\nassets than the other does not make this any less the case.”\n\nCassiday, 68 Haw. at 387, 716 P.2d at 1136.\n\n    In this case, the family court’s property division award,\n\nawarded Wife, who has few employment prospects after a thirty-\n\nfour year partnership, $1,396 in bank accounts, a retirement\n\n                                    51\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\naccount worth $13,000, and a used Suzuki valued at $13,000,\n\nwhile awarding Husband, who had $2,051,293 in his bank account,\n\nthe marital residence with equity of $243,781, an office cottage\n\nvalued at $95,000, a $32,875 Camaro, a $1,000 Jeep, $57,835 in\n\nliquid cash accounts, and an IRA account valued at $8,645.             This\n\nsimply does not meet a “just and equitable” standard.            For this\n\nreason, also, the property division award would have been set\n\naside for abuse of discretion, even if we had not already\n\nordered it set aside for the reasons above.\n\n    C.      Temporary Spousal Support\n\n            1.   During the Pendency of Divorce Proceedings\n\n    Turning to other issues on certiorari, Husband argues that\n\nthe ICA erred in affirming the family court’s award of temporary\n\nsupport to Wife during the pendency of the divorce proceedings\n\nbecause Wife was “effectively awarded [Husband’s] inheritance”\n\ndespite its subsequent classification as Marital Separate\n\nProperty.    He further argues that the ICA and family court\n\nfailed to consider that Wife’s gross monthly income was greater.\n\nIn response, Wife contends that Husband’s argument lacks merit\n\nbecause he was ultimately credited with these payments when the\n\nfamily court treated his spent inheritance funds as his Category\n\n3 property and deducted it from the marital estate.\n\n    The family court is authorized to order temporary support\n\nunder HRS § 580-9 (2006), which provides, in relevant part:\n\n                                    52\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          After the filing of a complaint for divorce or separation\n          the court may make such orders relative to the personal\n          liberty and support of either spouse pending the complaint\n          as the court may deem fair and reasonable and may enforce\n          the orders by summary process.\n\n“An award for temporary support is a sum necessary for the\n\nmaintenance of a party pending litigation.”          Farias v. Farias,\n\n58 Haw. 227, 233, 566 P.2d 1104, 1109 (1977).          “If one party has\n\ninsufficient income but the other party has sufficient income\n\nfor both, then neither’s capital should be impaired [while the\n\naction is pending] absent special circumstances.”           Horst v.\n\nHorst, 1 Haw. App. 617, 622, 623 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1981).             See\n\nalso Richards v. Richards, 44 Haw. 491, 497, 355 P.2d at 193\n\n(1960) (affirming an award of temporary alimony where wife had\n\ninsufficient income to maintain her standard of living without\n\nimpairing the capital of her separate estate).          As the ICA\n\nstated, “‘financial resources of the husband’ are given ‘due\n\nconsideration’ in awarding the spouse temporary support.”\n\nHamilton, mem. op. at 18 (quoting Richards, 44 Haw. at 497, 355\n\nP.2d at 193, superseded on other grounds in Epp, 80 Hawai‘i at\n\n91, 905 P.2d at 66).     Moreover, Marital Separate Property may\n\nfactor into the family court’s decision to “alter alimony . . .\n\nbased on the respective separate conditions of the spouses.”\n\nTougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 32, 868 P.2d at 450, overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Gonsales, 91 Hawai‘i 446, 984 P.2d 1272.\n\n\n\n\n                                    53\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n       In this case, neither spouse had sufficient income to\n\nmaintain each’s respective standard of living.             Wife received\n\napproximately $1,380 per month as a nanny.            Comparatively,\n\nHusband reported a lower gross monthly income of $1,000;\n\nhowever, Husband held significantly greater assets.              Therefore,\n\nthe temporary spousal support award appears to have been “fair\n\nand reasonable” in light of Husband’s significant financial\n\nresources, which were sufficient to cover expenses for both\n\nhimself and Wife during the divorce.           Moreover, the family\n\ncourt’s finding in support of the pre-divorce temporary spousal\n\nsupport award refers to Wife’s Income & Expense statement and\n\nthe parties’ previous use of Husband’s inheritance funds for\n\nmarital expenses.       Thus, the family court properly considered\n\nthe parties’ respective incomes and Husband’s large assets as\n\ncompared to Wife’s in requiring Husband to pay temporary alimony\n\nfor the purpose of Wife’s maintenance pending litigation.                See\n\nHRS § 580-9.      Accordingly, the ICA did not err in ruling that\n\n“[t]here was no abuse of discretion in the family court’s\n\nconsideration of [Husband’s] financial resources in ordering\n\ntemporary spousal support for [Wife].”            Hamilton, mem. op. at\n\n18.\n\n             2.    Failure to Award Permanent Spousal Support\n\n       The family court ordered Husband to pay spousal support of\n\n$2,000 per month until Wife moved out of the marital residence\n\n                                       54\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nthen $3,000 per month thereafter until December 2016.            Wife\n\nargues that the family court erred in failing to consider\n\naltering the amount or duration of post-divorce temporary\n\nspousal support to compensate her for the “grossly unequal\n\nproperty division caused by [Husband’s] inheritance.”            Comparing\n\nthe award of spousal support during the divorce proceedings to\n\nthe post-divorce award, Wife contends that an increase of $1000\n\nper month was “obviously inadequate” to cover her expenses where\n\npre-divorce spousal support also included housing and medical\n\nexpenses.\n\n     We have vacated the family court’s property division award.\n\nAs the need for spousal support will be related to the property\n\ndivision, we hereby also vacate the spousal support award.              See\n\nGordon, 135 Hawai‘i at 355, 350 P.3d at 1023.          On remand, the\n\nfamily court is to decide spousal support in light of the\n\nfollowing considerations.\n\n     HRS § 580-47(a) requires the family court to consider the\n\nfollowing criteria when making further orders for the support\n\nand maintenance of either spouse:        “the respective merits of the\n\nparties, the relative abilities of the parties, the condition in\n\nwhich each party will be left by the divorce, the burdens\n\nimposed upon either party for the benefit of the children of the\n\nparties, . . . and all other circumstances of the case.”            The\n\n\n\n                                    55\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nfamily court must also consider all of the following factors in\n\nordering spousal support and maintenance:\n\n          (1)    Financial resources of the parties;\n\n          (2) Ability of the party seeking support and maintenance\n          to meet his or her needs independently;\n\n          (3)    Duration of the marriage;\n\n          (4)    Standard of living established during the marriage;\n\n          (5)    Age of the parties;\n\n          (6)    Physical and emotional condition of the parties;\n\n          (7)    Usual occupation of the parties during the marriage;\n\n          (8) Vocational skills and employability of the party\n          seeking support and maintenance;\n\n          (9)    Needs of the parties;\n\n          (10)    Custodial and child support responsibilities;\n\n          (11) Ability of the party from whom support and\n          maintenance is sought to meet his or her own needs while\n          meeting the needs of the party seeking support and\n          maintenance;\n\n          (12) Other factors which measure the financial condition\n          in which the parties will be left as the result of the\n          action under which the determination of maintenance is\n          made; and\n\n          (13) Probable duration of the need of the party seeking\n          support and maintenance.\n\nHRS § 580-47(a).     See Cassiday, 6 Haw. App. at 215, 716 P.2d at\n\n1151 (“When deciding in a divorce case whether one party must\n\npay periodic support to the other, for how long, and how much,\n\nthe family court must consider all of the factors enumerated in\n\nHRS § 580–47(a)[.]”), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 68 Haw. 383,\n\n716 P.2d 1133 (1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                       56\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n    D.    Attorneys’ Fees\n\n    Over the course of the entire divorce proceeding, Wife\n\nreceived from Husband $60,450 out of $86,126.17 in attorney’s\n\nfees and costs.    Wife’s counsel declared that the amount\n\nrequested did not include attorney’s fees incurred after\n\npreparation of the closing argument and reply, which were still\n\naccumulating.\n\n    Husband argues that the attorneys’ fees and costs award to\n\nWife constituted an abuse of discretion because he had\n\ninsufficient income and the award “invaded” his inheritance,\n\nwhich he contends should have been “taken out of the equation”\n\nas Marital Separate Property.       Wife contends that Husband’s\n\nargument lacks merit because he was ultimately credited with\n\nthese payments when the family court treated his spent\n\ninheritance as a Category 3 asset and deducted it from the\n\nmarital estate.\n\n    This court has explained that “an award of attorney’s fees\n\nis in the sound discretion of the trial court, limited only by\n\nthe standard that it be fair and reasonable.”          Farias, 58 Haw.\n\nat 233, 566 P.2d at 1109 (citing Carson, 50 Haw. at 188, 436\n\nP.2d at 11; Richards, 44 Haw. at 496, 355 P.2d at 192).            With\n\nrespect to attorney’s fees and costs advanced to Wife during the\n\npendency of the divorce, HRS § 580-9 (2006) provides, in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                                    57\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          The court may also compel either spouse to advance\n          reasonable amounts for the compensation of witnesses and\n          other expenses of the trial, including attorney’s fees, to\n          be incurred by the other spouse and may from time to time\n          amend and revise the orders.\n\nWe have further stated:\n\n          In determining the fair and reasonable amount of attorney’s\n          fees, the trial court should consider the financial ability\n          of the parties and the amount necessary for the efficient\n          prosecution or defense of the action. The latter depends\n          on the character of the litigation, services to be\n          performed, and all other circumstances which may tend to\n          lessen or increase the probable expenses of the litigation.\n\n58 Haw. at 233, 566 P.2d at 1109 (citations omitted).\n\n    In this case, the family court’s award of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs appears to be fair and reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances.    Wife’s trial expenses were increased by\n\nHusband’s filing of five motions for partial summary judgment,\n\nwhich required extensive expert review of voluminous financial\n\ndocuments; a motion for reconsideration of an order granting and\n\ndenying in part a motion to compel; and a motion in limine.\n\nConsidering the parties’ financial abilities, discussed above,\n\nthe family court did not abuse its discretion in requiring\n\nHusband to advance amounts totaling $55,450 for trial expenses.\n\n    Regarding attorney’s fees awarded after divorce, HRS § 580-\n\n47(f) provides, in relevant part:\n\n                (f) Attorney’s fees and costs. The court hearing\n          any motion for orders either revising an order for the\n          custody, support, maintenance, and education of the\n          children of the parties, or an order for the support and\n          maintenance of one party by the other, or a motion for an\n          order to enforce any such order or any order made under\n          subsection (a) of this section, may make such orders\n          requiring either party to pay or contribute to the payment\n          of the attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses of the other\n\n\n                                    58\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n           party relating to such motion and hearing as shall appear\n           just and equitable after consideration of the respective\n           merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the\n           parties, the economic condition of each party at the time\n           of the hearing, the burdens imposed upon either party for\n           the benefit of the children of the parties, the concealment\n           of or failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation\n           of a restraining order issued under section 580-10(a) or\n           (b), if any, by either party, and all other circumstances\n           of the case.\n\n    Here, the family court concluded that Husband’s “superior\n\nfinancial condition” justified requiring him to pay Wife’s\n\nattorney’s fees.    This finding is supported by the parties’\n\nAsset and Debt statements, which show Husband as having\n\nsignificantly greater assets than Wife.         As stated supra,\n\nHusband’s individually held assets totaled more than $2 million,\n\nwhile Wife’s individually held assets totaled approximately\n\n$19,000.   Therefore, the evidence shows the family court\n\nproperly considered the factors in HRS § 580-47(f), in\n\nparticular the parties’ relative abilities and post-divorce\n\neconomic conditions.     Given the family court’s broad discretion,\n\nits award of attorney’s fees to Wife did not amount to an abuse\n\nof discretion.    Accordingly, the ICA did not err in affirming\n\nthe attorney’s fees and costs award to Wife.\n\nV.

Introduction\n\n      This case arises from an appeal and cross-appeal from\n\nmonetary decisions in a Divorce Decree.           David Hamilton\n\n(“Husband”) and Dorinda Hamilton (“Wife”) seek review of the\n\nIntermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) September 25, 2014\n\nJudgment on Appeal, filed pursuant to its August 29, 2014\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nMemorandum Opinion.     The ICA affirmed in part and vacated in\n\npart the June 7, 2013 Divorce Decree of the Family Court of the\n\nThird Circuit (“family court”).1\n\n     The parties dispute the impact of a multi-million dollar\n\ninheritance received by Husband on the family court’s\n\ndeterminations of property division, alimony, and attorney’s\n\nfees and costs.    With respect to property division, the family\n\ncourt found that a premarital economic partnership existed and\n\nimplied that proceeds from an illegal marijuana operation may\n\nhave constituted a portion of the marital real estate.            In\n\nultimately dividing and distributing the property, the family\n\ncourt awarded all inheritance funds remaining at trial to\n\nHusband as his marital separate property.         It credited Husband\n\nfor all sums withdrawn from his inheritance funds as a capital\n\ncontribution to the marital estate.        It then deducted these sums\n\nfrom the marital estate, thereby creating marital debt.            That\n\nmarital debt was then equally split between the parties,\n\nresulting in Wife owing Husband a substantial equalization\n\npayment.   The family court then found that equitable\n\nconsiderations justified a deviation from marital partnership\n\nprinciples and credited Wife with an amount equal to her\n\nequalization payment.     The family court awarded Wife spousal\n\nsupport during the pendency of the divorce proceedings and until\n\n     1\n           The Honorable Aley K.

The ICA vacated and\n\nremanded the portions of the Divorce Decree pertaining to\n\nproperty division and spousal support to the family court for\n\nrecalculation after segregating proceeds from the illegal\n\nmarijuana operation.\n\n    We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the ICA\n\nerred in vacating the property division and alimony awards to\n\nrequire a recalculation of these awards based on a segregation\n\nof proceeds from the illegal marijuana operation.           We also hold\n\nthat the family court erred, either by characterizing the entire\n\n$1,511,477 expended from Husband’s inheritance account as\n\nMarital Partnership Property or by characterizing the $2,051,293\n\nremaining in his inheritance account as Marital Separate\n\nProperty, because the $1,511,447 expended included payment of\n\ninheritance taxes on Husband’s entire inheritance, and if\n\ninheritance taxes are paid out of Marital Partnership Property,\n\nthe remaining inheritance cannot be classified as Marital\n\nSeparate Property.    We further hold that the family court erred\n\nin summarily ruling before trial that all funds expended by\n\nHusband from his Marital Separate Property inheritance account\n\n                                     3\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nconstituted Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which he\n\nwas entitled to be repaid, without requiring Husband to fulfill\n\nhis burden of establishing that such expenditures were in the\n\nnature of a contribution to or an investment in Marital\n\nPartnership Property, and then compounded the error by failing\n\nto allow and consider evidence of donative intent.           We also hold\n\nthat the family court erred in ordering an equal distribution of\n\nalleged partnership capital losses before deciding whether\n\nequitable considerations justified deviation from an equal\n\ndistribution.   Finally, we hold that the family court improperly\n\napplied marital partnership principles to fashion a property\n\ndivision award that was not just and equitable.          We find no\n\nerror in the award of attorney’s fees and costs.\n\n    We therefore affirm in part the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal to\n\nthe extent that it vacated the property division and alimony\n\nawards and remanded the case to the family court, but vacate the\n\nportion of the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal directing the family\n\ncourt on remand to segregate the proceeds of the alleged\n\nmarijuana operation from the property division.          We remand the\n\ncase to the family court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nII.    Background\n\n       Husband and Wife were married on June 21, 1985 (“date of\n\nmarriage”) and separated in June 2010.            The couple has two adult\n\nchildren.\n\n       The parties met in early 1976 in New Zealand and began\n\nliving together there soon after that.            At the time, Wife had\n\njust finished her final semester at the University of Hawai‘i at\n\nHilo, while Husband worked on repairing a home and a forest\n\nrestoration project.        Approximately four or five months later,\n\nthe parties moved to Massachusetts, where they lived and worked\n\non Husband’s family’s farm and store for about three months.\n\n       After leaving Massachusetts, the parties moved to the\n\nisland of Hawai‘i (“Big Island”) in November 1976, where Husband\n\nbegan working on a county road crew.            While on the Big Island,\n\nthe parties apparently started an illegal marijuana operation.\n\nWife testified that she was involved in the processing and\n\ntransportation of the marijuana.            Husband testified that the\n\nparties did not have a joint or mutual marijuana operation.                He\n\nindicated it was a sideline with a few friends that continued\n\nuntil his son was born in 1987.\n\n       At trial, the parties disputed whether marijuana proceeds\n\nwere used to purchase real property.           Wife testified that\n\nmarijuana proceeds were used to purchase multiple properties\n\nprior to the date of marriage, as well as one additional\n\n                                        5\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nproperty after the date of marriage, while Husband denied that\n\nallegation.    On one of the properties, purchased in 1978 and\n\ntitled in Husband’s name, the parties jointly constructed a two-\n\nstory house.\n\n     In 1990, five years after the date of marriage, Husband\n\nobtained his real estate brokerage license.           In 2003, he opened\n\nhis own real estate firm.       Husband testified that his income\n\ndeclined in 2006 due to a falling market and his father’s\n\npassing.   After Wife’s 2010 divorce filing, Husband reported his\n\ngross monthly income as $1,000.\n\n     Wife performed part-time work or was a housewife not\n\nemployed outside the home for much of the parties’ relationship.\n\nFrom approximately 1996 to 2009, Wife worked part-time at her\n\nchildren’s schools to obtain tuition assistance and health\n\ninsurance.    She also sold hand-painted clothing.          As of the date\n\nof final separation in contemplation of divorce (“date of final\n\nseparation”), she was collecting unemployment benefits.             At the\n\ndate of conclusion of the evidentiary portion of trial\n\n(“conclusion of trial”),2 she earned approximately $1,500 per\n\nmonth as a nanny.\n\n     Between 2007 and 2011, Husband inherited amounts totaling\n\n$3,550,770 from his parents’ estates.         He deposited the monies\n\n      2\n            The family court’s February 13, 2013 Order Re: Divorce Trial Held\non December 22 and 23, 2011 specified that December 22 and 23, 2011 should be\nconsidered the conclusion of trial.\n\n\n                                      6\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\ninto his separate Bank of Hawai‘i account (“inheritance\n\naccount”).      At the conclusion of trial, the inheritance account\n\nhad $2,051,293 remaining.\n\n     Prior to marriage, the parties filed no joint tax returns.\n\n     A.    Family Court Proceedings\n\n           1.     Pre-Trial Proceedings\n\n     On June 23, 2010, Wife filed a Complaint for Divorce.               She\n\nthen filed a motion for temporary relief, seeking, in part,\n\ntemporary spousal support.      In granting this request, the family\n\ncourt made the following finding:\n\n           Husband has historically used his existing inheritance\n           funds for payment of the marital expenses and Wife’s\n           support. Having reviewed Wife’s Income and Expense\n           statement filed, the [family court] finds that it would be\n           just and equitable to order that in addition to the above\n           support orders, Husband shall pay to Wife $2000 per month\n           in temporary spousal support beginning October 1, 2010.\n\n     Wife later moved for an advance of attorney’s fees,\n\nindicating a gross monthly income of $2,080.          Wife contended\n\nthat an advance for fees was necessary because Husband had filed\n\nmultiple pretrial motions for partial summary judgment.            The\n\nfamily court granted the request for attorney’s fees without\n\nprejudice to additional subsequent requests from Wife for good\n\ncause shown, and ordered Husband to advance $25,000 to Wife’s\n\ncounsel.\n\n     One of Husband’s pretrial motions for partial summary\n\njudgment, entitled “Husband’s Motion for Partial Summary\n\n\n\n                                     7\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nJudgment to Strike the Defense and/or Argument that Husband\n\nWasted his Category 3 Assets by Spending Money on Items Not\n\nRelated to the Marriage or the Children” (“Category 3 motion for\n\npartial summary judgment”), asserted that Wife could not provide\n\nadmissible evidence to establish that he “wasted” Category 3\n\nassets.3    In a declaration in support of the motion, Husband\n\nasserted:\n\n           In response to Plaintiff’s Request for Answers to Interrogatories\n     and for Production of Documents and Things, request number 9, I\n     itemized all of the disbursements I made from my inheritance money with\n     the exception of $88,597.80, which was disbursed for the marriage and\n     children’s expenses. This amount was not itemized in Defendant’s\n     response to Plaintiff’s interrogatory number 9, either because it\n     consisted of small dollar transactions too numerous to breakdown [sic],\n     e.g.[sic] $70 to KTA, etc [sic], or the credit card amounts were too\n     difficult to itemize the family or children expenses [sic] without\n     additional extensive effort, i.e.[sic] recreating the complete\n     accounting.\n\n     Although Husband’s motion summarily asserted that all sums\n\nexpended were for marital and children’s expenses, his response\n\nto interrogatory number 9 included amounts such as $111,885.00\n\nto the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Taxes and $326,540.00 to\n\nthe United States Treasury.       In addition, Husband’s heading for\n\nhis interrogatory 9 itemization of alleged Category 3\n\ndisbursements included the following characterization:\n\n“Category 3 Inheritance Account.”         After this heading, he\n\nincluded the inheritance tax payments.\n     3\n            Category 3 property includes the date-of acquisition net market\nvalue, plus or minus, of property separately acquired by one spouse by gift\nor inheritance during the marriage but excluding the net market value\nattributable to property that is subsequently legally gifted by the owner to\nthe other spouse, to both spouses, or to a third party.

Trial Order and Divorce Decree\n\n     After trial, on February 13, 2013, the family court entered\n\nits Order Re: Divorce Trial Held on December 22 and 23, 2011.\n\nThe family court found that the parties had formed a premarital\n\neconomic partnership in 1976 that lasted until they married in\n\n1985:\n\n                 9.   The parties met in New Zealand in 1976. They\n           began living together soon after they met. They continued\n           to cohabitate uninterrupted until DOM.\n\n                 10. The parties financially supported each other\n           during their cohabitation before DOM.\n\n                 11. They resided and worked together in New Zealand,\n           Massachusetts, and Hawaii prior to DOM.\n\n                 12. Husband worked at various jobs while Wife\n           contributed her services to their living arrangement. Wife\n           did, however, work on Husband’s parents’ farm and store in\n           Massachusetts, which contributed to the parties’ living\n           expenses and support.\n\n                 13. After moving to Hawaii and prior to DOM, Husband\n           worked for the County of Hawaii. The parties received food\n           stamps and Husband received a stipend from the State of\n           Hawaii. Wife was not employed, but contributed to the\n           parties’ living support.\n\n\n      4\n            The family court’s ruling appears in an order denying a different\namended motion for partial summary judgment.\n\n\n                                      9\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n                 14. In 1977, the parties started growing marijuana\n           and both worked on growing, processing, transporting the\n           finished product, and selling it.\n\n                 15. In 1978, the parties jointly purchased property\n           for $17,000. The parties jointly built a two-story house\n           on that property.\n\n                 16. During 1977 and 1978 the parties travelled\n           together to Thailand to look for orchids to establish an\n           orchid company with other business partners. They\n           purchased orchids and shipped them back to Hawaii.\n\n                 17. The parties also bought and sold other real\n           property prior to DOM from the proceeds of their joint\n           earnings.\n\n    From 2007 to 2011, Husband inherited from his parents’\n\nestates amounts totaling $3,550,770, and he deposited these\n\nfunds into his separate inheritance account.          As of the\n\nconclusion of trial, $2,051,293 remained in Husband’s\n\ninheritance account.     The family court found that the parties\n\nhad no written premarital or post-marital agreement, and\n\ncategorized this sum as Husband’s Marital Separate Property,\n\nfinding:\n\n                 24. Husband expressly classified his inherited funds\n           as his separate property by depositing them into the Bank\n           of Hawaii and labeled it “separate.” This account was\n           created solely for the purpose of holding and maintaining\n           Husband’s inheritance. No funds from any other source were\n           deposited into this account and this account was maintained\n           by itself and was funded only by interest earned.\n\n    The family court also found that the entire $1,499,477\n\nwithdrawn by Husband had been used “to invest in a business that\n\neventually failed and has no present value, for the purchase of\n\nthe Kala Cottage office, automobiles, and other assets, to fund\n\nthe Vanguard account in the amount of $50,000, to pay taxes, to\n\npay for the private school and post-high school education of the\n\n                                    10\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nparties’ children, and to support and maintain the family and\n\nthe family’s lifestyle.”      Consistent with its pretrial summary\n\njudgment ruling, the family court then found that the entire\n\namount was a Category 3 capital contribution credit.            With an\n\nadditional $12,000 for a 2009 cash gift from Husband’s mother to\n\nhim that had apparently been spent, the family court found that\n\nHusband’s Category 3 credits totaled $1,511,477.\n\n    As noted earlier, the family court had already ruled before\n\ntrial that Husband was entitled to be repaid all of his Category\n\n3 expenditures as having been used for marital purposes.            After\n\ntrial, the family court found that “[that] Wife did not meet her\n\nburden that Husband specifically intended these funds as a gift\n\nto her.\n\n    By the conclusion of trial, the value of the parties’\n\nassets was $466,522.     Because of its finding of $1,511,477 in\n\nCategory 3 expenditures by Husband, the family court found a\n\nmarital estate valued at negative $1,044.955, for which Wife\n\nwould otherwise have to repay Husband $522,478 as an\n\nequalization payment.     For property division, Wife was awarded\n\n$1,396 in bank accounts, a retirement account worth $13,000, and\n\na used Suzuki valued at $13,000.         Wife’s equalization payment\n\nincreased by half of those amounts, to a total of $549,873.\n\n    In addition to retaining the $2,051,293 remaining in his\n\ninheritance account, for property division, Husband was awarded\n\n                                    11\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n$57,835 in liquid cash accounts, a $8,645 IRA account, a $32,865\n\nChevy Camaro, a $1,000 Jeep Cherokee, the marital residence with\n\nequity of $243,781, and his office cottage then valued at\n\n$95,000.\n\n     With respect to the marital residence and the office\n\ncottage awarded to Husband, the family court found that in 2007,\n\nHusband had purchased it for $180,000 with inheritance funds.\n\nPrior to its purchase, Wife had co-signed a $250,000 equity loan\n\nsecured by the marital residence so that Husband could purchase\n\nthe cottage for his real estate business.          The equity loan was\n\nsupposed to be paid off from the anticipated inheritance, and\n\nWife testified she would not have agreed to co-sign the home\n\nequity loan if she had known that Husband was not going to pay\n\noff the equity loan with his inheritance.\n\n     Both parties were awarded their respective personal and\n\nhousehold property.\n\n     Because of the significant equalization payment that would\n\notherwise be owed by Wife to Husband, the family court then\n                                                                             5\ndetermined that sufficient “valid and relevant considerations”\n\n     5\n            Hawai‘i courts frequently refer to “valid and relevant\nconsiderations”, “valid and relevant circumstances”, and “equitable\nconsiderations” when discussing deviation from partnership principals.\nEquitable considerations permit the family court to deviate from the\npartnership model in dividing the parties’ Marital Partnership Property upon\ndivorce.

Wife’s equalization payment to Husband is\n            substantial.\n\n                  58.

Husband currently spends about $12,000 per month\n            for family support. He will now live at the marital\n            residence. His monthly expenses will go down.\n\n                  76. It would be just and equitable to award Wife\n            continued spousal support for a period of five years\n            commencing January 2012 (the month following trial), as\n            follows: $2,000 per month until Wife moves out of the\n            marital residence, then $3,000 per month commencing the\n            first month after Wife moves out of the marital residence\n            and through December 2017.\n\n     Later, in response to Husband’s motion for reconsideration,\n\nthe family court amended finding of fact No. 76 regarding\n\nspousal support to reduce Wife’s alimony award by one year.6\n\n\n     6\n            In addition to reducing the length of Wife’s alimony award,\nthe family court also added the following sentence: “Spousal support\nshall terminate upon Wife’s remarriage or upon the death of either\nHusband or Wife.”\n\n\n                                      14\n\f    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n     As to attorney’s fees and costs, the family court concluded\n\nthat because of Husband’s superior financial condition, it would\n\nbe just and equitable to award Wife a portion of her attorney’s\n\nfees and costs up to $5,000.        Wife’s counsel later submitted an\n\nitemized accounting of fees incurred through preparation of the\n\nclosing argument and reply, reflecting fees and costs totaling\n\n$86,126.17.7    On June 7, 2013, the Family Court entered its\n\nDivorce Decree.\n\n     B.    Appeal to the ICA\n\n     Wife appealed and Husband cross-appealed to the ICA.              The\n\nICA first addressed Husband’s cross-appeal.\n\n           1.    Husband’s Cross-Appeal\n\n     In his appeal, Husband argued that the family court erred\n\nwhen it (1) found a premarital economic partnership existed\n\nbased on illegal marijuana sales, (2) denied Husband Category 1\n\ncredits for property in his name at the date of marriage, (3)\n\nfound equitable deviation and waived the equalization payment,\n\nand (4) awarded Wife temporary spousal support and attorney’s\n\nfees before trial based on his inheritance.           Husband requested\n\nthat the family court’s decision be vacated and remanded and\n\nthat the attorneys’ fees and costs award be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n            Wife’s counsel stated that this amount did not include the\nattorney’s fees incurred after the reply, which were still accumulating.\n\n\n                                     15\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n    Noting that “[t]he family court considered the parties’\n\njoint financial acts, cohabitation since 1976, economic and non-\n\neconomic contributions, and other financial arrangements in\n\nfinding that the parties formed a premarital economic\n\npartnership in 1976,” the ICA stated that one basis for the\n\npremarital economic partnership finding was “the parties’\n\n‘growing, processing, transporting the finished product, and\n\nselling’ marijuana in 1977.”       Hamilton v. Hamilton, No. CAAP-13-\n\n1498, at 12 (App. Aug. 29, 2014) (mem.).         The ICA ruled that the\n\nfamily court’s equitable powers to divide marital property\n\npursuant to HRS § 580-47 do “not authorize [the family court] to\n\nprovide relief to parties to an illegal agreement.”           Hamilton,\n\nmem. op. at 13.    The ICA concluded, however, that “[t]he fact\n\nthat the parties’ illegal marijuana operation provided funds for\n\ntheir premarital economic partnership was not determinative of\n\nwhether the partnership was valid.”        Hamilton, mem. op. at 15.\n\nTherefore, the ICA rejected Husband’s argument that the illegal\n\nmarijuana business was the foundation of the premarital economic\n\npartnership on the bases that (1) “[n]o evidence presented\n\nreasonably supported a finding, that the purpose of the parties’\n\npremarital cohabitation and financial arrangements was the\n\ngrowing and sale of marijuana[,]” and (2) evidence of the\n\nparties’ premarital non-marijuana operations sufficiently\n\n\n\n\n                                    16\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nsupport a finding that a premarital economic partnership existed\n\nas a matter of law.     Id.\n\n    Although the ICA determined that the family court’s\n\npremarital economic partnership finding was not in error, it\n\nruled that the “finding that the parties’ marijuana operation\n\nwas part of that premarital economic partnership constitutes an\n\nerror as a matter of law.”      Id.    In this regard, the ICA ruled\n\nthat “[t]he family court should have segregated the illegal\n\nmarijuana operation from its consideration of the parties’\n\nalleged premarital economic partnership.”         Id. (citing 59A Am.\n\nJur. 2d Partnership § 54 at 233 (separation of mixed legal and\n\nillegal purposes)).     Therefore, the ICA concluded that the\n\npremarital economic partnership was “valid to the extent that it\n\nincluded legal partnership activities and its ‘legitimate\n\nobjectives’ can be segregated from the illegal marijuana\n\nbusiness.”   Hamilton, mem. op. at 16.       Noting the parties’\n\nconflicting testimony as to whether marijuana proceeds were used\n\nto purchase real property, the ICA explained that “[s]egregating\n\nthe economic contribution of the marijuana operation to the\n\nparties’ premarital economic partnership, however, would require\n\na credibility determination regarding [the parties’] testimony\n\nas to whether proceeds from the marijuana operations were used\n\nto purchase [certain properties] and, further, ascertaining how\n\nthe proceeds from the subsequent sales of those properties were\n\n                                      17\n\f      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nallocated to marital and legitimate premarital assets.”               Id.\n\nThe ICA vacated the family court’s Divorce Decree, in part, and\n\nremanded with instructions to re-assess the property division in\n\nconsideration of a premarital economic partnership excluding the\n\nmarijuana operation.        Hamilton, mem. op. at 16-17.\n\n       Next, as to equitable deviation, the ICA concluded that\n\n“the family court’s application of its finding that a premarital\n\neconomic partnership existed to support deviation from the\n\nPartnership Model constituted reversible error to the extent the\n\ndeviation was based on the illegal marijuana business.”\n\nHamilton, mem. op. at 17.\n\n       With respect to temporary alimony awarded to Wife during\n\nthe pendency of the divorce, the ICA held that “[t]here was no\n\nabuse of discretion in the family court’s consideration of\n\n[Husband’s] financial resources in ordering temporary spousal\n\nsupport for [Wife].”        Hamilton, mem. op. at 18.\n\n       As to attorney’s fees, the ICA rejected Husband’s argument,\n\nnoting a lack of authority in support of Husband’s contention\n\nthat the award would “invade” his inheritance, as well as the\n\nfamily court’s authority to award attorneys’ fees and costs\n\nduring the pendency of divorce proceedings under HRS § 580-9 and\n\ndivide property under HRS § 580-47(a).            Hamilton, mem. op. at\n\n18.    The ICA therefore concluded that the family court did not\n\nerr in “allocating responsibility for attorneys’ fees and costs\n\n                                       18\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\namongst the parties upon granting the divorce.”          Hamilton, mem.\n\nop. at 19.        Accordingly, the ICA held that “[t]he family court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion by awarding [Wife] $5,000 in\n\nattorneys’ fees and costs in its Order Re: Divorce Trial.”             Id.\n\n       The ICA also rejected Husband’s argument that the Order Re:\n\nFees and Costs was void for lack of jurisdiction, explaining\n\nthat the “Order Re: Fees and Costs confirmed the $5,000 award\n\nthat had already been set in the [] Order Re: Divorce Trial . .\n\n. .”    Hamilton, mem. op. at 20.\n\n             2.     Wife’s Appeal\n\n       In her appeal, Wife argued that the family court erred when\n\nit (1) treated 60% of Husband’s inheritance as Marital Separate\n\nProperty and 40% as Category 3 assets, (2) subtracted capital\n\ncontributions in excess of the marital assets and found that\n\nWife owed Husband for half of the partnership loss, (3) awarded\n\nWife virtually nothing from the marital estate, and (4) awarded\n\ninsufficient post-divorce alimony.\n\n       The ICA rejected Wife’s arguments regarding Husband’s\n\ninheritance and capital contribution credits, holding that\n\n“[t]he family court did not abuse its discretion in determining\n\nthat [Husband] could be credited for expenditures from the\n\nInheritance Account for household expenses.”          Hamilton, mem. op.\n\nat 23.    Nevertheless, the ICA declined to affirm the family\n\ncourt’s findings in support of the property division on the\n\n                                     19\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nbasis that the court’s “reliance on [an erroneous premarital\n\neconomic partnership finding] to justify equitable deviation\n\nconstitutes reversible error.”       Id.; accord id. at 24.\n\n    Regarding post-divorce alimony, the ICA concluded that\n\n“[t]he family court considered all required factors and\n\ndetermined [Wife] would be able to find employment to support\n\nherself by the end of December 2016.”        Hamilton, mem. op. at 24\n\n(citing HRS § 580-47(a)).      Nevertheless, the ICA “vacate[d] the\n\n[post-divorce] alimony award as reversible error[]” to the\n\nextent that it “may have been premised, in part, on premarital\n\nactivities connected to the illegal marijuana operations,” and\n\ndirected the family court on remand to “exclude from its\n\ndetermination of [Wife’s] alimony award any consideration of\n\nthose premarital economic activities connected to the marijuana\n\noperation.”    Hamilton, mem. op. at 25.\n\n    Accordingly, the ICA vacated Parts Four and Five of the\n\nDivorce Decree regarding alimony and property division, affirmed\n\nall other parts, and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n    C.    Applications for Writs of Certiorari\n\n          1.    Husband’s Application\n\n    In summary, Husband argues that the family court erred in\n\n(1) finding that a premarital economic partnership based on an\n\nillegal marijuana business venture existed, where the parties\n\nkept their finances separate prior to marriage; (2) deviating\n\n                                    20\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nfrom the Marital Partnership Model based on his inheritance; (3)\n\nawarding Wife temporary alimony during the divorce proceeding;\n\n(4) and awarding Wife attorneys’ fees and costs.\n\n          2.    Wife’s Application\n\n    In summary, Wife alleges that the family court erred in its\n\n(1) characterization of all amounts inherited by Husband as\n\nMarital Separate Property, (2) characterization of the entire\n\n$1,511,477 apparently then expended by Husband from his\n\ninheritance as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which\n\nHusband is entitled to be repaid; (3) finding that Wife incurred\n\na debt to Husband payable by an equalization payment when their\n\nmarital partnership assets were insufficient to repay the\n\nalleged Category 3 expenditures; (4) application of equitable\n\ndeviation principles in it property division award; and (5)\n\nfailure to consider altering the amount and duration of alimony\n\nto compensate Wife for the one-sided property division.              Wife\n\nalso challenges the ICA’s decision to remand the case to the\n\nfamily court on the “minor issue” of the illegal marijuana\n\noperation, without addressing Husband’s $3.5 million\n\ninheritance.\n\n    We address the issues on certiorari as follows.\n\nIII. Standards of Review\n\n    A.    Family Court Decisions\n\n          Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in\n          making its decisions and those decisions will not be set\n\n                                    21\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,\n          we will not disturb the family court’s decision on appeal\n          unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of\n          law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party\n          litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of\n          reason.\n\nKakinami v.

Discussion\n\n       A.    Illegality and the Premarital Economic Partnership\n\n       The ICA ruled that although there was substantial other\n\nevidence of a premarital economic partnership, the property\n\ndivision and alimony awards needed to be recalculated to exclude\n\nconsideration of premarital economic activities connected to the\n\nmarijuana operation.\n\n       Husband argues that the ICA erred in concluding that (1)\n\nthe fact that the parties’ illegal marijuana operation provided\n\nfunds for their premarital economic partnership was not\n\ndeterminative of whether the partnership was valid; and (2)\n\nlegal partnership activities existed that could be segregated\n\n\n                                       23\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nfrom the marijuana operation.       He contends that “even a partial\n\nreliance on an illegal enterprise would be contrary to public\n\npolicy and would require a finding that no PEP existed.”            In\n\naddition, Husband asserts that insufficient evidence existed to\n\nsupport the premarital economic partnership insofar as “it is\n\nclear that both the parties did not intend to create a PEP.”\n\n    Wife contends that the ICA did not err in affirming the\n\npremarital economic partnership finding because (1) Husband’s\n\n“trial testimony flatly contradicts [his] position asserted on\n\nappeal[]” to the extent that Husband denied having a “joint or\n\nmutual marijuana operation” at trial and testified that\n\npremarital properties held in his name were purchased with\n\n“savings,” “not marijuana money[;]” (2) Husband failed to raise\n\nhis illegality argument below; and (3) Husband “cannot use this\n\ncouple’s marijuana business 25 years ago to eliminate the PEP,\n\nbut also demand $125,000 in Category 1 credits for assets\n\npurchased in his name before DOM with [marijuana proceeds].”                In\n\naddition, Wife asserts that the family court found independent\n\ngrounds for the premarital economic partnership.\n\n    It is true that, generally, courts will not enforce an\n\nillegal agreement.    According to the United States Supreme\n\nCourt, “[i]n case any action is brought in which it is necessary\n\nto prove the illegal contract in order to maintain the action,\n\ncourts will not enforce it, nor will they enforce any alleged\n\n                                    24\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nrights directly springing from such contract.”          McMullen v.\n\nHoffman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95090\"><a href=\"/opinion/95090/mcmullen-v-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 654 (1899).        With respect to cases that\n\ninvolve partly illegal and partly legal partnership purposes,\n\nhowever, courts are split as to whether recovery is available to\n\nparties to the illegal transaction.        For example, although the\n\nCourt stated in McMullen that “[i]t has been sometimes said that\n\nwhere a contract, although it be illegal, has been fully\n\nexecuted between the parties, so that nothing remains thereof\n\nfor completion, if the plaintiff can recover from the defendant\n\nmoneys received by him without resorting to the contract the\n\ncourt will permit a recovery in such case[,]” 174 U.S. at 654-\n\n55, it held in Bruce’s Juices v.

In Brooks v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87628\"><a href=\"/opinion/87628/brooks-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1864), the Court held that “[a]fter a partnership contract\n\nconfessedly against public policy has been carried out, and\n\nmoney contributed by one of the partners has passed into other\n\nforms, . . . a partner, in whose hands the profits are, cannot\n\nrefuse to account for and divide them on the ground of the\n\n                                    25\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nillegal character of the original contract.”          69 U.S. at 71\n\n(emphasis omitted).\n\n    Hawai‘i cases have also addressed enforcement of illegal\n\ncontracts.

A majority of this court held that Marital Separate\n\nProperty is a narrow category of separate property “that has\n\nbeen excluded from the marital partnership, and thus, not\n\nsubject to division.”     127 Hawai‘i at 142, 276 P.3d at 711.         See\n\nalso 127 Hawai‘i at 141 n.9, 276 P.3d at 710 n.9 (“Marital\n\nSeparate Property is a narrow category of ‘separate property’\n\nthat, in our view, provides a practical means of segregating\n\ncertain property from the marital estate, the segregation of\n\nwhich can influence the equitable distribution of the parties’\n\nother assets.”).    Although Marital Separate Property is not\n\nsubject to division, if marital assets are used to maintain a\n\ngift or inheritance, then the gift or inheritance is subject to\n\ndivision as Marital Partnership Property:\n\n           if a party receives a gift or inheritance during the\n           marriage, but the party does not expressly classify that\n           gift or inheritance as separate property, or uses marital\n           assets or efforts to maintain that gift or inheritance,\n           then the gift or inheritance would be subject to division\n           as Marital Partnership Property.\n\nKakinami, 127 Hawai‘i at 141, 276 P.3d at 710.\n\n     In this case, Husband placed his inheritance funds in a\n\nseparate account, and labelled it as such.         The family court\n\nruled that the $2,051,293 remaining in Husband’s “separate”\n\ninheritance account was Marital Separate Property because the\n\naccount had been created solely for the purpose of holding and\n\nmaintaining his inheritance, no funds from any other source were\n\n                                    35\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\ndeposited into the account, and the account was maintained by\n\nitself and funded only by interest earned.         If, as stated above,\n\nhowever, “marital assets” were used to maintain the inheritance,\n\nthen the inheritance is subject to division as Marital\n\nPartnership Property.\n\n    At trial, Wife’s forensic accounting expert testified\n\npursuant to his report that a total of $463,455 had been paid\n\nfor Husband’s inheritance taxes.         He referenced his report,\n\nwhich included the itemized listing in Husband’s answers to\n\ninterrogatory number 9.     The inheritance taxes were included in\n\nthe amounts that the family court had ruled, before and after\n\ntrial, were “Category 3 assets [used] for marital purposes for\n\nwhich Husband is entitled to be repaid.”\n\n    Thus, those alleged “Category 3” disbursements included the\n\n$463,455 paid by Husband as inheritance taxes for his entire\n\ninheritance.   The entire $2,051,293 remaining in that\n\ninheritance was nonetheless characterized by the family court as\n\n“Marital Separate Property.”       Pursuant to Kakinami, however, if\n\na party uses marital assets to maintain an inheritance, the\n\ninheritance is no longer Marital Separate Property, but becomes\n\nsubject to division as Marital Partnership Property.            Thus, if\n\nthe $463,455 in inheritance taxes for the entire inheritance\n\ncame out of Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which\n\nHusband was entitled to be repaid, as ruled by the family court,\n\n                                    36\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nthen Marital Partnership Property was used to maintain the\n\n“separate” inheritance account, disqualifying the remaining\n\nfunds from being characterized as Marital Separate Property.\n\n    In order for the $2,051.293 remaining in Husband’s\n\ninheritance account to be his Marital Separate Property, as\n\nruled by the family court, the $463,455 paid as inheritance\n\ntaxes had to be excluded from Category 3 Marital Partnership\n\nProperty.   Thus, we hold that the family court erred, either by\n\ncharacterizing the entire $1,511,477 expended from Husband’s\n\ninheritance account as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property\n\nor by characterizing the $2,051,293 remaining in the account as\n\nMarital Separate Property.

This would include\n\nexpenditures for down payments, improvements, or toward the\n\nprincipal of loans related to Marital Partnership Property real\n\nestate, expenditures for Marital Partnership Property stock or\n\nbusiness interests, or other advances or payments toward Marital\n\nPartnership real or personal property or Marital Partnership\n\ninvestments.    Accordingly, expenditures for things such as a\n\nspouse’s or children’s educations, meals, trips, socializing,\n\nentertainment, requirements for daily living, etc., do not\n\nqualify, unless they are in the nature of a contribution to or\n\ninvestment in Marital Partnership Property.\n\n    In this case, the family court summarily categorized all\n\nexpenditures made by Husband from his Marital Separate Property\n\naccount as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which he\n\nwas entitled to be repaid upon divorce as a capital\n\ncontribution.    This already improperly included the $463,455\n\npaid as inheritance taxes, as noted in Section IV.B.2.a above.\n\nIt also appears to have included expenditures for Wife and the\n\nchildren’s trips, private school and university tuition and\n\nexpenses, cars, extracurricular activities, restaurant meals,\n\nbirthday and holiday presents, etc.         This does not comport with\n\nour case law, as explained above.        If such sums are\n\nautomatically characterized as Category 3 Marital Partnership\n\nProperty, a wealthy spouse could summarily be entitled to\n\n                                    39\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nreimbursement for half of all sums arguably expended on behalf\n\nof the spouse or children upon divorce.         It would be highly\n\nunusual for a wealthy spouse to make expenditures during a\n\nmarriage with a non-wealthy spouse for items not related to\n\ninvestment funds or assets while expecting to be repaid half of\n\nsuch expenditures upon divorce.       It defies logic to allow a\n\nwealthy spouse to make substantial expenditures that a non-\n\nwealthy spouse would never choose to make, has no control over,\n\nand probably never envisioned having to repay, and then to order\n\nthe non-wealthy spouse to reimburse the wealthy spouse for half\n\nof such expenditures at the time of divorce.          Under our case\n\nlaw, expenditures made from a Marital Separate Property account\n\nqualify for characterization as Category 3 Marital Partnership\n\nProperty only where they are in the nature of a contribution to\n\nor an investment in Marital Partnership Property.\n\n    Even if expenditures pass the threshold of being able to\n\nqualify as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property, the family\n\ncourt must still address the secondary issue of whether they\n\nwere actually contributions or investments with an expectation\n\nof repayment upon divorce.      In this regard,      Category 3 Marital\n\nPartnership Property includes property separately acquired by\n\ngift or inheritance during the marriage, but excludes the net\n\nmarket value attributable to property “that is subsequently\n\nlegally gifted by the owner to the other spouse, to both\n\n                                    40\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nspouses, or to a third party.”       Tougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 27, 868\n\nP.2d at 445 (emphasis added, citation omitted).          To constitute\n\na gift, there must be:     (1) donative intent; (2) delivery; and\n\n(3) acceptance.    76 Hawai‘i at 27, 31, 868 P.2d at 445, 449.\n\n    In this case, the family court first erroneously ruled that\n\nall of Husband’s expenditures from the Marital Separate Property\n\naccount qualified as Category 3 Marital Partnership Property\n\nwithout examining the expenditures to ascertain whether they\n\nwere in the nature of contributions to or investments in Marital\n\nPartnership Property.     The family court then also erred by\n\nruling, before hearing evidence on donative intent, that Husband\n\nwas entitled to be repaid the entire $1,511,447 expended from\n\nhis inheritance account.      Even though Wife briefly attempted to\n\ntestify at trial that Husband had not expected to be paid back\n\nany of this money, the family court had already ruled before\n\ntrial that none of these amounts were gifts, effectively\n\nprecluding evidence and argument on either issue.\n\n    Thus, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe family court erred in ruling before trial that all funds\n\nexpended by Husband from his Marital Separate Property\n\nconstituted Category 3 Marital Partnership Property for which he\n\nwas entitled to be repaid.      Upon remand, the family court must\n\nalso address the two issues discussed in this section.\n\n\n\n                                    41\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          3.     Equitable Deviation\n\n    The family court followed an erroneous approach to\n\nequitable deviation.     As stated above, the partnership model\n\nrequires the family court to “identify any equitable\n\nconsiderations justifying deviation from an equal distribution”\n\nof the marital estate before deciding “whether or not there will\n\nbe a deviation[.]”     Gordon, 135 Hawai‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018\n\n(internal citations omitted).      If the family court decides\n\nequitable considerations justify deviation from an equal\n\ndistribution, then it must “decide[] the extent of any\n\ndeviation.”    Id.\n\n    In this case, the family court first ordered an equal\n\ndistribution of alleged partnership losses, to the extent it\n\nruled that Husband was entitled to an equalization payment from\n\nWife of $549,873, before deciding whether equitable\n\nconsiderations justified deviation from such an equal\n\ndistribution.\n\n    Whether equitable considerations exist to justify deviation\n\nmust be determined, however, at the time the family court\n\ndecides whether to credit one partner for all of his or her\n\ncapital contributions, whether and how to distribute marital\n\nassets, and whether to award alimony.        See Gordon, 135 Hawai‘i at\n\n349, 350 P.3d at 1017 (“Each partner’s individual contributions\n\nto the marriage, i.e., the values of Category 1 and Category 3,\n\n                                    42\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nare to be repaid to the contributing spouse absent equitable\n\nconsiderations justifying a deviation.”).         In determining\n\nwhether the circumstances justify deviation from the partnership\n\nmodel, the family court must consider the following:            the\n\nrespective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the\n\nparties, the condition in which each party will be left by the\n\ndivorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit\n\nof the children of the parties, and all other circumstances of\n\nthe case.   135 Hawai‘i at 350, 350 P.3d at 1018.         See also\n\nTougas, 76 Hawai‘i at 32, 868 P.2d at 450 (“The court may,\n\nnevertheless, alter alimony, child support and . . . the\n\nultimate distribution of the marital estate based on the\n\nrespective separate conditions of the spouses.”).\n\n     In this case, the family court should have considered\n\nwhether equitable considerations justifying deviation from an\n\nequal distribution of Marital Partnership Property existed\n\nbefore ordering a 100% credit of Husband’s alleged Category 3\n\ncontributions.    In this regard, Husband’s arguments based on\n\nWong, 87 Hawai‘i 475, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1198816\"><a href=\"/opinion/1198816/wong-v-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, are unpersuasive.           In that\n\ncase, the family court did not award the husband the full value\n\nof his capital contribution.      In Wong, a husband and wife\n\njointly purchased two parcels of real property with $400,000 for\n\ndown payments received from the husband’s parents.           Upon\n\ndivorce, the family court ruled that the $400,000 was the\n\n                                    43\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nhusband’s Category 3 property.       87 Hawai‘i at 480, 960 P.2d at\n\n150.    The family court recognized that “[i]f [the husband] were\n\nto be returned his capital contribution, not only would [the\n\nhusband] be awarded all of the parties’ assets but [the wife]\n\nwould also need to reimburse [the husband] about $109,000,\n\nbecause [] the current net market value of the marital estate”\n\nhad declined.   Id.\n\n       This statement does not require the family court’s\n\ndeduction of capital contributions in excess of the marital\n\nestate, as Husband asserts.      In ultimately dividing the marital\n\nestate, the family court in Wong awarded the husband three out\n\nof four jointly owned properties, one of which had a negative\n\nnet market value.     The value of real property awarded to each\n\nspouse totaled $96,454 to the husband and $81,000 to the wife.\n\nSee id.   In affirming the property division on appeal, the ICA\n\nnoted that the husband left the marriage with less than his\n\ncapital contribution, while the wife left with “much more” than\n\nher negative capital contribution.        Id.   Thus, contrary to\n\nHusband’s assertion, Wong does not stand for the proposition\n\nthat a complete return of capital contributions is always\n\nrequired.    Rather, pursuant to the principles above, the family\n\ncourt must first decide whether equitable considerations justify\n\ndeviation from such an equal distribution of marital assets.\n\n\n\n                                    44\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n    Following the proper process could have significantly\n\ndifferent results for property division.         For example, in this\n\ncase, the family court could have found equitable considerations\n\njustifying departure from an equal distribution of partnership\n\nproperty based on the fact that Wife had virtually no assets and\n\nwould be left without a home in which to reside if an equal\n\ndistribution was made, before ordering a 100% credit of\n\nHusband’s alleged Category 3 contributions.          The family court\n\ncould then have decided the extent of the deviation with a view\n\ntoward reaching a just and equitable result, as more fully\n\ndiscussed in Section IV.B.5 below.        Instead, the family court\n\nordered an equal distribution of the alleged partnership losses.\n\n    Therefore, we also hold that the family court erred in\n\nordering an equal distribution of alleged partnership losses\n\nbefore deciding whether equitable considerations justified\n\ndeviation from an equal distribution.        On remand, the family\n\ncourt must first address whether any equitable considerations\n\njustifying deviation from an equal distribution exist, then\n\naddress whether or not there will be a deviation, then decide\n\nthe extent of any deviation.\n\n          4.    Consideration of Husband’s Inheritance to Deviate\n                from the Marital Partnership Model\n    Husband argues that the ICA erred in affirming the family\n\ncourt’s deviation from the Marital Partnership Model based on\n\n\n\n                                    45\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nhis Marital Separate Property inheritance.         He requests a\n\ndetermination that the family court’s reliance on his\n\ninheritance to justify a deviation was erroneous, or\n\nalternatively, that the property division be vacated and\n\nremanded with instructions to modify the equalization payment to\n\neliminate any consideration of his inheritance.\n\n     In response, Wife argues that Husband unfairly received\n\nboth 100% of his remaining Marital Separate Property inheritance\n\nand 100% of the Marital Partnership Property.          She contends that\n\nshe would have received at least 50% of the approximately\n\n$450,000 marital assets if they had filed for divorce before\n\nHusband received the inheritance.\n\n     Although we have already set aside the family court’s\n\nproperty division, we address these arguments to provide\n\nguidance on remand.     In Kakinami, we affirmed the ICA’s ruling\n\nthat “the mere existence of [] an inheritance does not, without\n\nmore, mandate deviation from the Marital Partnership Model.”\n\n127 Hawai‘i at 143, 276 P.3d at 712 (internal quotation marks and\n\nbrackets omitted) (quoting Kakinami v. Kakinami, No. 29340 (App.\n\nMay 11, 2011) (SDO)).

This court clarified that “all other\n\ncircumstances of the case” encompass “all other matters which\n\nwould have a bearing on the division and distribution of\n\nproperty.”   50 Haw. at 187, 436 P.2d at 11.\n\n     In Cassiday, this court recognized that other unique\n\nfactors beyond those set out in HRS § 580-47 may come into play,\n\nsuch as “the length of the marriage, the separate financial\n\ncontribution of each party to the upkeep of those assets, and\n\nthe involvement, direct or indirect, in the management and\n\nmaintenance of them.”     68 Haw. at 389, 716 P.2d at 1137.         In\n\nreversing the property division award, this court stated that\n\nthe family court had failed to consider “the extent to which the\n\nmarriage in and of itself affected the accumulation or\n\n                                    50\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\npreservation of [the husband’s] separate property.”           68 Haw. at\n\n387, 716 P.2d at 1137.\n\n    Cases such as Carson and Cassiday demonstrate the manner in\n\nwhich the family court, in its application of the partnership\n\nmodel, can unduly emphasize money or property brought into a\n\nmarriage over other non-economic considerations, such as the\n\ncontribution of services during the marriage, the value of which\n\nis not as readily quantifiable.       These cases demonstrate how one\n\nspouse’s non-economic contributions to the marriage can affect\n\nthe accumulation or preservation of the other spouse’s separate\n\nholdings, whether Marital Separate Property or Marital\n\nPartnership Property, and that the family court must take those\n\nfactors into consideration in fashioning a just and equitable\n\ndistribution of Marital Partnership Property under the\n\ncircumstances of the case.      “[M]arriage is a partnership to\n\nwhich both partners bring their financial resources as well as\n\ntheir individual energies and efforts.”         Collins, 133 Hawai‘i at\n\n43, 323 P.3d at 1225 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n“That one partner brings to the marriage substantially greater\n\nassets than the other does not make this any less the case.”\n\nCassiday, 68 Haw. at 387, 716 P.2d at 1136.\n\n    In this case, the family court’s property division award,\n\nawarded Wife, who has few employment prospects after a thirty-\n\nfour year partnership, $1,396 in bank accounts, a retirement\n\n                                    51\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\naccount worth $13,000, and a used Suzuki valued at $13,000,\n\nwhile awarding Husband, who had $2,051,293 in his bank account,\n\nthe marital residence with equity of $243,781, an office cottage\n\nvalued at $95,000, a $32,875 Camaro, a $1,000 Jeep, $57,835 in\n\nliquid cash accounts, and an IRA account valued at $8,645.             This\n\nsimply does not meet a “just and equitable” standard.            For this\n\nreason, also, the property division award would have been set\n\naside for abuse of discretion, even if we had not already\n\nordered it set aside for the reasons above.\n\n    C.      Temporary Spousal Support\n\n            1.   During the Pendency of Divorce Proceedings\n\n    Turning to other issues on certiorari, Husband argues that\n\nthe ICA erred in affirming the family court’s award of temporary\n\nsupport to Wife during the pendency of the divorce proceedings\n\nbecause Wife was “effectively awarded [Husband’s] inheritance”\n\ndespite its subsequent classification as Marital Separate\n\nProperty.    He further argues that the ICA and family court\n\nfailed to consider that Wife’s gross monthly income was greater.\n\nIn response, Wife contends that Husband’s argument lacks merit\n\nbecause he was ultimately credited with these payments when the\n\nfamily court treated his spent inheritance funds as his Category\n\n3 property and deducted it from the marital estate.\n\n    The family court is authorized to order temporary support\n\nunder HRS § 580-9 (2006), which provides, in relevant part:\n\n                                    52\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          After the filing of a complaint for divorce or separation\n          the court may make such orders relative to the personal\n          liberty and support of either spouse pending the complaint\n          as the court may deem fair and reasonable and may enforce\n          the orders by summary process.\n\n“An award for temporary support is a sum necessary for the\n\nmaintenance of a party pending litigation.”          Farias v.

Wife received\n\napproximately $1,380 per month as a nanny.            Comparatively,\n\nHusband reported a lower gross monthly income of $1,000;\n\nhowever, Husband held significantly greater assets.              Therefore,\n\nthe temporary spousal support award appears to have been “fair\n\nand reasonable” in light of Husband’s significant financial\n\nresources, which were sufficient to cover expenses for both\n\nhimself and Wife during the divorce.           Moreover, the family\n\ncourt’s finding in support of the pre-divorce temporary spousal\n\nsupport award refers to Wife’s Income & Expense statement and\n\nthe parties’ previous use of Husband’s inheritance funds for\n\nmarital expenses.       Thus, the family court properly considered\n\nthe parties’ respective incomes and Husband’s large assets as\n\ncompared to Wife’s in requiring Husband to pay temporary alimony\n\nfor the purpose of Wife’s maintenance pending litigation.                See\n\nHRS § 580-9.      Accordingly, the ICA did not err in ruling that\n\n“[t]here was no abuse of discretion in the family court’s\n\nconsideration of [Husband’s] financial resources in ordering\n\ntemporary spousal support for [Wife].”            Hamilton, mem. op. at\n\n18.\n\n             2.    Failure to Award Permanent Spousal Support\n\n       The family court ordered Husband to pay spousal support of\n\n$2,000 per month until Wife moved out of the marital residence\n\n                                       54\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\nthen $3,000 per month thereafter until December 2016.            Wife\n\nargues that the family court erred in failing to consider\n\naltering the amount or duration of post-divorce temporary\n\nspousal support to compensate her for the “grossly unequal\n\nproperty division caused by [Husband’s] inheritance.”            Comparing\n\nthe award of spousal support during the divorce proceedings to\n\nthe post-divorce award, Wife contends that an increase of $1000\n\nper month was “obviously inadequate” to cover her expenses where\n\npre-divorce spousal support also included housing and medical\n\nexpenses.\n\n     We have vacated the family court’s property division award.\n\nAs the need for spousal support will be related to the property\n\ndivision, we hereby also vacate the spousal support award.              See\n\nGordon, 135 Hawai‘i at 355, 350 P.3d at 1023.

Attorneys’ Fees\n\n    Over the course of the entire divorce proceeding, Wife\n\nreceived from Husband $60,450 out of $86,126.17 in attorney’s\n\nfees and costs.    Wife’s counsel declared that the amount\n\nrequested did not include attorney’s fees incurred after\n\npreparation of the closing argument and reply, which were still\n\naccumulating.\n\n    Husband argues that the attorneys’ fees and costs award to\n\nWife constituted an abuse of discretion because he had\n\ninsufficient income and the award “invaded” his inheritance,\n\nwhich he contends should have been “taken out of the equation”\n\nas Marital Separate Property.       Wife contends that Husband’s\n\nargument lacks merit because he was ultimately credited with\n\nthese payments when the family court treated his spent\n\ninheritance as a Category 3 asset and deducted it from the\n\nmarital estate.\n\n    This court has explained that “an award of attorney’s fees\n\nis in the sound discretion of the trial court, limited only by\n\nthe standard that it be fair and reasonable.”          Farias, 58 Haw.\n\nat 233, 566 P.2d at 1109 (citing Carson, 50 Haw. at 188, 436\n\nP.2d at 11; Richards, 44 Haw. at 496, 355 P.2d at 192).            With\n\nrespect to attorney’s fees and costs advanced to Wife during the\n\npendency of the divorce, HRS § 580-9 (2006) provides, in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n                                    57\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n          The court may also compel either spouse to advance\n          reasonable amounts for the compensation of witnesses and\n          other expenses of the trial, including attorney’s fees, to\n          be incurred by the other spouse and may from time to time\n          amend and revise the orders.\n\nWe have further stated:\n\n          In determining the fair and reasonable amount of attorney’s\n          fees, the trial court should consider the financial ability\n          of the parties and the amount necessary for the efficient\n          prosecution or defense of the action. The latter depends\n          on the character of the litigation, services to be\n          performed, and all other circumstances which may tend to\n          lessen or increase the probable expenses of the litigation.\n\n58 Haw. at 233, 566 P.2d at 1109 (citations omitted).\n\n    In this case, the family court’s award of attorney’s fees\n\nand costs appears to be fair and reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances.    Wife’s trial expenses were increased by\n\nHusband’s filing of five motions for partial summary judgment,\n\nwhich required extensive expert review of voluminous financial\n\ndocuments; a motion for reconsideration of an order granting and\n\ndenying in part a motion to compel; and a motion in limine.\n\nConsidering the parties’ financial abilities, discussed above,\n\nthe family court did not abuse its discretion in requiring\n\nHusband to advance amounts totaling $55,450 for trial expenses.\n\n    Regarding attorney’s fees awarded after divorce, HRS § 580-\n\n47(f) provides, in relevant part:\n\n                (f) Attorney’s fees and costs. The court hearing\n          any motion for orders either revising an order for the\n          custody, support, maintenance, and education of the\n          children of the parties, or an order for the support and\n          maintenance of one party by the other, or a motion for an\n          order to enforce any such order or any order made under\n          subsection (a) of this section, may make such orders\n          requiring either party to pay or contribute to the payment\n          of the attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses of the other\n\n\n                                    58\n\f   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***\n\n\n           party relating to such motion and hearing as shall appear\n           just and equitable after consideration of the respective\n           merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the\n           parties, the economic condition of each party at the time\n           of the hearing, the burdens imposed upon either party for\n           the benefit of the children of the parties, the concealment\n           of or failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation\n           of a restraining order issued under section 580-10(a) or\n           (b), if any, by either party, and all other circumstances\n           of the case.\n\n    Here, the family court concluded that Husband’s “superior\n\nfinancial condition” justified requiring him to pay Wife’s\n\nattorney’s fees.    This finding is supported by the parties’\n\nAsset and Debt statements, which show Husband as having\n\nsignificantly greater assets than Wife.         As stated supra,\n\nHusband’s individually held assets totaled more than $2 million,\n\nwhile Wife’s individually held assets totaled approximately\n\n$19,000.   Therefore, the evidence shows the family court\n\nproperly considered the factors in HRS § 580-47(f), in\n\nparticular the parties’ relative abilities and post-divorce\n\neconomic conditions.     Given the family court’s broad discretion,\n\nits award of attorney’s fees to Wife did not amount to an abuse\n\nof discretion.    Accordingly, the ICA did not err in affirming\n\nthe attorney’s fees and costs award to Wife.\n\nV.
