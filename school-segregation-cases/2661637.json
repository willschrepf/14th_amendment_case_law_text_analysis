The district court determined then\n\nthat the Greenville City and Pitt County Boards of Education\n\nwere operating racially segregated schools and directed them to\n\nsubmit      desegregation          plans    that      would     establish      a   nonracial,\n\nunitary school district.                   Following the school boards’ initial\n\ncompliance            with   the   orders,    the       cases     were    administratively\n\nclosed and lay dormant for over thirty-five years.\n\n       In 2008, a dispute arose between the Pitt County Board of\n\nEducation (the “Board”) 1 and the Greenville Parents Association\n\n(the        “Association”)            concerning            the       Board’s        explicit\n\nconsideration of race when devising student assignment plans.\n\nThe parties ultimately settled, and the district court entered a\n\nconsent order approving the settlement and directing the parties\n\nto work together toward attaining unitary status for the school\n\ndistrict.\n\n       Three years later, a group of parents and the Pitt County\n\nCoalition for Educating Black Children (“Plaintiffs”) moved to\n\nenjoin          the    implementation        of       the   Board’s      2011-12     student\n\n\n       1\n       By this date, the Greenville City and Pitt County schools\nhad been consolidated into a single school district.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fassignment    plan,     arguing    that        it   failed      to    move     the   school\n\ndistrict    toward     unitary     status.            The   district         court   denied\n\nrelief, but we vacated that ruling, holding that the district\n\ncourt erred when it failed to place the burden on the Board to\n\nshow that the 2011-12 student assignment plan moved the school\n\ndistrict toward unitary status.                 On remand, the Board filed a\n\nmotion requesting that the district court declare the school\n\ndistrict unitary.          After a five-day bench trial, the district\n\ncourt     granted    the   Board’s      motion        and     dismissed       Plaintiffs’\n\nrequest for an injunction as moot.\n\n     We     conclude    that     the    district        court        acted    within     its\n\ndiscretion     in    choosing      to    address        the     Board’s       motion     for\n\ndeclaration     of     unitary    status       before       ruling      on    Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for injunctive relief.                  And because the court did not\n\nclearly err in determining that the school district is unitary,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n\n\n                                          I.\n\n                                          A.\n\n        In January 1965, a group of plaintiffs representing black\n\nstudents filed suit against the Pitt County Board of Education,\n\nalleging     that    the   board       unlawfully       operated        and    maintained\n\nracially    segregated      schools.           Teel    v.     Pitt    County     Board    of\n\nEducation, No. 6:65-CV-569 (E.D.N.C. filed Jan. 4, 1965).                                The\n\n                                           4\n\fdistrict court entered an injunction restraining the Board from\n\nrefusing admission, assignment, or transfer of any student on\n\nthe basis of race.          The Board attempted to comply with the court\n\norder     by     adopting    a   freedom-of-choice            plan,       which    allowed\n\nstudents to choose the school they wished to attend.                          The plan,\n\nhowever, resulted in only a small percentage of black students\n\nattending       predominantly     white        schools.         As    a    result,     the\n\ndistrict court rejected it, ruling that it failed to advance the\n\nBoard’s        constitutional    duty     to        establish    a    unitary      school\n\ndistrict.        It took several more years for the Board to devise a\n\ndesegregation plan that met with the district court’s approval.\n\n      A separate but substantially similar action came before the\n\ndistrict       court   in    November     1969.          Like    Teel,       Edwards    v.\n\nGreenville City Board of Education, No. 6:69-CV-702 (E.D.N.C.\n\nfiled Nov. 12 1969), involved representatives of black students\n\nasking the district court to enjoin the Greenville City school\n\nboard’s    continued        operation   of      a    racially    segregated        school\n\nsystem.        Again, the district court granted the injunction.                       The\n\ncourt rejected the board’s first proposed desegregation plan and\n\nordered it to submit a plan that achieved racial integration in\n\nnot     only     student     assignment,       but     also     faculty      and     staff\n\nassignment,        extracurricular      activities,           and     transportation.\n\nShortly thereafter, the board submitted an amended plan that met\n\nwith both the plaintiffs’ and the court’s approval.\n\n                                           5\n\f     The district court continued to monitor the progress of the\n\ndesegregation plans until January 1972, when it issued orders\n\ndetermining that the cases had been decided on the merits and\n\nremoved them from the pending docket, subject to being reopened\n\nas circumstances warranted.          The cases remained administratively\n\nclosed for thirty-five years.           In the meantime, the two school\n\ndistricts merged in 1986 and their separate boards of education\n\nwere replaced by a single, consolidated Board.\n\n     The consolidated Board sought to reopen Teel and Edwards in\n\n2008.      The   impetus    was   the   Board’s   adoption,    three    years\n\nearlier,   of    a   new   student   assignment   plan   for   the     2006-07\n\nacademic year. 2     Under the then-existing attendance area policy,\n\nthe assignment plan considered students’ race, with the goal of\n\nachieving a 70/30 3 racial balance in each school.              To achieve\n\nthis balance, the new plan relied on satellite attendance areas 4\n\nand busing.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n        Only schools within the Greenville city                limits     were\nsubject to the 2006-07 student assignment plan.\n     3\n       By 70/30 racial balance, the Board intended no school to\nhave more than a seventy percent white or black population and\nno less than a thirty percent black or white population.\n     4\n        Satellite attendance areas are created by attaching\n“relatively homogenous neighborhoods of mostly one race” to\n“non-contiguous school zones some distance away that need[] that\nrace for racial balance.” J.A. 802.\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f       Objecting       to    the      explicit         use     of     race     in    student\n\nassignment,      the     Association      filed        a     discrimination         complaint\n\nwith the United States Department of Education Office for Civil\n\nRights (the “OCR”).           While the complaint was pending, the Board\n\nrevised its attendance area policy, adding student achievement\n\nand socioeconomic status as factors that, along with race, the\n\nBoard would consider when establishing student attendance areas.\n\n       Ultimately, the Board and the OCR settled the complaint.\n\nThe settlement required the school district to seek a ruling\n\nfrom the district court as to whether the desegregation orders\n\nin Teel and Edwards authorized the Board to consider race in its\n\nstudent assignment plan.              In accordance with the settlement, the\n\nBoard asked the district court to approve its 2006-07 student\n\nassignment plan as well as its revised attendance area policy.\n\n       In response, the district court reopened and consolidated\n\nTeel   and     Edwards      and     re-captioned       the     new    action    under      its\n\ncurrent name.       In addition, the court allowed the Association to\n\nintervene.        The Association then asked the district court to\n\nreject both the 2006-07 student assignment plan and the revised\n\nattendance area policy, and instead declare the school district\n\nunitary.       Plaintiffs joined the Board in opposing the motion.\n\n       After     court-ordered         mediation,          the      parties     reached      a\n\nsettlement.        The      Board    agreed       to   involve       Plaintiffs      and   the\n\nAssociation in developing the next student assignment plan.                                 In\n\n                                              7\n\fexchange, the Association withdrew its motion for a declaration\n\nof   unitary     status,      and   consented     to   the   Board’s    motion     for\n\napproval of the 2006-07 student assignment plan and the revised\n\nattendance area policy.              The parties also “pledge[d] to work\n\ntogether to achieve” unitary status for the school district.\n\nJ.A. 195.\n\n        The district court approved the settlement and entered a\n\nconsent order in November 2009.               The court’s order directed “the\n\nparties    to    work    toward     attaining    unitary     status    so   that   the\n\ncourt may relinquish jurisdiction over this case and restore to\n\nthe School Board full responsibility for the operation of its\n\nschools.”       J.A. 204.\n\n                                         B.\n\n        In 2010, the Board began developing a student assignment\n\nplan for the 2011-12 school year to accommodate the opening of a\n\nnew elementary school and the closing of an existing one.                          The\n\nBoard     worked       with   the     Operations       Research   and       Education\n\nLaboratory of North Carolina State University (“OREd”) 5 to draw\n\nup proposed attendance area maps.                 In designing the maps, the\n\nBoard     and   OREd    considered:     (1)     students’    proximity      to   their\n\n      5\n       OREd “is a non-profit organization that provides school\ndistricts with scientific tools to project future enrollment, to\nevaluate utilization of existing school facilities, to locate\nplacement of new schools, and to develop attendance boundaries.”\nJ.A. 492.\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fassigned       schools;       (2)       building         capacity;       (3)     academic\n\nproficiency; and (4) impact area 6.                Notably, academic proficiency\n\nwas     the    sole    diversity       input      factor       the   Board     used   when\n\ndesigning      the    maps,     even    though     the    Board’s       attendance    area\n\npolicy permitted it to consider student race.\n\n      The Board invited the Association and Plaintiffs to attend\n\ntwo   workshop        retreats    to    solicit     their       input    regarding    the\n\nproposed maps.          During the first retreat, the Board presented\n\ntwo proposals.          The first proposed map considered only student\n\nproximity       and     school         capacity     in      developing         attendance\n\nboundaries (“Scenario 1”).               This map resulted in an increase in\n\nracially identifiable schools, with six impacted schools falling\n\nshort     of   the    Board’s    target    student       proficiency       index.     The\n\nsecond proposed map factored in student proficiency along with\n\nproximity and school capacity (“Scenario 2”).                           It resulted in\n\nincreased student diversity, and a greater balance of student\n\nproficiency levels across the impacted schools.                              Scenario 2,\n\nunlike     Scenario     1,    required     the     use    of    satellite      attendance\n\nareas and busing.\n\n      After receiving input from the parties, the Board directed\n\nOREd to generate a new map.                This map (“Scenario 3”) aimed to\n\n\n      6\n       Impact area refers to the location and number of school\nattendance areas affected by the reassignment plan.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\flimit satellite attendance areas, but still considered student\n\nproficiency in an attempt to increase diversity.                    The proposed\n\nmap was then further modified based on community input.                        The\n\nfinal Scenario 3 map resulted in schools that were more racially\n\ndiverse than in Scenario 1, but less diverse than Scenario 2.\n\nIt also required fewer satellite attendance areas than Scenario\n\n2.   Over Plaintiffs’ objections, the Board adopted the Scenario\n\n3 map as its 2011-12 student assignment plan.\n\n        Plaintiffs moved to enjoin the implementation of the 2011-\n\n12 plan, arguing that it created racially identifiable schools\n\nand failed to move the district toward unitary status.                        The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, ruling that Plaintiffs “ha[d]\n\nnot demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\nclaim        so    as    to    justify   the    extraordinary       relief    they\n\nrequest[ed].”           Everett v. Juvenile Female 1, No. 6:69-CV-702-H,\n\n2011 WL 3606539, at *2 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 16, 2011).\n\n        On    appeal,     we   vacated   the   district   court’s    ruling    and\n\nremanded.         We found that:\n\n        Given that there is no dispute that the school\n        district   has  not    attained unitary status,  the\n        evidentiary burden should have been on the School\n        Board to prove that the 2011-12 Assignment Plan is\n        consistent with the controlling desegregation orders\n        and fulfills the School Board’s affirmative duty to\n        eliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move\n        toward unitary status.\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fEverett v. Pitt Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 678 F.3d 281, 290 (4th Cir.\n\n2012).\n\n     When the case returned to the district court, the Board\n\nmoved for a declaration of unitary status.                       After a five-day\n\nbench trial, the district court ruled for the Board.                      It found\n\nthat,    even     before   the   1986     merger,     both       Pitt   County    and\n\nGreenville City schools were unitary with respect to student\n\nassignment.       The court also found that the consolidated school\n\ndistrict    was     now    unitary   in       terms   of    faculty     and      staff\n\nassignment,       facilities,    transportation,           and     extracurricular\n\nactivities.\n\n     The Board, said the district court, had proven that “the\n\nvestiges of state-mandated discrimination practiced over forty\n\nyears ago have been eliminated to the extent practicable and\n\nthat the School Board, as well as its predecessor boards, has\n\ncomplied in good faith with this court’s desegregation orders.”\n\nEverett v. Pitt Cnty Bd. of Educ., No. 6:69-CV-702-H, slip op.\n\nat 42 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 25, 2013).                Because the school district\n\nwas unitary in all respects, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motion\n\nfor injunctive relief as moot.            This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                        II.\n\n                                        A.\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f       In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (Brown\n\nI),     the    Supreme          Court   held         that     laws       mandating       racial\n\nsegregation        in    public      schools        violate       the    Equal     Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.                          A year later, the Court\n\nordered those school boards operating racially segregated school\n\nsystems       to        “effectuate        a        transition           to    a     racially\n\nnondiscriminatory school system.”                      Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349\n\nU.S. 294, 301 (1955) (Brown II).                       The federal district courts\n\nwere tasked with undertaking “such proceedings and enter[ing]\n\nsuch    orders     and    decrees”      as     necessary       to       desegregate      school\n\ndistricts with “all deliberate speed.”                      Id.\n\n       Thirteen         years     later,       the     Court       clarified       that     the\n\n“transition to a unitary, nonracial system of public education\n\nwas and is the ultimate end to be brought about” by Brown II.\n\nGreen v. Cnty. Sch. Bd. of New Kent Cnty., 391 U.S. 430, 436\n\n(1968).       School boards operating “dual systems,” whereby black\n\nchildren attend black schools and white children attend white\n\nschools, retained “the affirmative duty to take whatever steps\n\nmight    be   necessary         to   convert     to    a    unitary       system    in    which\n\nracial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.”                                 Id.\n\nat 437-38.\n\n       Generally, courts “have used the terms ‘dual’ to denote a\n\nschool system which has engaged in intentional segregation of\n\nstudents      by   race,    and      ‘unitary’       to     describe      a   school     system\n\n                                               12\n\fwhich has been brought into compliance with the command of the\n\nConstitution.”            Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub. Schs. v. Dowell,\n\n498    U.S.    237,       246   (1991).                However,    the      Supreme     Court    has\n\ndeclined       to     give      the        term    “unitary”           a    “fixed     meaning    or\n\ncontent.”       Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 487 (1992).                                 Rather,\n\nthe    Court        has    left       it     to        district    courts       overseeing       the\n\ndesegregation process to determine when a school district “no\n\nlonger discriminates between children on the basis of race.”\n\nBelk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 269 F.3d 305, 318\n\n(4th Cir. 2001).\n\n       In making this determination, a district court considers\n\n“whether      the     Board         [has]     complied        in       good    faith     with    the\n\ndesegregation         decree        since         it    was   entered,        and    whether     the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination [have] been eliminated to the\n\nextent practicable.”                Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50.                      Only when it\n\nis    satisfied       that      a    school        district       is       operating    a   unitary\n\nsystem may the court dissolve a desegregation order, thereby\n\nrelinquishing             its    supervisory              authority          over    the     school\n\ndistrict.       See id. at 246 (“If [a desegregation] decree is to be\n\nterminated or dissolved, respondents as well as the school board\n\nare entitled to a like statement from the court.”); Riddick by\n\nRiddick v. Sch. Bd. of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 530 (4th Cir.\n\n1986) (“[The district court] is required to retain jurisdiction\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n\funtil    it   determines       that   the        school     system    has     become\n\nunitary.”).\n\n     The district court’s “end purpose must be to remedy the\n\nviolation     and,   in    addition,     to       restore     state    and    local\n\nauthorities to the control of a school system that is operating\n\nin compliance with the Constitution.”               Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489.\n\nIndeed, “[r]eturning schools to the control of local authorities\n\nat the earliest practicable date is essential to restore their\n\ntrue accountability in our governmental system.”                Id. at 490.\n\n                                       B.\n\n     With these principles in mind, we consider the merits of\n\nPlaintiffs’    legal   challenges.          We    first     address   Plaintiffs’\n\nclaim that the Board was estopped from seeking a retroactive\n\ndeclaration    of    unitary    status      given    its    “numerous       judicial\n\nadmissions . . . that it had not attained unitary status at any\n\ntime prior to 2009.” 7         Appellant’s Br. at 36.            We reject this\n\ncontention.\n\n\n     7\n       Plaintiffs and the dissent assert (incorrectly) that the\ndistrict court determined that the school district was unitary\nas of the mid-1980s.    In fact, the court found that the two\nthen-separate districts were unitary only as to student\nassignment, see Everett v. Pitt Cnty. Bd. of Educ., No. 6:69-CV-\n702-H, slip op. at 20, 23 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 25, 2013), which was\nnot sufficient to support a declaration of unitary status. The\ncourt implicitly recognized this fact, as it went on to conclude\nthat the school district remained unitary with respect to\nstudent assignment after the merger, and then conducted a\nthorough examination of the remaining Green factors.     Yet, by\n(Continued)\n                                       14\n\f      A judicial admission is a representation made by a party\n\nthat,      “unless     allowed       by    the    court    to    be    withdrawn,    is\n\nconclusive in the case.”              Meyer v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 372\n\nF.3d 261, 264 (4th Cir. 2004) (quoting Keller v. United States,\n\n58 F.3d 1194, 1199 n.8 (7th Cir. 1995)).                        Judicial admissions\n\n“go     to   matters        of     fact    which,      otherwise,      would    require\n\nevidentiary proof.”              New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d\n\n20,   24     (4th    Cir.    1963).        In    addition,      judicial      admissions\n\n“include intentional and unambiguous waivers that release the\n\nopposing party from its burden to prove the facts necessary to\n\nestablish the waived conclusion of law.”                     Minter v. Wells Fargo\n\nBank,      N.A.,     762    F.3d    339,    347     (4th   Cir.       2014)    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).                  A purported judicial admission is\n\nbinding      only     if    the     statement     is    “deliberate,       clear,   and\n\nunambiguous.”        Id.\n\n      Included among the statements that Plaintiffs rely on as\n\nexamples of judicial admissions are the Board’s statements in\n\nits motion for approval of the 2006-07 student assignment plan\n\nand revised attendance area policy that the school district “was\n\n\n\ndetermining that Plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin the 2011-12\nstudent assignment plan was moot, the district court necessarily\nfound--even if it did not say so expressly--that the school\ndistrict was unitary at the time of the implementation of the\n2011-12 plan.    As we explain, however, we do not think this\nproblematic.\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fpermitted to consider racial balance in student assignment under\n\nEdwards and Teel,” and could “adopt a racial balance ratio and\n\notherwise . . . consider         race    as     a     factor”      in    its    student\n\nassignment plans.      J.A. 90, 93, 95.               Plaintiffs also cite the\n\nBoard’s motion in support of the 2009 consent order in which the\n\nBoard acknowledged that “the Proposed Consent Order would not\n\ndispose of the unitary status issue once and for all.”                                J.A.\n\n178.\n\n       These statements, however, merely acknowledged the judicial\n\nreality on the ground, i.e. that the school district remained\n\nsubject to the district court’s desegregation orders until the\n\ncourt declared the schools unitary.                    They fall far short of\n\ndeliberate,   clear,   and       unambiguous        admissions     that     the   Board\n\ncontinued to operate a dual school district.\n\n       In any event, Plaintiffs’ contention suffers from a more\n\nfundamental   flaw.      Simply     put,      whether      a    school   district      is\n\nunitary is not something that can be judicially admitted (or\n\ndenied); rather, it is entirely the province of the district\n\ncourt to decide the issue.          This conclusion is compelled by our\n\ndecision in Belk.\n\n       There, the school board insisted to the district court that\n\nit “had not pursued the dismantlement of the dual system with\n\nthe    requisite   zeal.”        Belk,    269       F.3d   at    333.       The   court\n\nnonetheless   declined      to   defer    to    the    board’s      claim      that    its\n\n                                         16\n\fschool district was not unitary.                  Indeed, it highlighted several\n\nreasons why the board might have wanted to remain subject to the\n\ndesegregation      orders,       including        avoiding    the      “long,    drawn-out\n\nprocess” and expense involved with a unitary status hearing,\n\nfears that it might lose eligibility for certain federal funding\n\nshould it be declared unitary, and a desire to continue racially\n\nbalancing its schools.            Id.    We approved of the district court’s\n\nfinding     on    this     issue,       concluding       that      a    school     board’s\n\nrepresentation      that    it    is     not   unitary       may    reflect     the    self-\n\ninterested desire of a board to use a desegregation order as a\n\n“mechanism[] for the attainment of different goals.”                                  Id. at\n\n334.\n\n       Consequently, even if the Board in this case had admitted\n\nthat   it   continued       to    operate         a   dual   school      district,       the\n\ndistrict    court   was     under       no   obligation      to    treat     the   Board’s\n\nstatements as conclusive in deciding whether the school district\n\nwas unitary.\n\n                                             C.\n\n       Plaintiffs next contend that the district court violated\n\nthe “law of the case” by considering the unitary status question\n\nbefore    first   deciding       whether       the    2011-12      student      assignment\n\nplan moved the school district toward that status.                              The law of\n\nthe case doctrine “posits that when a court decides upon a rule\n\nof law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues\n\n                                             17\n\fin subsequent stages in the same case.”                 Christianson v. Colt\n\nIndus.    Operating     Corp.,   486    U.S.    800,    816   (1988)    (quoting\n\nArizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983)).                   Once a court\n\nhas established the law of the case,\n\n      it must be followed in all subsequent proceedings in\n      the same case in the trial court or on a later\n      appeal . . . unless: (1) a subsequent trial produces\n      substantially   different  evidence,   (2)  controlling\n      authority has since made a contrary decision of law\n      applicable to the issue, or (3) the prior decision was\n      clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\n\nUnited States v. Aramony, 166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir. 1999)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).             Because we find the first\n\nexception applicable here, we reject Plaintiffs’ contention.\n\n      According to Plaintiffs, we established the law of the case\n\nduring the first appeal when we directed the district court to\n\nplace the evidentiary burden on the Board “to prove that the\n\n2011-12    Assignment     Plan   is    consistent      with   the    controlling\n\ndesegregation orders and fulfills the School Board’s affirmative\n\nduty to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move toward\n\nunitary status.”      Everett, 678 F.3d at 290.          Plaintiffs say that\n\nthe   district   court’s     finding     that    the    school      district   was\n\nalready unitary at the time of the implementation of the 2011-12\n\nstudent assignment plan effectively ignores our prior holding.\n\n      When we first considered this case, however, the only issue\n\ndecided by the district court was whether the 2011-12 student\n\nassignment plan was consistent with the Board’s obligation to\n\n                                       18\n\fwork   toward   attaining   unitary    status.       On   remand,    the    Board\n\nmoved for just such a declaration.            In response, the district\n\ncourt held a trial during which the parties, for the first time,\n\npresented evidence on that issue.          Once the district court took\n\nevidence on the question, it was no longer bound by the law of\n\nthe case, but was instead free to determine whether the school\n\ndistrict was unitary.        Accordingly, we find no error in the\n\nmanner in which the district court elected to address the issues\n\nbefore it.\n\n                                      D.\n\n       We turn now to the heart of Plaintiffs’ challenge to the\n\nprocess by which the district court resolved this case.                       In\n\nessence, Plaintiffs contend that the Board first had to prove\n\nthat   the   2011-12    student    assignment    plan     moved     the    school\n\ndistrict toward unitary status before the district court could\n\ndeclare the schools unitary.          Plaintiffs say that by flipping\n\nthe issues--that is, by first declaring the schools unitary and\n\nthen   refusing,   on   mootness   grounds,     to   assess   the    merits    of\n\n2011-12 student assignment plan--the district court improperly\n\ngave the unitary status determination retroactive effect.                  We do\n\nnot agree.\n\n                                      1.\n\n       Plaintiffs contend that a declaration of unitary status is\n\neffective only as of the date it is issued.                Therefore, until\n\n                                      19\n\fSeptember       25,    2013    (the       date    of    the    district          court’s    order\n\ndeclaring the school district unitary), any Board action had to\n\nbe     consistent      with        its    obligations         under    the       desegregation\n\norders,    and    the       later    2009      consent      order.         By     deciding       the\n\nunitary     status         issue     before      evaluating         the     2011-12      student\n\nassignment plan, Plaintiffs say that the district court made an\n\nunlawful retroactive declaration of unitary status.\n\n       It is of course true that, until declared unitary, a school\n\ndistrict retains a continuing duty to work toward eliminating\n\nthe vestiges of its past discrimination.                            Riddick, 784 F.2d at\n\n535;    Vaughns       by    Vaughns       v.   Bd.     of   Educ.     of    Prince       George’s\n\nCnty., 758 F.2d 983, 988 (4th Cir. 1985) (“Until a school system\n\nhas discharged its duty to liquidate the dual system and replace\n\nit with a unitary one, the school’s duty remains in place.”).\n\nWhether     a    school       district         has     eliminated          the    vestiges       of\n\ndiscrimination is judged against what are known as the Green\n\nfactors.        See Green v. Cnty. Sch. Bd. of New Kent Cnty., 391\n\nU.S. 430 (1968).             Under Green, “a school district has achieved\n\nunitary status when it is devoid of racial discrimination in\n\nregard     to     faculty,          staff,       transportation,             extracurricular\n\nactivities,       facilities,            and   pupil    assignment.”              Sch.     Bd.    of\n\nRichmond v. Baliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1312 (4th Cir. 1987).\n\n       A dual school district operates under a presumption “that\n\ncurrent disparities are causally related to prior segregation,\n\n                                                 20\n\fand   the   burden      of    proving    otherwise     rests   on     the    [school\n\nboard].”    Id. at 1311.        That presumption, however, ends when the\n\nschool has achieved unitary status, at which point the burden of\n\nproof shifts back to the plaintiffs “to prove discriminatory\n\nintent on the part of the school board of a unitary school\n\n[district].”     Riddick, 782 F.2d at 537.\n\n      Importantly,      the    burden    of   proof    shifts,      not     when   the\n\nschool district is declared unitary, but when the district court\n\ndetermines it first achieved that status.                 This proposition is\n\nexemplified     by   our     decision    in   School   Board     of   Richmond     v.\n\nBaliles.    In that case, after a court-ordered freedom-of-choice\n\nplan proved unsuccessful, the district court ordered the School\n\nBoard of the City of Richmond to implement a desegregation plan\n\nthat “required extensive busing of students, proximal geographic\n\nzoning, pairing, clustering, satellites and racial balance among\n\nfaculty.”      Bradley v. Baliles, 639 F. Supp. 680, 682 (E.D. Va.\n\n1986).\n\n      Twelve    years    later,    the    board   came   before       the   district\n\ncourt asking to be realigned as plaintiffs and to have certain\n\nstate officials, including the Governor of Virginia, joined as\n\ndefendants.      It argued that Virginia had “engaged in various\n\nactivities which contributed to the segregation that existed in”\n\nRichmond Public Schools.           Id.     Consequently, the board “sought\n\nto compel the state to fund remedial and compensatory programs\n\n                                         21\n\fto eliminate the lingering effects of the state’s former dual\n\nsystem.”      Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1310.\n\n       The district court found that Richmond Public Schools had\n\nachieved       unitary    status     sometime    between        1972     and       1986.\n\nBradley, 639 F. Supp. at 687.               Because the school district had\n\nbecome unitary, the court concluded that the burden had shifted\n\nto the board to prove that any vestiges of past state-mandated\n\nsegregation remained in Richmond Public Schools.                       Id. at 689.\n\nThe court then proceeded to address and deny the board’s request\n\nfor relief.\n\n       On appeal, we affirmed the district court’s shifting of the\n\nburden.       Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1312.         Thus, Baliles demonstrates\n\nthat    a     district    court     may     assess     unitary     status      before\n\naddressing the request for relief that brought the plaintiff\n\nbefore the court in the first place.                 This is true, even though\n\nthe declaration may weaken (or even eliminate) the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim for relief.\n\n       The only authority that Plaintiffs cite in support of their\n\nclaim that a unitary status determination cannot relate back is\n\nCapacchione      v.   Charlotte-Mecklenburg          Schools,    57    F.    Supp.    2d\n\n228, 285 (W.D.N.C. 1999), aff’d in part, rev’d in part by Belk,\n\n269    F.3d    305.      There,    the    district    court     stated      that    “the\n\ntermination of court supervision today cannot ‘relate back’ to\n\nan earlier time.”         Id.     However, in context, that statement was\n\n                                          22\n\fpart of a larger discussion on whether school officials acting\n\npursuant to a court’s desegregation order enjoyed immunity from\n\ndamages.     Indeed, the court held that the school district “was\n\nstill under court order [and there was] no legal basis for a\n\nfinding    of    de    facto     unitary     status       that    would     abrogate        [the\n\ndistrict’s] immunity retroactively.”                    Id.\n\n     This,       of    course,       must    be     the      case      given    the    “well-\n\nestablished       insistence         that    those      who      are      subject     to    the\n\ncommands    of    an    injunctive          order    must     obey      those     commands.”\n\nPasadena    City      Bd.   of      Educ.    v.

It follows that school officials, acting pursuant to\n\ntheir obligations under a desegregation order, cannot be held\n\nliable    for    damages       on    account       of   those       actions.          However,\n\nCapacchione       has    little       relevance         here,       where      the    court’s\n\n“retroactive”         unitary       status     declaration          merely      shifts      the\n\nburden of proving discriminatory intent.\n\n                                              2.\n\n     The    district        court’s     decision        to    assess       unitary      status\n\nfirst comports with its obligation to “restore state and local\n\nauthorities to the control of a school system that is operating\n\nin compliance with the Constitution.”                     Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489.\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that district court\n\nsupervision is a “temporary measure.”                      Id.; Dowell, 498 U.S. at\n\n247; see also Dayton Bd. of Educ. v.

Pitt Cnty. Bd. of Educ., No. 6:69-CV-702-H, slip op.\n\nat 40-41 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 25, 2013).                          Still, if Plaintiffs had\n\nmade     credible         allegations          that         the       Board      was     taking\n\nintentionally          segregative            actions,          an     injunction        should\n\nnonetheless issue.             But here, Plaintiffs’ request to enjoin the\n\n2011-12      student      assignment          plan     depends         entirely    on        their\n\nallegation        that    the    plan        “moves       the    district      further       from\n\n                                               24\n\funitary status.”      J.A. 214.      Because the district court held\n\nthat the school district was unitary at the time of the plan’s\n\nimplementation    (and    has    remained      so),   it   did   not    err    in\n\ndismissing Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief as moot.\n\n\n\n                                    III.\n\n                                     A.\n\n     Having determined that the district court did not err in\n\nthe manner in which it addressed the issues before it, we now\n\nreach the merits of its finding that the school district is\n\nunitary.   We review this determination for clear error.                  Belk,\n\n269 F.3d at 317.     “A finding is clearly erroneous when, although\n\nthere is evidence to support it, on the entire evidence the\n\nreviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction\n\nthat a mistake has been committed.”               Id. at 317-18 (quoting\n\nFaulconer v. Comm’r, 748 F.2d 890, 895 (4th Cir. 1984)).                 We may\n\nnot overturn the district court so long as its “unitary status\n\ndetermination rests on a permissible view of the evidence,” even\n\nif we might have ruled differently had we been sitting as the\n\ntrier of fact.      Id.     If the “district court’s account of the\n\nevidence   is   plausible   in   light    of   the    record   viewed   in    its\n\nentirety,” then we must affirm.           Id. at 319 (quoting Anderson v.\n\nCity of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985)).\n\n\n\n                                     25\n\f      The    test   for     determining       whether       a     school      district      is\n\nunitary     is   twofold.        The    district        court   must     find      that    the\n\nschool      district      has     “complied         in     good     faith       with       the\n\ndesegregation       decree      since   it    was       entered,”       and   it    must    be\n\nsatisfied that “the vestiges of past discrimination [have] been\n\neliminated to the extent practicable.”                    Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-\n\n50.     We have said previously that “[i]mplicit in the . . . term\n\n‘practicable’ is ‘a reasonable limit on the duration of federal\n\nsupervision.’”       Belk, 269 F.3d at 318 (quoting Coal. to Save Our\n\nChildren v. State Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 760 (3d Cir. 1996))\n\n(alteration omitted).\n\n      When deciding whether a school district has eliminated the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination, the district court considers\n\nthe six Green factors: student assignment, faculty assignment,\n\nstaff    assignment,      transportation,           extracurricular           activities,\n\nand facilities.         See Belk, 269 F.3d at 318-19 (citing Green, 391\n\nU.S. at 435).       In addition, the court has discretion to consider\n\nother factors not listed in Green.                 Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.\n\n      Before a school district is declared unitary, there is a\n\npresumption that racial disparities in any of the Green factors\n\nare   traceable     to    segregation.            Baliles,        829    F.2d      at   1311.\n\nHowever, that presumption is overcome when a school district\n\ndemonstrates that racial disparities are a result, not of its\n\npresent     or   past    discrimination,          but    rather     external       factors,\n\n                                             26\n\fsuch   as    demographic         changes,     beyond       the    district’s     control.\n\nMissouri      v.

Moreover, “with the passage of time, the degree to which\n\nracial      imbalances          continue      to     represent        vestiges     of     a\n\nconstitutional violation may diminish.”                          Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n491.\n\n       As we explain below, we find that the district court did\n\nnot    clearly      err    in     finding     that     the       school   district      has\n\neliminated the vestiges of its past discrimination.\n\n                                             B.\n\n                                             1.\n\n       The first and “perhaps the most critical Green factor” is\n\nwhether      there        remains     any     racial        disparity      in     student\n\nassignment.        See Belk, 269 F.3d at 319.                    When analyzing racial\n\nimbalances     in    student        assignment,       district       courts     generally\n\ncompare the variance between an individual school’s ratio of\n\nblack students to white students to a broader measure of the\n\nentire school district’s population of black students and white\n\nstudents.     See id.\n\n       The parties called competing expert witnesses to testify as\n\nto the Board’s efforts to eliminate racial disparity in student\n\nassignment.         The    Board’s        witness,    Dr.    David    Armor,     reviewed\n\n                                             27\n\fstudent enrollment data for the Pitt County schools (and the\n\nGreenville City schools, pre-merger) from 1968 to 2011. 8                               To\n\ndetermine    whether     the     schools          were    racially    balanced       post-\n\nmerger, Dr. Armor applied a plus-or-minus 20% variance comparing\n\nthe percentage of black students at a particular school to the\n\npercentage of black students enrolled at that grade level (i.e.,\n\nK-5, 6-8, 9-12).        Pre-merger, Dr. Armor compared the percentage\n\nof   black   students     at        a     particular      school     to     the    overall\n\npercentage of black students enrolled in the school district.\n\n     Dr. Armor found that, pre-merger, the school boards were\n\nsuccessfully     able   to     desegregate          their    schools       and    maintain\n\nracial balance.     He thus concluded that the school district was\n\nunitary   with   respect       to       student    assignment,       even    before    the\n\nmerger.      Following     the          merger,    Pitt    County    saw     substantial\n\npopulation growth with attendant demographic changes.                             Even so,\n\nDr. Armor found that twenty-six of the thirty-seven schools in\n\nthe district were racially balanced for twenty or more years,\n\nand were also balanced as of the 2011-12 school year.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       For the years 1968 to 1984, Dr. Armor only had access to\nstudent enrollment data for even-numbered years.     We do not\nbelieve that Dr. Armor’s lack of data for odd-numbered years\nsubstantially undermines the credibility of his testimony and\nreport.   We also note that Plaintiffs’ expert relied on this\nsame data for her analysis.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       On the other hand, Plaintiffs’ student assignment expert,\n\nDr.    Genevieve       Siegel-Hawley,    applied    a   plus-or-minus       15%\n\nvariance in comparing the share of black or white students at a\n\nparticular school to the district-wide share of black or white\n\nstudents. 9      She found that, since 1987, an average of eight\n\nschools were racially imbalanced each year.               By 2011, fourteen\n\nschools were racially imbalanced.            Since 2001, three new schools\n\nwere built that opened with a racial imbalance.\n\n       Overall, Dr. Siegel-Hawley concluded that “[d]ownturns in\n\nlevels of racial imbalance were quickly followed by increases,\n\nindicating      that    [the   school   district]   did    not   sustain    an\n\neffective desegregation program for more than a year.”                     J.A.\n\n656.       Indeed, she testified that the 2011-12 student assignment\n\nplan resulted in a post-merger high of 40% of students attending\n\na racially imbalanced school.            Thus, according to Dr. Siegel-\n\nHawley, the Board had failed to eliminate the vestiges of past\n\ndiscrimination in regard to student assignment.\n\n       The district court adopted Dr. Armor’s metrics and relied\n\nprimarily on his analysis in finding the school district unitary\n\nwith respect to student assignment.             First, it found that Dr.\n\n       9\n       Before the merger, Dr. Siegel-Hawley compared the white\npopulation of an individual school to the white population of\nthe entire school district.      Post-merger, Dr. Siegel-Hawley\ncompared the black population of an individual school to that of\nthe entire school district.\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\fArmor’s      use    of     a    plus-or-minus        20%    variance       was      reasonable.\n\nWhile we have previously specifically approved the plus-or-minus\n\n15% variance that Dr. Siegel-Hawley applied, we have also noted\n\napprovingly         that       higher      variances       have    been     used         by   other\n\ncourts.      See Belk, 269 F.3d at 319 (citing the plus-or-minus 20%\n\nvariance used in Manning v. Hillsborough County School Board,\n\n244 F.3d 927, 935 (11th Cir. 2001)).\n\n     Moreover,           the     district       court       found      that        Dr.    Armor’s\n\ncomparison         (post-merger)           of   an     individual          school’s           racial\n\ncomposition to the student population of that particular grade\n\nlevel was a superior metric to Dr. Siegel-Hawley’s comparison to\n\nthe student population of the school district as a whole.                                       The\n\ncourt agreed         with       Dr.   Armor     “that      the    racial    composition          of\n\nstudents      attending          elementary          schools      within       a     particular\n\ndistrict may be far different from the racial composition of\n\nthat district’s high schools.”                       Everett v. Pitt Cnty. Bd. of\n\nEduc., No. 6:69-CV-702-H, slip op. at 14 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 25,\n\n2013).\n\n     We believe that the district court’s decision to rely on\n\nDr. Armor’s report and testimony was not clearly erroneous.                                     See\n\nFTC v. Ross, 743 F.3d 886, 894 (4th Cir. 2014) (“In cases in\n\nwhich    a   district          court’s      factual     findings       turn    on . . .         the\n\nweighing      of    conflicting          evidence      during      a   bench       trial,      such\n\nfindings      are    entitled         to    even     greater      deference.”            (internal\n\n                                                30\n\fquotation marks omitted)).                And we agree with the district court\n\nthat, to the extent that racial imbalance remains an issue in\n\nthe school district, there is substantial evidence indicating\n\nthat it was caused by white students either leaving the public\n\nschool    system,        or    moving           to       more     racially       segregated\n\nneighborhoods.\n\n      The Supreme Court has been clear that school districts need\n\nnot   take    affirmative          measures        to    correct    racial       imbalances\n\ncaused   by    demographic          changes        once    they    have    remedied       the\n\neffects of prior de jure segregation.                       Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494\n\n(“Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has\n\nbeen remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy\n\nimbalance that is caused by demographic factors.”); Swann, 402\n\nU.S. at 31-32.      Moreover, “[t]he continued existence of a small\n\nnumber of one race schools within . . . a school district does\n\nnot   establish    in    and       of    itself      a    constitutional        violation.”\n\nRiddick, 784 F.2d at 535.\n\n      Here, the most striking instance of “white flight” came in\n\nresponse to the Board’s aggressive 2006-07 student assignment\n\nplan, which “used satellite school [attendance areas] and racial\n\nbalancing ratios in an effort to reduce the racial isolation of\n\nelementary     schools        in        the   former       Greenville          City     school\n\ndistrict.”        J.A.    201.            The      implementation         of     that    plan\n\nultimately     resulted       in     a    significant           decline   in     the    white\n\n                                              31\n\fstudent population, much of which left the impacted schools for\n\nprivate schools, home schooling, or other schools in the County.\n\n     While the Board was under no duty to implement intensive\n\ndesegregation efforts given that many of the remaining racially\n\nidentifiable schools were a consequence of demographic shifts\n\nwithin Greenville, its failed efforts at bringing greater racial\n\nbalance to Greenville City schools illustrate that any remaining\n\nsegregation in the school district is a consequence of outside\n\nforces that cannot properly be attributed to the Board’s prior\n\ndiscriminatory acts.        We therefore find no clear error in the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that the school district is unitary\n\nwith respect to student assignment.\n\n                                        2.\n\n     Next, we consider two Green factors together, faculty and\n\nstaff assignment.       Here, all of the Board’s data comes from 2004\n\nand later.      Dr. Armor employed a variance of plus-or-minus 10%\n\nto   compare    the     number   of    black   faculty   and   staff    at   an\n\nindividual     school    with    the   districtwide   percentage   of    black\n\nfaculty and staff. 10       He found that, since 2004, thirty-one out\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       Plaintiffs argue that there was no basis for Dr. Armor’s\nuse of the plus-or-minus 10% variance.       We have, however,\npreviously approved the use of an even greater variance--plus-\nor-minus 15%--with respect to faculty assignment.     Belk, 269\nF.3d at 326.\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fof thirty-six schools maintained racial balance in faculty and\n\nstaff, or were only slightly imbalanced for one or two years.\n\n       Furthermore, Dr. Armor testified that nearly all of the\n\nschools during that time had a racially mixed administrative\n\nstaff.         In     addition,      the     former       district      superintendent\n\ntestified that she specifically considered the diversity that a\n\ncandidate for a vacant principal or assistant principal position\n\ncould offer to the school.                 The Board also introduced evidence\n\nshowing the efforts the district has made to recruit minority\n\nteachers.      In short, the district court had sufficient evidence\n\nbefore it to conclude that the Board undertook diligent efforts\n\nthat   ultimately         resulted    in    a    racially      diverse    faculty     and\n\nadministrative staff at its schools.\n\n                                            3.\n\n       The     next       Green    factor       we     consider    is    the     Board’s\n\nmaintenance         and     provision      of      adequate     school     facilities.\n\nPlaintiffs do not say that the school district is not unitary\n\nwith respect to quality of facilities.                    Rather, they claim that\n\nthe    Board    failed      to     prove    that      siting   decisions       are   made\n\nconsistently        with     the    Board’s      obligation       to    eliminate     the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination.                     The district court disagreed,\n\nand we believe that it did not clearly err.\n\n       The Board uses a Long Range Facility Plan to “strategically\n\nlocate schools where residential growth is anticipated.”                             J.A.\n\n                                            33\n\f1029.      It determines when improvements or new construction are\n\nnecessary based on the overall needs of the individual school\n\nand the school district in general.                       Since 1990, the district\n\nhas worked with OREd to determine where to locate new schools.\n\nOREd uses a computer model that determines the “optimal location\n\nfor    a   new     site    that     will    relieve      the    current    crowding   and\n\nprovide room for anticipated growth.”                      J.A. 2402.       The Board’s\n\nevidence         adequately       demonstrates     that    new    schools     are   sited\n\naccording to the needs of the district overall, and that the\n\nBoard works with OREd in a race-neutral manner to make siting\n\ndecisions.\n\n                                             4.\n\n       We also discern no error in the district court’s finding\n\nthat       the     school     district        is    unitary        with     respect    to\n\ntransportation.           The school district provides bus service to all\n\neligible     students.            Students    qualify     for    bus   transportation,\n\nregardless         of     race,     based    on    the    distance        between   their\n\nresidences and their assigned schools.                         Moreover, travel times\n\nare actually longer for white and Hispanic students than for\n\nblack students.             Thus, we find no basis for questioning the\n\ndistrict court’s view that students receive transportation to\n\nschool on a racially nondiscriminatory basis.\n\n                                             5.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f      Finally,        the    district         court    did     not     clearly         err    in\n\nconcluding that the school district is unitary with respect to\n\nextracurricular activities.                   The Board’s evidence showed that\n\nsuch activities are available in all schools, and there are no\n\nrace-based        barriers       to     participation.              Moreover,          students\n\nthroughout      the      district       are     adequately          informed      about      the\n\navailability       of    extracurricular           activities.             Nor    are     there\n\nfinancial    barriers        to   participation.               We    think       the    Board’s\n\nevidence was sufficient for the district court to conclude that\n\nthe   district      is      unitary      with      respect     to     this       final    Green\n\nfactor. 11\n\n                                              C.\n\n      Our    analysis       of    the    Board’s       efforts        to    eliminate        the\n\nvestiges     of    past      discrimination           to   the       extent       practicable\n\nsatisfies us that the district court did not clearly err in also\n\nfinding that the Board has complied in good faith with the Teel\n\nand   Edwards      desegregation          orders.          A     school       district       can\n\ndemonstrate its good faith compliance by showing its “commitment\n\nto a constitutional course of action [in which] its policies\n\n      11\n       Despite Plaintiffs’ urging, the district court refused to\nconsider disparity in student discipline as an ancillary factor\nin addition to the Green factors.        We find no abuse of\ndiscretion in this decision because there was not sufficient\nevidence in the record demonstrating that the school district\ntargets black students for discipline or otherwise treats them\ndifferently in disciplinary matters. See Belk, 269 F.3d at 332.\n\n\n\n                                              35\n\fform    a      consistent       pattern         of     lawful        conduct       directed     to\n\neliminating earlier violations.”                      Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.                 We\n\nagree with the district court that the Board has demonstrated\n\ncommendable       good     faith      in    complying          with       the   desegregation\n\norders.\n\n       Indeed, we need look no further for proof than the fact\n\nthat the desegregation orders remained administratively closed\n\nfor     over     thirty-five       years,            during     which       time     the     Board\n\nundertook        the     task    of     integrating            the     schools       relatively\n\nundisturbed.           Until    2008,      no    party        came    before    the    district\n\ncourt    accusing        the    Board      of    neglecting          or    disregarding        its\n\nobligations under the desegregation orders.                               And when this case\n\nwas reopened, it was as a consequence of a dispute regarding the\n\n2006-07        student    assignment            plan     in     which       certain        parents\n\nessentially argued that the Board went too far in its efforts to\n\ndesegregate the schools.                Moreover, in the proceedings leading\n\nup to the district court’s 2009 consent order, Plaintiffs and\n\nthe Board were both aligned in opposition to the Association’s\n\nmotion for declaration of unitary status.\n\n       From the date the district court entered its desegregation\n\norders,        school      administrators              took      immediate           steps      to\n\neffectively integrate their schools and move them toward unitary\n\nstatus.        In very short order, both school districts had almost\n\ncompletely       eliminated       racially           identifiable          schools.          While\n\n                                                36\n\fracial    imbalance      returned       over    the     succeeding      years,      the\n\nrespective      boards   consistently         took    measures    to    bring      their\n\nschools back into balance.\n\n       Post-merger,      the     consolidated          Board     used        satellite\n\nattendance areas and busing to maintain racial balance.                             When\n\ndemographic factors caused an increase in racially identifiable\n\nschools, the Board took reasonable steps to restore balance.\n\nUltimately, a substantial number of schools were able to achieve\n\nracial balance, and maintain it as of the 2011-12 school year.\n\nIn short, we are convinced that the Board has acted in good\n\nfaith since the entry of the desegregation orders in 1970.                           We\n\ntherefore conclude that the district court did not clearly err\n\nin finding that the Board satisfied this prong of the unitary\n\nstatus inquiry.\n\n\n\n                                         IV.\n\n       In sum, the district court did not err by first determining\n\nthat   the    Pitt    County    school    district       is    unitary,      and    then\n\ndenying      Plaintiffs’    motion       to    enjoin     the    2011-12      student\n\nassignment plan as moot.         And because the district court did not\n\nclearly   err    in   finding    that    the    school    district      is    in    fact\n\nunitary, the judgment of the district court is\n\n                                                                             AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fWYNN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       In 2010 parents of minor children attending schools in Pitt\n\nCounty    and     the    Pitt     County      Coalition        for    Educating      Black\n\nChildren (“Appellants”) sought to enjoin implementation of the\n\nPitt   County     Board    of    Education’s         (“Board”)       2011-2012      student\n\nassignment plan (“2011-2012 Plan”).                   Appellants alleged that the\n\n2011-2012    Plan,      which    resulted       in    the   opening     of    a    racially\n\nidentifiable school and increased racial imbalance across the\n\nschool district, and which the Board’s own members described as\n\n“disappointing . . . for racial balance,” J.A. 618, violated the\n\nBoard’s     obligations         under   controlling         desegregation          orders,\n\nincluding a 2009 consent order that directed the Board to “work\n\ntoward attaining unitary status.”                J.A. 204.\n\n       The first time the district court considered Appellants’\n\nmotion, it improperly placed the burden of proof on Appellants.\n\nOn appeal, we vacated the district court’s denial of the motion,\n\nand    remanded    with    instructions         to     apply    the    Supreme      Court-\n\nmandated presumption that any racial disparities in 2011-2012\n\nPlan   resulted     from   the       School     Board’s     prior     unconstitutional\n\nconduct   in    operating        a   racially        segregated      school       district.\n\nEverett v. Pitt Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 678 F.3d 281, 288 (4th Cir.\n\n2012) (“Everett I”).            We further held that the School Board bore\n\nthe burden of proving that the plan “moves the school district\n\ntoward unitary status” in compliance with a 2009 Consent Order\n\n                                           38\n\fissued by the district court.             Id.        To be sure, at the time of\n\nthe appeal in 2013, the Board did not dispute that it had yet to\n\nobtain    unitary   status     and   thus      had    a   duty     to   eliminate      the\n\nvestiges    of   past    discrimination         and       demonstrate      good      faith\n\ncompliance with prior desegregation orders.\n\n     Our words, it would appear, have fallen upon deaf ears.\n\nThe district court expressly did not consider whether the Board\n\nhad met its burden with respect to the 2011-2012 Plan.                          Nor did\n\nthe court substantially take the plan into account when deciding\n\nwhether    the   Board   had   complied        in    good   faith       with   the    2009\n\nConsent    Order.       Instead,     it   ruled      that    the    school     district\n\nbecame unitary in 1986, and thus deemed the Board “released”\n\nfrom the burden that we and the district court’s own prior order\n\nsaid it had.     The district court concluded:\n\n     Even assuming, arguendo, that the School Board is\n     unable to meet its burden of proof as to the 2011-2012\n     plan, an order enjoining the continued implementation\n     of this plan would be pointless since the district\n     court has been declared unitary and no longer has an\n     affirmative duty to ensure that its policies move the\n     district towards unitary status.\n\nJ.A. 568-569 (emphasis added).\n\n     Yet how could the school district be declared unitary if it\n\nnever met “its burden of proof as to the 2011-2012 Plan”?                               As\n\nEverett I stated, in no uncertain terms, satisfying this burden\n\nwas a condition precedent to the declaration of unitary status.\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f      Our consideration of this case does not occur in a vacuum.\n\nThe rapid rate of de facto resegregation in our public school\n\nsystem in recent decades is well-documented.                As one scholar put\n\nit, “Schools are more segregated today than they have been for\n\ndecades,    and     segregation    is        rapidly     increasing.”        Erwin\n\nChemerinsky,      Separate   and   Unequal:      American       Public   Education\n\nToday, 52 Am.

Such racial isolation in public schools\n\nis worse today than at any time in the last thirty years.”).\n\n      Today the majority upholds the Board’s promulgation of a\n\nstudent assignment plan that, Appellants argue, furthers this\n\ntrend.     The majority reaches that result out of deference to a\n\ndistrict court decision that utterly fails to analyze the facts\n\nin this case in compliance with this Court’s instructions and\n\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.\n\n      Though it is pleasing to hear that the district court takes\n\ncomfort in the Supreme Court’s recent proclamation in Shelby\n\nCounty v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2625-26 (2013), that “our\n\n                                        40\n\fNation has made great strides” in ensuring the civil rights of\n\nminorities since the 1960s, see J.A. 569, these words are not a\n\npanacea for difficult cases involving race, particularly when\n\nthe “facts on the ground” “caution[] . . . against” resting on\n\nthe laurels of prior generations.

Second, and relatedly, the district court gave\n\nretroactive effect to its declaration of unitary status so as to\n\nretroactively         release      the    Board          of    its     obligations          under\n\ncontrolling desegregation orders in direct contravention of this\n\nCourt’s opinion in Everett I.

In     those   cases,   from     which   this      case   arises,     the\n\ndistrict court determined that Pitt County and Greenville City\n\nSchools were operating racially segregated dual school districts\n\nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n       As     the    majority   describes,         after   the     school    systems’\n\nproposed desegregation plans were finally approved, the Teel and\n\nEdwards cases remained dormant for over three decades until the\n\nGreenville Parents Association (“GPA”), a group of predominantly\n\nwhite parents, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                         42\n\fEducation Office for Civil Rights, objecting to the Board’s use\n\nof     race   in   its   student      assignment    plan    for     the    2006–2007\n\nacademic year.\n\n       The    GPA’s    challenge   to    that    plan    culminated       in    a   2009\n\nsettlement to which Appellants and the Board were parties.                           The\n\nsettlement     recognized      that    the    parties    “believe    that       unitary\n\nstatus for [Pitt County Schools] is a salutary goal, and all\n\nparties pledge to work together to achieve that goal.”                              J.A.\n\n195.     On November 4, 2009, the district court issued an order\n\napproving the settlement (“2009 Consent Order”).                    In addition to\n\nincorporating the terms of the parties’ settlement agreement,\n\nthe 2009 Consent Order further obligated the parties to “work\n\ntoward attaining unitary status so that the [district] court may\n\nrelinquish jurisdiction over this case and restore to the School\n\nBoard full responsibility for the operation of its schools.”\n\nJ.A. 204 (emphasis added).            The 2009 Consent Order also directed\n\nthe parties to submit, on or before December 31, 2012, “a report\n\ndetailing the School Board’s efforts and progress in achieving\n\nunitary       status     and    eliminating        the     vestiges        of       past\n\ndiscrimination to the extent practicable.”                J.A. 204.\n\n       To assist in its formulation of the 2011-2012 Plan, the\n\nBoard enlisted the Operations Research and Education Laboratory\n\nof North Carolina State University.              After considering the three\n\nscenarios outlined in the majority opinion, in November 2010 the\n\n                                         43\n\fBoard     settled         on     the     2011-2012          Plan.     Plaintiff’s          expert\n\ntestified      that       the    plan     adopted      by     the     Board    was     the    most\n\nsegregative option it considered.                            And even according to the\n\nBoard’s    expert’s          methodology,           three    schools—C.M.       Eppes,       South\n\nGreenville, and G.R. Whitfield—became racially imbalanced as a\n\nresult    of     the      2011-2012          Plan.      Also,       Lakeforest        Elementary\n\nopened    as     a   “racially         identifiable          school,”    with     nearly       80%\n\nblack enrollment.              J.A. 558.\n\n      Some      of     the      Board’s       own     members       appeared     to     question\n\nwhether      the     2011-2012         Plan    was     consistent       with     the       Board’s\n\nobligations          under       controlling          desegregation           orders.          For\n\ninstance, Board Member Tolmie, noting that the plan would open\n\nLakeforest         with      only      12%    white     enrollment        and     make       South\n\nGreenville Elementary 17% white, found the plan “disappointing .\n\n. . for racial balance.”                      J.A. 618.        He believed that “there\n\nmust be a better map for diversity.”                         J.A. 618.        Others believed\n\nthe   plan     would      compromise          opportunity       for    some     students       and\n\ninhibit the district’s efforts to achieve unitary status.\n\n      On April 19, 2011, Appellants filed a motion for injunctive\n\nand      other       appropriate             relief         seeking      to      enjoin        the\n\nimplementation of the 2011-2012 Plan, arguing that it violated\n\nthe   Board’s        obligation         to    move     the    district        toward       unitary\n\nstatus.        The district court construed Appellants’ motion as a\n\nrequest      for     a    preliminary          injunction.             Because       the     court\n\n                                                 44\n\fdetermined        that       Appellants     had     failed      to    demonstrate    a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits, it denied the motion.\n\n       Appellants appealed to the Fourth Circuit, and this panel\n\nvacated the decision and remanded, concluding that the district\n\ncourt       had     improperly       placed       the     evidentiary    burden     on\n\nAppellants.         Everett I, 678 F.3d at 289.            Specifically, we held:\n\n       Given that there is no dispute that the school\n       district   has  not    attained unitary status,  the\n       evidentiary burden should have been on the School\n       Board to prove that the 2011–12 Assignment Plan is\n       consistent with the controlling desegregation orders\n       and fulfills the School Board's affirmative duty to\n       eliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move\n       toward unitary status.\n\nId. at 290.         We further noted that “the 2009 Consent Order does\n\nnot settle the core dispute that arose in the 1960s and 1970s,\n\nnamely, the School Board’s unconstitutional operation of a dual\n\nschool      system     and    its    continuing         affirmative   obligation    to\n\neliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move toward unitary\n\nstatus.”      Id. at 290 n.8 (emphasis added).\n\n       On    July    6,   2012,     the   Board    filed    a   motion   for   unitary\n\nstatus, arguing that the school system was unitary as of 2000.\n\nOver     Appellants’         objection,    the     district      court   decided    to\n\nconsider the Board’s motion for unitary status together with\n\nAppellants’ remanded motion to enjoin the 2011-2012 Plan.\n\n       The district court conducted a five-day bench trial in July\n\n2013.       The Board’s expert, Dr. Armor, concluded that as of 1986,\n\n\n                                            45\n\fnearly     three    decades    ago,    Greenville     City    Schools       and   Pitt\n\nCounty Schools had each obtained unitary status and that any\n\nsubsequent         imbalance    was      not    a     vestige       of     de     jure\n\ndiscrimination, but rather was due to demographic changes.                          In\n\nreliance on Dr. Armor’s testimony, the district court concluded\n\nthat prior to the 1986 merger, both the Greenville City Schools\n\nand the Pitt County Board of Education successfully implemented\n\ntheir court-ordered plans, fully desegregated all schools within\n\nboth districts, and maintained a high level of integration until\n\nmerger.\n\n       The district court further concluded that post-merger, the\n\nBoard adopted policies to maintain racial balance and succeeded\n\nin   the   vast     majority   of     schools   and   found     that      significant\n\ndemographic shifts had occurred in the post-merger period.                          In\n\nthis analysis, the district court only briefly mentioned the\n\n2011–12 Plan.        Importantly, the district court acknowledged that\n\nit made no effort to determine whether the Board met its burden\n\nof demonstrating that “the 2011–12 Assignment Plan is consistent\n\nwith     the     controlling   desegregation        orders    and    fulfills      the\n\nSchool Board’s affirmative duty to eliminate the vestiges of\n\ndiscrimination and move toward unitary status.”                  Id. at 290 n.8.\n\nRather, the court assumed that it did not, without deciding the\n\nissue,     and    determined   that    Appellants’     motion       for    injunctive\n\nrelief was moot, stating:\n\n                                         46\n\f      Even assuming, arguendo, that the School Board is\n      unable to meet its burden of proof as to the 2011-2012\n      plan, an order enjoining the continued implementation\n      of this plan would be pointless since the school\n      district has been declared unitary and no longer has\n      an affirmative duty to ensure that its policies move\n      the district toward unitary status.\n\nJ.A. 568-569 (emphasis added). 2\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n                                           A.\n\n      For   a   court    to    release      a   school    district     from   prior\n\ndesegregation orders, a school district must “comply in good\n\nfaith with [school desegregation orders].”                     Everett I, 678 F.3d\n\n281   (citing   Bd.     of    Educ.   v.    Dowell,      498    U.S.   237,   248–50\n\n(1991)).    In determining whether a school board has shown a good\n\nfaith commitment to prior desegregation orders, courts look to\n\nwhether the school board’s policies “form a consistent pattern\n\nof lawful conduct directed to eliminating earlier violations.”\n\nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 491 (1992).\n\n      The Supreme Court has explained the rationale for requiring\n\na showing of good faith compliance:\n\n      2\n       Even the majority opinion concedes in footnote 7 that “by\ndetermining that Plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin the 2011-12\nstudent assignment plan was moot, the district court necessarily\nfound--even if it did not say so expressly--that the school\ndistrict was unitary at the time of the implementation of the\n2011-12 plan,” and that the district court had found that the\ntwo   then-separate  districts  were   unitary  as   to  student\nassignment. Ante at 14.\n\n\n\n                                           47\n\f       A history of good-faith compliance is evidence that\n       any current racial imbalance is not the product of a\n       new de jure violation, and enables the district court\n       to accept the school board’s representation that it\n       has accepted the principle of racial equality and will\n       not suffer intentional discrimination in the future.\n\nId. at 498-99.      The importance of the good faith requirement is\n\nparticularly salient in this case, where the parties entered\n\ninto a settlement in 2009, memorialized in the district court’s\n\n2009   Consent     Order,      which     required      the    Board     to     move    the\n\ndistrict towards unitary status.                As a result of the settlement,\n\nparents of school children forwent legal action in favor of a\n\ncooperative      agreement       premised       on   the    Board’s     commitment      to\n\nworking towards the laudable goal of a racially balanced school\n\nsystem.     Whether the board complied in good faith with that\n\ndirective would be undeniably probative of its commitment to\n\nmaintaining a racially balanced school system even after the\n\ndesegregation      orders        were    lifted       and    the      district        court\n\nrelinquished jurisdiction over the case.                     Such a determination\n\nis   important    not   only     to     instill      confidence    in    the    district\n\ncourt when it decides whether to release the district from its\n\npurview,    but    also     to    the     stakeholders        in   this      litigation\n\nconsisting primarily of parents of minor school children.\n\n       In concluding that the Board had complied in good faith\n\nwith prior desegregation orders, the district court found that\n\nthe pre-merged school systems had fully implemented the Teel and\n\n\n                                           48\n\fEdwards     orders      in   a     short       period        of    time        and    had        sought\n\nfaithfully       to     comply          with       those          orders        notwithstanding\n\nconsiderable      demographic               shifts      in        the     district          in     the\n\nintervening     years.        The       district        court      also        stated      that     the\n\nBoard’s reluctance to seek a declaration of unitary status was\n\nevidence that the Board was committed to continued integration\n\nof its schools.\n\n      Yet the district court failed to substantially account for\n\nthe   Board’s    actions         in    the    wake      of   the        2009    Consent          Order.\n\nAppellants      argue    that         the    Board’s     adoption          of    the       2011-2012\n\nPlan, which came on the heels of the 2009 Consent Order and\n\nresulted in more rather than fewer racially imbalanced schools\n\nin    the    district        constituted           a    violation          of        the     Board’s\n\nobligation to move towards unitary status under with the 2009\n\nOrder.       Indeed,     applying           Dr.    Armor’s         metrics       for       assessing\n\nracial      imbalance,       C.M.       Eppes,         South       Greenville,             and    G.R.\n\nWhitfield schools all became racially imbalanced as a result of\n\nthe 2011-2012 Plan.           Lakeforest Elementary opened as a racially\n\nidentifiable school with a black population of nearly 80%.                                           In\n\nthe view of Appellants’ expert, the plan adopted by the Board\n\nwas the most segregative option it considered.                                   Board members\n\nquestioned      whether      the       2011-2012        Plan       satisfied         the     Board’s\n\nobligations to eliminate racial imbalance in its schools.                                         Board\n\nMember Tolmie found the plan “disappointing . . . for racial\n\n                                                  49\n\fbalance”     and    believed    that   “there   must   be    a   better   map    for\n\ndiversity.”        J.A. 618.   Others echoed similar sentiments.\n\n      As has long been recognized, a court clearly errs when it\n\nfails to consider substantial evidence contrary to its ultimate\n\nfinding.      Miller v. Mercy Hosp., Inc., 720 F.2d 356, 361 (4th\n\nCir. 1983).         Given that the Board had alternatives available\n\nthat would result in higher levels of racial balance in the\n\ndistrict,     and     acted    with    full   awareness     of   the   regressive\n\nimpacts on the school district’s racial balance, the Board’s\n\ndecision to adopt that approach, at the very least, ought to\n\nhave received closer scrutiny from the district court.\n\n       Thus, the district court’s finding that the Board complied\n\nin good faith with prior desegregation orders should be vacated\n\nand the case remanded for further consideration.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      What    is    perhaps    even    more   troubling     about   the   district\n\ncourt’s decision is that by failing to consider the impacts of\n\nthe   2011-2012       Plan,     the    district    court      effectively       made\n\nretroactive its declaration of unitary status.\n\n      In Everett I, we stated:\n\n      Even if we assume that the district court will fully\n      consider the issue of unitary status in December 2012,\n      this does not absolve the School Board from the burden\n      of demonstrating to the district court, as Green v.\n      Cnty. Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430 (1968), and its progeny\n      require, that the 2011–2012 Assignment Plan moves the\n      school district toward unitary status, particularly\n\n                                         50\n\f       where   this  plan   allegedly  causes   immediate                         and\n       substantial adverse effects on students.\n\n678 F.3d at 288.              We further explained, “Any other conclusion\n\nwould necessarily, but impermissibly, provide the School Board\n\nwith latitude to discriminate pending the resolution of some\n\nfuture hearing.”          Id. at 288.               Cf. Capachione v. Charlotte-\n\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228, 285 (W.D.N.C.\n\n1999) (“[A] unitary status determination is not retroactive, and\n\ntherefore,      the    termination       of    court     supervision      today     cannot\n\nrelate back to an earlier time.”).                      By declaring the district\n\nunitary and its burden with respect to the 2011-2012 plan moot,\n\nthe district court has directly contravened our instructions.\n\nThat is precisely what the district court’s decision and the\n\nmajority’s      affirmance       of    that        decision    does     here.      Such    a\n\nholding    has    troubling           implications:       will     others        bound    by\n\ndesegregation orders take the majority’s holding as a signal\n\nthat de facto unitary status in the eyes of a school district\n\ngives the school district license to act as though it were not\n\nunder court order?\n\n       The majority justifies its ruling by pointing to School\n\nBoard of Richmond v. Baliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1312 (4th Cir.\n\n1987),    yet     the     procedural          posture     of     this     case     differs\n\nsignificantly from that of Baliles, particularly in light of the\n\n2009    Consent       Order    in     this    case.       Moreover,       the     majority\n\n\n                                              51\n\fopinion’s reading of Baliles directly conflicts with our holding\n\nin Everett I.          In Baliles, plaintiffs sought to force Virginia\n\nto fund programs designed to eliminate vestiges of segregation.\n\nThe district court ruled that, because the school district had\n\nalready achieved unitary status as a factual matter, the burden\n\nshifted to the plaintiffs to prove their case.                     639 F. Supp. at\n\n687 & n.3 (citing Riddick v. Sch. Bd., 784 F.2d 521, 534, 538\n\n(4th Cir. 1986)).\n\n      This Court ruled in Everett I that the burden of proof\n\nremained with the Board to prove “that the 2011–12 Assignment\n\nPlan is consistent with the controlling desegregation orders and\n\nfulfills the School Board's affirmative duty to eliminate the\n\nvestiges       of    discrimination     and    move    toward    unitary   status.”\n\nEverett, 678 F.3d at 29.               The Board was further obligated to\n\ndemonstrate good faith compliance with prior orders including\n\nthe     2009        Consent   Order     which     immediately        preceded     the\n\npromulgation of the 2011-2012 Plan.

The district court determined then\n\nthat the Greenville City and Pitt County Boards of Education\n\nwere operating racially segregated schools and directed them to\n\nsubmit      desegregation          plans    that      would     establish      a   nonracial,\n\nunitary school district.                   Following the school boards’ initial\n\ncompliance            with   the   orders,    the       cases     were    administratively\n\nclosed and lay dormant for over thirty-five years.\n\n       In 2008, a dispute arose between the Pitt County Board of\n\nEducation (the “Board”) 1 and the Greenville Parents Association\n\n(the        “Association”)            concerning            the       Board’s        explicit\n\nconsideration of race when devising student assignment plans.\n\nThe parties ultimately settled, and the district court entered a\n\nconsent order approving the settlement and directing the parties\n\nto work together toward attaining unitary status for the school\n\ndistrict.\n\n       Three years later, a group of parents and the Pitt County\n\nCoalition for Educating Black Children (“Plaintiffs”) moved to\n\nenjoin          the    implementation        of       the   Board’s      2011-12     student\n\n\n       1\n       By this date, the Greenville City and Pitt County schools\nhad been consolidated into a single school district.\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fassignment    plan,     arguing    that        it   failed      to    move     the   school\n\ndistrict    toward     unitary     status.            The   district         court   denied\n\nrelief, but we vacated that ruling, holding that the district\n\ncourt erred when it failed to place the burden on the Board to\n\nshow that the 2011-12 student assignment plan moved the school\n\ndistrict toward unitary status.                 On remand, the Board filed a\n\nmotion requesting that the district court declare the school\n\ndistrict unitary.          After a five-day bench trial, the district\n\ncourt     granted    the   Board’s      motion        and     dismissed       Plaintiffs’\n\nrequest for an injunction as moot.\n\n     We     conclude    that     the    district        court        acted    within     its\n\ndiscretion     in    choosing      to    address        the     Board’s       motion     for\n\ndeclaration     of     unitary    status       before       ruling      on    Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for injunctive relief.                  And because the court did not\n\nclearly err in determining that the school district is unitary,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n\n\n                                          I.\n\n                                          A.\n\n        In January 1965, a group of plaintiffs representing black\n\nstudents filed suit against the Pitt County Board of Education,\n\nalleging     that    the   board       unlawfully       operated        and    maintained\n\nracially    segregated      schools.           Teel    v.     Pitt    County     Board    of\n\nEducation, No. 6:65-CV-569 (E.D.N.C. filed Jan. 4, 1965).                                The\n\n                                           4\n\fdistrict court entered an injunction restraining the Board from\n\nrefusing admission, assignment, or transfer of any student on\n\nthe basis of race.          The Board attempted to comply with the court\n\norder     by     adopting    a   freedom-of-choice            plan,       which    allowed\n\nstudents to choose the school they wished to attend.                          The plan,\n\nhowever, resulted in only a small percentage of black students\n\nattending       predominantly     white        schools.         As    a    result,     the\n\ndistrict court rejected it, ruling that it failed to advance the\n\nBoard’s        constitutional    duty     to        establish    a    unitary      school\n\ndistrict.        It took several more years for the Board to devise a\n\ndesegregation plan that met with the district court’s approval.\n\n      A separate but substantially similar action came before the\n\ndistrict       court   in    November     1969.          Like    Teel,       Edwards    v.\n\nGreenville City Board of Education, No. 6:69-CV-702 (E.D.N.C.\n\nfiled Nov. 12 1969), involved representatives of black students\n\nasking the district court to enjoin the Greenville City school\n\nboard’s    continued        operation   of      a    racially    segregated        school\n\nsystem.        Again, the district court granted the injunction.                       The\n\ncourt rejected the board’s first proposed desegregation plan and\n\nordered it to submit a plan that achieved racial integration in\n\nnot     only     student     assignment,       but     also     faculty      and     staff\n\nassignment,        extracurricular      activities,           and     transportation.\n\nShortly thereafter, the board submitted an amended plan that met\n\nwith both the plaintiffs’ and the court’s approval.\n\n                                           5\n\f     The district court continued to monitor the progress of the\n\ndesegregation plans until January 1972, when it issued orders\n\ndetermining that the cases had been decided on the merits and\n\nremoved them from the pending docket, subject to being reopened\n\nas circumstances warranted.          The cases remained administratively\n\nclosed for thirty-five years.           In the meantime, the two school\n\ndistricts merged in 1986 and their separate boards of education\n\nwere replaced by a single, consolidated Board.\n\n     The consolidated Board sought to reopen Teel and Edwards in\n\n2008.      The   impetus    was   the   Board’s   adoption,    three    years\n\nearlier,   of    a   new   student   assignment   plan   for   the     2006-07\n\nacademic year. 2     Under the then-existing attendance area policy,\n\nthe assignment plan considered students’ race, with the goal of\n\nachieving a 70/30 3 racial balance in each school.              To achieve\n\nthis balance, the new plan relied on satellite attendance areas 4\n\nand busing.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n        Only schools within the Greenville city                limits     were\nsubject to the 2006-07 student assignment plan.\n     3\n       By 70/30 racial balance, the Board intended no school to\nhave more than a seventy percent white or black population and\nno less than a thirty percent black or white population.\n     4\n        Satellite attendance areas are created by attaching\n“relatively homogenous neighborhoods of mostly one race” to\n“non-contiguous school zones some distance away that need[] that\nrace for racial balance.” J.A. 802.\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f       Objecting       to    the      explicit         use     of     race     in    student\n\nassignment,      the     Association      filed        a     discrimination         complaint\n\nwith the United States Department of Education Office for Civil\n\nRights (the “OCR”).           While the complaint was pending, the Board\n\nrevised its attendance area policy, adding student achievement\n\nand socioeconomic status as factors that, along with race, the\n\nBoard would consider when establishing student attendance areas.\n\n       Ultimately, the Board and the OCR settled the complaint.\n\nThe settlement required the school district to seek a ruling\n\nfrom the district court as to whether the desegregation orders\n\nin Teel and Edwards authorized the Board to consider race in its\n\nstudent assignment plan.              In accordance with the settlement, the\n\nBoard asked the district court to approve its 2006-07 student\n\nassignment plan as well as its revised attendance area policy.\n\n       In response, the district court reopened and consolidated\n\nTeel   and     Edwards      and     re-captioned       the     new    action    under      its\n\ncurrent name.       In addition, the court allowed the Association to\n\nintervene.        The Association then asked the district court to\n\nreject both the 2006-07 student assignment plan and the revised\n\nattendance area policy, and instead declare the school district\n\nunitary.       Plaintiffs joined the Board in opposing the motion.\n\n       After     court-ordered         mediation,          the      parties     reached      a\n\nsettlement.        The      Board    agreed       to   involve       Plaintiffs      and   the\n\nAssociation in developing the next student assignment plan.                                 In\n\n                                              7\n\fexchange, the Association withdrew its motion for a declaration\n\nof   unitary     status,      and   consented     to   the   Board’s    motion     for\n\napproval of the 2006-07 student assignment plan and the revised\n\nattendance area policy.              The parties also “pledge[d] to work\n\ntogether to achieve” unitary status for the school district.\n\nJ.A. 195.\n\n        The district court approved the settlement and entered a\n\nconsent order in November 2009.               The court’s order directed “the\n\nparties    to    work    toward     attaining    unitary     status    so   that   the\n\ncourt may relinquish jurisdiction over this case and restore to\n\nthe School Board full responsibility for the operation of its\n\nschools.”       J.A. 204.\n\n                                         B.\n\n        In 2010, the Board began developing a student assignment\n\nplan for the 2011-12 school year to accommodate the opening of a\n\nnew elementary school and the closing of an existing one.                          The\n\nBoard     worked       with   the     Operations       Research   and       Education\n\nLaboratory of North Carolina State University (“OREd”) 5 to draw\n\nup proposed attendance area maps.                 In designing the maps, the\n\nBoard     and   OREd    considered:     (1)     students’    proximity      to   their\n\n      5\n       OREd “is a non-profit organization that provides school\ndistricts with scientific tools to project future enrollment, to\nevaluate utilization of existing school facilities, to locate\nplacement of new schools, and to develop attendance boundaries.”\nJ.A. 492.\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fassigned       schools;       (2)       building         capacity;       (3)     academic\n\nproficiency; and (4) impact area 6.                Notably, academic proficiency\n\nwas     the    sole    diversity       input      factor       the   Board     used   when\n\ndesigning      the    maps,     even    though     the    Board’s       attendance    area\n\npolicy permitted it to consider student race.\n\n      The Board invited the Association and Plaintiffs to attend\n\ntwo   workshop        retreats    to    solicit     their       input    regarding    the\n\nproposed maps.          During the first retreat, the Board presented\n\ntwo proposals.          The first proposed map considered only student\n\nproximity       and     school         capacity     in      developing         attendance\n\nboundaries (“Scenario 1”).               This map resulted in an increase in\n\nracially identifiable schools, with six impacted schools falling\n\nshort     of   the    Board’s    target    student       proficiency       index.     The\n\nsecond proposed map factored in student proficiency along with\n\nproximity and school capacity (“Scenario 2”).                           It resulted in\n\nincreased student diversity, and a greater balance of student\n\nproficiency levels across the impacted schools.                              Scenario 2,\n\nunlike     Scenario     1,    required     the     use    of    satellite      attendance\n\nareas and busing.\n\n      After receiving input from the parties, the Board directed\n\nOREd to generate a new map.                This map (“Scenario 3”) aimed to\n\n\n      6\n       Impact area refers to the location and number of school\nattendance areas affected by the reassignment plan.\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\flimit satellite attendance areas, but still considered student\n\nproficiency in an attempt to increase diversity.                    The proposed\n\nmap was then further modified based on community input.                        The\n\nfinal Scenario 3 map resulted in schools that were more racially\n\ndiverse than in Scenario 1, but less diverse than Scenario 2.\n\nIt also required fewer satellite attendance areas than Scenario\n\n2.   Over Plaintiffs’ objections, the Board adopted the Scenario\n\n3 map as its 2011-12 student assignment plan.\n\n        Plaintiffs moved to enjoin the implementation of the 2011-\n\n12 plan, arguing that it created racially identifiable schools\n\nand failed to move the district toward unitary status.                        The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion, ruling that Plaintiffs “ha[d]\n\nnot demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n\nclaim        so    as    to    justify   the    extraordinary       relief    they\n\nrequest[ed].”           Everett v.

After a five-day\n\nbench trial, the district court ruled for the Board.                      It found\n\nthat,    even     before   the   1986     merger,     both       Pitt   County    and\n\nGreenville City schools were unitary with respect to student\n\nassignment.

A purported judicial admission is\n\nbinding      only     if    the     statement     is    “deliberate,       clear,   and\n\nunambiguous.”        Id.\n\n      Included among the statements that Plaintiffs rely on as\n\nexamples of judicial admissions are the Board’s statements in\n\nits motion for approval of the 2006-07 student assignment plan\n\nand revised attendance area policy that the school district “was\n\n\n\ndetermining that Plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin the 2011-12\nstudent assignment plan was moot, the district court necessarily\nfound--even if it did not say so expressly--that the school\ndistrict was unitary at the time of the implementation of the\n2011-12 plan.    As we explain, however, we do not think this\nproblematic.\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fpermitted to consider racial balance in student assignment under\n\nEdwards and Teel,” and could “adopt a racial balance ratio and\n\notherwise . . . consider         race    as     a     factor”      in    its    student\n\nassignment plans.      J.A. 90, 93, 95.               Plaintiffs also cite the\n\nBoard’s motion in support of the 2009 consent order in which the\n\nBoard acknowledged that “the Proposed Consent Order would not\n\ndispose of the unitary status issue once and for all.”                                J.A.\n\n178.\n\n       These statements, however, merely acknowledged the judicial\n\nreality on the ground, i.e. that the school district remained\n\nsubject to the district court’s desegregation orders until the\n\ncourt declared the schools unitary.                    They fall far short of\n\ndeliberate,   clear,   and       unambiguous        admissions     that     the   Board\n\ncontinued to operate a dual school district.\n\n       In any event, Plaintiffs’ contention suffers from a more\n\nfundamental   flaw.      Simply     put,      whether      a    school   district      is\n\nunitary is not something that can be judicially admitted (or\n\ndenied); rather, it is entirely the province of the district\n\ncourt to decide the issue.          This conclusion is compelled by our\n\ndecision in Belk.\n\n       There, the school board insisted to the district court that\n\nit “had not pursued the dismantlement of the dual system with\n\nthe    requisite   zeal.”        Belk,    269       F.3d   at    333.       The   court\n\nnonetheless   declined      to   defer    to    the    board’s      claim      that    its\n\n                                         16\n\fschool district was not unitary.                  Indeed, it highlighted several\n\nreasons why the board might have wanted to remain subject to the\n\ndesegregation      orders,       including        avoiding    the      “long,    drawn-out\n\nprocess” and expense involved with a unitary status hearing,\n\nfears that it might lose eligibility for certain federal funding\n\nshould it be declared unitary, and a desire to continue racially\n\nbalancing its schools.            Id.    We approved of the district court’s\n\nfinding     on    this     issue,       concluding       that      a    school     board’s\n\nrepresentation      that    it    is     not   unitary       may    reflect     the    self-\n\ninterested desire of a board to use a desegregation order as a\n\n“mechanism[] for the attainment of different goals.”                                  Id. at\n\n334.\n\n       Consequently, even if the Board in this case had admitted\n\nthat   it   continued       to    operate         a   dual   school      district,       the\n\ndistrict    court   was     under       no   obligation      to    treat     the   Board’s\n\nstatements as conclusive in deciding whether the school district\n\nwas unitary.\n\n                                             C.\n\n       Plaintiffs next contend that the district court violated\n\nthe “law of the case” by considering the unitary status question\n\nbefore    first   deciding       whether       the    2011-12      student      assignment\n\nplan moved the school district toward that status.

Because we find the first\n\nexception applicable here, we reject Plaintiffs’ contention.\n\n      According to Plaintiffs, we established the law of the case\n\nduring the first appeal when we directed the district court to\n\nplace the evidentiary burden on the Board “to prove that the\n\n2011-12    Assignment     Plan   is    consistent      with   the    controlling\n\ndesegregation orders and fulfills the School Board’s affirmative\n\nduty to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move toward\n\nunitary status.”      Everett, 678 F.3d at 290.          Plaintiffs say that\n\nthe   district   court’s     finding     that    the    school      district   was\n\nalready unitary at the time of the implementation of the 2011-12\n\nstudent assignment plan effectively ignores our prior holding.\n\n      When we first considered this case, however, the only issue\n\ndecided by the district court was whether the 2011-12 student\n\nassignment plan was consistent with the Board’s obligation to\n\n                                       18\n\fwork   toward   attaining   unitary    status.       On   remand,    the    Board\n\nmoved for just such a declaration.            In response, the district\n\ncourt held a trial during which the parties, for the first time,\n\npresented evidence on that issue.          Once the district court took\n\nevidence on the question, it was no longer bound by the law of\n\nthe case, but was instead free to determine whether the school\n\ndistrict was unitary.        Accordingly, we find no error in the\n\nmanner in which the district court elected to address the issues\n\nbefore it.\n\n                                      D.\n\n       We turn now to the heart of Plaintiffs’ challenge to the\n\nprocess by which the district court resolved this case.                       In\n\nessence, Plaintiffs contend that the Board first had to prove\n\nthat   the   2011-12    student    assignment    plan     moved     the    school\n\ndistrict toward unitary status before the district court could\n\ndeclare the schools unitary.          Plaintiffs say that by flipping\n\nthe issues--that is, by first declaring the schools unitary and\n\nthen   refusing,   on   mootness   grounds,     to   assess   the    merits    of\n\n2011-12 student assignment plan--the district court improperly\n\ngave the unitary status determination retroactive effect.                  We do\n\nnot agree.\n\n                                      1.\n\n       Plaintiffs contend that a declaration of unitary status is\n\neffective only as of the date it is issued.                Therefore, until\n\n                                      19\n\fSeptember       25,    2013    (the       date    of    the    district          court’s    order\n\ndeclaring the school district unitary), any Board action had to\n\nbe     consistent      with        its    obligations         under    the       desegregation\n\norders,    and    the       later    2009      consent      order.         By     deciding       the\n\nunitary     status         issue     before      evaluating         the     2011-12      student\n\nassignment plan, Plaintiffs say that the district court made an\n\nunlawful retroactive declaration of unitary status.\n\n       It is of course true that, until declared unitary, a school\n\ndistrict retains a continuing duty to work toward eliminating\n\nthe vestiges of its past discrimination.

That presumption, however, ends when the\n\nschool has achieved unitary status, at which point the burden of\n\nproof shifts back to the plaintiffs “to prove discriminatory\n\nintent on the part of the school board of a unitary school\n\n[district].”     Riddick, 782 F.2d at 537.\n\n      Importantly,      the    burden    of   proof    shifts,      not     when   the\n\nschool district is declared unitary, but when the district court\n\ndetermines it first achieved that status.                 This proposition is\n\nexemplified     by   our     decision    in   School   Board     of   Richmond     v.\n\nBaliles.    In that case, after a court-ordered freedom-of-choice\n\nplan proved unsuccessful, the district court ordered the School\n\nBoard of the City of Richmond to implement a desegregation plan\n\nthat “required extensive busing of students, proximal geographic\n\nzoning, pairing, clustering, satellites and racial balance among\n\nfaculty.”      Bradley v.

Va.\n\n1986).\n\n      Twelve    years    later,    the    board   came   before       the   district\n\ncourt asking to be realigned as plaintiffs and to have certain\n\nstate officials, including the Governor of Virginia, joined as\n\ndefendants.      It argued that Virginia had “engaged in various\n\nactivities which contributed to the segregation that existed in”\n\nRichmond Public Schools.           Id.     Consequently, the board “sought\n\nto compel the state to fund remedial and compensatory programs\n\n                                         21\n\fto eliminate the lingering effects of the state’s former dual\n\nsystem.”      Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1310.\n\n       The district court found that Richmond Public Schools had\n\nachieved       unitary    status     sometime    between        1972     and       1986.\n\nBradley, 639 F. Supp. at 687.               Because the school district had\n\nbecome unitary, the court concluded that the burden had shifted\n\nto the board to prove that any vestiges of past state-mandated\n\nsegregation remained in Richmond Public Schools.                       Id. at 689.\n\nThe court then proceeded to address and deny the board’s request\n\nfor relief.\n\n       On appeal, we affirmed the district court’s shifting of the\n\nburden.       Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1312.         Thus, Baliles demonstrates\n\nthat    a     district    court     may     assess     unitary     status      before\n\naddressing the request for relief that brought the plaintiff\n\nbefore the court in the first place.                 This is true, even though\n\nthe declaration may weaken (or even eliminate) the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim for relief.\n\n       The only authority that Plaintiffs cite in support of their\n\nclaim that a unitary status determination cannot relate back is\n\nCapacchione      v.

See id.\n\n       The parties called competing expert witnesses to testify as\n\nto the Board’s efforts to eliminate racial disparity in student\n\nassignment.         The    Board’s        witness,    Dr.    David    Armor,     reviewed\n\n                                             27\n\fstudent enrollment data for the Pitt County schools (and the\n\nGreenville City schools, pre-merger) from 1968 to 2011. 8                               To\n\ndetermine    whether     the     schools          were    racially    balanced       post-\n\nmerger, Dr. Armor applied a plus-or-minus 20% variance comparing\n\nthe percentage of black students at a particular school to the\n\npercentage of black students enrolled at that grade level (i.e.,\n\nK-5, 6-8, 9-12).        Pre-merger, Dr. Armor compared the percentage\n\nof   black   students     at        a     particular      school     to     the    overall\n\npercentage of black students enrolled in the school district.\n\n     Dr. Armor found that, pre-merger, the school boards were\n\nsuccessfully     able   to     desegregate          their    schools       and    maintain\n\nracial balance.     He thus concluded that the school district was\n\nunitary   with   respect       to       student    assignment,       even    before    the\n\nmerger.      Following     the          merger,    Pitt    County    saw     substantial\n\npopulation growth with attendant demographic changes.                             Even so,\n\nDr. Armor found that twenty-six of the thirty-seven schools in\n\nthe district were racially balanced for twenty or more years,\n\nand were also balanced as of the 2011-12 school year.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       For the years 1968 to 1984, Dr. Armor only had access to\nstudent enrollment data for even-numbered years.     We do not\nbelieve that Dr. Armor’s lack of data for odd-numbered years\nsubstantially undermines the credibility of his testimony and\nreport.   We also note that Plaintiffs’ expert relied on this\nsame data for her analysis.\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       On the other hand, Plaintiffs’ student assignment expert,\n\nDr.    Genevieve       Siegel-Hawley,    applied    a   plus-or-minus       15%\n\nvariance in comparing the share of black or white students at a\n\nparticular school to the district-wide share of black or white\n\nstudents. 9      She found that, since 1987, an average of eight\n\nschools were racially imbalanced each year.               By 2011, fourteen\n\nschools were racially imbalanced.            Since 2001, three new schools\n\nwere built that opened with a racial imbalance.\n\n       Overall, Dr. Siegel-Hawley concluded that “[d]ownturns in\n\nlevels of racial imbalance were quickly followed by increases,\n\nindicating      that    [the   school   district]   did    not   sustain    an\n\neffective desegregation program for more than a year.”                     J.A.\n\n656.       Indeed, she testified that the 2011-12 student assignment\n\nplan resulted in a post-merger high of 40% of students attending\n\na racially imbalanced school.            Thus, according to Dr. Siegel-\n\nHawley, the Board had failed to eliminate the vestiges of past\n\ndiscrimination in regard to student assignment.\n\n       The district court adopted Dr. Armor’s metrics and relied\n\nprimarily on his analysis in finding the school district unitary\n\nwith respect to student assignment.             First, it found that Dr.\n\n       9\n       Before the merger, Dr. Siegel-Hawley compared the white\npopulation of an individual school to the white population of\nthe entire school district.      Post-merger, Dr. Siegel-Hawley\ncompared the black population of an individual school to that of\nthe entire school district.\n\n\n\n                                        29\n\fArmor’s      use    of     a    plus-or-minus        20%    variance       was      reasonable.\n\nWhile we have previously specifically approved the plus-or-minus\n\n15% variance that Dr. Siegel-Hawley applied, we have also noted\n\napprovingly         that       higher      variances       have    been     used         by   other\n\ncourts.

The\n\ncourt agreed         with       Dr.   Armor     “that      the    racial    composition          of\n\nstudents      attending          elementary          schools      within       a     particular\n\ndistrict may be far different from the racial composition of\n\nthat district’s high schools.”                       Everett v.

And we agree with the district court\n\nthat, to the extent that racial imbalance remains an issue in\n\nthe school district, there is substantial evidence indicating\n\nthat it was caused by white students either leaving the public\n\nschool    system,        or    moving           to       more     racially       segregated\n\nneighborhoods.\n\n      The Supreme Court has been clear that school districts need\n\nnot   take    affirmative          measures        to    correct    racial       imbalances\n\ncaused   by    demographic          changes        once    they    have    remedied       the\n\neffects of prior de jure segregation.                       Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494\n\n(“Once the racial imbalance due to the de jure violation has\n\nbeen remedied, the school district is under no duty to remedy\n\nimbalance that is caused by demographic factors.”); Swann, 402\n\nU.S. at 31-32.      Moreover, “[t]he continued existence of a small\n\nnumber of one race schools within . . . a school district does\n\nnot   establish    in    and       of    itself      a    constitutional        violation.”\n\nRiddick, 784 F.2d at 535.\n\n      Here, the most striking instance of “white flight” came in\n\nresponse to the Board’s aggressive 2006-07 student assignment\n\nplan, which “used satellite school [attendance areas] and racial\n\nbalancing ratios in an effort to reduce the racial isolation of\n\nelementary     schools        in        the   former       Greenville          City     school\n\ndistrict.”        J.A.    201.            The      implementation         of     that    plan\n\nultimately     resulted       in     a    significant           decline   in     the    white\n\n                                              31\n\fstudent population, much of which left the impacted schools for\n\nprivate schools, home schooling, or other schools in the County.\n\n     While the Board was under no duty to implement intensive\n\ndesegregation efforts given that many of the remaining racially\n\nidentifiable schools were a consequence of demographic shifts\n\nwithin Greenville, its failed efforts at bringing greater racial\n\nbalance to Greenville City schools illustrate that any remaining\n\nsegregation in the school district is a consequence of outside\n\nforces that cannot properly be attributed to the Board’s prior\n\ndiscriminatory acts.        We therefore find no clear error in the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that the school district is unitary\n\nwith respect to student assignment.\n\n                                        2.\n\n     Next, we consider two Green factors together, faculty and\n\nstaff assignment.       Here, all of the Board’s data comes from 2004\n\nand later.      Dr. Armor employed a variance of plus-or-minus 10%\n\nto   compare    the     number   of    black   faculty   and   staff    at   an\n\nindividual     school    with    the   districtwide   percentage   of    black\n\nfaculty and staff. 10       He found that, since 2004, thirty-one out\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       Plaintiffs argue that there was no basis for Dr. Armor’s\nuse of the plus-or-minus 10% variance.       We have, however,\npreviously approved the use of an even greater variance--plus-\nor-minus 15%--with respect to faculty assignment.     Belk, 269\nF.3d at 326.\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fof thirty-six schools maintained racial balance in faculty and\n\nstaff, or were only slightly imbalanced for one or two years.\n\n       Furthermore, Dr. Armor testified that nearly all of the\n\nschools during that time had a racially mixed administrative\n\nstaff.         In     addition,      the     former       district      superintendent\n\ntestified that she specifically considered the diversity that a\n\ncandidate for a vacant principal or assistant principal position\n\ncould offer to the school.                 The Board also introduced evidence\n\nshowing the efforts the district has made to recruit minority\n\nteachers.      In short, the district court had sufficient evidence\n\nbefore it to conclude that the Board undertook diligent efforts\n\nthat   ultimately         resulted    in    a    racially      diverse    faculty     and\n\nadministrative staff at its schools.\n\n                                            3.\n\n       The     next       Green    factor       we     consider    is    the     Board’s\n\nmaintenance         and     provision      of      adequate     school     facilities.\n\nPlaintiffs do not say that the school district is not unitary\n\nwith respect to quality of facilities.                    Rather, they claim that\n\nthe    Board    failed      to     prove    that      siting   decisions       are   made\n\nconsistently        with     the    Board’s      obligation       to    eliminate     the\n\nvestiges of past discrimination.                     The district court disagreed,\n\nand we believe that it did not clearly err.\n\n       The Board uses a Long Range Facility Plan to “strategically\n\nlocate schools where residential growth is anticipated.”                             J.A.\n\n                                            33\n\f1029.      It determines when improvements or new construction are\n\nnecessary based on the overall needs of the individual school\n\nand the school district in general.                       Since 1990, the district\n\nhas worked with OREd to determine where to locate new schools.\n\nOREd uses a computer model that determines the “optimal location\n\nfor    a   new     site    that     will    relieve      the    current    crowding   and\n\nprovide room for anticipated growth.”                      J.A. 2402.       The Board’s\n\nevidence         adequately       demonstrates     that    new    schools     are   sited\n\naccording to the needs of the district overall, and that the\n\nBoard works with OREd in a race-neutral manner to make siting\n\ndecisions.\n\n                                             4.\n\n       We also discern no error in the district court’s finding\n\nthat       the     school     district        is    unitary        with     respect    to\n\ntransportation.           The school district provides bus service to all\n\neligible     students.            Students    qualify     for    bus   transportation,\n\nregardless         of     race,     based    on    the    distance        between   their\n\nresidences and their assigned schools.                         Moreover, travel times\n\nare actually longer for white and Hispanic students than for\n\nblack students.             Thus, we find no basis for questioning the\n\ndistrict court’s view that students receive transportation to\n\nschool on a racially nondiscriminatory basis.\n\n                                             5.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f      Finally,        the    district         court    did     not     clearly         err    in\n\nconcluding that the school district is unitary with respect to\n\nextracurricular activities.                   The Board’s evidence showed that\n\nsuch activities are available in all schools, and there are no\n\nrace-based        barriers       to     participation.              Moreover,          students\n\nthroughout      the      district       are     adequately          informed      about      the\n\navailability       of    extracurricular           activities.             Nor    are     there\n\nfinancial    barriers        to   participation.               We    think       the    Board’s\n\nevidence was sufficient for the district court to conclude that\n\nthe   district      is      unitary      with      respect     to     this       final    Green\n\nfactor. 11\n\n                                              C.\n\n      Our    analysis       of    the    Board’s       efforts        to    eliminate        the\n\nvestiges     of    past      discrimination           to   the       extent       practicable\n\nsatisfies us that the district court did not clearly err in also\n\nfinding that the Board has complied in good faith with the Teel\n\nand   Edwards      desegregation          orders.          A     school       district       can\n\ndemonstrate its good faith compliance by showing its “commitment\n\nto a constitutional course of action [in which] its policies\n\n      11\n       Despite Plaintiffs’ urging, the district court refused to\nconsider disparity in student discipline as an ancillary factor\nin addition to the Green factors.        We find no abuse of\ndiscretion in this decision because there was not sufficient\nevidence in the record demonstrating that the school district\ntargets black students for discipline or otherwise treats them\ndifferently in disciplinary matters. See Belk, 269 F.3d at 332.\n\n\n\n                                              35\n\fform    a      consistent       pattern         of     lawful        conduct       directed     to\n\neliminating earlier violations.”                      Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491.                 We\n\nagree with the district court that the Board has demonstrated\n\ncommendable       good     faith      in    complying          with       the   desegregation\n\norders.\n\n       Indeed, we need look no further for proof than the fact\n\nthat the desegregation orders remained administratively closed\n\nfor     over     thirty-five       years,            during     which       time     the     Board\n\nundertook        the     task    of     integrating            the     schools       relatively\n\nundisturbed.           Until    2008,      no    party        came    before    the    district\n\ncourt    accusing        the    Board      of    neglecting          or    disregarding        its\n\nobligations under the desegregation orders.                               And when this case\n\nwas reopened, it was as a consequence of a dispute regarding the\n\n2006-07        student    assignment            plan     in     which       certain        parents\n\nessentially argued that the Board went too far in its efforts to\n\ndesegregate the schools.                Moreover, in the proceedings leading\n\nup to the district court’s 2009 consent order, Plaintiffs and\n\nthe Board were both aligned in opposition to the Association’s\n\nmotion for declaration of unitary status.\n\n       From the date the district court entered its desegregation\n\norders,        school      administrators              took      immediate           steps      to\n\neffectively integrate their schools and move them toward unitary\n\nstatus.        In very short order, both school districts had almost\n\ncompletely       eliminated       racially           identifiable          schools.          While\n\n                                                36\n\fracial    imbalance      returned       over    the     succeeding      years,      the\n\nrespective      boards   consistently         took    measures    to    bring      their\n\nschools back into balance.\n\n       Post-merger,      the     consolidated          Board     used        satellite\n\nattendance areas and busing to maintain racial balance.                             When\n\ndemographic factors caused an increase in racially identifiable\n\nschools, the Board took reasonable steps to restore balance.\n\nUltimately, a substantial number of schools were able to achieve\n\nracial balance, and maintain it as of the 2011-12 school year.\n\nIn short, we are convinced that the Board has acted in good\n\nfaith since the entry of the desegregation orders in 1970.                           We\n\ntherefore conclude that the district court did not clearly err\n\nin finding that the Board satisfied this prong of the unitary\n\nstatus inquiry.\n\n\n\n                                         IV.\n\n       In sum, the district court did not err by first determining\n\nthat   the    Pitt    County    school    district       is    unitary,      and    then\n\ndenying      Plaintiffs’    motion       to    enjoin     the    2011-12      student\n\nassignment plan as moot.         And because the district court did not\n\nclearly   err    in   finding    that    the    school    district      is    in    fact\n\nunitary, the judgment of the district court is\n\n                                                                             AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\fWYNN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       In 2010 parents of minor children attending schools in Pitt\n\nCounty    and     the    Pitt     County      Coalition        for    Educating      Black\n\nChildren (“Appellants”) sought to enjoin implementation of the\n\nPitt   County     Board    of    Education’s         (“Board”)       2011-2012      student\n\nassignment plan (“2011-2012 Plan”).

We further held that the School Board bore\n\nthe burden of proving that the plan “moves the school district\n\ntoward unitary status” in compliance with a 2009 Consent Order\n\n                                           38\n\fissued by the district court.             Id.        To be sure, at the time of\n\nthe appeal in 2013, the Board did not dispute that it had yet to\n\nobtain    unitary   status     and   thus      had    a   duty     to   eliminate      the\n\nvestiges    of   past    discrimination         and       demonstrate      good      faith\n\ncompliance with prior desegregation orders.\n\n     Our words, it would appear, have fallen upon deaf ears.\n\nThe district court expressly did not consider whether the Board\n\nhad met its burden with respect to the 2011-2012 Plan.                          Nor did\n\nthe court substantially take the plan into account when deciding\n\nwhether    the   Board   had   complied        in    good   faith       with   the    2009\n\nConsent    Order.       Instead,     it   ruled      that    the    school     district\n\nbecame unitary in 1986, and thus deemed the Board “released”\n\nfrom the burden that we and the district court’s own prior order\n\nsaid it had.     The district court concluded:\n\n     Even assuming, arguendo, that the School Board is\n     unable to meet its burden of proof as to the 2011-2012\n     plan, an order enjoining the continued implementation\n     of this plan would be pointless since the district\n     court has been declared unitary and no longer has an\n     affirmative duty to ensure that its policies move the\n     district towards unitary status.\n\nJ.A. 568-569 (emphasis added).\n\n     Yet how could the school district be declared unitary if it\n\nnever met “its burden of proof as to the 2011-2012 Plan”?                               As\n\nEverett I stated, in no uncertain terms, satisfying this burden\n\nwas a condition precedent to the declaration of unitary status.\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f      Our consideration of this case does not occur in a vacuum.\n\nThe rapid rate of de facto resegregation in our public school\n\nsystem in recent decades is well-documented.                As one scholar put\n\nit, “Schools are more segregated today than they have been for\n\ndecades,    and     segregation    is        rapidly     increasing.”        Erwin\n\nChemerinsky,      Separate   and   Unequal:      American       Public   Education\n\nToday, 52 Am.

Two separate lawsuits filed in the\n\n1960s    in    the    Eastern   District      of   North   Carolina     seeking     the\n\ndesegregation of Pitt County and Greenville City Schools, which\n\nat the time were operated as two separate school systems.                           See\n\nTeel    v.    Pitt     County   Board    of    Education,        Civ.   A.   No.    569\n\n(E.D.N.C. filed August 10, 1970); Edwards v. Greenville City\n\nBoard of Education, Civ. A. No. 702 (E.D.N.C. filed July 7,\n\n1970).        In     those   cases,   from     which   this      case   arises,     the\n\ndistrict court determined that Pitt County and Greenville City\n\nSchools were operating racially segregated dual school districts\n\nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n       As     the    majority   describes,         after   the     school    systems’\n\nproposed desegregation plans were finally approved, the Teel and\n\nEdwards cases remained dormant for over three decades until the\n\nGreenville Parents Association (“GPA”), a group of predominantly\n\nwhite parents, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                         42\n\fEducation Office for Civil Rights, objecting to the Board’s use\n\nof     race   in   its   student      assignment    plan    for     the    2006–2007\n\nacademic year.\n\n       The    GPA’s    challenge   to    that    plan    culminated       in    a   2009\n\nsettlement to which Appellants and the Board were parties.                           The\n\nsettlement     recognized      that    the    parties    “believe    that       unitary\n\nstatus for [Pitt County Schools] is a salutary goal, and all\n\nparties pledge to work together to achieve that goal.”                              J.A.\n\n195.     On November 4, 2009, the district court issued an order\n\napproving the settlement (“2009 Consent Order”).                    In addition to\n\nincorporating the terms of the parties’ settlement agreement,\n\nthe 2009 Consent Order further obligated the parties to “work\n\ntoward attaining unitary status so that the [district] court may\n\nrelinquish jurisdiction over this case and restore to the School\n\nBoard full responsibility for the operation of its schools.”\n\nJ.A. 204 (emphasis added).            The 2009 Consent Order also directed\n\nthe parties to submit, on or before December 31, 2012, “a report\n\ndetailing the School Board’s efforts and progress in achieving\n\nunitary       status     and    eliminating        the     vestiges        of       past\n\ndiscrimination to the extent practicable.”                J.A. 204.\n\n       To assist in its formulation of the 2011-2012 Plan, the\n\nBoard enlisted the Operations Research and Education Laboratory\n\nof North Carolina State University.              After considering the three\n\nscenarios outlined in the majority opinion, in November 2010 the\n\n                                         43\n\fBoard     settled         on     the     2011-2012          Plan.     Plaintiff’s          expert\n\ntestified      that       the    plan     adopted      by     the     Board    was     the    most\n\nsegregative option it considered.                            And even according to the\n\nBoard’s    expert’s          methodology,           three    schools—C.M.       Eppes,       South\n\nGreenville, and G.R. Whitfield—became racially imbalanced as a\n\nresult    of     the      2011-2012          Plan.      Also,       Lakeforest        Elementary\n\nopened    as     a   “racially         identifiable          school,”    with     nearly       80%\n\nblack enrollment.              J.A. 558.\n\n      Some      of     the      Board’s       own     members       appeared     to     question\n\nwhether      the     2011-2012         Plan    was     consistent       with     the       Board’s\n\nobligations          under       controlling          desegregation           orders.          For\n\ninstance, Board Member Tolmie, noting that the plan would open\n\nLakeforest         with      only      12%    white     enrollment        and     make       South\n\nGreenville Elementary 17% white, found the plan “disappointing .\n\n. . for racial balance.”                      J.A. 618.        He believed that “there\n\nmust be a better map for diversity.”                         J.A. 618.        Others believed\n\nthe   plan     would      compromise          opportunity       for    some     students       and\n\ninhibit the district’s efforts to achieve unitary status.\n\n      On April 19, 2011, Appellants filed a motion for injunctive\n\nand      other       appropriate             relief         seeking      to      enjoin        the\n\nimplementation of the 2011-2012 Plan, arguing that it violated\n\nthe   Board’s        obligation         to    move     the    district        toward       unitary\n\nstatus.        The district court construed Appellants’ motion as a\n\nrequest      for     a    preliminary          injunction.             Because       the     court\n\n                                                 44\n\fdetermined        that       Appellants     had     failed      to    demonstrate    a\n\nlikelihood of success on the merits, it denied the motion.\n\n       Appellants appealed to the Fourth Circuit, and this panel\n\nvacated the decision and remanded, concluding that the district\n\ncourt       had     improperly       placed       the     evidentiary    burden     on\n\nAppellants.         Everett I, 678 F.3d at 289.            Specifically, we held:\n\n       Given that there is no dispute that the school\n       district   has  not    attained unitary status,  the\n       evidentiary burden should have been on the School\n       Board to prove that the 2011–12 Assignment Plan is\n       consistent with the controlling desegregation orders\n       and fulfills the School Board's affirmative duty to\n       eliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move\n       toward unitary status.\n\nId. at 290.         We further noted that “the 2009 Consent Order does\n\nnot settle the core dispute that arose in the 1960s and 1970s,\n\nnamely, the School Board’s unconstitutional operation of a dual\n\nschool      system     and    its    continuing         affirmative   obligation    to\n\neliminate the vestiges of discrimination and move toward unitary\n\nstatus.”      Id. at 290 n.8 (emphasis added).\n\n       On    July    6,   2012,     the   Board    filed    a   motion   for   unitary\n\nstatus, arguing that the school system was unitary as of 2000.\n\nOver     Appellants’         objection,    the     district      court   decided    to\n\nconsider the Board’s motion for unitary status together with\n\nAppellants’ remanded motion to enjoin the 2011-2012 Plan.\n\n       The district court conducted a five-day bench trial in July\n\n2013.       The Board’s expert, Dr. Armor, concluded that as of 1986,\n\n\n                                            45\n\fnearly     three    decades    ago,    Greenville     City    Schools       and   Pitt\n\nCounty Schools had each obtained unitary status and that any\n\nsubsequent         imbalance    was      not    a     vestige       of     de     jure\n\ndiscrimination, but rather was due to demographic changes.                          In\n\nreliance on Dr. Armor’s testimony, the district court concluded\n\nthat prior to the 1986 merger, both the Greenville City Schools\n\nand the Pitt County Board of Education successfully implemented\n\ntheir court-ordered plans, fully desegregated all schools within\n\nboth districts, and maintained a high level of integration until\n\nmerger.\n\n       The district court further concluded that post-merger, the\n\nBoard adopted policies to maintain racial balance and succeeded\n\nin   the   vast     majority   of     schools   and   found     that      significant\n\ndemographic shifts had occurred in the post-merger period.                          In\n\nthis analysis, the district court only briefly mentioned the\n\n2011–12 Plan.        Importantly, the district court acknowledged that\n\nit made no effort to determine whether the Board met its burden\n\nof demonstrating that “the 2011–12 Assignment Plan is consistent\n\nwith     the     controlling   desegregation        orders    and    fulfills      the\n\nSchool Board’s affirmative duty to eliminate the vestiges of\n\ndiscrimination and move toward unitary status.”                  Id. at 290 n.8.\n\nRather, the court assumed that it did not, without deciding the\n\nissue,     and    determined   that    Appellants’     motion       for    injunctive\n\nrelief was moot, stating:\n\n                                         46\n\f      Even assuming, arguendo, that the School Board is\n      unable to meet its burden of proof as to the 2011-2012\n      plan, an order enjoining the continued implementation\n      of this plan would be pointless since the school\n      district has been declared unitary and no longer has\n      an affirmative duty to ensure that its policies move\n      the district toward unitary status.\n\nJ.A. 568-569 (emphasis added). 2\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n                                           A.\n\n      For   a   court    to    release      a   school    district     from   prior\n\ndesegregation orders, a school district must “comply in good\n\nfaith with [school desegregation orders].”                     Everett I, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799407\"><a href=\"/opinion/799407/everett-v-pitt-county-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (citing   Bd.     of    Educ.   v.

The importance of the good faith requirement is\n\nparticularly salient in this case, where the parties entered\n\ninto a settlement in 2009, memorialized in the district court’s\n\n2009   Consent     Order,      which     required      the    Board     to     move    the\n\ndistrict towards unitary status.                As a result of the settlement,\n\nparents of school children forwent legal action in favor of a\n\ncooperative      agreement       premised       on   the    Board’s     commitment      to\n\nworking towards the laudable goal of a racially balanced school\n\nsystem.     Whether the board complied in good faith with that\n\ndirective would be undeniably probative of its commitment to\n\nmaintaining a racially balanced school system even after the\n\ndesegregation      orders        were    lifted       and    the      district        court\n\nrelinquished jurisdiction over the case.                     Such a determination\n\nis   important    not   only     to     instill      confidence    in    the    district\n\ncourt when it decides whether to release the district from its\n\npurview,    but    also     to    the     stakeholders        in   this      litigation\n\nconsisting primarily of parents of minor school children.\n\n       In concluding that the Board had complied in good faith\n\nwith prior desegregation orders, the district court found that\n\nthe pre-merged school systems had fully implemented the Teel and\n\n\n                                           48\n\fEdwards     orders      in   a     short       period        of    time        and    had        sought\n\nfaithfully       to     comply          with       those          orders        notwithstanding\n\nconsiderable      demographic               shifts      in        the     district          in     the\n\nintervening     years.        The       district        court      also        stated      that     the\n\nBoard’s reluctance to seek a declaration of unitary status was\n\nevidence that the Board was committed to continued integration\n\nof its schools.\n\n      Yet the district court failed to substantially account for\n\nthe   Board’s    actions         in    the    wake      of   the        2009    Consent          Order.\n\nAppellants      argue    that         the    Board’s     adoption          of    the       2011-2012\n\nPlan, which came on the heels of the 2009 Consent Order and\n\nresulted in more rather than fewer racially imbalanced schools\n\nin    the    district        constituted           a    violation          of        the     Board’s\n\nobligation to move towards unitary status under with the 2009\n\nOrder.       Indeed,     applying           Dr.    Armor’s         metrics       for       assessing\n\nracial      imbalance,       C.M.       Eppes,         South       Greenville,             and    G.R.\n\nWhitfield schools all became racially imbalanced as a result of\n\nthe 2011-2012 Plan.           Lakeforest Elementary opened as a racially\n\nidentifiable school with a black population of nearly 80%.                                           In\n\nthe view of Appellants’ expert, the plan adopted by the Board\n\nwas the most segregative option it considered.                                   Board members\n\nquestioned      whether      the       2011-2012        Plan       satisfied         the     Board’s\n\nobligations to eliminate racial imbalance in its schools.                                         Board\n\nMember Tolmie found the plan “disappointing . . . for racial\n\n                                                  49\n\fbalance”     and    believed    that   “there   must   be    a   better   map    for\n\ndiversity.”        J.A. 618.   Others echoed similar sentiments.\n\n      As has long been recognized, a court clearly errs when it\n\nfails to consider substantial evidence contrary to its ultimate\n\nfinding.      Miller v.
