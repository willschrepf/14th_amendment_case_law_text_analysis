Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell\n\n    RYAN ZINKE, Secretary, United States\n    Department of the Interior, et al.,\n\n                            Defendants.\n\n\n\n                                         MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n         The plaintiff, Forest County Potawatomi Community, a federally recognized Native\n\nAmerican tribe located in Crandon, Wisconsin, filed ten requests, pursuant to the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, for information relating to a competitor tribe’s\n\nunsuccessful application to open a gaming establishment. Pl.’s Statement of Undisputed\n\nMaterial Facts & Resps. to Defs.’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“Pl.’s SUMF”) ¶¶ 19,\n\n37–118, ECF No. 49-2. The FOIA requests were submitted to three components of the U.S.\n\nDepartment of the Interior (“DOI”)—the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ (“BIA”) Central Office\n\n(“BIA-Central”) and Midwest Regional Office (“MWRO”), and Office of Indian Gaming\n\n(“OIG”). Id. 1 The gaming application died, but the FOIA requests live on. In response to the\n\nplaintiff’s requests, DOI released over 22,954 pages of information. Id. ¶ 139. Dissatisfied, the\n\n\n\n1\n          The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”); BIA’s Office of\nIndian Gaming; BIA’s Central Office; Sally Jewel, Secretary of the Interior, in her official capacity; Kevin\nWashburn, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, in his official capacity; Paula Hart, Director, Office of Indian\nGaming, in her official capacity; and Diane Rosen, Regional Director for the Midwest Region Bureau of Indian\nAffairs, in her official capacity. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), federal employees named in\ntheir official capacities are automatically substituted. Accordingly, Ryan Zinke is substituted for Sally Jewell,\nMichael Black is substituted for Kevin Washburn, and Tammie Poitra is substituted for Diane Rosen.\n\n                                                              1\n\fplaintiff sued the defendants to compel disclosure of nine documents withheld in full or part and\n\nto challenge the adequacy of the agencies’ search procedures. Pending before this Court are the\n\nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. See generally Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. (“Defs.’\n\nMSJ”), ECF No. 44; Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 49. The defendants’ motion is granted\n\nin part and denied in part, and the plaintiff’s motion is denied.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         Contextual background for the FOIA requests at issue is helpful in understanding the\n\nscope and timing of the requests, and the agencies’ rationale for the searches conducted and\n\nwithholdings. Consequently, the statutory framework for, and participation in, commercial\n\ngaming activities of both the plaintiff and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin\n\n(“Menominee”) are briefly reviewed before turning to the legal challenges to the defendants’\n\nresponses to plaintiff’s FOIA requests.\n\n         A.       Overview of Statutory Framework Governing Indian Gaming\n\n         The records sought in this action concern the Menominee’s application to engage in\n\ngaming operations on land approximately 35 miles from the plaintiff’s gaming facility in\n\nWisconsin. 2 Under the Indian Reorganization Act (“IRA”), the Secretary of DOI “is authorized,\n\nin his discretion, to acquire . . . any interest in lands, water rights, or surface rights to lands . . .\n\nfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.” 25 U.S.C. § 5108; see also Citizens Exposing\n\nTruth About Casinos v. Kempthorne, 492 F.3d 460, 461 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[T]he Secretary may\n\nacquire lands for the purpose of providing land for Native Americans.”). The IRA further\n\n\n\n\n2\n         The land the Menominee sought to acquire, known as the Dairyland Greyhound Park, is located in\nKenosha, Wisconsin, Pl.’s SUMF ¶¶ 2, 8, approximately 35 miles from Milwaukee, where the plaintiff operates a\ngaming facility, id. ¶ 15. The distance between the two locations is judicially noticed, as “not subject to reasonable\ndispute because” this distance “can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot\nreasonably be questioned.” FED. R. EVID. 201(b).\n\n                                                              2\n\fspecifies that “[t]itle to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be taken in the\n\nname of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is\n\nacquired.” 25 U.S.C. § 5108. Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (“IGRA”), “gaming\n\nregulated by [the IGRA] shall not be conducted on lands acquired by the Secretary in trust for\n\nthe benefit of an Indian tribe after October 17, 1988.” 25 U.S.C. § 2719(a). Notwithstanding\n\nthis provision, a tribe may conduct gaming on trust land acquired after 1988 when, as relevant\n\nhere, the Secretary determines after a consultation process that “a gaming establishment on\n\nnewly acquired lands” both (1) “would be in the best interest of the Indian tribe and its\n\nmembers” and (2) “would not be detrimental to the surrounding community.” Id. §\n\n2719(b)(1)(A). This exception may be granted “only if the Governor of the State in which the\n\ngaming activity is to be conducted concurs in the Secretary’s determination.” Id.\n\n        In practice, the Secretary makes this two-part determination after a tribe submits an\n\napplication for a gaming exemption to the applicable BIA Regional Office, which develops and\n\nsends a recommendation to OIG. Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 2. OIG then conducts its own review and\n\nprepares a draft two-part determination for consideration and final decision by the Assistant\n\nSecretary for Indian Affairs. Id.\n\n        B.      The Menominee’s Gaming Application\n\n        In 2004, the Menominee “filed an off-reservation gaming acquisition application with\n\n[MWRO] requesting that the Secretary acquire in trust approximately 228 acres of land” in\n\nKenosha, Wisconsin for gaming purposes. Id. ¶¶ 8, 15. “The site of the proposed casino is\n\nlocated approximately 190 miles from the Menominee’s gaming facility in Northern Wisconsin,”\n\nand the “Menominee’s existing gaming facility is located approximately 160 miles north of the\n\n[plaintiff’s] casino in Milwaukee, [Wisconsin].” Id. ¶ 26. MWRO entered into a three-party\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n\fagreement (“TPA”) with a third party contractor, Analytical Environmental Services (“AES”),\n\nand the Menominee to undertake preparation of Environmental Impact Statements (“EISs”)\n\nrequired by the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., as part\n\nof the Menominee’s gaming application. Decl. of Scott Doig (“First MWRO Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 9, 11,\n\n16, ECF No. 45-1. AES was responsible “only for the delivery of draft and final EIS\n\ndocuments.” Id. ¶ 16.\n\n       The Secretary denied the Menominee’s application to acquire the land in trust on January\n\n7, 2009. Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 29. Thereafter, the Menominee sued DOI challenging the denial, which\n\nlawsuit was resolved in 2011 with an agreement that DOI would withdraw its denial letter and\n\nreconsider the Menominee’s application. Id.\n\n       Following further review, DOI conveyed to the Governor of Wisconsin, on August 23,\n\n2013, a Secretarial Determination, ECF No. 49-25, that gaming at the Kenosha location would be\n\nin the Menominee’s best interest and not detrimental to the surrounding community. See id. ¶\n\n14. On January 23, 2015, the Governor conveyed to the Secretary his non-concurrence with\n\nDOI’s determination, prompting DOI to recognize formally, on June 1, 2015, that the Kenosha\n\nsite could not be acquired in trust. Id. ¶ 124.\n\n       C.      The Plaintiff’s FOIA Requests\n\n       As this process unfolded, the plaintiff filed ten FOIA requests for documents concerning\n\nthe Menominee’s gaming application with BIA-Central, MWRO, and OIG. Pl.’s SUMF ¶¶ 37–\n\n118. These requests sought “to obtain the Supplemental Information submitted by Menominee\n\nor its third party contractor, Analytical Environmental Services (‘AES’), regarding the Kenosha\n\nCasino Application” in order to “provide meaningful comments on the Kenosha Casino\n\nApplication . . . by the comment deadlines.” Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 3, Decl. of April E.\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fOlson (“Plaintiff Decl.”) ¶ 4, ECF No. 49-3. In response to this multiple FOIA requests, the\n\ndefendants produced 22,954 pages of documents. Pl.’s’ SUMF ¶¶ 18, 139. Despite the volume\n\nof this production, the plaintiff filed the instant suit challenging both the adequacy of the search\n\nand the withholdings. Id. ¶ 126.\n\n         The defendants withheld 71 documents, pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 4, 5, and 6, for\n\nreasons set out in a Vaughn Index. See Vaughn Index, ECF No. 45-2. 3 The plaintiff does not\n\ncontest the defendants’ withholdings under Exemptions 3, 5, and 6, except as to segregable\n\nportions of such documents. Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Cross-Mot. Summ. J. & Resp. Defs.’ Mot.\n\nSumm. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) at 5 & n.2, 7, 24–25, ECF No. 49-1; Pl.’s Reply Supp. Cross-Mot.\n\nSumm. J. (“Pl.’s Reply”) at 1, 15–16, ECF No. 60. At issue, then, are the plaintiff’s challenges\n\nto withholdings under Exemption 4 and the adequacy of the defendants’ searches for responsive\n\ndocuments. The plaintiff raises the following five grounds for relief, claiming the defendants:\n\n(1) improperly withheld six documents under Exemption 4, Pl.’s Mem. at 1; (2) failed to produce\n\nor identify in their Vaughn Index two documents that the plaintiff “knows to be in [d]efendants’\n\npossession,” id.; 4 (2) failed to release reasonably segregable information from documents\n\nwithheld in their entirety, id. at 7; (3) failed to search AES’s computer networks for responsive\n\ndocuments, id. at 1; and (4) engaged in a pattern and practice of violating FOIA, id. at 2.\n\nII.      LEGAL STANDARD\n\n         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that summary judgment shall be granted “if\n\nthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\n\n3\n         “A Vaughn index describes the documents withheld or redacted and the FOIA exemptions invoked, and\nexplains why each exemption applies.” Prison Legal News v. Samuels, 787 F.3d 1142, 1145 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\nThe 71 entries in the Vaughn Index appear to include some duplicates since, for example, Vaughn Rows 17, 22, 29\nand 38 refer to a document titled Menominee Report on Impact of Kenosha, without any indication that the\ndocuments differ in any way.\n4\n         As described in more detail, infra n.5, the plaintiff originally complained about five missing documents, but\nthree were ultimately disclosed, leaving only two such documents at issue.\n\n                                                              5\n\fentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). “In FOIA cases, ‘summary\n\njudgment may be granted on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain reasonable specificity\n\nof detail rather than merely conclusory statements, and if they are not called into question by\n\ncontradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith.’” Judicial Watch, Inc.\n\nv. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 215 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting Consumer Fed’n of Am. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Agric., 455 F.3d 283, 287 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has observed that\n\n“the vast majority of FOIA cases can be resolved on summary judgment.” Brayton v. Office of\n\nthe U.S. Trade Representative, 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n          The FOIA was enacted “to promote the ‘broad disclosure of Government records’ by\n\ngenerally requiring federal agencies to make their records available to the public on\n\nrequest.” DiBacco v. U.S. Army, 795 F.3d 178, 183 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing U.S. Dep’t of Justice\n\nv. Julian, 486 U.S. 1, 8 (1988)). Reflecting the necessary balance between the public’s interest\n\nin governmental transparency and “legitimate governmental and private interests that could be\n\nharmed by release of certain types of information,” United Techs. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nDefense, 601 F.3d 557, 559 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the FOIA contains nine exemptions, set forth in 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b), which “are explicitly made exclusive and must be narrowly construed,” Milner\n\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Navy, 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted); see also Murphy v. Exec. Office for U.S. Attys., 789 F.3d 204, 206 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2015); Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice (CREW), 746 F.3d\n\n1082, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt. & Budget, 598 F.3d 865, 869\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2010). “[T]hese limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure,\n\nnot secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.” Dep’t of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361\n\n(1976).\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n\f       In litigation challenging the sufficiency of “the release of information under the FOIA,\n\n‘the agency has the burden of showing that requested information comes within a FOIA\n\nexemption.’” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. Food & Drug Admin., 185 F.3d 898, 904\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 169 F.3d 16,\n\n18 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); see also U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Landano, 508 U.S. 165, 171 (1993)\n\n(noting that “[t]he Government bears the burden of establishing that the exemption applies”);\n\nFed. Open Mkt. Comm. of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340, 352 (1979) (finding that\n\nthe agency invoking an exemption bears the burden “to establish that the requested information\n\nis exempt”); Elec. Frontier Found. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 739 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2014). This\n\nburden does not shift even when the requester files a cross-motion for summary judgment\n\nbecause “the Government ‘ultimately [has] the onus of proving that the [documents] are exempt\n\nfrom disclosure,’” while the “burden upon the requester is merely ‘to establish the absence of\n\nmaterial factual issues before a summary disposition of the case could permissibly occur,’” Pub.\n\nCitizen Health Research Grp., 185 F.3d at 904–05 (quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Gov’t Emps. v.\n\nCampbell, 593 F.2d 1023, 1027 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).\n\n       An agency may carry its burden of showing an exemption was properly invoked by\n\nsubmitting sufficiently detailed affidavits or declarations, a Vaughn index of the withheld\n\ndocuments, or both, to demonstrate that the government has analyzed carefully any material\n\nwithheld and provided sufficient information as to the applicability of an exemption to enable the\n\nadversary system to operate. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 215\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (“In FOIA cases, ‘summary judgment may be granted on the basis of agency\n\naffidavits if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory\n\nstatements, and if they are not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by\n\n\n\n                                                     7\n\fevidence of agency bad faith.’” (alteration adopted) (quoting Consumer Fed’n of Am., 455 F.3d\n\nat 287)); CREW, 746 F.3d at 1088 (noting that an agency’s burden is sustained by submitting an\n\naffidavit that “‘describe[s] the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,\n\ndemonstrate[s] that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and\n\n[is] not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad\n\nfaith’” (quoting Larson v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009))); Oglesby v.\n\nU.S. Dep’t of Army, 79 F.3d 1172, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (instructing that an agency’s\n\ndescription “should reveal as much detail as possible as to the nature of the document, without\n\nactually disclosing information that deserves protection[,] . . . [which] serves the purpose of\n\nproviding the requestor with a realistic opportunity to challenge the agency’s decision.”)\n\n(internal citation omitted). While “an agency’s task is not herculean” it must “‘describe the\n\njustifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail’ and ‘demonstrate that the\n\ninformation withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption.’” Murphy, 789 F.3d at\n\n209 (quoting Larson, 565 F.3d at 862). “Ultimately, an agency’s justification for invoking a\n\nFOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears ‘logical’ or ‘plausible.’” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Defense, 715 F.3d 937, 941 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nDefense, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Larson, 565 F.3d at 862 (quoting Wolf v. CIA, 473\n\nF.3d 370, 374–75 (D.C. Cir. 2007)).\n\n       The FOIA provides federal courts with the power to “enjoin the agency from withholding\n\nagency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the\n\ncomplainant.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). District courts must “determine de novo whether non-\n\ndisclosure was permissible,” Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 777 F.3d\n\n518, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2015), by reviewing the Vaughn index and any supporting declarations “to\n\n\n\n                                                      8\n\fverify the validity of each claimed exemption.” Summers v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 140 F.3d\n\n1077, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In addition, the court has an “affirmative duty” to consider whether\n\nthe agency has produced all segregable, non-exempt information. Elliott v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nAgric., 596 F.3d 842, 851 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (referring to court’s “affirmative duty to consider the\n\nsegregability issue sua sponte”) (quoting Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1123 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007)); Stolt–Nielsen Transp. Grp. Ltd. v. United States, 534 F.3d 728, 734 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008) (“[B]efore approving the application of a FOIA exemption, the district court must make\n\nspecific findings of segregability regarding the documents to be withheld.”) (quoting Sussman v.\n\nU.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007))); Trans-Pac. Policing Agreement v.\n\nU.S. Customs Serv., 177 F.3d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“[W]e believe that the District Court\n\nhad an affirmative duty to consider the segregability issue sua sponte . . . even if the issue has not\n\nbeen specifically raised by the FOIA plaintiff.”); see also 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (“Any reasonably\n\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after\n\ndeletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.”).\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the sufficiency of the defendants’ responses to the ten FOIA\n\nrequests at issue, raising issues as to the adequacy of the search, explanations for withholdings,\n\nand delays in responding. Specifically, whether the defendants conducted an adequate search\n\nturns on whether (1) their failure to search records held by AES was improper and (2) their\n\nsearch’s failure to turn up two documents the plaintiff knew to exist means it necessarily was\n\ninadequate. These issues are addressed first, before turning to whether the defendants (3)\n\nimproperly withheld or redacted five documents under Exemption 4, (4) failed to disclose all\n\n\n\n\n                                                      9\n\freasonably segregable portions of three documents that they withheld in full, and (5) engaged in\n\na policy or practice of violating FOIA.\n\n        A.       The Adequacy of DOI’s Search\n\n        The plaintiff complains that the defendants’ search was inadequate because the search (1)\n\nfailed to locate two documents the plaintiff knew to exist because the documents were attached\n\nto the Secretarial Determination, and (2) did not include documents held by defendants’\n\ncontractor AES. See Pl.’s Reply at 11−14, 17−19. These issues are addressed following review\n\nof the applicable legal standard. For the reasons that follow, the defendants have met their\n\nburden to show that the search was adequate as to the AES records, but they must either perform\n\nan additional search for responsive documents or provide a supplemental Vaughn Index or\n\ndeclaration explaining the withholdings of the two documents attached to the Secretarial\n\nDetermination.\n\n                 1.       Failure to Locate Documents\n\n        The plaintiff asserts that the defendants’ search was unreasonable or inadequate because\n\nthe defendants did not produce or identify in response to FOIA Requests Nos. 6, 9, and 10, two\n\ndocuments attached to the Secretarial Decision, namely: the KlasRobinson Final Report (Feb.\n\n12, 2012) and a letter, dated June 19, 2013, from Craig Corn, Chairman, Menominee Indian\n\nTribe of Wisconsin, to Troy Woodward, Office of Indian Gaming, with supporting exhibits\n\n(“Corn Letter”). 5 See Pl.’s Mem. at 23−24; Pl.’s Reply, at 13 & n.12; Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 117.\n\n\n\n5\n         The plaintiff initially challenged the defendants’ withholding of three other documents attached to the\nSecretarial Determination as well, but has since acknowledged that only the KlasRobinson Final Report and Corn\nLetter remain at issue. Pl.’s Reply at 13 & n.12. The plaintiff acknowledges that the defendants might have\nproduced these documents in entirely redacted form, although “it is impossible to know due to the complete\nredaction of documents and due to Defendant’s failure to update their Vaughn Index to identify the documents\nwithheld and the grounds for withholding.” Id. at 13 n.13. In any event, the plaintiff waives any challenge to the\nredactions on these three documents, id. at 12–13 & n.11, and, thus, the defendants are entitled to summary\njudgment as to those documents.\n\n                                                             10\n\fAccording to the plaintiff, these documents were “specifically requested” in Request No. 10,\n\nwhich sought “[a]ll records listed in the . . . Attachment List to the [Secretarial] Determination,”\n\nPl.’s Reply at 14 (emphasis in original); Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 117, and, consequently, the defendants\n\nshould be required “to perform an additional search to locate and disclose these missing\n\nrecords,” and to produce both documents and/or identify withholdings in their Vaughn Index,\n\nPl.’s Mem. at 24; Pl.’s Reply at 13−14.\n\n        The defendants assert the “well-settled” principle that “the identification of potentially\n\nresponsive documents that were not identified in response to a request is not proof of an\n\nunreasonable or inadequate search.” Def.’s Opp’n Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. & Reply Supp.\n\nDef.’s Mot. Summ J. (“Defs.’ Reply”) at 8, ECF No. 59 (citing DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 191−92;\n\nSafeCard Services, Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). Further, the defendants\n\npoint out that the “documents Plaintiff [seeks] . . . were produced to Plaintiff in response to yet\n\nanother FOIA request,” one of the ten at issue, and that the plaintiff’s request for an additional\n\nsearch to produce these documents thus is moot. Id. at 9. 6 In other words, the defendants do not\n\ndispute that the records are responsive and are non-exempt from disclosure. The defendants cite\n\nto nothing in the record, however, showing that these two documents were produced, and the\n\nplaintiff denies that the KlasRobinson Final Report and the Corn Letter were either produced or\n\nidentified as withheld. Pl.’s Reply at 12−13 & n.12.\n\n         This dispute raises a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the defendants’\n\nsearch, requiring denial of both the defendants and plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe defendants’ suggestion that this issue is “moot” is predicated on their assumption that the\n\n\n6\n         In addition, the defendants argued that most of the documents attached to the Secretarial Determination\n“were not part of the search parameters” because they “post-date the FOIA requests at issue.” Defs.’ Reply at 9.\nThis argument fails because the plaintiff’s Reply focuses on Request No. 10, which was submitted after the\nSecretarial Determination issued. See Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 117.\n\n                                                            11\n\ftwo documents, the KlasRobinson Final Report and Corn Letter, were actually produced, but the\n\ndefendants have not shown that such production occurred.\n\n       Nevertheless, the defendants assert that “BIA has met the reasonableness standard in\n\nconducting its search for records concerning the Menominee Indian Tribe’s Kenosha Casino\n\napplication and various documents required as a part of the gaming application process,” and cite\n\nto declarations detailing their process of searching for records responsive to the plaintiff’s FOIA\n\nrequests. Defs.’ Mem. at 6; see generally First MWRO Decl.; Defs.’ Mot., Ex. 2, Decl. of\n\nMichelle R.

An agency is not\n\nentitled to summary judgment, however, if “a review of the record raises substantial doubt,\n\nparticularly in view of ‘well defined requests and positive indications of overlooked materials.’”\n\nIturralde v. Comptroller of Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 314 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Valencia–\n\nLucena v. U.S. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted); see also Aguiar v. Drug Enf’t Admin., 865 F.3d 730, 738 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n\n       In this case, the plaintiff submitted a “well defined” request for all records attached to the\n\nSecretarial Determination. See Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 117; Valencia-Lucena, 180 F.3d at 326 (quoting\n\nFounding Church of Scientology of Wash. D.C., Inc., v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 610 F.2d 824, 837\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1979)). That the Secretarial Determination listed the KlasRobinson Final Report and\n\nCorn Letter as attachments makes clear that these documents exist, Secretarial Determination at\n\n53−54, and the defendants do not dispute their existence, see Defs.’ Reply at 9; indeed, they\n\nclaim, without any record evidence, to have already produced these documents. Id. These\n\nconstitute “positive indications of overlooked materials” that preclude a grant of summary\n\n\n\n                                                     12\n\fjudgment to the defendants. Valencia-Lucena, 180 F.3d at 326 (quoting Founding Church of\n\nScientology, 610 F.2d at 837). The defendants have not sustained their burden of showing their\n\nsearches’ adequacy, and so are not entitled to summary judgment as to this claim. They may\n\neither supplement their declarations to address the genuine issues of material fact the plaintiff\n\nraises as to the KlasRobinson Final Report and the Corn Letter, or else perform an additional\n\nsearch to locate these missing records. See Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs.,\n\n975 F. Supp. 2d 81, 98 (D.D.C. 2013) (directing defendant to “either supplement its declarations\n\nto address the factual questions raised by the plaintiff . . . or perform an additional search” where\n\n“the defendant was or became aware” while conducting its search that additional responsive\n\nreports “should exist,” yet “offer[ed] no explanation, and cite[d] to no produced document, to\n\naccount for the missing records”).\n\n                 2.       Records Held by Contractor AES\n\n        The parties also dispute whether AES internal records are “agency records” for the\n\npurpose of FOIA’s disclosure requirements. See Pl.’s Mem. at 34; Defs.’ Reply at 9. The\n\nplaintiff seeks an order requiring the defendants to conduct a search for records responsive to\n\nRequest No. 7, of internal AES records as “likely includ[ing] information and analysis relating to\n\nAES’s preparation of” records and documents ultimately provided to the BIA. Pl.’s Mem. at\n\n25−26. 7\n\n        The defendants argue that the MWRO “conducted a reasonable search for AES files” by\n\n“provid[ing] emails between its employees and AES, as those emails were incorporated into the\n\nagency’s files, but did not conduct a search of AES’s internal files because those files do not\n\n\n7\n        Request No. 7 sought “[a]ll records produced by or held by AES or its subcontractors relating to the BIA,\nthe Menominee Tribe, the Menominee Tribe’s business partners and its third party agent, AES, including counsel or\nrepresentatives of the foregoing, regarding the National Environmental Policy Act review and evaluation process\nconducted by AES for the Menominee Tribe’s Kenosha Casino Project.” Pl.’s Reply at 26.\n\n                                                           13\n\fmeet the standard for agency records.” Defs.’ Mem. at 8; First MRWO Decl. ¶¶ 17−24. The\n\ndefendants aver that “they lack the authority to command [AES] to retain or dispose of AES’s\n\nrecords,” and that because the plaintiff “cannot point to a specific document custody arrangement\n\nbetween AES and Defendants, it is reasonable that potentially responsive documents may remain\n\nsolely within AES’s custody and control, meaning [d]efendants’ search was adequate and\n\n[d]efendants are entitled to summary judgment.” Defs.’ Reply at 9.\n\n       Records held by third-party contractors may under certain circumstances be “agency\n\nrecords.” This inquiry does not turn on who created the document or where the document is\n\ncurrently located. Rather, to qualify as “agency records,” requested documents must satisfy two\n\nrequirements: the agency must (1) “either create or obtain the requested materials” and (2) “be in\n\ncontrol of [them] at the time the FOIA request is made.” Burka v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 87 F.3d 508, 515 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Tax Analysts,\n\n492 U.S. 136, 144 (1989)) (alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted). “The burden is\n\non the agency to demonstrate, not the requester to disprove, that the materials sought are not\n\n‘agency records’ or have not been ‘improperly’ ‘withheld.’” Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. at 142 n.3\n\n(citing S. REP. NO. 89-813, at 8 (1965)). For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that AES’s\n\ninternal records are not “agency records” subject to the disclosure requirements of FOIA.\n\n                       a)      Creating or Obtaining Requested Materials\n\n       An agency “created or obtained” records possessed by third-party firms when “the\n\nextensive supervision and control exercised by the agency over collection and analysis of the\n\ndata indicates that these [third-party] firms acted on behalf of [the agency] in creating the\n\n[records].” Burka, 87 F.3d at 515. The defendants assert that they lacked access to AES’s\n\ninternal records and never sought documents from any subcontractor. See First MRWO Decl. ¶¶\n\n16−19, 21−23. Furthermore, MWRO “considered the records which were internal to and\n                                                     14\n\fcontrolled by AES . . . as non-government records, since the records were created by a non-\n\nfederal entity.” Second MWRO Decl. ¶ 117. The plaintiff counters that the BIA “created or\n\nobtained” the AES internal records because AES was a contractor that “‘acted on behalf of’ the\n\n[BIA].” See Pl.’s Mem. at 27 (citing Burka, 87 F.3d at 515; ExxonMobil Corp. v. Dep’t of\n\nCommerce, 828 F. Supp. 2d 97, 106 (D.D.C. 2011); Chi. Tribune Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., No. 95 C 3917, 1997 WL 1137641, at *13 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 1997)). As support,\n\nthe plaintiff notes that under the TPA, “AES agree[d] to act as the project manager on behalf of\n\nthe BIA,” and BIA served as “Lead Agency,” Pl.’s Mem. at 28 (quoting Plaintiff Decl., Ex. M\n\n(“TPA Exhibit”) § 5.0, ECF No. 49-16 (emphasis added)), and, further, that “[DOI] regulations\n\nand Council on Environmental Quality (‘CEQ’) regulations[] both required BIA to retain\n\nultimate responsibility for the preparation of environmental documents and independently\n\nevaluate such documents,” id. at 28−29 (citing; 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a), (c); 43 C.F.R. § 46.105).\n\nAs such, the plaintiff argues, AES created the internal records the plaintiff seeks “on behalf of”\n\nthe defendants and under their “extensive supervision and control.” Id.\n\n       The plaintiff’s points are well taken. AES “acted on [BIA’s] behalf” in serving as project\n\nmanager, TPA Exhibit § 5.0, meaning that any internal documents created by AES in the course\n\nof serving as project manager were made on BIA’s behalf as well. BIA thus exercised\n\n“extensive supervision and control” over AES’s “collection and analysis of the data.” Burka, 87\n\nF.3d at 515. As such, the defendants “created or obtained” AES’s internal records for purposes\n\nof FOIA’s disclosure rules even though these records “were neither created by agency\n\nemployees, nor [we]re they currently located on agency property.” Id. That the defendants did\n\nnot understand AES’s internal records to be agency records, see Second MWRO Decl. ¶ 117, is\n\nimmaterial—the objective nature of an agency-third party relationship, not the agency’s\n\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fsubjective understanding of a document’s status, controls whether an agency “created or\n\nobtained” the document. See Burka, 87 F.3d at 515.\n\n                       b)     Agency control of the AES internal documents at the time the FOIA\n                       request was made\n\n       A document that an agency “created or obtained” is not an “agency record” within\n\nFOIA’s meaning if the agency lacked “control of [them] at the time the FOIA request [wa]s\n\nmade.” Id. (quoting Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. at 144 (internal quotation marks and citation). Four\n\nfactors determine whether an agency controlled records at the time of a FOIA request:\n\n       (1) the intent of the document’s creator to retain or relinquish control over the\n       records; (2) the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit;\n       (3) the extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the document;\n       and (4) the degree to which the document was integrated into the agency’s record\n       system or files.\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 646 F.3d 924, 926–27 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting\n\nBurka, 87 F.3d at 515). The D.C. Circuit “has adopted a totality of the circumstances test” to\n\ndetermine whether documents are “agency records.” Consumer Fed’n of Am., 455 F.3d at 287.\n\nCourts apply this test “mindful that the ‘core purpose of the FOIA’ is to ‘contribut[e]\n\nsignificantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.’” Judicial\n\nWatch, Inc., 646 F.3d at 928 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of\n\nthe Press, 489 U.S. 749, 775 (1989) (alternation and emphasis in original) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)). The plaintiff argues that three of the four factors weigh in favor of finding that\n\nBIA has “control” over the internal AES records. Pl.’s Reply at 17.\n\n       The first factor, “the intent of the document’s creator to retain or relinquish control over\n\nthe records,” weighs in a requester’s favor when a third-party firm transfers documents to an\n\nagency “with full knowledge that the agency might use them.” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at\n\n926–27 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d at 515). BIA explains that neither BIA nor AES “intended for\n\n\n                                                     16\n\finternal AES documentation to be provided to BIA as part of the contract,” but rather, intended\n\nonly for AES to turn over to BIA “actual deliverables – namely, draft and final EIS documents.”\n\nFirst MRWO Decl. ¶ 17. The plaintiff asserts that BIA “ordered the creation of” the EIS\n\ndocuments as “Lead Agency” and “necessarily retained ultimate responsibility and control over\n\nthese documents.” Pl.’s Mem. at 30–31 (citing Burka, 87 F.3d at 515). Although AES knew\n\nBIA might use the particular deliverables AES agreed to provide BIA, the record does not show\n\nthat AES intended to provide BIA other internal documents. In fact, BIA and AES did not\n\nexpect BIA to obtain access to or control over internal AES documents. First MRWO Decl. ¶\n\n17. BIA sought only the EIS and related documents, and MWRO produced those documents in\n\nresponse to the plaintiff’s FOIA requests. Id. ¶ 22. The first factor thus weighs in the\n\ndefendants’ favor.\n\n       As to the second factor, “the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it\n\nsees fit,” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at 926–27 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d at 515), BIA explains\n\nthat “MWRO has no direct access to AES’[s] internal documents (aside from those transmitted to\n\n[MWRO])” and thus “MWRO cannot use the documents, nor can MWRO require AES to\n\ndispose of the documents.” First MRWO Decl. ¶ 20. The plaintiff argues that MWRO had\n\nimplicit access to internal AES pursuant to the TPA, which “provided that AES would provide\n\n‘technical direction, review, and quality control for the preparation of the Scoping Report, EIS,\n\ntechnical studies, and other NEPA-related documents,’” and that BIA would review “‘[w]ork in\n\nprogress, deliverables, and finished products . . . for accuracy, completeness, compliance with\n\nrequired standards, and responsiveness to the requirements of this agreement.’” Pl.’s Mem. at 31\n\n(quoting TPA Exhibit §§ 5.0, 7.0) (alteration in original). The plaintiff observes that AES\n\nroutinely provided to BIA documents that, in the plaintiff’s view, show BIA had “the ability to\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fobtain, use, and dispose of AES records as it saw fit.” Id. Moreover, the plaintiff points out that\n\nthe TPA allowed BIA to provide review and quality control over AES’s work. Id. at 32. Finally,\n\nthe plaintiff argues as a policy matter that to allow agencies “to avoid disclosure under FOIA by\n\nsetting limits on their access and control over documents created and held by their contractors on\n\ntheir behalf” effectively “would shield an agency from public scrutiny where the agency\n\ndelegated sensitive assignments to independent contractors yet effectively created, obtained, and\n\ncontrolled the work.” Id. (quoting Chi. Tribune 1997 WL 1137641, at *16). 8\n\n         Notwithstanding the legitimate concerns implicated by the plaintiff’s arguments, the\n\nsecond factor weighs against the plaintiff’s assertion that internal AES documents were “agency\n\nrecords.” Here, the defendants lacked the ability to use or dispose of internal AES documents as\n\nthey saw fit. See First MRWO Decl. ¶ 19–20 (asserting that BIA “cannot use the documents” or\n\n“require AES to dispose of the documents”). AES’s submission of some documents to BIA does\n\nnot show that the defendants could use or dispose of different, internal AES documents as they\n\nsaw fit. The TPA allowed BIA to provide technical direction, review, and quality control with\n\nrespect only to “the Scoping Report, EIS, technical studies, and other NEPA-related documents,”\n\nnot all internal AES documents related to the casino project. TPA Exhibit § 5.0. Likewise, the\n\nTPA allowed BIA to review “for accuracy, completeness, compliance with required standards,\n\nand responsiveness to the requirements of this agreement” only “[w]ork in progress, deliverables,\n\nand finished products,” not all internal AES documents related to the project. Id. § 7.0.\n\nMoreover, even if the defendants could have demanded access to AES’s internal documents, this\n\nwould not make such internal documents subject to FOIA. “[D]ocuments an agency had the\n\n\n\n8\n         The plaintiff’s reliance on Chicago Tribune is misplaced. In that case, the agency did not deny that it could\nuse or dispose of the contractor’s documents at issue and, in fact, directed the contractor to provide some\ninformation for the FOIA request. 1997 WL 1137641, at *14–15. The defendants here lacked such control.\n\n                                                              18\n\fright to acquire [do] not become agency records subject to FOIA ‘unless and until the right is\n\nexercised.’” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at 928 (citing Forsham v. Harris, 445 U.S. 169,\n\n181).\n\n        As to the third factor, “the extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the\n\ndocument,” id. at 927 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d at 515), the defendants assert that because they\n\nlacked direct access to AES internal records, they did “not rely upon those documents in making\n\nits decisions.” First MRWO Decl. ¶ 21. The plaintiff counters that (1) MWRO was obligated to\n\nreview AES records because BIA was contractually obligated to review AES “work in progress”\n\nand provide technical direction, and (2) the defendants necessarily relied on internal AES records\n\nbecause AES assisted the defendants in preparing the EIS, with related analyses and documents,\n\nas well as the Secretarial Determination, which cited the final EIS. Pl.’s Mem. at 33. Although\n\nBIA reviewed and relied upon certain AES documents in drafting the EIS and Secretarial\n\nDetermination, the plaintiff identifies no evidence that the defendants relied on undisclosed\n\ninternal AES documents. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the defendants did not read or\n\nrely on internal AES documents. First MRWO Decl. ¶ 17, 19, 21–22.\n\n        As to the fourth factor, “the degree to which the document was integrated into the\n\nagency’s record system or files,” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at 927 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d\n\nat 515), only documents sent to or received by the BIA—not internal AES documents—were\n\nincorporated into the BIA’s files. First MRWO Decl. ¶ 22. The defendants also note that AES\n\nand DOI had no agreement “whereby [DOI] maintains custody and control over all AES\n\ndocuments relevant to Plaintiff’s FOIA requests.” Defs.’ Reply at 10. The plaintiff believes that\n\nthe defendants had constructive or actual control over AES’s internal documents, but\n\nacknowledges not knowing whether AES records were integrated into the defendants’ record\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\fkeeping system. Pl.’s Mem. at 33. Nonetheless, in light of the defendants’ invocation of\n\nExemption 5 to withhold certain communications with AES as inter- or intra-agency records, the\n\nplaintiff contends this “confirms” that internal AES documents are agency records. Id. at 34−35.\n\nYet, whether information the defendants and AES communicated between each other are inter-\n\nor intra-agency records does not bear on whether internal information that AES did not disclose\n\nto the defendants are agency records.\n\n         For these reasons, the defendants lacked control of internal AES records at the time of the\n\nFOIA requests. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of the defendants’ search\n\non this basis fails.\n\n         B.       Documents Withheld Under Exemption 4\n\n         The plaintiff challenges the defendants’ withholding, under Exemption 4, of the\n\nfollowing six documents: (1) KlasRobinson Preliminary Report (Feb. 9, 2012) (Vaughn Index\n\nRows 28, 30, 39, 63); (2) Memorandum of Agreement (Vaughn Index Rows 27, 37); (3)\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha (Vaughn Index Rows 17, 22, 29, 38); (4) Use of\n\nFunding Data (Vaughn Index Row 14); (5) Interim Report—LaFollette School of Public Affairs\n\n(Vaughn Index Row 18); and (6) KlasRobinson Rebuttal Report (Vaughn Index Row 63). 9 Pl.’s\n\nMem. at 33. Exemption 4 exempts from disclosure “trade secrets and commercial or financial\n\ninformation obtained from a person” that is “privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).\n\nWhere withheld records do not contain trade secrets, an agency must establish that the records\n\nare “(1) commercial or financial, (2) obtained from a person, and (3) privileged or confidential”\n\nto sustain the burden of showing that Exemption 4 was properly applied. Pub. Citizen Health\n\n\n9\n        The Vaughn Index identifies the KlasRobinson Rebuttal Report as withheld under Exemption 5, see\nVaughn Index at 28, but that appears to have been a typographical error. The Vaughn Index also identifies this\ndocument only as KlasRobinson Report, but the plaintiffs describe this to be a rebuttal report, see Pl.’s Mem. at\n19−20; Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 33, a description adopted here for specificity’s sake.\n\n                                                              20\n\fResearch Grp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1983). All parties agree “that documents\n\nreceived from Menominee are ‘obtained from a person,’” Pl.’s Mem. at 8 (citing Defs.’ Mem. at\n\n11),10 and contest only whether the withheld documents (1) contain “commercial” materials and\n\nare (2) “confidential.” Id.\n\n                  1.       Whether The Withheld Documents Are “Commercial”\n\n         FOIA does not define the term “commercial” used in Exemption 4 and, thus, the D.C.\n\nCircuit has instructed that “the term[] ‘commercial’ . . . in this exemption should be given [its]\n\nordinary meaning[].” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290; see also Nat’l Ass’n\n\nof Home Builders v. Norton, 309 F.3d 26, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2002); accord Perrin v. United States,\n\n444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979) (“A fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise\n\ndefined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.”).\n\n“[I]nformation is commercial under this exemption if, in and of itself, it serves a commercial\n\nfunction or is of a commercial nature.” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders, 309 F.3d at 38 (citing Am.\n\nAirlines, Inc. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 588 F.2d 863, 870 (2d Cir. 1978)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “[R]ecords that actually reveal basic commercial operations, such as sales statistics,\n\nprofits and losses, and inventories, or relate to the income-producing aspects of a business”\n\ncontain “commercial” information. Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290. Yet,\n\n“Exemption 4 is not confined only to records that ‘reveal basic commercial operations . . . or\n\nrelate to the income-producing aspects of a business,’” Baker & Hostetler LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nCommerce, 473 F.3d 312, 319 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (emphasis is original) (quoting Pub. Citizen\n\nHealth Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1290), but “reaches more broadly and applies . . . when the\n\n\n\n\n10\n         Under 5 U.S.C. § 551(2), a “‘person’ includes an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public\nor private organization other than an agency.” Id.\n\n                                                              21\n\fprovider of the information has a commercial interest in the information submitted to the\n\nagency,” id. (citing Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders, 309 F.3d at 38–39).\n\n       The defendants have met their burden of showing that the six documents withheld under\n\nExemption 4 contain commercial or financial information. Gaming, as a general matter, is\n\n“commercial . . . by its nature,” particularly in connection with establishing a casino as a\n\n“commercial enterprise.” Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders, 309 F.3d at 39. Moreover, information\n\nrelating to this project is commercial “in its function,” as the Menominee have “a commercial\n\ninterest at stake in its disclosure.” Id. This conclusion is fully supported by the declarations\n\nsubmitted by the defendants describing the commercial or financial information contained in\n\neach of the six disputed documents. The KlasRobinson Preliminary Report contains “projected\n\nrevenues of a gaming facility,” as well as “information regarding: traffic patterns in and around\n\nthe proposed Kenosha Facility, demographic and population statistics related to persons living\n\nwithin various distances from the proposed Kenosha Facility,” which is pertinent to evaluating\n\npotential revenue streams,” and the “description of gaming facilities, projected size and phasing\n\nof the Kenosha Facility, and projected breakdown of revenue and expenses of the Kenosha\n\nFacility.” Defs.’ Opp’n. Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 2, Decl. of Joan R. Delabreau,\n\nChairperson of the Menominee Tribal Legislature ¶¶ 7–8 (“Menominee Decl.”), ECF No. 58-2.\n\nThe Memorandum of Agreement contains “information regarding the rights and liabilities of both\n\nthe Menominee Kenosha Gaming Authority and the Menominee Indian Tribe.” Id. ¶ 13. The\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha contains “information regarding detailed analysis of\n\nTribal assets and their potential for development, an analysis of how potential Kenosha Casino\n\ngaming revenue would be used, and information on long term . . . business, and economic[,]\n\ngoals of the Menominee Tribe,” id. ¶ 9, as well as “documents summarizing the Tribes’ financial\n\n\n\n                                                     22\n\fdecision” and summaries of financial documents, DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 74. The Use of Funding\n\nData contains “projected revenues of a gaming facility,” Menominee Decl. ¶ 7, as well as\n\n“documents summarizing the Tribes’ financial decision” and summaries of financial documents\n\nfound in the other withheld and redacted documents, DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 74. The Interim Report—\n\nLaFollette School of Public Affairs contains “information regarding detailed analysis of Tribal\n\nassets and their potential for development, an analysis of how potential Kenosha Casino gaming\n\nrevenue would be used, and information on long term [Menominee] business[] and economic\n\ngoals.” Menominee Decl. ¶ 9. Finally, the KlasRobinson Rebuttal Report contains “information\n\nregarding: traffic patterns in and around the proposed Kenosha Facility, demographic and\n\npopulation statistics related to persons living within various distances from the proposed\n\nKenosha Facility, description of gaming facilities, projected size and phasing of the Kenosha\n\nFacility, and projected breakdown of revenue and expenses of the Kenosha Facility.” Id. ¶ 8. 11\n\n         Notwithstanding these descriptions of the commercial or financial information contained\n\nin each of the six disputed documents, the plaintiff asserts that the withhold information in these\n\nsix documents “is not ‘commercial or financial,’ because the information relates to the\n\nMenominee’s governmental operations, and thus ‘is commercial neither by its nature (having\n\nbeen created by the government rather than in connection with a commercial enterprise) nor in\n\nits function (as there is no evidence that the parties who supplied the . . . information have a\n\ncommercial interest at stake in its disclosure).’” Pl.’s Mem. at 17−23 (citing Nat’l Ass’n of\n\nHome Builders, 309 F.3d at 39). 12 This argument is predicated on a false dichotomy. Simply\n\n\n11\n        The defendants stress the obvious context that the “[p]laintiff wants the proprietary information of a rival\ngroup – submitted at the behest of [DOI] – to better compete against that rival.” Defs.’ Reply at 5. Even if so,\n“agencies must generally release requested records without regard to the identity or motive of the requestor.”\nChiquita Brands Int’l Inc., v. S.E.C., 805 F.3d 289, 294 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n12\n        The plaintiff’s reliance on National Association of Home Builders for this proposition is misplaced. Pl.’s\nMem. at 17−18 (quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders, 309 F.3d at 39). In that case, a statute forbade sale of the\nrecords at issue, and the “quid-pro-quo exchange between governmental entities” by which the federal government\n\n                                                             23\n\fput, governmental and commercial information are not mutually exclusive categories, and,\n\naccordingly, information provided by a tribal government relating to governmental operations\n\ndoes not preclude such information from being commercial or financial. See, e.g., Flathead\n\nJoint Bd. of Control v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 309 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1220 (D. Mont. 2004)\n\n(concluding that information submitted by a tribe to BIA relating to a tribe’s water rights\n\nnegotiating position, materials supporting their water rights claims, and information that\n\nmaximizes their negotiating position was “commercial” information); Merit Energy Co. v. U.S.\n\nDep’t of Interior, 180 F. Supp. 2d 1184, 1188 (D. Colo. 2001) (concluding that information\n\nrelating to the computation of royalties assessed on production of oil and gas on a tribe’s\n\nreservation was “clearly” “commercial or financial” information).\n\n         For these reasons, the defendants have met their burden with respect to the first prong of\n\nthe test to determine whether Exemption 4 is properly applied to withhold information from the\n\nfive documents here.\n\n                  2.       Whether The Withheld Documents Are “Confidential”\n\n         To invoke Exemption 4, the defendants must show that the withheld information, in\n\naddition to being “commercial,” is “privileged” or “confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4). The\n\ndefendants contend that the withheld information is “confidential.” Defs.’ Mem. at 10−11.\n\nDifferent tests apply to voluntarily and involuntarily submitted documents in determining\n\nwhether information is “confidential.” See Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory\n\nComm’n, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992). “Commercial or financial matter” that an entity\n\n\n\n\nobtained them was not, in the D.C. Circuit’s opinion, “a commercial transaction in the ordinary sense.” 309 F.3d at\n38–39. For these reasons, the records at issue were held not to be “commercial or financial.” Id. Information on\ncasino operations and related land acquisition, business planning, and revenue predictions, in contrast, fall within the\nordinary meaning of “commercial.” See Wash. Post Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 690 F.2d 252, 266\n(D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[B]usiness information was Congress’s primary concern.”).\n\n                                                               24\n\fsubmits to the government involuntarily may be deemed “confidential” under Exemption 4 if the\n\ninformation’s disclosure is likely “(1) to impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary\n\ninformation in the future; or (2) to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the\n\nperson from whom the information was obtained.” Id. at 873 (quoting Nat’l Parks &\n\nConservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 (D.C. Cir. 1974)) (alterations omitted). By\n\ncontrast, “financial or commercial information provided to the Government on a voluntary\n\nbasis,” is “‘confidential’ for the purpose of Exemption 4” merely if the information “is of a kind\n\nthat would customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained.”\n\nId. at 879 (emphasis added). Thus, the threshold determination to be made is whether the\n\nMenominee submitted the six disputed documents voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\n       “[A]ctual legal authority, rather than parties’ beliefs or intentions, governs judicial\n\nassessments of the character of submissions” as voluntary or involuntary.” Ctr. for Auto Safety\n\nv. Nat'l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 244 F.3d 144, 149 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Although the D.C.\n\nCircuit has not formulated a test for determining whether documents were voluntarily or\n\ninvoluntarily submitted, an entity has been held to submit documents involuntarily when “any\n\nlegal authority compels its submission, including informal mandates that call for the submission\n\nof the information as a condition of doing business with the government.” Lepelletier v. FDIC,\n\n977 F. Supp. 456, 460 n.3 (D.D.C. 1997), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, & remanded on other\n\ngrounds, 164 F.3d 37 (D.C.Cir.1999). “In contrast, documents collected by a government\n\nagency merely to aid in ‘formulating effective policies’ [are] voluntarily submitted for\n\nExemption 4 purposes.” Soghoian v. Office of Mgmt. & Budget, 932 F. Supp. 2d 167, 175\n\n(D.D.C. 2013) (alterations omitted) (quoting Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nCommerce, 337 F. Supp. 2d 146, 171 (D.D.C. 2004)). A tribe’s decision to apply for a license to\n\n\n\n                                                     25\n\foperate an off-reservation casino is plainly voluntary, but then, having chosen to apply, the\n\nMenominee committed themselves to complying with all information submission requirements\n\nthat the law imposed. The documents at issue were submitted to the government as required by\n\nthe gaming application process, and so were submitted involuntarily. The defendants concede as\n\nmuch. Defs.’ Mem. at 12 (“In the instant case, the information was turned over to the\n\ngovernment as a requirement in the application process. . . . Thus, the proper standard is whether\n\nthe information would: (1) impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in\n\nthe future, or (2) cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the\n\ninformation was obtained.”). The confidentiality standard for involuntarily-submitted documents\n\nthus governs.\n\n                       a)     The Defendants’ Ability to Obtain Necessary Information\n\n       The first prong of the confidentiality standard for involuntarily-submitted information\n\nasks whether the information’s disclosure “is likely to . . . impair the Government’s ability to\n\nobtain necessary information in the future.” Critical Mass Energy Project, 975 F.2d at 873\n\n(quoting Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n, 498 F.2d at 770). The defendants argue that\n\nalthough tribes currently submit detailed financial statements to DOI as part of off-reservation\n\ngaming license applications, if information in these applications were not protected from\n\ndisclosure to rival tribes, tribal applicants would be deterred from making such detailed\n\nsubmissions and “would only submit very broad, cursory financial information, which would\n\nhinder the agency’s ability to determine the extent to which a casino would benefit the tribe.”\n\nDOI OIG Decl. ¶ 67. The plaintiff rejects this reasoning since the information was obtained\n\nthrough a mandatory submission and tribes would risk having their applications rejected by\n\nsubmitting low-quality information. Pl.’s Mem. at 10–11. Though a close call, the plaintiff has\n\nthe better argument.\n\n                                                    26\n\f       Generally, “the governmental impact inquiry . . . focus[es] on the possible effect of\n\ndisclosure on [the] quality” of information supplied. Ctr. for Auto Safety, 244 F.3d at 148\n\n(quoting Critical Mass Energy Project, 975 F.2d at 878). “When the Government obtains\n\ninformation as part of a mandatory submission, the Government’s access to the information\n\nnormally is not seriously threatened by disclosure.” Id.; see also Nat’l Parks & Conservation\n\nAss’n, 498 F.2d at 770 (“[D]isclosure of this material . . . is a mandatory condition of the\n\nconcessioners’ right to operate in national parks. Since the concessioners are required to provide\n\nthis financial information to the government, there is presumably no danger that public\n\ndisclosure will impair the ability of the Government to obtain this information in the future.”).\n\n       To be sure, a tribe applying for an off-reservation gaming license might understandably\n\nbe reluctant to submit information that the tribe knows may be disclosed publicly. Indeed, the\n\nMenominee’s Chairperson has asserted that she would recommend submitting less detailed\n\ninformation in future off-reservation gaming applications if information of the sort that the six\n\ndocuments contain is released. Menominee Decl. ¶ 6. In this case, however, regulations\n\ngoverning off-reservation gaming applications require submission of specific commercial or\n\nfinancial information, see, e.g., 25 C.F.R. §§ 151.11(c), 292.17(a), (j)(2)-(3), 292.18(g), and\n\nfailure to provide sufficiently specific, detailed, and relevant information would adversely affect\n\nany approval of a gaming application. Accordingly, the disclosure of the information in the six\n\ndocuments cannot be found to pose serious risk to the government’s ability to obtain similar\n\ninformation in the future from the Menominee or any other tribe seeking approval for off-\n\nreservation gaming. See Ctr. for Auto Safety, 244 F.3d at 148.\n\n                       b)      Likelihood of Substantial Competitive Harm\n\n       Since the defendants cannot show that disclosure of the withheld information would\n\nimpair the government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future, Exemption 4 may\n\n                                                     27\n\fonly be invoked successfully here upon a showing that disclosure likely would cause the\n\nMenominee substantial competitive harm. Id. The defendants satisfy that burden by showing\n\ndisclosure likely would substantially injure the Menominee with respect to actual competition.\n\n       Substantial competitive harm is “limited to harm flowing from the affirmative use of\n\nproprietary information by competitors,” Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp., 704 F.2d at 1291\n\nn.30 (emphasis in original), and “requires a showing of both” (1) actual competition and” (2) “a\n\nlikelihood of substantial competitive injury,” Jurewicz v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 741 F.3d 1326,\n\n1331 (D.C. Cir. 2014). “In reviewing an agency’s determination as to substantial competitive\n\nharm,” courts “recognize that ‘predictive judgements are not capable of exact proof,’” and\n\n“generally defer to the agency’s predictive judgments as to ‘the repercussions of disclosure.’”\n\nUnited Techs. Corp., 601 F.3d at 563 (quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Air\n\nForce, 375 F.3d 1182, 1191 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).\n\n       The defendants contend that disclosure of the withheld and redacted information would\n\ncause the Menominee substantial competitive harm, DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 68, a position also urged\n\nby the Menominee, Menominee Decl. ¶¶ 7–13. According to the defendants, disclosure of the\n\nwithheld information in the six documents would give gaming competitors “insight into the\n\nactual or projected financial plans” of the Menominee and allow such competitors “to use such\n\ninformation to gain an advantage in the gaming marketplace.” DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 68.\n\nAdditionally, the Menominee express a continuing interest in opening a casino in Kenosha,\n\nWisconsin, noting that the tribe has in effect a gaming compact with the State of Wisconsin\n\nauthorizing gaming pursuant to approval under the IGRA, and has even intervened as a party in\n\nForest County Potawatomi Community v. United States, 317 F.R.D. 6 (D.D.C. 2016), “to protect\n\n\n\n\n                                                    28\n\f[the tribe’s] rights related to future gaming in Kenosha, Wisconsin.” Menominee Decl. ¶¶ 14,\n\n16–17. 13\n\n        The defendants identify specific competitive concerns regarding release of the six\n\ndisputed documents. For example, release of the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report “would\n\nbenefit any Indian Tribe interested in pursuing an off-reservation casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin\n\nto the detriment of the Menominee,” id. ¶¶ 7–8, “allowing a competitor casino to identify and\n\ncompete for the key revenue sources and amounts identified in the report,” Vaughn Index at 15.\n\nProduction of the Memorandum of Agreement “would reveal the legal rights and/or legal\n\ncommitments of the parties, including information about the financial risk and responsibilities\n\nborne by each party.” Menominee Decl. ¶ 13; accord Vaughn Index at 14. Production of the\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha “would allow a competitor to identify proposed\n\nrevenue amounts from the Kenosha Casino and the businesses and governmental activities that\n\nthe [Menominee] proposes to fund with Kenosha Casino revenues,” Menominee Decl. ¶ 9, which\n\nin turn “would allow a competitor tribe to identify elements of the [t]ribe’s long-term plan and\n\nacquire key assets or revenue streams in advance of the [t]ribe’s ability to do so, thwarting the\n\n[t]ribe’s economic development and/or driving up the cost to the [t]ribe of purchasing key\n\nassets.” Vaughn Index at 7, 10, 15. Production of the Use of Funding Data “would benefit any\n\nIndian Tribe interested in pursuing an off-reservation casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin to the\n\ndetriment of the Menominee,” Menominee Decl. ¶ 7, and “cause substantial harm to the\n\ncompetitive position of the Casino and the [t]ribe,” Vaughn Index at 6. Production of the Interim\n\nReport “would allow a competitor to identify proposed revenue amounts from the Kenosha\n\n\n13\n        In Forest County Potawatomi Community, the plaintiff here seeks to reverse DOI’s disapproval of an\nagreement between the plaintiff and the State of Wisconsin that effectively would have created a fifty-mile zone of\nnoncompetition around the plaintiff’s Milwaukee gaming facility. 317 F.R.D. at 9–10. That case serves as further\nevidence of existing competition between the plaintiff and the Menominee.\n\n                                                             29\n\fCasino and the businesses and governmental activities that the [Menominee] proposes to fund\n\nwith Kenosha Casino revenues.” Menominee Decl. ¶ 9. Release of the KlasRobinson Rebuttal\n\nReport would “would benefit any Indian Tribe interested in pursuing an off-reservation casino in\n\nKenosha, Wisconsin to the detriment of the Menominee.” Id. ¶ 8. Finally, release of the\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha and Interim Report “would cause competitive harm to\n\nthe [Menominee] by placing [it] at a disadvantage in any commercial dealings with third parties\n\nnecessary to accomplish its long term goals by allowing them access to the [Menominee’s]\n\npriorities and proposed level of funding,” allow competitors “to identify elements of the\n\n[Menominee’s] long-term plan and acquire key assets or revenue streams in advance of the\n\n[Menominee’s] ability to do so, thwarting the [t]ribe’s economic development,” and “allow\n\n[t]ribes and other persons or entities in competition with the [Menominee’s] Kenosha Casino\n\nincluding the [plaintiff] to utilize the [Menominee’s] commercial and financial information\n\nrelated to its intended use of Kenosha Casino revenue to bolster public relations or government\n\nrelations efforts to oppose the Kenosha Casino development.” Id. ¶¶ 10–12.\n\n       The plaintiff points to the fact that the Governor rejected the Menominee’s application to\n\nbuild a casino in Kenosha, and argues, on this basis, that the defendants are unable to show any\n\neffect on either actual competition or a likelihood of substantial competitive harm. Pl.’s Mem. at\n\n14. Moreover, the Menominee have not renewed its option agreement to purchase the Kenosha\n\nsite for the planned casino, the property is back on the market, and the Menominee’s\n\nintergovernmental agreement for the casino with the City and County of Kenosha has expired.\n\nId. at 15. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff contends that any future competition the\n\nMenominee may face for a gaming operation in Kenosha is “highly speculative,” which “is\n\ninsufficient under Exemption 4.” Id. at 14–15 (citing Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 169 F.3d\n\n\n\n                                                    30\n\fat 19). In addition, according to the plaintiff, disclosure would not cause substantial competitive\n\nharm to the Menominee’s existing casino operations, which are located 190 miles from Kenosha,\n\nas the information at issue is largely specific to the proposed casino in Kenosha. Id. at 15. The\n\nplaintiff also asserts that production of the withheld documents would not cause the Menominee\n\nsubstantial competitive harm because the documents are several years old and that the defendants\n\nhave not explained how the information they contain is still competitively valuable, id. at 15–23,\n\nnoting, in particular, that the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report analyzed a public\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers report from 2004 and was discussed in the Secretarial Determination,\n\nid. at 18–19. These arguments are not persuasive.\n\n       The defendants have met their burden to show that the Menominee face actual\n\ncompetition with respect to gaming operations in Kenosha and that production of the withheld\n\ndocuments likely would cause them substantial competitive harm. Despite the Governor of\n\nWisconsin’s non-concurrence with DOI’s determination, the Menominee continue to seek a\n\ngaming operation in Kenosha. Menominee Decl. ¶¶ 14–17. The Menominee thus face not just\n\n“future or potential competition,” which is “legally inadequate” to justify withholding or\n\nredaction information, but “actual competition.” Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 169 F.3d at 19.\n\nThe Menominee is involved in separate litigation with the plaintiff concerning future gaming\n\noperations in Kenosha and have evidenced a “continuing commercial interest” in opening a\n\ngaming facility in Kenosha in reliance on provisions in its gaming compact with the State of\n\nWisconsin that authorize gaming in Kenosha upon acquisition of land eligible for gaming.\n\nMenominee Decl. ¶ 17.\n\n       The disputed documents’ ages, though relevant, do not alter this conclusion, given that\n\nthe Menominee continue to seek a gaming operation in Kenosha. The plaintiff cites Center for\n\n\n\n                                                    31\n\fAuto Safety v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, 133 F. Supp. 3d 109 (D.D.C. 2015), and Biles v.\n\nDepartment of Health & Human Services, 931 F. Supp. 2d 211 (D.D.C. 2013)), to argue that the\n\ninformation at issue is too old for its production to cause the Menominee substantial competitive\n\nharm. Pl.’s Mem. at 15–16. Center for Auto Safety and Biles each determined that production of\n\nfive-year old documents likely would not cause substantial competitive harm, but Center for\n\nAuto Safety’s analysis rested in meaningful part on the facts that (1) the companies involved had\n\nundergone significant bankruptcy restructuring and (2) companies in the industry rarely planned\n\nmore than five years ahead, 133 F. Supp. 3d at 134, while Biles’s analysis rested in meaningful\n\npart on the fact that the health care industry had undergone major structural reform due to the\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (“ACA”) enactment, which altered rebate\n\ncalculation, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 226. No analogous restructuring has occurred here, nor is there\n\nany indication that obtaining an off-reservation gaming license rarely entails planning more than\n\nfive years ahead. Given the Menominee’s continuing interest in a Kenosha gaming operation\n\nand the “defer[ence due] to [an] agency’s predictive judgments as to ‘the repercussions of\n\ndisclosure,’” Jurewicz, 741 F.3d at 1331 (quoting United Techs., 601 F.3d at 563), the\n\ndefendants have carried their burden to show that production of the disputed documents likely\n\nwould cause the Menominee substantial competitive harm. The defendants are therefore entitled\n\nto summary judgment, on this claim as to each of the withheld documents, except the\n\nKlasRobinson Preliminary Report.\n\n       The defendants have withheld in full the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report, even though\n\nthe Secretarial Determination partially disclosed its contents as part of the Secretarial\n\nDetermination. Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 35. “To the extent that any data requested under FOIA are in the\n\npublic domain, the submitter is unable to make any claim to confidentiality—a sine qua non of\n\n\n\n                                                     32\n\fExemption 4.” CNA Fin. Corp. v. Donovan, 830 F.2d 1132, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see also\n\nWorthington Compressors, Inc. v. Costle, 662 F.2d 45, 51 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“If the information\n\nis freely or cheaply available from other sources . . . it can hardly be called confidential and\n\nagency disclosure is unlikely to cause competitive harm to the submitter.”). Thus, the defendants\n\nhave not carried their burden to show that production of any part of the report would cause the\n\nMenominee substantial competitive harm. The defendants must release all reasonably\n\nsegregable information that the Secretarial Determination already makes publicly available, and\n\nso are not entitled to summary judgment as to this particular document withheld in full.\n\n       C.      Segregability\n\n       The plaintiff argues that the defendants have not released all segregable information from\n\nthree documents: (1) the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report (Vaughn Index Rows 28, 30, 39), (2)\n\nthe Memorandum of Agreement (Vaughn Index Rows 27, 37); and (3) the Draft Memo re:\n\nRecommendation of Menominee Indian Tribe’s Off Reservation Trust Application (Nov. 5, 2012)\n\n(Vaughn Index Row 70). Pl.’s Mem. at 24–25. According to the plaintiff, “[a]t a minimum,\n\n[d]efendants should release the cover pages or headings of these documents, which would likely\n\nindicate information such as the sender, recipient, date, and title of the documents.” Id.\n\n        “FOIA requires that ‘any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to\n\nany person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.’” Morley,\n\n508 F.3d at 1123 (alteration omitted) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)). To satisfy its segregability\n\nobligation, “[an] agency must provide a ‘detailed justification’ for . . . non-segregability,” but “is\n\nnot required to provide so much detail that the exempt material would be effectively disclosed.”\n\nJohnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Att’ys, 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citing Mead Data\n\nCtr., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). An agency may\n\n\n\n                                                      33\n\fprovide sufficient justification by describing the materials withheld, the exemption under which\n\nthey were withheld, and an affidavit attesting that “it released all segregable material.” Loving v.\n\nDep’t of Defense, 550 F.3d 32, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (holding that “the description of the\n\ndocument set forth in the Vaughn index and the agency’s declaration that it released all\n\nsegregable material” are “sufficient for [the segregability] determination”); Johnson, 310 F.3d at\n\n776.\n\n       The defendants assert that “BIA has performed adequate and reasonable searches for\n\nresponsive records; has processed all such records and released all reasonably segregable non-\n\nexempt information from documents responsive to plaintiff’s . . . requests that are subject to\n\nFOIA; and has properly denied access to records and information pursuant to FOIA Exemptions\n\n3, 4, 5, and 6.” Defs.’ Mem. at 21. They also assert that any release of non-exempt information\n\nin the Draft Memo would also reveal information covered under Exemption 5 which is not\n\nchallenged, and that the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report “could not be redacted with any\n\ninformation provided without revealing the substance of the information withheld properly.”\n\nDefs.’ Reply at 7; see Vaughn Index at 32. Finally, they assert that the plaintiff’s claim is moot\n\nwith respect to the Memorandum of Agreement because they released a redaction version of the\n\ndocument on July 29, 2015. Defs.’ Reply at 7.\n\n       The defendants have met their burden of showing that they have released all segregable\n\ninformation from the Draft Memo and Memorandum of Agreement. The Vaughn Index entry for\n\nthe Draft Memo asserts that the document cannot be redacted without revealing exempt\n\ninformation, Vaughn Index at 32, which suffices to show that the defendants met their burden to\n\n“provide a ‘detailed justification’ for . . . non-segregability.” Johnson, 310 F.3d at 776 (citing\n\nMead Data Ctr., 566 F.2d at 261). The defendants thus are entitled to summary judgment and\n\n\n\n                                                     34\n\fthe plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff’s segregability claim as to those\n\ndocuments. The defendants have also produced the Memorandum of Agreement in redacted\n\nform. Vaughn Index at 14; Memorandum of Agreement, ECF No. 60-3. The plaintiff correctly\n\nnotes that the Memorandum of Agreement is entirely redacted, Pl.’s Reply at 15, but does not\n\nshow that any withheld portion of the document was segregable, and the defendants’ assertion\n\nthat it has released a redacted version of the document, Defs.’ Reply at 7, must be understood to\n\nimplicitly assert that further segregation of disclosable material is not possible. Accordingly, the\n\ndefendants are entitled to summary judgment as to the Memorandum of Agreement as well.\n\n       Despite their assertion to the contrary, the defendants identify no attestation they have\n\nmade, in any declaration or in the Vaughn Index, that they have “released all segregable\n\nmaterial” from the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report. Loving, 550 F.3d at 41. As discussed,\n\nsupra, the Secretarial Determination partially disclosed this document’s contents. Given the\n\ndefendants’ obligation to release any information reasonably segregable from the KlasRobinson\n\nPreliminary Report, they are not entitled to summary judgment as to this document and are\n\ndirected to either produce the document in a less redacted form or clarify their Vaughn Index’s\n\ndeficiencies with respect to this document.\n\n       D.      Pattern or Practice of Violating FOIA\n\n       Finally, the plaintiff argues that the defendants have engaged in a “pattern and practice”\n\nof violating FOIA, for which it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Pl.’s Mem. at 35. The\n\ndefendants assert that the “[p]laintiff has not (and cannot) show some general policy or practice\n\nwhereby [d]efendants have affirmatively elected to not process FOIA requests . . . that would\n\nrequire extraordinary relief.” Defs.’ Reply at 13.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     35\n\f       FOIA requires agencies to “determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and\n\nlegal public holidays) after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request\n\nand [to] immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the\n\nreasons therefor.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). This deadline may be extended in accordance\n\nwith FOIA. See, e.g., id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i), (ii). Even when a requester has “obtained relief as to\n\na specific request under the FOIA,” the requester may raise a “claim that an agency policy or\n\npractice will impair [its] lawful access to information in the future.” Payne Enters., Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 837 F.2d 486, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988). A district court may “order relief beyond the\n\nsimple release of extant records,” including “a prospective injunction with an affirmative duty to\n\ndisclose,” Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 846 F.3d\n\n1235, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2017), where “an agency’s refusal to supply information evidences a\n\npolicy or practice of delayed disclosure or some other failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA,\n\nand not merely isolated mistakes by agency officials,” Payne Enters., Inc., 837 F.2d at 491.\n\n       The plaintiff asserts that the defendants’ delays evidence a policy or practice of FOIA\n\nnoncompliance. Pl.’s Mem. at 35. Specifically, it asserts that the defendants failed to make\n\ntimely determinations for eight of its ten FOIA requests, identify “the date on which a\n\ndetermination is expected to be dispatched,” or offer the plaintiff an opportunity to narrow the\n\nscope of its claims or access to a FOIA Public Liaison to aid its requests. Id. at 37–39 (citing 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i), (ii)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff also asserts that\n\nthe defendants also failed to make records “promptly available,” identifying long delays in the\n\ndefendants’ response to its FOIA requests. Id. at 41–43 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A); Citizens\n\nfor Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC, 711 F.3d 180, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). Further, the\n\nplaintiff asserts that the defendants failed to make appeal determinations within twenty days, and\n\n\n\n                                                     36\n\feven failed to acknowledge or make any appeal determination at all for eight of the ten appeals.\n\nId. at 35, 39. Finally, the plaintiff criticizes the defendants for “repeatedly spen[ding] time\n\nproviding old documents that had been re-submitted by [the] Menominee, notwithstanding . . .\n\nrepeated requests that they focus on more recent information.” Id. at 43.\n\n       Although the defendants missed many FOIA deadlines and in some cases failed to act\n\naltogether, the plaintiff must show that the defendants’ delays were not due “merely [to] isolated\n\nmistakes by agency officials” to establish a FOIA policy or practice claim. Payne Enters., Inc.,\n\n837 F.2d at 491. Significant personnel turnover occurred in late 2012, when many of the FOIA\n\nresponses at issue were due, and the defendants could not begin searching for responsive\n\ndocuments until March 2013. DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 45. While searching for and reviewing\n\nresponsive documents “as time allowed,” OIG also was processing the Menominee’s gaming\n\napplication, “7 other . . . applications for gaming, 47 class III tribal state gaming compacts, 2\n\nSecretarial Procedures, and 41 Revenue Allocation Plans.” Id. ¶ 46.\n\n       The plaintiff’s complaint that the defendants did not release requested materials until late\n\nJuly 2012, in response to FOIA Request No. 2 made in early June 2012, Pl.’s Mem. at 41−42,\n\nseems almost frivolous since this delay is brief, this request’s scope was broad, and the\n\ndefendants gave multiple partial responses throughout June and July. Plaintiff Decl. ¶¶ 40–41;\n\nPl.’s SUMF ¶ 55. The plaintiff asserts that it did not receive final responses as to FOIA Requests\n\nNo. 4, 6, and 9 until July 2015, but concedes that it received partial responses in February and\n\nDecember of 2014. Pl.’s Mem. at 42 n.13. Though this delay was more significant, the\n\ndefendants requested that the plaintiff narrow the scope of these requests, which sought “‘any\n\nand all documentation and communication’ over a five year period of time,” as they were “overly\n\nburdensome and vague,” and would require searching 47 storage boxes over a period of years.\n\n\n\n                                                     37\n\fPlaintiff Decl. ¶¶ 71–72; DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 31. The plaintiff also complains that the defendants\n\nrepeatedly produced “old documents that had been resubmitted by [the Tribe],” even though the\n\nplaintiff had asked that the government focus on more recent information. Pl.’s Mem. at 43. To\n\nthe extent, however, that the plaintiff requested documents that were duplicates of earlier\n\nsubmitted documents, so long as those documents were resubmitted after September 9, 2009, the\n\ndefendants fulfilled their FOIA obligations. Plaintiff Decl. ¶ 13. In any event, the plaintiff fails\n\nto show that the defendants’ production of duplicative documents amounted to a “policy or\n\npractice” of FOIA noncompliance. Payne Enters., Inc., 837 F.2d at 491. Finally, the plaintiff\n\ncomplains that it “specifically and repeatedly requested OIG’s October 17, 2011 letter to [the]\n\nMenominee,” but that the defendants did not produce this letter until June 17, 2015, over three\n\nyears after the plaintiff had initially requested it. Pl.’s Mem. at 43; Pl.’s SUMF ¶¶ 9, 54. An\n\nagency’s delay in complying with this request for this specific document, however, simply does\n\nnot rise to the level of establishing a pattern and practice by the defendant agencies of refusing to\n\ncomply with their FOIA obligations, especially in light of the tremendous volume of responsive\n\nrecords disclosed to the plaintiff here. Cf. Payne Enters., Inc., 837 F.2d at 494 (allowing pattern\n\nand practice claim where agency simply refused to release of responsive records where no FOIA\n\nexemption applied).\n\n       Given this background and close examination of the plaintiff’s specific complaints about\n\ndelays in the defendants’ responses, the plaintiff has failed to establish a policy or practice of\n\nFOIA noncompliance and, accordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment and the\n\nplaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment as to this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      38\n\fIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is denied as to the plaintiff’s claims for\n\n(1) an additional search for the KlasRobinson Final Report and Corn Letter, and (2) production\n\nof all segregable portions of the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report, and otherwise granted in full.\n\nThe plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is denied in full.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n       Date: September 30, 2017\n\n\n\n                                                    __________________________\n                                                    BERYL A.

Pl.’s Statement of Undisputed\n\nMaterial Facts & Resps. to Defs.’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“Pl.’s SUMF”) ¶¶ 19,\n\n37–118, ECF No. 49-2. The FOIA requests were submitted to three components of the U.S.\n\nDepartment of the Interior (“DOI”)—the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ (“BIA”) Central Office\n\n(“BIA-Central”) and Midwest Regional Office (“MWRO”), and Office of Indian Gaming\n\n(“OIG”). Id. 1 The gaming application died, but the FOIA requests live on. In response to the\n\nplaintiff’s requests, DOI released over 22,954 pages of information. Id. ¶ 139. Dissatisfied, the\n\n\n\n1\n          The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”); BIA’s Office of\nIndian Gaming; BIA’s Central Office; Sally Jewel, Secretary of the Interior, in her official capacity; Kevin\nWashburn, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, in his official capacity; Paula Hart, Director, Office of Indian\nGaming, in her official capacity; and Diane Rosen, Regional Director for the Midwest Region Bureau of Indian\nAffairs, in her official capacity. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), federal employees named in\ntheir official capacities are automatically substituted.

The defendants’ motion is granted\n\nin part and denied in part, and the plaintiff’s motion is denied.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         Contextual background for the FOIA requests at issue is helpful in understanding the\n\nscope and timing of the requests, and the agencies’ rationale for the searches conducted and\n\nwithholdings. Consequently, the statutory framework for, and participation in, commercial\n\ngaming activities of both the plaintiff and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin\n\n(“Menominee”) are briefly reviewed before turning to the legal challenges to the defendants’\n\nresponses to plaintiff’s FOIA requests.\n\n         A.       Overview of Statutory Framework Governing Indian Gaming\n\n         The records sought in this action concern the Menominee’s application to engage in\n\ngaming operations on land approximately 35 miles from the plaintiff’s gaming facility in\n\nWisconsin. 2 Under the Indian Reorganization Act (“IRA”), the Secretary of DOI “is authorized,\n\nin his discretion, to acquire . . . any interest in lands, water rights, or surface rights to lands . . .\n\nfor the purpose of providing land for Indians.” 25 U.S.C. § 5108; see also Citizens Exposing\n\nTruth About Casinos v. Kempthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187000\"><a href=\"/opinion/187000/citizens-exposing-truth-about-casinos-v-kempthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[T]he Secretary may\n\nacquire lands for the purpose of providing land for Native Americans.”). The IRA further\n\n\n\n\n2\n         The land the Menominee sought to acquire, known as the Dairyland Greyhound Park, is located in\nKenosha, Wisconsin, Pl.’s SUMF ¶¶ 2, 8, approximately 35 miles from Milwaukee, where the plaintiff operates a\ngaming facility, id. ¶ 15. The distance between the two locations is judicially noticed, as “not subject to reasonable\ndispute because” this distance “can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot\nreasonably be questioned.” FED. R. EVID. 201(b).\n\n                                                              2\n\fspecifies that “[t]itle to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be taken in the\n\nname of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is\n\nacquired.” 25 U.S.C. § 5108. Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (“IGRA”), “gaming\n\nregulated by [the IGRA] shall not be conducted on lands acquired by the Secretary in trust for\n\nthe benefit of an Indian tribe after October 17, 1988.” 25 U.S.C. § 2719(a). Notwithstanding\n\nthis provision, a tribe may conduct gaming on trust land acquired after 1988 when, as relevant\n\nhere, the Secretary determines after a consultation process that “a gaming establishment on\n\nnewly acquired lands” both (1) “would be in the best interest of the Indian tribe and its\n\nmembers” and (2) “would not be detrimental to the surrounding community.” Id. §\n\n2719(b)(1)(A). This exception may be granted “only if the Governor of the State in which the\n\ngaming activity is to be conducted concurs in the Secretary’s determination.” Id.\n\n        In practice, the Secretary makes this two-part determination after a tribe submits an\n\napplication for a gaming exemption to the applicable BIA Regional Office, which develops and\n\nsends a recommendation to OIG. Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 2. OIG then conducts its own review and\n\nprepares a draft two-part determination for consideration and final decision by the Assistant\n\nSecretary for Indian Affairs. Id.\n\n        B.      The Menominee’s Gaming Application\n\n        In 2004, the Menominee “filed an off-reservation gaming acquisition application with\n\n[MWRO] requesting that the Secretary acquire in trust approximately 228 acres of land” in\n\nKenosha, Wisconsin for gaming purposes. Id. ¶¶ 8, 15. “The site of the proposed casino is\n\nlocated approximately 190 miles from the Menominee’s gaming facility in Northern Wisconsin,”\n\nand the “Menominee’s existing gaming facility is located approximately 160 miles north of the\n\n[plaintiff’s] casino in Milwaukee, [Wisconsin].” Id. ¶ 26. MWRO entered into a three-party\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n\fagreement (“TPA”) with a third party contractor, Analytical Environmental Services (“AES”),\n\nand the Menominee to undertake preparation of Environmental Impact Statements (“EISs”)\n\nrequired by the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq., as part\n\nof the Menominee’s gaming application. Decl. of Scott Doig (“First MWRO Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 9, 11,\n\n16, ECF No. 45-1. AES was responsible “only for the delivery of draft and final EIS\n\ndocuments.” Id. ¶ 16.\n\n       The Secretary denied the Menominee’s application to acquire the land in trust on January\n\n7, 2009. Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 29. Thereafter, the Menominee sued DOI challenging the denial, which\n\nlawsuit was resolved in 2011 with an agreement that DOI would withdraw its denial letter and\n\nreconsider the Menominee’s application. Id.\n\n       Following further review, DOI conveyed to the Governor of Wisconsin, on August 23,\n\n2013, a Secretarial Determination, ECF No. 49-25, that gaming at the Kenosha location would be\n\nin the Menominee’s best interest and not detrimental to the surrounding community. See id. ¶\n\n14. On January 23, 2015, the Governor conveyed to the Secretary his non-concurrence with\n\nDOI’s determination, prompting DOI to recognize formally, on June 1, 2015, that the Kenosha\n\nsite could not be acquired in trust. Id. ¶ 124.\n\n       C.      The Plaintiff’s FOIA Requests\n\n       As this process unfolded, the plaintiff filed ten FOIA requests for documents concerning\n\nthe Menominee’s gaming application with BIA-Central, MWRO, and OIG. Pl.’s SUMF ¶¶ 37–\n\n118.

DISCUSSION\n\n       The plaintiff challenges the sufficiency of the defendants’ responses to the ten FOIA\n\nrequests at issue, raising issues as to the adequacy of the search, explanations for withholdings,\n\nand delays in responding. Specifically, whether the defendants conducted an adequate search\n\nturns on whether (1) their failure to search records held by AES was improper and (2) their\n\nsearch’s failure to turn up two documents the plaintiff knew to exist means it necessarily was\n\ninadequate. These issues are addressed first, before turning to whether the defendants (3)\n\nimproperly withheld or redacted five documents under Exemption 4, (4) failed to disclose all\n\n\n\n\n                                                      9\n\freasonably segregable portions of three documents that they withheld in full, and (5) engaged in\n\na policy or practice of violating FOIA.\n\n        A.       The Adequacy of DOI’s Search\n\n        The plaintiff complains that the defendants’ search was inadequate because the search (1)\n\nfailed to locate two documents the plaintiff knew to exist because the documents were attached\n\nto the Secretarial Determination, and (2) did not include documents held by defendants’\n\ncontractor AES. See Pl.’s Reply at 11−14, 17−19. These issues are addressed following review\n\nof the applicable legal standard. For the reasons that follow, the defendants have met their\n\nburden to show that the search was adequate as to the AES records, but they must either perform\n\nan additional search for responsive documents or provide a supplemental Vaughn Index or\n\ndeclaration explaining the withholdings of the two documents attached to the Secretarial\n\nDetermination.\n\n                 1.       Failure to Locate Documents\n\n        The plaintiff asserts that the defendants’ search was unreasonable or inadequate because\n\nthe defendants did not produce or identify in response to FOIA Requests Nos. 6, 9, and 10, two\n\ndocuments attached to the Secretarial Decision, namely: the KlasRobinson Final Report (Feb.\n\n12, 2012) and a letter, dated June 19, 2013, from Craig Corn, Chairman, Menominee Indian\n\nTribe of Wisconsin, to Troy Woodward, Office of Indian Gaming, with supporting exhibits\n\n(“Corn Letter”). 5 See Pl.’s Mem. at 23−24; Pl.’s Reply, at 13 & n.12; Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 117.\n\n\n\n5\n         The plaintiff initially challenged the defendants’ withholding of three other documents attached to the\nSecretarial Determination as well, but has since acknowledged that only the KlasRobinson Final Report and Corn\nLetter remain at issue. Pl.’s Reply at 13 & n.12. The plaintiff acknowledges that the defendants might have\nproduced these documents in entirely redacted form, although “it is impossible to know due to the complete\nredaction of documents and due to Defendant’s failure to update their Vaughn Index to identify the documents\nwithheld and the grounds for withholding.” Id. at 13 n.13. In any event, the plaintiff waives any challenge to the\nredactions on these three documents, id. at 12–13 & n.11, and, thus, the defendants are entitled to summary\njudgment as to those documents.\n\n                                                             10\n\fAccording to the plaintiff, these documents were “specifically requested” in Request No. 10,\n\nwhich sought “[a]ll records listed in the . . . Attachment List to the [Secretarial] Determination,”\n\nPl.’s Reply at 14 (emphasis in original); Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 117, and, consequently, the defendants\n\nshould be required “to perform an additional search to locate and disclose these missing\n\nrecords,” and to produce both documents and/or identify withholdings in their Vaughn Index,\n\nPl.’s Mem. at 24; Pl.’s Reply at 13−14.\n\n        The defendants assert the “well-settled” principle that “the identification of potentially\n\nresponsive documents that were not identified in response to a request is not proof of an\n\nunreasonable or inadequate search.” Def.’s Opp’n Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. & Reply Supp.\n\nDef.’s Mot. Summ J. (“Defs.’ Reply”) at 8, ECF No. 59 (citing DiBacco, 795 F.3d at 191−92;\n\nSafeCard Services, Inc. v. SEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556586\"><a href=\"/opinion/556586/safecard-services-inc-v-securities-and-exchange-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). Further, the defendants\n\npoint out that the “documents Plaintiff [seeks] . . . were produced to Plaintiff in response to yet\n\nanother FOIA request,” one of the ten at issue, and that the plaintiff’s request for an additional\n\nsearch to produce these documents thus is moot. Id. at 9. 6 In other words, the defendants do not\n\ndispute that the records are responsive and are non-exempt from disclosure. The defendants cite\n\nto nothing in the record, however, showing that these two documents were produced, and the\n\nplaintiff denies that the KlasRobinson Final Report and the Corn Letter were either produced or\n\nidentified as withheld. Pl.’s Reply at 12−13 & n.12.\n\n         This dispute raises a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the defendants’\n\nsearch, requiring denial of both the defendants and plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe defendants’ suggestion that this issue is “moot” is predicated on their assumption that the\n\n\n6\n         In addition, the defendants argued that most of the documents attached to the Secretarial Determination\n“were not part of the search parameters” because they “post-date the FOIA requests at issue.” Defs.’ Reply at 9.\nThis argument fails because the plaintiff’s Reply focuses on Request No. 10, which was submitted after the\nSecretarial Determination issued.

As support,\n\nthe plaintiff notes that under the TPA, “AES agree[d] to act as the project manager on behalf of\n\nthe BIA,” and BIA served as “Lead Agency,” Pl.’s Mem. at 28 (quoting Plaintiff Decl., Ex. M\n\n(“TPA Exhibit”) § 5.0, ECF No. 49-16 (emphasis added)), and, further, that “[DOI] regulations\n\nand Council on Environmental Quality (‘CEQ’) regulations[] both required BIA to retain\n\nultimate responsibility for the preparation of environmental documents and independently\n\nevaluate such documents,” id. at 28−29 (citing; 40 C.F.R. § 1506.5(a), (c); 43 C.F.R. § 46.105).\n\nAs such, the plaintiff argues, AES created the internal records the plaintiff seeks “on behalf of”\n\nthe defendants and under their “extensive supervision and control.” Id.\n\n       The plaintiff’s points are well taken. AES “acted on [BIA’s] behalf” in serving as project\n\nmanager, TPA Exhibit § 5.0, meaning that any internal documents created by AES in the course\n\nof serving as project manager were made on BIA’s behalf as well. BIA thus exercised\n\n“extensive supervision and control” over AES’s “collection and analysis of the data.” Burka, 87\n\nF.3d at 515. As such, the defendants “created or obtained” AES’s internal records for purposes\n\nof FOIA’s disclosure rules even though these records “were neither created by agency\n\nemployees, nor [we]re they currently located on agency property.” Id. That the defendants did\n\nnot understand AES’s internal records to be agency records, see Second MWRO Decl. ¶ 117, is\n\nimmaterial—the objective nature of an agency-third party relationship, not the agency’s\n\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fsubjective understanding of a document’s status, controls whether an agency “created or\n\nobtained” the document.

The plaintiff argues that three of the four factors weigh in favor of finding that\n\nBIA has “control” over the internal AES records. Pl.’s Reply at 17.\n\n       The first factor, “the intent of the document’s creator to retain or relinquish control over\n\nthe records,” weighs in a requester’s favor when a third-party firm transfers documents to an\n\nagency “with full knowledge that the agency might use them.” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at\n\n926–27 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d at 515). BIA explains that neither BIA nor AES “intended for\n\n\n                                                     16\n\finternal AES documentation to be provided to BIA as part of the contract,” but rather, intended\n\nonly for AES to turn over to BIA “actual deliverables – namely, draft and final EIS documents.”\n\nFirst MRWO Decl. ¶ 17. The plaintiff asserts that BIA “ordered the creation of” the EIS\n\ndocuments as “Lead Agency” and “necessarily retained ultimate responsibility and control over\n\nthese documents.” Pl.’s Mem. at 30–31 (citing Burka, 87 F.3d at 515). Although AES knew\n\nBIA might use the particular deliverables AES agreed to provide BIA, the record does not show\n\nthat AES intended to provide BIA other internal documents. In fact, BIA and AES did not\n\nexpect BIA to obtain access to or control over internal AES documents. First MRWO Decl. ¶\n\n17. BIA sought only the EIS and related documents, and MWRO produced those documents in\n\nresponse to the plaintiff’s FOIA requests. Id. ¶ 22. The first factor thus weighs in the\n\ndefendants’ favor.\n\n       As to the second factor, “the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it\n\nsees fit,” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at 926–27 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d at 515), BIA explains\n\nthat “MWRO has no direct access to AES’[s] internal documents (aside from those transmitted to\n\n[MWRO])” and thus “MWRO cannot use the documents, nor can MWRO require AES to\n\ndispose of the documents.” First MRWO Decl. ¶ 20. The plaintiff argues that MWRO had\n\nimplicit access to internal AES pursuant to the TPA, which “provided that AES would provide\n\n‘technical direction, review, and quality control for the preparation of the Scoping Report, EIS,\n\ntechnical studies, and other NEPA-related documents,’” and that BIA would review “‘[w]ork in\n\nprogress, deliverables, and finished products . . . for accuracy, completeness, compliance with\n\nrequired standards, and responsiveness to the requirements of this agreement.’” Pl.’s Mem. at 31\n\n(quoting TPA Exhibit §§ 5.0, 7.0) (alteration in original). The plaintiff observes that AES\n\nroutinely provided to BIA documents that, in the plaintiff’s view, show BIA had “the ability to\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fobtain, use, and dispose of AES records as it saw fit.” Id. Moreover, the plaintiff points out that\n\nthe TPA allowed BIA to provide review and quality control over AES’s work. Id. at 32. Finally,\n\nthe plaintiff argues as a policy matter that to allow agencies “to avoid disclosure under FOIA by\n\nsetting limits on their access and control over documents created and held by their contractors on\n\ntheir behalf” effectively “would shield an agency from public scrutiny where the agency\n\ndelegated sensitive assignments to independent contractors yet effectively created, obtained, and\n\ncontrolled the work.” Id. (quoting Chi. Tribune </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1137641</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16). 8\n\n         Notwithstanding the legitimate concerns implicated by the plaintiff’s arguments, the\n\nsecond factor weighs against the plaintiff’s assertion that internal AES documents were “agency\n\nrecords.” Here, the defendants lacked the ability to use or dispose of internal AES documents as\n\nthey saw fit. See First MRWO Decl. ¶ 19–20 (asserting that BIA “cannot use the documents” or\n\n“require AES to dispose of the documents”). AES’s submission of some documents to BIA does\n\nnot show that the defendants could use or dispose of different, internal AES documents as they\n\nsaw fit. The TPA allowed BIA to provide technical direction, review, and quality control with\n\nrespect only to “the Scoping Report, EIS, technical studies, and other NEPA-related documents,”\n\nnot all internal AES documents related to the casino project. TPA Exhibit § 5.0. Likewise, the\n\nTPA allowed BIA to review “for accuracy, completeness, compliance with required standards,\n\nand responsiveness to the requirements of this agreement” only “[w]ork in progress, deliverables,\n\nand finished products,” not all internal AES documents related to the project. Id. § 7.0.\n\nMoreover, even if the defendants could have demanded access to AES’s internal documents, this\n\nwould not make such internal documents subject to FOIA. “[D]ocuments an agency had the\n\n\n\n8\n         The plaintiff’s reliance on Chicago Tribune is misplaced. In that case, the agency did not deny that it could\nuse or dispose of the contractor’s documents at issue and, in fact, directed the contractor to provide some\ninformation for the FOIA request. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1137641</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14–15.

The plaintiff counters that (1) MWRO was obligated to\n\nreview AES records because BIA was contractually obligated to review AES “work in progress”\n\nand provide technical direction, and (2) the defendants necessarily relied on internal AES records\n\nbecause AES assisted the defendants in preparing the EIS, with related analyses and documents,\n\nas well as the Secretarial Determination, which cited the final EIS. Pl.’s Mem. at 33. Although\n\nBIA reviewed and relied upon certain AES documents in drafting the EIS and Secretarial\n\nDetermination, the plaintiff identifies no evidence that the defendants relied on undisclosed\n\ninternal AES documents. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the defendants did not read or\n\nrely on internal AES documents. First MRWO Decl. ¶ 17, 19, 21–22.\n\n        As to the fourth factor, “the degree to which the document was integrated into the\n\nagency’s record system or files,” Judicial Watch, Inc., 646 F.3d at 927 (quoting Burka, 87 F.3d\n\nat 515), only documents sent to or received by the BIA—not internal AES documents—were\n\nincorporated into the BIA’s files. First MRWO Decl. ¶ 22. The defendants also note that AES\n\nand DOI had no agreement “whereby [DOI] maintains custody and control over all AES\n\ndocuments relevant to Plaintiff’s FOIA requests.” Defs.’ Reply at 10. The plaintiff believes that\n\nthe defendants had constructive or actual control over AES’s internal documents, but\n\nacknowledges not knowing whether AES records were integrated into the defendants’ record\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\fkeeping system. Pl.’s Mem. at 33. Nonetheless, in light of the defendants’ invocation of\n\nExemption 5 to withhold certain communications with AES as inter- or intra-agency records, the\n\nplaintiff contends this “confirms” that internal AES documents are agency records. Id. at 34−35.\n\nYet, whether information the defendants and AES communicated between each other are inter-\n\nor intra-agency records does not bear on whether internal information that AES did not disclose\n\nto the defendants are agency records.\n\n         For these reasons, the defendants lacked control of internal AES records at the time of the\n\nFOIA requests. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s challenge to the adequacy of the defendants’ search\n\non this basis fails.\n\n         B.       Documents Withheld Under Exemption 4\n\n         The plaintiff challenges the defendants’ withholding, under Exemption 4, of the\n\nfollowing six documents: (1) KlasRobinson Preliminary Report (Feb. 9, 2012) (Vaughn Index\n\nRows 28, 30, 39, 63); (2) Memorandum of Agreement (Vaughn Index Rows 27, 37); (3)\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha (Vaughn Index Rows 17, 22, 29, 38); (4) Use of\n\nFunding Data (Vaughn Index Row 14); (5) Interim Report—LaFollette School of Public Affairs\n\n(Vaughn Index Row 18); and (6) KlasRobinson Rebuttal Report (Vaughn Index Row 63). 9 Pl.’s\n\nMem. at 33. Exemption 4 exempts from disclosure “trade secrets and commercial or financial\n\ninformation obtained from a person” that is “privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).\n\nWhere withheld records do not contain trade secrets, an agency must establish that the records\n\nare “(1) commercial or financial, (2) obtained from a person, and (3) privileged or confidential”\n\nto sustain the burden of showing that Exemption 4 was properly applied. Pub. Citizen Health\n\n\n9\n        The Vaughn Index identifies the KlasRobinson Rebuttal Report as withheld under Exemption 5, see\nVaughn Index at 28, but that appears to have been a typographical error. The Vaughn Index also identifies this\ndocument only as KlasRobinson Report, but the plaintiffs describe this to be a rebuttal report, see Pl.’s Mem. at\n19−20; Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 33, a description adopted here for specificity’s sake.\n\n                                                              20\n\fResearch Grp. v.

Thus, the proper standard is whether\n\nthe information would: (1) impair the Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in\n\nthe future, or (2) cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the\n\ninformation was obtained.”). The confidentiality standard for involuntarily-submitted documents\n\nthus governs.\n\n                       a)     The Defendants’ Ability to Obtain Necessary Information\n\n       The first prong of the confidentiality standard for involuntarily-submitted information\n\nasks whether the information’s disclosure “is likely to . . . impair the Government’s ability to\n\nobtain necessary information in the future.” Critical Mass Energy Project, 975 F.2d at 873\n\n(quoting Nat’l Parks & Conservation Ass’n, 498 F.2d at 770). The defendants argue that\n\nalthough tribes currently submit detailed financial statements to DOI as part of off-reservation\n\ngaming license applications, if information in these applications were not protected from\n\ndisclosure to rival tribes, tribal applicants would be deterred from making such detailed\n\nsubmissions and “would only submit very broad, cursory financial information, which would\n\nhinder the agency’s ability to determine the extent to which a casino would benefit the tribe.”\n\nDOI OIG Decl. ¶ 67. The plaintiff rejects this reasoning since the information was obtained\n\nthrough a mandatory submission and tribes would risk having their applications rejected by\n\nsubmitting low-quality information. Pl.’s Mem. at 10–11. Though a close call, the plaintiff has\n\nthe better argument.\n\n                                                    26\n\f       Generally, “the governmental impact inquiry . . . focus[es] on the possible effect of\n\ndisclosure on [the] quality” of information supplied.

Since the concessioners are required to provide\n\nthis financial information to the government, there is presumably no danger that public\n\ndisclosure will impair the ability of the Government to obtain this information in the future.”).\n\n       To be sure, a tribe applying for an off-reservation gaming license might understandably\n\nbe reluctant to submit information that the tribe knows may be disclosed publicly. Indeed, the\n\nMenominee’s Chairperson has asserted that she would recommend submitting less detailed\n\ninformation in future off-reservation gaming applications if information of the sort that the six\n\ndocuments contain is released. Menominee Decl. ¶ 6. In this case, however, regulations\n\ngoverning off-reservation gaming applications require submission of specific commercial or\n\nfinancial information, see, e.g., 25 C.F.R. §§ 151.11(c), 292.17(a), (j)(2)-(3), 292.18(g), and\n\nfailure to provide sufficiently specific, detailed, and relevant information would adversely affect\n\nany approval of a gaming application. Accordingly, the disclosure of the information in the six\n\ndocuments cannot be found to pose serious risk to the government’s ability to obtain similar\n\ninformation in the future from the Menominee or any other tribe seeking approval for off-\n\nreservation gaming. See Ctr. for Auto Safety, 244 F.3d at 148.\n\n                       b)      Likelihood of Substantial Competitive Harm\n\n       Since the defendants cannot show that disclosure of the withheld information would\n\nimpair the government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future, Exemption 4 may\n\n                                                     27\n\fonly be invoked successfully here upon a showing that disclosure likely would cause the\n\nMenominee substantial competitive harm. Id. The defendants satisfy that burden by showing\n\ndisclosure likely would substantially injure the Menominee with respect to actual competition.\n\n       Substantial competitive harm is “limited to harm flowing from the affirmative use of\n\nproprietary information by competitors,” Pub.

For example, release of the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report “would\n\nbenefit any Indian Tribe interested in pursuing an off-reservation casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin\n\nto the detriment of the Menominee,” id. ¶¶ 7–8, “allowing a competitor casino to identify and\n\ncompete for the key revenue sources and amounts identified in the report,” Vaughn Index at 15.\n\nProduction of the Memorandum of Agreement “would reveal the legal rights and/or legal\n\ncommitments of the parties, including information about the financial risk and responsibilities\n\nborne by each party.” Menominee Decl. ¶ 13; accord Vaughn Index at 14. Production of the\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha “would allow a competitor to identify proposed\n\nrevenue amounts from the Kenosha Casino and the businesses and governmental activities that\n\nthe [Menominee] proposes to fund with Kenosha Casino revenues,” Menominee Decl. ¶ 9, which\n\nin turn “would allow a competitor tribe to identify elements of the [t]ribe’s long-term plan and\n\nacquire key assets or revenue streams in advance of the [t]ribe’s ability to do so, thwarting the\n\n[t]ribe’s economic development and/or driving up the cost to the [t]ribe of purchasing key\n\nassets.” Vaughn Index at 7, 10, 15. Production of the Use of Funding Data “would benefit any\n\nIndian Tribe interested in pursuing an off-reservation casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin to the\n\ndetriment of the Menominee,” Menominee Decl. ¶ 7, and “cause substantial harm to the\n\ncompetitive position of the Casino and the [t]ribe,” Vaughn Index at 6.

Finally, release of the\n\nMenominee Report on Impact of Kenosha and Interim Report “would cause competitive harm to\n\nthe [Menominee] by placing [it] at a disadvantage in any commercial dealings with third parties\n\nnecessary to accomplish its long term goals by allowing them access to the [Menominee’s]\n\npriorities and proposed level of funding,” allow competitors “to identify elements of the\n\n[Menominee’s] long-term plan and acquire key assets or revenue streams in advance of the\n\n[Menominee’s] ability to do so, thwarting the [t]ribe’s economic development,” and “allow\n\n[t]ribes and other persons or entities in competition with the [Menominee’s] Kenosha Casino\n\nincluding the [plaintiff] to utilize the [Menominee’s] commercial and financial information\n\nrelated to its intended use of Kenosha Casino revenue to bolster public relations or government\n\nrelations efforts to oppose the Kenosha Casino development.” Id. ¶¶ 10–12.\n\n       The plaintiff points to the fact that the Governor rejected the Menominee’s application to\n\nbuild a casino in Kenosha, and argues, on this basis, that the defendants are unable to show any\n\neffect on either actual competition or a likelihood of substantial competitive harm.

Under these circumstances, the plaintiff contends that any future competition the\n\nMenominee may face for a gaming operation in Kenosha is “highly speculative,” which “is\n\ninsufficient under Exemption 4.” Id. at 14–15 (citing Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n\n\n                                                    <span class=\"page\">30</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fat 19). In addition, according to the plaintiff, disclosure would not cause substantial competitive\n\nharm to the Menominee’s existing casino operations, which are located 190 miles from Kenosha,\n\nas the information at issue is largely specific to the proposed casino in Kenosha. Id. at 15. The\n\nplaintiff also asserts that production of the withheld documents would not cause the Menominee\n\nsubstantial competitive harm because the documents are several years old and that the defendants\n\nhave not explained how the information they contain is still competitively valuable, id. at 15–23,\n\nnoting, in particular, that the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report analyzed a public\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers report from 2004 and was discussed in the Secretarial Determination,\n\nid. at 18–19. These arguments are not persuasive.\n\n       The defendants have met their burden to show that the Menominee face actual\n\ncompetition with respect to gaming operations in Kenosha and that production of the withheld\n\ndocuments likely would cause them substantial competitive harm. Despite the Governor of\n\nWisconsin’s non-concurrence with DOI’s determination, the Menominee continue to seek a\n\ngaming operation in Kenosha. Menominee Decl. ¶¶ 14–17. The Menominee thus face not just\n\n“future or potential competition,” which is “legally inadequate” to justify withholding or\n\nredaction information, but “actual competition.” Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 169 F.3d at 19.\n\nThe Menominee is involved in separate litigation with the plaintiff concerning future gaming\n\noperations in Kenosha and have evidenced a “continuing commercial interest” in opening a\n\ngaming facility in Kenosha in reliance on provisions in its gaming compact with the State of\n\nWisconsin that authorize gaming in Kenosha upon acquisition of land eligible for gaming.\n\nMenominee Decl. ¶ 17.\n\n       The disputed documents’ ages, though relevant, do not alter this conclusion, given that\n\nthe Menominee continue to seek a gaming operation in Kenosha. The plaintiff cites Center for\n\n\n\n                                                    31\n\fAuto Safety v.

Pl.’s Mem. at 15–16. Center for Auto Safety and Biles each determined that production of\n\nfive-year old documents likely would not cause substantial competitive harm, but Center for\n\nAuto Safety’s analysis rested in meaningful part on the facts that (1) the companies involved had\n\nundergone significant bankruptcy restructuring and (2) companies in the industry rarely planned\n\nmore than five years ahead, 133 F. Supp. 3d at 134, while Biles’s analysis rested in meaningful\n\npart on the fact that the health care industry had undergone major structural reform due to the\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (“ACA”) enactment, which altered rebate\n\ncalculation, 931 F. Supp. 2d at 226. No analogous restructuring has occurred here, nor is there\n\nany indication that obtaining an off-reservation gaming license rarely entails planning more than\n\nfive years ahead. Given the Menominee’s continuing interest in a Kenosha gaming operation\n\nand the “defer[ence due] to [an] agency’s predictive judgments as to ‘the repercussions of\n\ndisclosure,’” Jurewicz, 741 F.3d at 1331 (quoting United Techs., 601 F.3d at 563), the\n\ndefendants have carried their burden to show that production of the disputed documents likely\n\nwould cause the Menominee substantial competitive harm. The defendants are therefore entitled\n\nto summary judgment, on this claim as to each of the withheld documents, except the\n\nKlasRobinson Preliminary Report.\n\n       The defendants have withheld in full the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report, even though\n\nthe Secretarial Determination partially disclosed its contents as part of the Secretarial\n\nDetermination. Pl.’s SUMF ¶ 35. “To the extent that any data requested under FOIA are in the\n\npublic domain, the submitter is unable to make any claim to confidentiality—a sine qua non of\n\n\n\n                                                     32\n\fExemption 4.” CNA Fin.

Cir. 1981) (“If the information\n\nis freely or cheaply available from other sources . . . it can hardly be called confidential and\n\nagency disclosure is unlikely to cause competitive harm to the submitter.”). Thus, the defendants\n\nhave not carried their burden to show that production of any part of the report would cause the\n\nMenominee substantial competitive harm. The defendants must release all reasonably\n\nsegregable information that the Secretarial Determination already makes publicly available, and\n\nso are not entitled to summary judgment as to this particular document withheld in full.\n\n       C.      Segregability\n\n       The plaintiff argues that the defendants have not released all segregable information from\n\nthree documents: (1) the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report (Vaughn Index Rows 28, 30, 39), (2)\n\nthe Memorandum of Agreement (Vaughn Index Rows 27, 37); and (3) the Draft Memo re:\n\nRecommendation of Menominee Indian Tribe’s Off Reservation Trust Application (Nov. 5, 2012)\n\n(Vaughn Index Row 70). Pl.’s Mem. at 24–25. According to the plaintiff, “[a]t a minimum,\n\n[d]efendants should release the cover pages or headings of these documents, which would likely\n\nindicate information such as the sender, recipient, date, and title of the documents.” Id.\n\n        “FOIA requires that ‘any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to\n\nany person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.’” Morley,\n\n508 F.3d at 1123 (alteration omitted) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)). To satisfy its segregability\n\nobligation, “[an] agency must provide a ‘detailed justification’ for . . . non-segregability,” but “is\n\nnot required to provide so much detail that the exempt material would be effectively disclosed.”\n\nJohnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Att’ys, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185805\"><a href=\"/opinion/185805/johnson-neil-v-exec-off-us-atty/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 776 (D.C.

Cir. 2008) (holding that “the description of the\n\ndocument set forth in the Vaughn index and the agency’s declaration that it released all\n\nsegregable material” are “sufficient for [the segregability] determination”); Johnson, 310 F.3d at\n\n776.\n\n       The defendants assert that “BIA has performed adequate and reasonable searches for\n\nresponsive records; has processed all such records and released all reasonably segregable non-\n\nexempt information from documents responsive to plaintiff’s . . . requests that are subject to\n\nFOIA; and has properly denied access to records and information pursuant to FOIA Exemptions\n\n3, 4, 5, and 6.” Defs.’ Mem. at 21. They also assert that any release of non-exempt information\n\nin the Draft Memo would also reveal information covered under Exemption 5 which is not\n\nchallenged, and that the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report “could not be redacted with any\n\ninformation provided without revealing the substance of the information withheld properly.”\n\nDefs.’ Reply at 7; see Vaughn Index at 32. Finally, they assert that the plaintiff’s claim is moot\n\nwith respect to the Memorandum of Agreement because they released a redaction version of the\n\ndocument on July 29, 2015. Defs.’ Reply at 7.\n\n       The defendants have met their burden of showing that they have released all segregable\n\ninformation from the Draft Memo and Memorandum of Agreement. The Vaughn Index entry for\n\nthe Draft Memo asserts that the document cannot be redacted without revealing exempt\n\ninformation, Vaughn Index at 32, which suffices to show that the defendants met their burden to\n\n“provide a ‘detailed justification’ for . . . non-segregability.” Johnson, 310 F.3d at 776 (citing\n\nMead Data Ctr., 566 F.2d at 261). The defendants thus are entitled to summary judgment and\n\n\n\n                                                     34\n\fthe plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff’s segregability claim as to those\n\ndocuments. The defendants have also produced the Memorandum of Agreement in redacted\n\nform. Vaughn Index at 14; Memorandum of Agreement, ECF No. 60-3. The plaintiff correctly\n\nnotes that the Memorandum of Agreement is entirely redacted, Pl.’s Reply at 15, but does not\n\nshow that any withheld portion of the document was segregable, and the defendants’ assertion\n\nthat it has released a redacted version of the document, Defs.’ Reply at 7, must be understood to\n\nimplicitly assert that further segregation of disclosable material is not possible. Accordingly, the\n\ndefendants are entitled to summary judgment as to the Memorandum of Agreement as well.\n\n       Despite their assertion to the contrary, the defendants identify no attestation they have\n\nmade, in any declaration or in the Vaughn Index, that they have “released all segregable\n\nmaterial” from the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report. Loving, 550 F.3d at 41. As discussed,\n\nsupra, the Secretarial Determination partially disclosed this document’s contents. Given the\n\ndefendants’ obligation to release any information reasonably segregable from the KlasRobinson\n\nPreliminary Report, they are not entitled to summary judgment as to this document and are\n\ndirected to either produce the document in a less redacted form or clarify their Vaughn Index’s\n\ndeficiencies with respect to this document.\n\n       D.      Pattern or Practice of Violating FOIA\n\n       Finally, the plaintiff argues that the defendants have engaged in a “pattern and practice”\n\nof violating FOIA, for which it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Pl.’s Mem. at 35. The\n\ndefendants assert that the “[p]laintiff has not (and cannot) show some general policy or practice\n\nwhereby [d]efendants have affirmatively elected to not process FOIA requests . . . that would\n\nrequire extraordinary relief.” Defs.’ Reply at 13.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     35\n\f       FOIA requires agencies to “determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and\n\nlegal public holidays) after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request\n\nand [to] immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the\n\nreasons therefor.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). This deadline may be extended in accordance\n\nwith FOIA. See, e.g., id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i), (ii). Even when a requester has “obtained relief as to\n\na specific request under the FOIA,” the requester may raise a “claim that an agency policy or\n\npractice will impair [its] lawful access to information in the future.” Payne Enters., Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500338\"><a href=\"/opinion/500338/payne-enterprises-inc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988). A district court may “order relief beyond the\n\nsimple release of extant records,” including “a prospective injunction with an affirmative duty to\n\ndisclose,” Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1235</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2017), where “an agency’s refusal to supply information evidences a\n\npolicy or practice of delayed disclosure or some other failure to abide by the terms of the FOIA,\n\nand not merely isolated mistakes by agency officials,” Payne Enters., Inc., 837 F.2d at 491.\n\n       The plaintiff asserts that the defendants’ delays evidence a policy or practice of FOIA\n\nnoncompliance. Pl.’s Mem. at 35. Specifically, it asserts that the defendants failed to make\n\ntimely determinations for eight of its ten FOIA requests, identify “the date on which a\n\ndetermination is expected to be dispatched,” or offer the plaintiff an opportunity to narrow the\n\nscope of its claims or access to a FOIA Public Liaison to aid its requests. Id. at 37–39 (citing 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i), (ii)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff also asserts that\n\nthe defendants also failed to make records “promptly available,” identifying long delays in the\n\ndefendants’ response to its FOIA requests. Id. at 41–43 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A); Citizens\n\nfor Responsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). Further, the\n\nplaintiff asserts that the defendants failed to make appeal determinations within twenty days, and\n\n\n\n                                                     36\n\feven failed to acknowledge or make any appeal determination at all for eight of the ten appeals.\n\nId. at 35, 39. Finally, the plaintiff criticizes the defendants for “repeatedly spen[ding] time\n\nproviding old documents that had been re-submitted by [the] Menominee, notwithstanding . . .\n\nrepeated requests that they focus on more recent information.” Id. at 43.\n\n       Although the defendants missed many FOIA deadlines and in some cases failed to act\n\naltogether, the plaintiff must show that the defendants’ delays were not due “merely [to] isolated\n\nmistakes by agency officials” to establish a FOIA policy or practice claim. Payne Enters., Inc.,\n\n837 F.2d at 491. Significant personnel turnover occurred in late 2012, when many of the FOIA\n\nresponses at issue were due, and the defendants could not begin searching for responsive\n\ndocuments until March 2013. DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 45. While searching for and reviewing\n\nresponsive documents “as time allowed,” OIG also was processing the Menominee’s gaming\n\napplication, “7 other . . . applications for gaming, 47 class III tribal state gaming compacts, 2\n\nSecretarial Procedures, and 41 Revenue Allocation Plans.” Id. ¶ 46.\n\n       The plaintiff’s complaint that the defendants did not release requested materials until late\n\nJuly 2012, in response to FOIA Request No. 2 made in early June 2012, Pl.’s Mem. at 41−42,\n\nseems almost frivolous since this delay is brief, this request’s scope was broad, and the\n\ndefendants gave multiple partial responses throughout June and July. Plaintiff Decl. ¶¶ 40–41;\n\nPl.’s SUMF ¶ 55. The plaintiff asserts that it did not receive final responses as to FOIA Requests\n\nNo. 4, 6, and 9 until July 2015, but concedes that it received partial responses in February and\n\nDecember of 2014. Pl.’s Mem. at 42 n.13. Though this delay was more significant, the\n\ndefendants requested that the plaintiff narrow the scope of these requests, which sought “‘any\n\nand all documentation and communication’ over a five year period of time,” as they were “overly\n\nburdensome and vague,” and would require searching 47 storage boxes over a period of years.\n\n\n\n                                                     37\n\fPlaintiff Decl. ¶¶ 71–72; DOI OIG Decl. ¶ 31. The plaintiff also complains that the defendants\n\nrepeatedly produced “old documents that had been resubmitted by [the Tribe],” even though the\n\nplaintiff had asked that the government focus on more recent information. Pl.’s Mem. at 43. To\n\nthe extent, however, that the plaintiff requested documents that were duplicates of earlier\n\nsubmitted documents, so long as those documents were resubmitted after September 9, 2009, the\n\ndefendants fulfilled their FOIA obligations. Plaintiff Decl. ¶ 13. In any event, the plaintiff fails\n\nto show that the defendants’ production of duplicative documents amounted to a “policy or\n\npractice” of FOIA noncompliance. Payne Enters., Inc., 837 F.2d at 491. Finally, the plaintiff\n\ncomplains that it “specifically and repeatedly requested OIG’s October 17, 2011 letter to [the]\n\nMenominee,” but that the defendants did not produce this letter until June 17, 2015, over three\n\nyears after the plaintiff had initially requested it. Pl.’s Mem. at 43; Pl.’s SUMF ¶¶ 9, 54. An\n\nagency’s delay in complying with this request for this specific document, however, simply does\n\nnot rise to the level of establishing a pattern and practice by the defendant agencies of refusing to\n\ncomply with their FOIA obligations, especially in light of the tremendous volume of responsive\n\nrecords disclosed to the plaintiff here. Cf. Payne Enters., Inc., 837 F.2d at 494 (allowing pattern\n\nand practice claim where agency simply refused to release of responsive records where no FOIA\n\nexemption applied).\n\n       Given this background and close examination of the plaintiff’s specific complaints about\n\ndelays in the defendants’ responses, the plaintiff has failed to establish a policy or practice of\n\nFOIA noncompliance and, accordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment and the\n\nplaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment as to this claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      38\n\fIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is denied as to the plaintiff’s claims for\n\n(1) an additional search for the KlasRobinson Final Report and Corn Letter, and (2) production\n\nof all segregable portions of the KlasRobinson Preliminary Report, and otherwise granted in full.\n\nThe plaintiff’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is denied in full.\n\n       An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n       Date: September 30, 2017\n\n\n\n                                                    __________________________\n                                                    BERYL A.
