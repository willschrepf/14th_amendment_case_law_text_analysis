It is intended to prevent the\n        granting of special privileges and to secure uni-\n        formity of law throughout the State as fan as pos-\n        sible. It is said that at an early period in many\n        of the states the practice of enacting special and\n        local laws became *an efficient means for the easy\n        enactment of laws for the advancement of personal\n        rather than public interests, and encouraged the\n        reprehensible practice of trading and wlogrollilig\".1\n        It was for the suppression of such practices that\n        such a provision was adopted in this and many of\n        the other states of the Union.\n             *Notwithstanding the above constitutional pro-\n        vision, the courts recognize in the Legislature a\n        rather broad power to make classifications for le-\n        gislative purposes and to enact laws for the rsgu-\n        latinn thereof, even though such legislation may\n        be applicable only to a particular class or? in\n        fact, affect only the inhabitants of a particular\n        locality; but such legislation must be intended\n        to apply uniformly to all who may come within the\n        classification designated in the Act, and the class-\n        ification must be broad enough to include a substen-\n        tial class and must be based on characteristics\n        legitimately distinguishing such class from others\n        with respect to the public purpose sought to be\n        accomplished by the proposed legislation. In other\n\fHonorable Charles F. Hemphill, Fage   5\n\n     words there must be a substantial reason for the\n     classification. It must not be a mere arbitrary\n     device resorted to for the purpose of giving what\n     is, in fact, a local law the appearance of a gen-\n     eral law. ... *The rule is that a classifica-\n     tion cannot be adopted arbitrarily upon a ground\n     which has no foundation in difference of situation\n     or circumstances of the municipalities placed in\n     the different classes. There must be some reason-\n     able relation between the situation of ausicipal-\n     ities classified anidthe purposes and objects to\n     be attained. There must be something . . . which\n     in some reasonable degree accounts for the division\n     into classes.'n\n          It will be noted that the Act in questicn by its\nterms is made applicable only ih those counties having a\npopulation of not more than three persons per square mile\nand having an assessed valuation of not less than $20.,000,000.\nThe peculiar limitaions employed by the Legislature in this\ninstance to segregate the class to be affected by the Legis-\nlation not only bears no substantial relation to the object\nsought to be accomplished by the Act, but the purported class\nattempted to be so segregated is, in fact, not a class dis:\ntinct in any substantial manner from others in this State.\nThere is nothing peculiar about a county having a population\nof not more than three persons per s uare mile and having an\nassessed valuatinn of not less than %.20,000,000 that marks\nit a suitable and peculiar field for the expending of public\nfunds for the purposes mentioned in the Act, as distinguished\nfrom other counties having substantially the same valuation\nand population. The slight variation between the po.nulation\nand valuation mentioned in the Act does not distingu!ishcit\nin any manner from other counties having substantially the\nsame population and aSSeSS6d valuation that is germane to the\npurpose of the particular Legislation. In other words, what-\never difference there is in population and assessed valuation\ndO6S not appear to be material to the object sought to be ac-\ncomplished. After having carefully considered the matter, we\nare convinced that the attempted classification is unreason-\nable and bears no relation to the object sought to be accmm-\nplished by the Act and that as a consequence the Act is uhcon-\nstitutional and therefore void.\n          In viea of the Miller case, supra, and the cese of\nJameson et al. v. Smith, 161 S.W. (2d),52O, and the authori-\nties cited in these cases, it is the opinion of this department,\n\fHonorable Charles F.

It must not be a mere arbitrary\n     device resorted to for the purpose of giving what\n     is, in fact, a local law the appearance of a gen-\n     eral law. ... *The rule is that a classifica-\n     tion cannot be adopted arbitrarily upon a ground\n     which has no foundation in difference of situation\n     or circumstances of the municipalities placed in\n     the different classes. There must be some reason-\n     able relation between the situation of ausicipal-\n     ities classified anidthe purposes and objects to\n     be attained. There must be something . . . which\n     in some reasonable degree accounts for the division\n     into classes.'n\n          It will be noted that the Act in questicn by its\nterms is made applicable only ih those counties having a\npopulation of not more than three persons per square mile\nand having an assessed valuation of not less than $20.,000,000.\nThe peculiar limitaions employed by the Legislature in this\ninstance to segregate the class to be affected by the Legis-\nlation not only bears no substantial relation to the object\nsought to be accomplished by the Act, but the purported class\nattempted to be so segregated is, in fact, not a class dis:\ntinct in any substantial manner from others in this State.\nThere is nothing peculiar about a county having a population\nof not more than three persons per s uare mile and having an\nassessed valuatinn of not less than %.20,000,000 that marks\nit a suitable and peculiar field for the expending of public\nfunds for the purposes mentioned in the Act, as distinguished\nfrom other counties having substantially the same valuation\nand population. The slight variation between the po.nulation\nand valuation mentioned in the Act does not distingu!ishcit\nin any manner from other counties having substantially the\nsame population and aSSeSS6d valuation that is germane to the\npurpose of the particular Legislation. In other words, what-\never difference there is in population and assessed valuation\ndO6S not appear to be material to the object sought to be ac-\ncomplished. After having carefully considered the matter, we\nare convinced that the attempted classification is unreason-\nable and bears no relation to the object sought to be accmm-\nplished by the Act and that as a consequence the Act is uhcon-\nstitutional and therefore void.\n          In viea of the Miller case, supra, and the cese of\nJameson et al. v. Smith, 161 S.W. (2d),52O, and the authori-\nties cited in these cases, it is the opinion of this department,\n\fHonorable Charles F. Hemphill, Page 6\n\n\nas above stated, that the Act under consideration is uncon-\nstitutional and therefore void. Therefore, it is our further\nopinion that the County Commissioners are not entitled to\nany additional compensation under the abovementioned Act nor\nare they entitled to any traveling expenses unde,rthe same.\nThe CountyCommissioners are only entitled to the compensa-\ntion as provided by    eneral law (Article 2350, Vernon's Anno-\ntated Civil Statutesâ€˜i .\n          Trusting that the foregoing fully answers your in-\nquiry, we are\n                                       Yours very truly\n                                 ATTORNEY GENERAL OF T2X.Q\n\n\n                                 BY     s\n                                            Ardell William\n                                                  Assistant\nAK:mp\n\n          APPROV3:;)\n                   OCT 5, 1942\n          s   Gerald C.
