We will affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n             Trent receives dialysis treatment at defendant\n\nCommunity Dialysis Center (\"CDC\") in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania.\n\nDefendant Dial Medical of Florida, Inc. (\"Dial Medical\") sells\n\nacid concentrate to CDC for use in dialysis treatment.        Between\n\nlate 1988 and early 1992, several CDC patients, including Trent,\n\nwere found to have high serum aluminum levels, which could result\n\nin aluminum poisoning.\n\n             In July, 1992, Trent filed a class action complaint in\n\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\n\nPennsylvania alleging negligence against CDC and Dial Medical.1\n\nSpecifically, Trent alleged that the elevated aluminum levels in\n\nCDC patients resulted from CDC's use of aluminum pumps to pump\n\nacid concentrate through patients as part of their dialysis\n\ntreatment.    In September, 1992, he filed a \"motion for class\n\n1\n.    CDC apparently filed a third-party complaint against W.W.\n     Grainger, Inc. (\"Grainger\"), and American Machine and Tool\n     Co., Inc. of Pennsylvania (\"American Machine\"), and Dial\n     Medical filed a third-party complaint against Baxter\n     Healthcare Corp. (\"Baxter\"). Dial Medical, Grainger, and\n     American Machine have since been dismissed from this appeal\n     pursuant to stipulations of dismissal filed with the\n     district court, and Baxter was not a party to this appeal.\n\fmaintenance,\" seeking certification of the class described in his\n\namended complaint -- fifty-three CDC patients who have tested\n\npositive for serum aluminum levels of greater that 100 micrograms\n\nper liter (mcg/l) since January, 1990.\n\n           Shortly thereafter, Edwin Snead, who had earlier filed\n\na similar class action complaint against CDC and its two medical\n\ndirectors in state court, moved to intervene in Trent's lawsuit.\n\nSnead, whose wife had died of aluminum poisoning after receiving\n\ndialysis treatment at CDC, sought in his case to represent a\n\nclass comprised of all CDC patients injured by CDC's allegedly\n\ndefective dialysis equipment and methods.   Snead's complaint\n\nalleged negligence and outrageous conduct and included counts for\n\nwrongful death and survival.\n\n           In November 1992, the district court granted Snead's\n\nmotion to intervene, denied Trent's motion for class\n\ncertification and sua sponte decided to abstain from hearing the\nTrent case in light of the pendency of the Snead case in state\n\ncourt.   The following order issued:\n                The motion of Edwin Snead . . . to\n           intervene as a party plaintiff is GRANTED.\n\n                The motion of plaintiff Earl Trent for\n           class certification is DENIED without\n           prejudice.\n\n                This suit is DISMISSED WITHOUT\n           PREJUDICE. This case is to remain in status\n           quo and the Statute of Limitations is tolled.\n\n                It is further understood that all\n           discovery and settlement discussions will\n           continue in coordination with the action\n           currently pending in the Delaware County\n           Court of Common Pleas styled Snead v.\n\f          Community Dialysis Center, Inc. . . . . If\n          intervention by the court is needed or\n          desired, the parties may ask for assistance\n          by either filing the appropriate motions,\n          writing to the court or setting a telephone\n          conference.\n\n               The parties shall keep the court advised\n          of the status of this case and the state\n          court action. When they are ready for trial\n          or wish a settlement conference all that is\n          necessary is to write directly to the court\n          or set a telephone conference.\n\n\nApp. at 185-86.\n\n          Since this appeal was argued, a class has been\n\ncertified in the Snead case as to duty and breach of duty.\n\nAlthough the time period for opting out of that class has\n\nexpired, Trent has chosen not to opt out.   Trent appeals the\n\ndistrict court's decision to abstain from hearing his case.\n\n                               II.\n\n          Initially we must determine whether federal appellate\n\njurisdiction exists.   The district court had jurisdiction over\n\nthis case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(a)(1).2   The inquiry into\n2\n.    Stating that it \"anticipates that discovery will reveal to a\n     legal certainty that plaintiff will not be able to recover\n     the jurisdictional amount of $50,000,\" CDC urges that the\n     district court may not have had diversity jurisdiction over\n     this case. CDC's brief at 12 (footnote omitted). Trent's\n     complaint, however, alleges damages in excess of $50,000,\n     exclusive of interest and costs. Unless it appears to a\n     legal certainty from the facts alleged that this case does\n     not involve potential damages on that scale, the district\n     court had jurisdiction. Nelson v. Keefer, 451 F.2d 289 (3d\n     Cir. 1971); 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(a). Given that Trent seeks\n     both compensatory and punitive damages, and the lack of\n     clarity as to the extent of his injuries, if he suffered\n     any, we cannot say with any certainty -- legal or otherwise\n     -- at this time that his damages will amount to less than\n     $50,000.\n\four jurisdiction, which we would undertake in any event but which\n\nis also the subject of a pending motion to dismiss for lack of\n\nappellate jurisdiction, is more complex due to conflicting\n\nstatements in the district court's order.\n\n          That order indicates that Trent's case was dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice.    An order dismissing a case is, of course,\n\nfinal and appealable.     Ingersoll-Rand Fin. Corp. v. Callison, 844\nF.2d 133, 134-35 & n.1 (3d Cir. 1988).     Even dismissals without\n\nprejudice have been held to be final and appealable if they\n\n\"end[] [the] suit so far as the District Court was concerned,\"\n\nUnited States v. Wallace & Tiernan Co., 336 U.S. 793, 794 n.1\n\n(1949), although we have indicated that such dismissals may not\n\nconstitute final orders until the party seeking relief renounces\n\nany intention to reinstate litigation.    See Tiernan v. Devoe, 923\n\nF.2d 1024, 1031 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n          The court's order is not clearly a dismissal, however,\n\nfor it states that the case is \"to remain in status quo,\"\n\n\"discovery and settlement discussions will continue in\n\ncoordination with\" the Snead case, the parties may contact the\n\ncourt if they desire judicial intervention, and the parties need\n\nonly \"write directly to the court or set a telephone conference\"\n\nwhen they \"are ready for trial or wish a settlement conference.\"\n\nApp. at 185-86.    The order thus appears to remove the case from\n\nthe district court's docket of pending cases but to anticipate\n\nreactivation.     See Brace v. O'Neill, 567 F.2d 237 (3d Cir. 1977).\nTherefore, the proper jurisdictional inquiry focusses on an\n\ninterpretation of Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr.\n\fCorp., 460 U.S. 1 (1983), and other cases addressing the issue of\nwhether a stay order is final for purposes of appeal.     See Rolo\n\nv. General Development Corp., 949 F.2d 695, 700-02 (3d Cir.\n\n1991); Schall v. Joyce, 885 F.2d 101, 104-05 (3d Cir. 1989);\n\nCommonwealth Ins. Co. v. Underwriters, Inc., 846 F.2d 196, 198\n\n(3d Cir. 1988); Cheyney State College Faculty v. Hufstedler, 703\n\nF.2d 732 (3d Cir. 1983).\n\n           In Moses H. Cone, the Supreme Court held that a stay\n\ngrounded in the pendency of similar litigation in state court is\n\nappealable if it \"effectively deprive[s] the plaintiff of its\n\nright to a federal forum because once the state court\n\nadjudicate[s] the issues in the case, a federal court would be\n\nbound to honor those determinations as res judicata.\"     Schall,\n\n885 F.2d at 104.    Under Moses H. Cone, even if a stay order is\n\nentered with the expectation that the federal litigation will\n\nresume if the plaintiff does not obtain relief in state court,\n\nthe stay decision may be appealed if \"the object of the stay is\n\nto require all or an essential part of the federal suit to be\n\nlitigated in a state forum.\"    Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 10 n.11.\n\n           That is precisely the effect the district court's order\n\nwill have here.    It is clear that the district court judge\n\nexpected that Snead would resolve this case, at least in large\npart.   A decision in Snead will constitute res judicata as to at\n\nleast the two major issues (duty and breach) in Trent.3\n\n3\n.    CDC has asserted a counterclaim against Trent in his lawsuit\n     alleging that he has failed to pay for his dialysis\n     treatments. Snead may not resolve this counterclaim,\n     although, depending on the substance of Trent's defense to\n\fEffectively requiring Trent either to wait until Snead is\nresolved or to remain in the Snead class deprives him of the\n\nopportunity to pursue remedies in federal court, thus\n\nconstituting a requirement that \"all or an essential part of the\n\nfederal suit . . . be litigated in a state forum.\"     Moses H.\n\nCone, 460 U.S. at 10 n.11.      Since issuing the order in question,\n\nin fact, the district court has denied as moot a motion to file a\n\nsecond amended complaint, thus implying that it believes it has\n\neffectively disposed of the case.\n\n           In Moses H. Cone, \"[t]he Court distinguished between\n\nstay orders that `merely . . . have the practical effect of\n\nallowing a state court to be the first to rule on a common issue'\n\n(such as an `ordinary delay in the interest of docket control')\n\nand stay orders whose `sole purpose and effect . . . are\n\nprecisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federal suit to a state\n\ncourt.'   . . .    Only the latter type of stay order is immediately\n\nappealable.\"      Schall, 885 F.2d at 104, quoting Moses H. Cone, 460\n\nU.S. at 10 n.11.     CDC attempts to categorize this case as one in\n\nwhich the district court has issued a stay merely to afford the\n\nstate court an opportunity to rule first on a common issue.       It\n\nsees this order as an attempt at docket control rather than an\n\naction which effectively dismisses Trent's case.     Thus, it argues\n\nthat we lack jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n     it, it is conceivable that even that counterclaim may be\n     resolved by a verdict in Snead.\n\f             Indeed, portions of the order point in the direction\n\nCDC indicates.     The order provides that \"the case is to remain in\n\nthe status quo\" and that \"all discovery and settlement discussion\n\nwill continue in coordination with the action currently pending\n\nin . . . Snead.\"     App. at 185.   It also instructs the parties\n\nthat the judge will be amenable to intervening if the parties ask\n\nhim to do so, and that they should keep him \"advised of the\n\nstatus of this case and the state court action.\"     Id.   In the\n\nsame vein, it provides that \"[w]hen [the parties] are ready for\n\ntrial or wish a settlement conference all that is necessary is to\n\nwrite directly to the court or set a telephone conference.\"         App.\n\nat 185-86.    Moreover, since entering the order, the district\n\ncourt judge has denied a motion to stay discovery pending this\n\nappeal, thus perhaps implying that he expects discovery to\n\ncontinue because the case is still pending.4\n\n             The order's unintended lack of clarity, which has been\n\nexacerbated by the denial of the discovery motion, does not,\n\nhowever, compel a conclusion that we lack appellate jurisdiction.\n\nTwo relevant precedents assist in line-drawing here, and\n\ncomparison with those cases provides the focus for our decision\n\nthat we have appellate jurisdiction.\n\n             In Cheyney State College Faculty v. Hufstedler, supra,\n\nwe examined a district court's decision to abstain from a class\n\n\n4\n.    Of course, this could alternatively imply that the judge\n     believes he has no jurisdiction to consider the motion to\n     stay discovery because the case has been dismissed.\n\faction suit alleging segregation in the Pennsylvania higher\n\neducation system until the United States Department of Education\n\nhad adjudicated administrative procedures regarding the\n\nallegation.   We acknowledged Moses H. Cone's holding that,\nalthough a stay is not ordinarily a final decision, an appellate\n\ncourt may review it when it \"amounts to a dismissal of the\n\nunderlying suit.\"   Cheyney, 703 F.2d at 735.    We also\n\nacknowledged that \"[a]n indefinite stay order that unreasonably\n\ndelays a plaintiff's right to have his case heard is appealable.\"\n\nId.   We held, however, that \"[t]he stay in this case does not\n\nhave the practical effect of a dismissal.    Nothing in the\n\ndistrict court's opinion or order intimates that the stay was\n\nintended to `deep six' the suit.   Plaintiffs have not been put\n\n`effectively out of court.'   . . .   Nor is the case `rife with\n\nspecial circumstances which bring it outside the general rule and\n\nso limit its precedential value as to not measurably weaken our\n\ncontinued aversion to piecemeal appeals.'\"      Id.   Rather, based in\n\nlarge part on the district court's instruction that the parties\n\nreport to it on the progress of the administrative proceedings,\n\nwe were \"convinced\" that \"this stay [was] merely a temporary\n\nsuspension of proceedings.\"   Id. at 735.    Therefore, we\n\ndetermined that we lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from the\n\nstay order because the district court was only abstaining until\n\nthe plaintiffs proceeded on the administrative level.       There was\n\nno indication that the outcome of the administrative proceeding\n\nwould deprive plaintiffs of their day in federal court.\n\f          Conversely, in Schall, we held that a district court's\ndecision to stay a case pending the disposition of a state court\n\ncase was appealable because:   (1) there was no indication that\n\nthe order was tentative (i.e., there was no basis to suppose that\n\nthe district judge contemplated any reconsideration of his\n\ndecision to defer to the parallel state-court suit (quoting Moses\n\nH. Cone)); (2) the district court had instructed the plaintiff to\n\nproceed in state court and then ordered the stay pending the\n\noutcome of those state court proceedings, leading us to believe\n\nthat \"the district court stayed the suit to relegate the\n\nplaintiff to state court rather than to exercise control over its\n\ndocket\"; and (3) the issues in the state court suit constituted\n\nthe heart of the federal court suit, thus effectively preventing\n\nthe litigation in federal court of a significant part of\n\nplaintiff's federal case.   Schall, 885 F.2d at 105.\n\n          Arguably, unlike Schall, the order on appeal here\n\nindicates that the district court might reconsider whether to\n\ndefer to Snead.   The court's statements that it will \"intervene\"\n\nif asked and will set a trial date or a settlement conference\n\nupon request imply not only that it recognizes that there may be\n\nsome issues remaining after Snead is disposed of, but also that\nit might try the case whenever the parties (apparently jointly)\n\nseek a trial date.   Like Schall, however, the issues in Snead\n\nprovide the central focus of this case, so the district court's\n\norder effectively prevents litigation of Trent's claims in\n\nfederal court and requires him to abide by the state court\n\ndecision in Snead.   (Although Snead alleges more legal bases for\n\frelief that the Trent case does, the allegations of the Trent\ncase are subsumed within Snead.)   Unlike Cheyney, then, this stay\n\nhas the practical effect of a dismissal rather than merely\n\ndelaying adjudication until completion of administrative or state\n\ncourt proceedings.   Therefore, we conclude that, like the orders\n\nin Schall and Moses H. Cone, this stay order is immediately\n\nappealable and we may exercise jurisdiction over it.\n\n                               III.\n\n          The district court decided to defer exercising\n\njurisdiction over this case under the \"exceptional circumstances\"\n\ndoctrine of Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United\n\nStates, 424 U.S. 800 (1976).   See Ingersoll-Rand, 844 F.2d 133.\n\nColorado River abstention is not one of the three\n\nconstitutionally- or comity-based traditional grounds for\n\nabstention.5   Instead, under Colorado River, even if a case (such\n\nas this one) does not fall within one of the three traditional\n\ncategories,\n\n5\n.    The three constitutionally- or comity-based grounds for\n     abstention are Pullman abstention, an outgrowth of Railroad\n     Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941), which\n     is proper when a state court determination of a question of\n     state law might moot or change a federal constitutional\n     issue presented in a federal court case; Burford abstention,\n     an outgrowth of Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943),\n     which is proper when questions of state law in which the\n     state has expressed a desire to establish a coherent policy\n     with respect to a matter of substantial public concern are\n     presented; and Younger abstention, an outgrowth of Younger\n     v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), which is proper when federal\n     jurisdiction has been invoked for the purpose of restraining\n     certain state proceedings. See generally Colorado River\n     Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814-16\n     (1976).\n\f          there are principles unrelated to\n          considerations of proper constitutional\n          adjudication and regard for federal-state\n          relations which govern in situations\n          involving the contemporaneous exercise of\n          concurrent jurisdictions, either by federal\n          courts or by state and federal courts. These\n          principles rest on consideration of \"[w]ise\n          judicial administration, giving regard to\n          conservation of judicial resources and\n          comprehensive disposition of litigation.\"\n\n\nColorado River, 424 U.S. at 817, quoting Kerotest Mfg. Co. v.\nC-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183 (1952).    While\n\nabstention even under the three traditional categories is the\n\nexception, rather than the rule, Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 813\n\n(Moses H. Cone, 406 U.S. at 14), Colorado River abstention is\n\neven rarer, for two reasons.   First, generally, the pendency of a\n\ncase in state court will not bar federal litigation of a case\n\nconcerning the same issues if the federal court has jurisdiction\n\nover the case before it.    Id. at 817.   Second, the federal courts\n\nhave a \"virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the\n\njurisdiction given them.\"   Id. at 817; see also Olde Discount\n\nCorp. v. Tupman, 1 F.3d 202, 211 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n                                 A.\n\n          In reviewing an abstention decision, \"the underlying\n\nlegal questions are subject to plenary review, although the\n\ndecision to abstain is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\"\n\nUniversity of Maryland v. Peat Marwick Main & Co., 923 F.2d 265,\n\n269 (3d Cir. 1991); see also Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 19;\n\nGeneral Glass Indus. Corp. v. Monsour Medical Found., 973 F.2d\n\n197, 200 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\f          In other words,\n          The determination of whether this case falls\n          in the area within which the district court\n          may exercise discretion is . . . a matter of\n          law, reviewable on a plenary basis. Only if\n          we determine that the case falls within this\n          range will we apply an abuse of discretion\n          standard in reviewing the district court's\n          decision to abstain.\n\n\nUniversity of Maryland, 923 F.2d at 270.\n                                B.\n\n          Cases that are not truly duplicative do not invite\n\nColorado River deference.   University of Maryland, 923 F.2d at\n\n276; Complaint of Bankers Trust Co. v. Chatterjee, 636 F.2d 37,\n\n40-41 (3d Cir. 1980); see also LaDuke v. Burlington Northern R.R.\n\nCo., 879 F.2d 1556 (7th Cir. 1989).   Therefore, we initially\n\ninquire whether the Trent case and the Snead case are parallel.\n\n          Generally, cases are parallel so as to justify\n\nabstention under Colorado River when they involve the same\n\nparties and claims.   In LaDuke, a plaintiff sued his employer in\n\nstate court and then filed an identical suit in federal court.\n\nThe cases were \"parallel\" because they involved identical parties\n\nand claims.   La Duke, 879 F.2d at 1559.   Similarly, in Moses H.\n\nCone and Colorado River, the state and federal cases involved the\n\nsame claims and the same parties, although the defendants in the\n\nfederal cases appeared as plaintiffs in the state cases.     Moses\n\nH. Cone, 460 U.S. at 7; Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 805-06.\n\nThus, those cases, too, were parallel.\n\n          In contrast, when a federal court case involves claims\n\nthat are distinct from those at issue in a state court case, the\n\fcases are not parallel and do not justify Colorado River\nabstention.   In University of Maryland, for example, we reversed\n\na district court's dismissal of a class action fraud case filed\n\nby policyholders of an insolvent insurance company against the\n\ninsurance company's independent auditor.    The district court\n\ndecided to abstain under Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315\n\n(1943) (see note 5, supra), in favor of a state court case\n\nagainst the same auditor brought by the Pennsylvania insurance\n\ncommissioner on behalf of the insurance company and its\n\npolicyholders.   Although the district court had based its\n\ndecision upon Burford, we reviewed its decision under both\n\nBurford and Colorado River.\n\n          We reversed the district court because the parties and\n\nclaims in each of the two cases differed.    The insolvent\n\ninsurance company was a party to the state court suit but not to\n\nthe one brought in federal court.   The classes of policyholders\n\ninvolved in each case differed.    And the insurance commissioner's\n\nlawsuit alleged fewer legal bases for relief than did the federal\n\ncourt suit.   University of Maryland, 923 F.2d at 268-69.\n\nTherefore, the policyholders' claims in the federal court case\n\nwere \"distinct\" from those asserted in the commissioner's case;\n\nbecause of this \"lack of identity of all issues,\" and because\n\nthere was \"no theoretical obstacle to both actions proceeding\n\nindependently,\" we ruled that abstention under Colorado River\nwould be improper.   Id. at 276.\n\n          Similarly, in Complaint of Bankers Trust, we admonished\nthat \"[i]t is important . . . that only truly duplicative\n\fproceedings be avoided.   When the claims, parties, or requested\n\nrelief differ, deference may not be appropriate.\"     Complaint of\nBankers Trust, 636 F.2d at 40.    In that case, we reviewed a\n\nfederal district court's decision to defer in favor of litigation\n\npending in another federal district court.      Because neither the\n\nparties to nor the relief requested in the two cases at issue\n\nwere identical, and because the two cases employed substantially\n\ndifferent \"approaches\" and might \"achieve potentially different\n\nresults,\" we reversed the district court's \"docket-control\n\ndismissal\" of one of the cases.    Id. at 41.\n\n          In this case, the district court ruled that Trent and\n\nSnead were parallel because it found them to be \"substantially\n\nidentical.\"   App. at 180.   The two cases do in fact raise nearly\n\nidentical allegations and issues, and the defendants in each are\n\nessentially identical.6   Moreover, as the district court found,\n\nthe plaintiffs in the two cases are effectively the same.7      That\n\n6\n.    The Snead case in state court includes as defendants the two\n     medical directors of CDC in addition to CDC itself. This\n     does not trouble us, since abstention will in no way deny\n     Trent an opportunity to have his claims litigated against\n     the remaining defendant in this federal suit -- CDC. See\n     supra n.1.\n7\n.    The court stated:\n\n          The class previously certified by the state\n          court includes all CDC patients who utilized\n          the defective dialysis equipment at CDC and\n          suffered injury as a result. Although the\n          putative class defined by plaintiff Trent is\n          somewhat more limited, he relies upon the\n          same allegations of negligence.\n\n     App. at 180 (emphasis added).\n\fSnead has been certified only as to duty and breach of that duty\ndoes not negate the fact that the determination of those issues\n\nin Snead will resolve them in Trent.     Trent's decision not to opt\n\nout of Snead8 means that Snead will result in recovery for him if\n\nthe class prevails on the class-wide issues and he is found to\n\nhave suffered damages as a result of the defendants' actions.     In\n\nsum, Trent and Snead are parallel and thus present an appropriate\n\nsetting for Colorado River abstention.\n\n                                C.\n\n          Given that this case is one in which Colorado River\n\nabstention may be appropriate, we now must determine whether the\n\ndecision to abstain constituted an abuse of the district court's\n\ndiscretion.   We conclude that it did not.\n\n     In fact, the class in Snead had not yet been certified at\n     the time the district court decided to abstain. App. at\n     177. Subsequent events have nonetheless proven the district\n     court judge to have been prescient, for, as previously\n     noted, the judge handling Snead has, during the pendency of\n     this appeal, certified a class consisting of \"all persons\n     who received bicarbonate dialysate treatments at CDC's\n     Lansdowne facility between January 1, 1990 and February 7,\n     1992, the spouses of all such patients and the\n     administrators and the executors of the estates of such\n     persons and/or their spouses.\" Attachment to Letter from P.\n     Quinn to P. Lester (Deputy Clerk, Third Circuit) of June 30,\n     1994 (state court order in Snead granting class\n     certification). Clearly, Trent would be a member of that\n     class.\n8\n.    Trent states that he intends to move for permission to opt\n     out of the Snead class after receiving our decision in this\n     appeal. At oral argument, he expressed an intention to\n     pursue his case on an individual basis instead of as a class\n     action. We cannot assume that his belated motion to opt out\n     of the Snead class will be granted, however, so we must\n     consider him to be a member of the Snead class as we decide\n     this appeal.\n\f          The factors which govern a district court's exercise of\n\ndiscretion in deciding whether to abstain under Colorado River\nare:\n          (1)     Which court first assumed jurisdiction\n                  over property involved, if any;\n\n          (2)     Whether the federal forum is\n                  inconvenient;\n\n          (3)     The desirability of avoiding piecemeal\n                  litigation;\n\n          (4)     The order in which the respective courts\n                  obtained jurisdiction;\n\n          (5)     Whether federal or state law applies;\n                  and\n\n          (6)     Whether the state court proceeding would\n                  adequately protect the federal\n                  plaintiff's rights.\n\n\nSee generally Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 15-16, 19-26; see also\n\nColorado River, 424 U.S. at 818-19 (\"No one factor is necessarily\n\ndeterminative; a carefully considered judgment taking into\n\naccount both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the\n\ncombination of factors counselling against that exercise is\n\nrequired. . . .    Only the clearest of justifications will warrant\n\ndismissal.\").\n\n          Many factors weigh in favor of abstention in this case.\n\nThe principal reasons to abstain, once abstention has been found\n\nto be possible, are to avoid piecemeal litigation and to\n\nadjudicate state-law issues in state court.       Cf. DeCisneros v.\n\nYounger, 871 F.2d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 1989).       Here, state rather\n\nthan federal law is at issue, and piecemeal litigation might\n\fresult if the district court presided over Trent while Snead was\nprogressing through the state court system.      Moreover, the class\n\ncertified in Snead is broader than that asserted in Trent.      Snead\n\nthus will resolve more individuals' claims than Trent would; it\n\nmakes more sense to resolve common issues in a setting which will\n\ndispose of the most claims.       Finally, Snead was filed before\n\nTrent and, more importantly under Moses H. Cone, it appears as if\n\nSnead has invested more time into substantive work and discovery\n\nin his case.    See App. at 32.\n\n          In sum, because the parties agree that there is no res\n\nover which any court has exercised jurisdiction, only one factor\n\ntruly weighs in favor of the district court exercising federal\n\njurisdiction.   That is simply that the federal forum is not\n\ninconvenient.   This alone, even given the obligation federal\n\ncourts have to exercise their jurisdiction, cannot justify a\n\ndecision to exercise jurisdiction when the countervailing factors\n\nweigh so heavily in favor of abstention.      Accordingly, we will\n\naffirm.\n\f                                IV.\n\n            Trent and CDC also argue that the district court erred\n\nin granting Snead's motion to intervene because Snead had not\n\ncomplied with the requirements of Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure in filing it.9     We need not reach the merits\n\nof this argument on appeal because orders granting intervention\n\nare not final for purposes of appeal.     In re Continental\nAirlines, Inc., 932 F.2d 282, 286 (3d Cir. 1991); Matter of Marin\n\nMotor Oil, Inc., 689 F.2d 445, 447 (3d Cir. 1982); Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission v. American Tel. & Tel. Co.,\n\n506 F.2d 735, 742 (3d Cir. 1974).     Trent's and CDC's arguments\n\nmust await the conclusion of this case before they may be\n\nconsidered.\n\n                                 V.\n\n            In conclusion, we will affirm the district court's\n\ndecision to abstain from proceeding further with Trent until the\n\nparties inform it either that Snead has reached some conclusion\n\nbut issues remain for disposition in Trent or that it is\n\nappropriate to proceed in Trent despite the continuing pendency\n\nof Snead.\n\n\n\n\n9\n.

We will affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n             Trent receives dialysis treatment at defendant\n\nCommunity Dialysis Center (\"CDC\") in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania.\n\nDefendant Dial Medical of Florida, Inc. (\"Dial Medical\") sells\n\nacid concentrate to CDC for use in dialysis treatment.        Between\n\nlate 1988 and early 1992, several CDC patients, including Trent,\n\nwere found to have high serum aluminum levels, which could result\n\nin aluminum poisoning.\n\n             In July, 1992, Trent filed a class action complaint in\n\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\n\nPennsylvania alleging negligence against CDC and Dial Medical.1\n\nSpecifically, Trent alleged that the elevated aluminum levels in\n\nCDC patients resulted from CDC's use of aluminum pumps to pump\n\nacid concentrate through patients as part of their dialysis\n\ntreatment.    In September, 1992, he filed a \"motion for class\n\n1\n.    CDC apparently filed a third-party complaint against W.W.\n     Grainger, Inc. (\"Grainger\"), and American Machine and Tool\n     Co., Inc. of Pennsylvania (\"American Machine\"), and Dial\n     Medical filed a third-party complaint against Baxter\n     Healthcare Corp. (\"Baxter\"). Dial Medical, Grainger, and\n     American Machine have since been dismissed from this appeal\n     pursuant to stipulations of dismissal filed with the\n     district court, and Baxter was not a party to this appeal.\n\fmaintenance,\" seeking certification of the class described in his\n\namended complaint -- fifty-three CDC patients who have tested\n\npositive for serum aluminum levels of greater that 100 micrograms\n\nper liter (mcg/l) since January, 1990.\n\n           Shortly thereafter, Edwin Snead, who had earlier filed\n\na similar class action complaint against CDC and its two medical\n\ndirectors in state court, moved to intervene in Trent's lawsuit.\n\nSnead, whose wife had died of aluminum poisoning after receiving\n\ndialysis treatment at CDC, sought in his case to represent a\n\nclass comprised of all CDC patients injured by CDC's allegedly\n\ndefective dialysis equipment and methods.   Snead's complaint\n\nalleged negligence and outrageous conduct and included counts for\n\nwrongful death and survival.\n\n           In November 1992, the district court granted Snead's\n\nmotion to intervene, denied Trent's motion for class\n\ncertification and sua sponte decided to abstain from hearing the\nTrent case in light of the pendency of the Snead case in state\n\ncourt.   The following order issued:\n                The motion of Edwin Snead . . . to\n           intervene as a party plaintiff is GRANTED.\n\n                The motion of plaintiff Earl Trent for\n           class certification is DENIED without\n           prejudice.\n\n                This suit is DISMISSED WITHOUT\n           PREJUDICE. This case is to remain in status\n           quo and the Statute of Limitations is tolled.\n\n                It is further understood that all\n           discovery and settlement discussions will\n           continue in coordination with the action\n           currently pending in the Delaware County\n           Court of Common Pleas styled Snead v.\n\f          Community Dialysis Center, Inc. . . . .

Stating that it \"anticipates that discovery will reveal to a\n     legal certainty that plaintiff will not be able to recover\n     the jurisdictional amount of $50,000,\" CDC urges that the\n     district court may not have had diversity jurisdiction over\n     this case. CDC's brief at 12 (footnote omitted). Trent's\n     complaint, however, alleges damages in excess of $50,000,\n     exclusive of interest and costs. Unless it appears to a\n     legal certainty from the facts alleged that this case does\n     not involve potential damages on that scale, the district\n     court had jurisdiction. Nelson v.

Cone, the Supreme Court held that a stay\n\ngrounded in the pendency of similar litigation in state court is\n\nappealable if it \"effectively deprive[s] the plaintiff of its\n\nright to a federal forum because once the state court\n\nadjudicate[s] the issues in the case, a federal court would be\n\nbound to honor those determinations as res judicata.\"     Schall,\n\n885 F.2d at 104.    Under Moses H. Cone, even if a stay order is\n\nentered with the expectation that the federal litigation will\n\nresume if the plaintiff does not obtain relief in state court,\n\nthe stay decision may be appealed if \"the object of the stay is\n\nto require all or an essential part of the federal suit to be\n\nlitigated in a state forum.\"    Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 10 n.11.\n\n           That is precisely the effect the district court's order\n\nwill have here.    It is clear that the district court judge\n\nexpected that Snead would resolve this case, at least in large\npart.   A decision in Snead will constitute res judicata as to at\n\nleast the two major issues (duty and breach) in Trent.3\n\n3\n.    CDC has asserted a counterclaim against Trent in his lawsuit\n     alleging that he has failed to pay for his dialysis\n     treatments. Snead may not resolve this counterclaim,\n     although, depending on the substance of Trent's defense to\n\fEffectively requiring Trent either to wait until Snead is\nresolved or to remain in the Snead class deprives him of the\n\nopportunity to pursue remedies in federal court, thus\n\nconstituting a requirement that \"all or an essential part of the\n\nfederal suit . . . be litigated in a state forum.\"     Moses H.\n\nCone, 460 U.S. at 10 n.11.      Since issuing the order in question,\n\nin fact, the district court has denied as moot a motion to file a\n\nsecond amended complaint, thus implying that it believes it has\n\neffectively disposed of the case.\n\n           In Moses H. Cone, \"[t]he Court distinguished between\n\nstay orders that `merely . . . have the practical effect of\n\nallowing a state court to be the first to rule on a common issue'\n\n(such as an `ordinary delay in the interest of docket control')\n\nand stay orders whose `sole purpose and effect . . . are\n\nprecisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federal suit to a state\n\ncourt.'   . . .    Only the latter type of stay order is immediately\n\nappealable.\"      Schall, 885 F.2d at 104, quoting Moses H. Cone, 460\n\nU.S. at 10 n.11.     CDC attempts to categorize this case as one in\n\nwhich the district court has issued a stay merely to afford the\n\nstate court an opportunity to rule first on a common issue.       It\n\nsees this order as an attempt at docket control rather than an\n\naction which effectively dismisses Trent's case.     Thus, it argues\n\nthat we lack jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n     it, it is conceivable that even that counterclaim may be\n     resolved by a verdict in Snead.\n\f             Indeed, portions of the order point in the direction\n\nCDC indicates.     The order provides that \"the case is to remain in\n\nthe status quo\" and that \"all discovery and settlement discussion\n\nwill continue in coordination with the action currently pending\n\nin . . . Snead.\"     App. at 185.   It also instructs the parties\n\nthat the judge will be amenable to intervening if the parties ask\n\nhim to do so, and that they should keep him \"advised of the\n\nstatus of this case and the state court action.\"     Id.   In the\n\nsame vein, it provides that \"[w]hen [the parties] are ready for\n\ntrial or wish a settlement conference all that is necessary is to\n\nwrite directly to the court or set a telephone conference.\"         App.\n\nat 185-86.    Moreover, since entering the order, the district\n\ncourt judge has denied a motion to stay discovery pending this\n\nappeal, thus perhaps implying that he expects discovery to\n\ncontinue because the case is still pending.4\n\n             The order's unintended lack of clarity, which has been\n\nexacerbated by the denial of the discovery motion, does not,\n\nhowever, compel a conclusion that we lack appellate jurisdiction.\n\nTwo relevant precedents assist in line-drawing here, and\n\ncomparison with those cases provides the focus for our decision\n\nthat we have appellate jurisdiction.\n\n             In Cheyney State College Faculty v. Hufstedler, supra,\n\nwe examined a district court's decision to abstain from a class\n\n\n4\n.    Of course, this could alternatively imply that the judge\n     believes he has no jurisdiction to consider the motion to\n     stay discovery because the case has been dismissed.\n\faction suit alleging segregation in the Pennsylvania higher\n\neducation system until the United States Department of Education\n\nhad adjudicated administrative procedures regarding the\n\nallegation.   We acknowledged Moses H. Cone's holding that,\nalthough a stay is not ordinarily a final decision, an appellate\n\ncourt may review it when it \"amounts to a dismissal of the\n\nunderlying suit.\"   Cheyney, 703 F.2d at 735.    We also\n\nacknowledged that \"[a]n indefinite stay order that unreasonably\n\ndelays a plaintiff's right to have his case heard is appealable.\"\n\nId.   We held, however, that \"[t]he stay in this case does not\n\nhave the practical effect of a dismissal.    Nothing in the\n\ndistrict court's opinion or order intimates that the stay was\n\nintended to `deep six' the suit.   Plaintiffs have not been put\n\n`effectively out of court.'   . . .   Nor is the case `rife with\n\nspecial circumstances which bring it outside the general rule and\n\nso limit its precedential value as to not measurably weaken our\n\ncontinued aversion to piecemeal appeals.'\"      Id.   Rather, based in\n\nlarge part on the district court's instruction that the parties\n\nreport to it on the progress of the administrative proceedings,\n\nwe were \"convinced\" that \"this stay [was] merely a temporary\n\nsuspension of proceedings.\"   Id. at 735.    Therefore, we\n\ndetermined that we lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from the\n\nstay order because the district court was only abstaining until\n\nthe plaintiffs proceeded on the administrative level.       There was\n\nno indication that the outcome of the administrative proceeding\n\nwould deprive plaintiffs of their day in federal court.\n\f          Conversely, in Schall, we held that a district court's\ndecision to stay a case pending the disposition of a state court\n\ncase was appealable because:   (1) there was no indication that\n\nthe order was tentative (i.e., there was no basis to suppose that\n\nthe district judge contemplated any reconsideration of his\n\ndecision to defer to the parallel state-court suit (quoting Moses\n\nH. Cone)); (2) the district court had instructed the plaintiff to\n\nproceed in state court and then ordered the stay pending the\n\noutcome of those state court proceedings, leading us to believe\n\nthat \"the district court stayed the suit to relegate the\n\nplaintiff to state court rather than to exercise control over its\n\ndocket\"; and (3) the issues in the state court suit constituted\n\nthe heart of the federal court suit, thus effectively preventing\n\nthe litigation in federal court of a significant part of\n\nplaintiff's federal case.   Schall, 885 F.2d at 105.\n\n          Arguably, unlike Schall, the order on appeal here\n\nindicates that the district court might reconsider whether to\n\ndefer to Snead.   The court's statements that it will \"intervene\"\n\nif asked and will set a trial date or a settlement conference\n\nupon request imply not only that it recognizes that there may be\n\nsome issues remaining after Snead is disposed of, but also that\nit might try the case whenever the parties (apparently jointly)\n\nseek a trial date.   Like Schall, however, the issues in Snead\n\nprovide the central focus of this case, so the district court's\n\norder effectively prevents litigation of Trent's claims in\n\nfederal court and requires him to abide by the state court\n\ndecision in Snead.   (Although Snead alleges more legal bases for\n\frelief that the Trent case does, the allegations of the Trent\ncase are subsumed within Snead.)   Unlike Cheyney, then, this stay\n\nhas the practical effect of a dismissal rather than merely\n\ndelaying adjudication until completion of administrative or state\n\ncourt proceedings.   Therefore, we conclude that, like the orders\n\nin Schall and Moses H. Cone, this stay order is immediately\n\nappealable and we may exercise jurisdiction over it.\n\n                               III.\n\n          The district court decided to defer exercising\n\njurisdiction over this case under the \"exceptional circumstances\"\n\ndoctrine of Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v.

Therefore, we initially\n\ninquire whether the Trent case and the Snead case are parallel.\n\n          Generally, cases are parallel so as to justify\n\nabstention under Colorado River when they involve the same\n\nparties and claims.   In LaDuke, a plaintiff sued his employer in\n\nstate court and then filed an identical suit in federal court.\n\nThe cases were \"parallel\" because they involved identical parties\n\nand claims.

Cone, 460 U.S. at 7; Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 805-06.\n\nThus, those cases, too, were parallel.\n\n          In contrast, when a federal court case involves claims\n\nthat are distinct from those at issue in a state court case, the\n\fcases are not parallel and do not justify Colorado River\nabstention.   In University of Maryland, for example, we reversed\n\na district court's dismissal of a class action fraud case filed\n\nby policyholders of an insolvent insurance company against the\n\ninsurance company's independent auditor.    The district court\n\ndecided to abstain under Burford v. Sun Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1943) (see note 5, supra), in favor of a state court case\n\nagainst the same auditor brought by the Pennsylvania insurance\n\ncommissioner on behalf of the insurance company and its\n\npolicyholders.   Although the district court had based its\n\ndecision upon Burford, we reviewed its decision under both\n\nBurford and Colorado River.\n\n          We reversed the district court because the parties and\n\nclaims in each of the two cases differed.    The insolvent\n\ninsurance company was a party to the state court suit but not to\n\nthe one brought in federal court.   The classes of policyholders\n\ninvolved in each case differed.    And the insurance commissioner's\n\nlawsuit alleged fewer legal bases for relief than did the federal\n\ncourt suit.   University of Maryland, 923 F.2d at 268-69.\n\nTherefore, the policyholders' claims in the federal court case\n\nwere \"distinct\" from those asserted in the commissioner's case;\n\nbecause of this \"lack of identity of all issues,\" and because\n\nthere was \"no theoretical obstacle to both actions proceeding\n\nindependently,\" we ruled that abstention under Colorado River\nwould be improper.   Id. at 276.\n\n          Similarly, in Complaint of Bankers Trust, we admonished\nthat \"[i]t is important . . . that only truly duplicative\n\fproceedings be avoided.   When the claims, parties, or requested\n\nrelief differ, deference may not be appropriate.\"     Complaint of\nBankers Trust, 636 F.2d at 40.    In that case, we reviewed a\n\nfederal district court's decision to defer in favor of litigation\n\npending in another federal district court.      Because neither the\n\nparties to nor the relief requested in the two cases at issue\n\nwere identical, and because the two cases employed substantially\n\ndifferent \"approaches\" and might \"achieve potentially different\n\nresults,\" we reversed the district court's \"docket-control\n\ndismissal\" of one of the cases.    Id. at 41.\n\n          In this case, the district court ruled that Trent and\n\nSnead were parallel because it found them to be \"substantially\n\nidentical.\"   App. at 180.   The two cases do in fact raise nearly\n\nidentical allegations and issues, and the defendants in each are\n\nessentially identical.6   Moreover, as the district court found,\n\nthe plaintiffs in the two cases are effectively the same.7      That\n\n6\n.    The Snead case in state court includes as defendants the two\n     medical directors of CDC in addition to CDC itself. This\n     does not trouble us, since abstention will in no way deny\n     Trent an opportunity to have his claims litigated against\n     the remaining defendant in this federal suit -- CDC. See\n     supra n.1.\n7\n.    The court stated:\n\n          The class previously certified by the state\n          court includes all CDC patients who utilized\n          the defective dialysis equipment at CDC and\n          suffered injury as a result. Although the\n          putative class defined by plaintiff Trent is\n          somewhat more limited, he relies upon the\n          same allegations of negligence.\n\n     App. at 180 (emphasis added).\n\fSnead has been certified only as to duty and breach of that duty\ndoes not negate the fact that the determination of those issues\n\nin Snead will resolve them in Trent.     Trent's decision not to opt\n\nout of Snead8 means that Snead will result in recovery for him if\n\nthe class prevails on the class-wide issues and he is found to\n\nhave suffered damages as a result of the defendants' actions.     In\n\nsum, Trent and Snead are parallel and thus present an appropriate\n\nsetting for Colorado River abstention.\n\n                                C.\n\n          Given that this case is one in which Colorado River\n\nabstention may be appropriate, we now must determine whether the\n\ndecision to abstain constituted an abuse of the district court's\n\ndiscretion.   We conclude that it did not.\n\n     In fact, the class in Snead had not yet been certified at\n     the time the district court decided to abstain. App. at\n     177. Subsequent events have nonetheless proven the district\n     court judge to have been prescient, for, as previously\n     noted, the judge handling Snead has, during the pendency of\n     this appeal, certified a class consisting of \"all persons\n     who received bicarbonate dialysate treatments at CDC's\n     Lansdowne facility between January 1, 1990 and February 7,\n     1992, the spouses of all such patients and the\n     administrators and the executors of the estates of such\n     persons and/or their spouses.\" Attachment to Letter from P.\n     Quinn to P. Lester (Deputy Clerk, Third Circuit) of June 30,\n     1994 (state court order in Snead granting class\n     certification). Clearly, Trent would be a member of that\n     class.\n8\n.    Trent states that he intends to move for permission to opt\n     out of the Snead class after receiving our decision in this\n     appeal. At oral argument, he expressed an intention to\n     pursue his case on an individual basis instead of as a class\n     action. We cannot assume that his belated motion to opt out\n     of the Snead class will be granted, however, so we must\n     consider him to be a member of the Snead class as we decide\n     this appeal.\n\f          The factors which govern a district court's exercise of\n\ndiscretion in deciding whether to abstain under Colorado River\nare:\n          (1)     Which court first assumed jurisdiction\n                  over property involved, if any;\n\n          (2)     Whether the federal forum is\n                  inconvenient;\n\n          (3)     The desirability of avoiding piecemeal\n                  litigation;\n\n          (4)     The order in which the respective courts\n                  obtained jurisdiction;\n\n          (5)     Whether federal or state law applies;\n                  and\n\n          (6)     Whether the state court proceeding would\n                  adequately protect the federal\n                  plaintiff's rights.\n\n\nSee generally Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 15-16, 19-26; see also\n\nColorado River, 424 U.S. at 818-19 (\"No one factor is necessarily\n\ndeterminative; a carefully considered judgment taking into\n\naccount both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the\n\ncombination of factors counselling against that exercise is\n\nrequired. . . .    Only the clearest of justifications will warrant\n\ndismissal.\").\n\n          Many factors weigh in favor of abstention in this case.\n\nThe principal reasons to abstain, once abstention has been found\n\nto be possible, are to avoid piecemeal litigation and to\n\nadjudicate state-law issues in state court.       Cf. DeCisneros v.\n\nYounger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520591\"><a href=\"/opinion/520591/ela-f-de-cisneros-v-robert-younger-and-overall-construction/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309 (2d Cir. 1989).       Here, state rather\n\nthan federal law is at issue, and piecemeal litigation might\n\fresult if the district court presided over Trent while Snead was\nprogressing through the state court system.      Moreover, the class\n\ncertified in Snead is broader than that asserted in Trent.      Snead\n\nthus will resolve more individuals' claims than Trent would; it\n\nmakes more sense to resolve common issues in a setting which will\n\ndispose of the most claims.       Finally, Snead was filed before\n\nTrent and, more importantly under Moses H. Cone, it appears as if\n\nSnead has invested more time into substantive work and discovery\n\nin his case.    See App. at 32.\n\n          In sum, because the parties agree that there is no res\n\nover which any court has exercised jurisdiction, only one factor\n\ntruly weighs in favor of the district court exercising federal\n\njurisdiction.   That is simply that the federal forum is not\n\ninconvenient.   This alone, even given the obligation federal\n\ncourts have to exercise their jurisdiction, cannot justify a\n\ndecision to exercise jurisdiction when the countervailing factors\n\nweigh so heavily in favor of abstention.      Accordingly, we will\n\naffirm.\n\f                                IV.\n\n            Trent and CDC also argue that the district court erred\n\nin granting Snead's motion to intervene because Snead had not\n\ncomplied with the requirements of Rule 24(c) of the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure in filing it.9     We need not reach the merits\n\nof this argument on appeal because orders granting intervention\n\nare not final for purposes of appeal.
