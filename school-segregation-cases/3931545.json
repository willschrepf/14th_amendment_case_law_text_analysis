      "posture": "Application of E. S. Wilhite for a writ of mandamus to M. R. Mansfield and others. Writ awarded.\n\nOn the 7th day of August, A.D. 1908, the plaintiff, E. S. Wilhite, of Alfalfa county, for himself and all other resident taxpayers similarly situated, instituted this action for peremptory mandamus to compel M. R. Mansfield, John Zimmerman, and J. C McWilliams, as the board of county commissioners of Alfalfa county, to appoint trustees for what is alleged to be the high school of Alfalfa county, situated at Helena therein. He alleges that ever since the 16th day of November, A.D. 1907, he has been an actual resident and taxpayer of Alfalfa county, Okla., having a\nson and daughter who are entitled to attend the county high school at Helena in said county, and that prior to the 16th day, of November, A.D. 1907, he has been an actual resident and taxpayer in the then county of Woods, territory of Oklahoma, for more than four years; that prior to November 16, A.D. 1907, the territory embracing Alfalfa county was a part and parcel of Woods county, Okla. T., and that, under and by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of Oklahoma, Alfalfa county embraces territory which prior to November 16, A.D. 1907, was included in Woods county, Okla. T.; that prior to the 8th day of November, A.D. 1904, the then board of county commissioners of Woods county, Okla. T., having investigated the matter of the establishment of a high school near Helena in said county, and having exercised their discretion and judgment in the matter regarding the matter to be submitted to the voters of said county according to law, after resolution duly passed to give due and legal notice of the submission of the question as to whether or not the high school should be established at the town of Helena in said county to the qualified voters therein, as required by section 2, art. 1, c. 28, p. 187, of the Session Laws of said territory for 1901; that at said election held in said county on the 8th day of November, A.D. 1904, said proposition as to the establishment of said high school at said place was submitted to the qualified voters of said county, and was duly and legally voted upon by the electors, and that the returns of said election have been duly canvassed by proper officers and made to the then board of county commissioners of Woods county in said territory, and the result of said election announced and made of record; that at said election there were cast, canvassed, and counted for the establishment of said high school for the county of Woods at Helena 2,509 legal votes, and against the establishment of said high school 2,140 votes, a majority of the votes of what is now Alfalfa county having been cast in favor of the establishment of said high school, and said question as to the establishment of said high school carried by a majority of 369 votes; that the result of said election was duly announced, and the high school established\nat the town of Helena in said county, under and by virtue of the provisions of chapter 28, p. 187, of the Session Laws of the territory of Oklahoma for the year 1901. He further alleges that six qualified property owners were appointed a board of trustees, and that they qualified and entered upon the discharge of such duties, procured a site for the erection and construction of said high school building, and caused the building to be constructed in which to conduct the school, and purchased the supplies, materials, and equipment for said school; that ever since said building was constructed and said school furnished with the necessary equipment it has been a going and flourishing institution, located in the town of Helena; that said board of trustees of said high school contracted for an expenditure of about $20,000, which was a reasonable, legal, and proper expenditure; that since the 16th day of November, A.D. 1907, vacancies have occurred in the office of the board of trustees of said school, and that at the present time there is no board of trustees authorized to act as such for said high school, and that it is necessary that a board of trustees for said school be appointed immediately in order that said board may immediately reorganize and employ a suitable person to take charge of said school as principal and employ such assistant teachers as may be necessary, provide salaries therefor, and appoint a secretary and treasurer, who shall perform such duties devolving upon such officers as required by law, and that they shall proceed to make an itemized estimate of the amount of funds needed for the payment of teachers' wages and contingent expenses, and other necessary expenses which may be incurred in the conduct of said school for the coming year, and that they shall present to the board of county commissioners of Alfalfa county certified estimate of the rate of tax required to raise the amount necessary, for such purpose, as required by law.\n\nIt is further alleged that under the provisions of the act of the Oklahoma Legislature, approved April 10, A.D. 1908 (Laws 1907-08, p. 280, c. 26, art. 2), the title to the high school building erected at Helena has become the property of Alfalfa county, and that the\nschool located at Helena became and is a part and parcel of Alfalfa county, and that the board of county commissioners of said county should appoint a board of trustees as provided by law, in order that such high school may be a going and existing institution.\n\nPlaintiff further alleges that he made demand for the appointment of the trustees of said high school, and that the board of county commissioners refused to make such appointment.\n\nThe county attorney of Alfalfa county, acting for the board of county commissioners, entered into an agreed statement of facts, which supports the foregoing allegations.\n\nL. A. Salter, F. N. Winslow, W. T. Barrett, A. J. Titus, A. H. Stroud, Luther Martin, J. W. Howard, and S. B. McFadden, having obtained leave of this court, intervened in this action, and alleged that they were residents of Alfalfa county, and owners of property aggregating the value of $250,000, which was subject to taxation. They demurred to the sufficiency of plaintiff's complaint and the agreed statement of facts, insisting that on the facts alleged and agreed to by the county attorney the plaintiff was not entitled to the writ of mandamus to compel the board of county commissioners of Alfalfa county to appoint trustees for the alleged high school, and that there is no high school in Alfalfa county.",
