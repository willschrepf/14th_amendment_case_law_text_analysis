FILED: August 18, 2014\n\n\n       Leach, J. — The city of Shoreline and Deputy Mayor Maggie Fimia (collectively\n\nCity) appeal a trial court decision awarding costs and attorney fees to Beth and Doug\n\nO'Neill under the Public Records Act.1 The City claims that the O'Neills lost their right to\n\nthis recovery because they filed their fee request more than 10 days after the court\n\nentered a stipulated judgment on their damage claim. Because the City fails to show\n\nprejudice from the O'Neills' failure to file their fee request within the time required by CR\n\n54(d)(2), we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n        Ch. 42.56 RCW.\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 2\n\n\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n\n       In 2006, the O'Neills sued the City, alleging violations of the Public Records Act.2\nOn August 2, 2012, on remand from our Supreme Court, the trial court granted partial\nsummary judgment in favor of the O'Neills. In its order, the court stated,\n               The Court HEREBY Orders that pursuant to RCW 42.56.550(4)\n       Plaintiffs shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and all costs\n       incurred in this action to date, and statutory penalties, to be determined\n       after subsequent briefing and argument. Plaintiffs shall be entitled to an\n       award of reasonable attorney's fees and all costs incurred in connection\n       with such fee and penalty motions, the amounts of which shall be\n       determined by the Court in conjunction with the fee and penalty motions.\nThe court denied the City's motion for reconsideration.\n\n       On September 18, 2012, the City made an offer of judgment to the O'Neills. This\noffer stated,\n\n                The Defendants, pursuant to CR 68, offer to allow judgment to be\n       entered against them in this matter for $100,000.00 (One Hundred\n       Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents) for daily penalties. This amount does\n       not include costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred to date, which shall\n       be awarded in an amount to be determined by the Superior Court after\n       subsequent briefing and argument.\n\nThe O'Neills accepted this offer on September 27, 2012.\n\n        On October 9, 2012, the trial court entered a stipulated judgment on the offer and\n\n acceptance, which stated,\n\n        This matter came before the Court for entry of judgment under CR 68 on\n        the O'Neills' acceptance of the City of Shoreline's and Maggie Fimia's\n        offer of judgment for $100,000.00 (One Hundred Thousand Dollars and\n        Zero Cents) for daily penalties only. True copies of the offer, acceptance\n        and proof of service of the same are attached as Exhibit A.\n\n\n\n        2O'Neill v. City of Shoreline, 170 Wn.2d 138, 144, 240 P.3d 1149 (2010).\n                                             -2-\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 3\n\n\n      Based on the offer of judgment and acceptance, Judgment is entered\n      against the City of Shoreline and Maggie Fimia for $100,000.00 (One\n      Hundred Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents) for daily penalties. This\n      amount does not include costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred to date,\n      which shall be awarded in an amount to be determined by the Superior\n      Court after subsequent briefing and argument.\n\n       On September 28, 2012, after the O'Neills accepted the City's offer of judgment\n\nbut before the court entered its judgment on the offer, the City sought discovery about\n\nthe amount of attorney fees. The O'Neills responded to the City's discovery requests on\n\nOctober 29, 2012. On November 1, the City sent a letter to the O'Neills stating,\n\n       You accepted the offer of judgment on September 24, 2012, the court\n       entered the final judgment on October 8, 2012 [sic] and a copy of the\n       signed order was provided to you on October 11, 2012. King County\n       Superior Court Rule 54(d)(2) required you to submit your claim for\n       attorneys' fees no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment, i.e.,\n       October 18, 2012. An alternative deadline is not provided by the court's\n       October 8, 2012 order or the Public Records Act. Thus, it is the City's and\n       Fimia's position that you have waived any claim for attorneys' fees and\n       any subsequently filed request must be denied by the court as untimely.\n       See Corev v. Pierce County, 154 Wn. App 752, 225 P.3d 367 (2010)\n       (despite successful recovery of a judgment for wages and salary owed,\n       plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was properly denied due to her failure\n       to file her attorney's fees request within the 10 day time limitation under\n       CR 54(d)(2)).\n\n       Therefore, although your discovery responses are deficient, issues\n       regarding production of records responsive to the discovery requests\n       appear to be moot.\n\n       On November 5, 2012, the O'Neills moved for determination ofthe amount of the\n\nfee and cost award. On November 6, they responded to the City's letter, asserting,\n\n\"Defendants had no intention of pursuing the completely improper discovery requests\n\nthey issued. Defendants clearly issued it solely to delay any filing of a fee motion so\n they could make the argument the fee motion was waived.\" In response, the City\n argued that the O'Neills waived their right to attorney fees because they failed to comply\n\fNo. 70657-8-1/4\n\n\n\nwith the 10-day time limit in CR 54(d). The O'Neills replied that the 10-day time limit did\nnot apply, contending that the court's judgment on the offer and acceptance was not a\njudgment for the purposes of CR 54(d) because it did not contain a judgment summary,\nas RCW 4.64.030(2)(a) required. The O'Neills also asserted that the City made its\ndiscovery request \"to delay a fee motion filing\" and claimed that if the 10-day limit\napplied, they had demonstrated excusable neglect. The City filed a surreply asking the\ncourt to strike the fee motion as untimely on the basis that the O'Neills failed to file a CR\n\n6 motion to excuse their failure to meet the 10-day deadline and find that they had not\n\nshown excusable neglect.\n\n       At a hearing on the O'Neills' fee motion, the court told the City, \"I'm not\nconcerned about the 54 issue, so let's just talk about your rates.\" The record contains\n\nno finding of excusable neglect. The court granted the O'Neills' motion.\n       On June 28, 2013, the trial court entered an order awarding the O'Neills\n$428,966.18 for fees and $9,588.79 for costs. The court denied the City's motion for\n reconsideration.\n\n       The City appeals.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The parties ask us to determine if, in the absence of a finding of excusable\n neglect, the trial court had the legal authority to enter an order awarding fees and costs\n when the O'Neills filed their request for this relief more than 10 days after the court\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 5\n\n\n\n\nentered judgment on the offer for damages and its acceptance. We review this question\n\nof law de novo.3\n\n      We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.4 A\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or is based on\n\nuntenable grounds.5\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\n       The City contends that the trial court erred by considering the O'Neills' motion for\n\ndetermination of the amount of fees and costs because they filed it more than 10 days\n\nafter the court entered a stipulated judgment for damages in their favor.         The City\n\nasserts that the trial court must, but did not, make a finding of excusable neglect before\n\nit could consider the O'Neills' untimely motion. We disagree.\n\n       CR 54(d)(2) requires a party seeking attorney fees and expenses to file a claim\n\nby motion \"no later than 10 days after entry of judgment.\" CR 6(b) provides procedures\nfor enlarging the time specified in this rule.6 CR 6(b) specifically prohibits extending the\n\n\n       3 Klem v. Wash. Mut. Bank, 176 Wn.2d 771, 782, 295 P.3d 1179 (2013) (citing\nUdall v. T.D. Escrow Servs., Inc., 159 Wn.2d 903, 908, 154 P.3d 882 (2007)).\n       4 Brinnon Grp. v. Jefferson County, 159 Wn. App. 446, 485, 245 P.3d 789 (2011)\n(citing Lilly v. Lynch, 88 Wn. App. 306, 321, 945 P.2d 727 (1997)).\n       5 State v. Emery, 161 Wn. App. 172, 190, 253 P.3d 413 (2011) (quoting State v.\nAllen, 159 Wn.2d 1, 10, 147 P.3d 581 (2006)).\n       6 CR 6(b) states,\n         Enlargement. When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or\n         by order of court an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a\n         specified time, the court for cause shown may at any time in its\n         discretion, (1) with or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged\n         if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally\n         prescribed or as extended by a previous order or, (2) upon motion made\n         after the expiration of the specified period, permit the act to be done\n         where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect; but it may\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 6\n\n\n\n\ntime for taking action under rules 50(b), 52(b), 59(b), 59(d), and 60(b). The O'Neills\n\nnever filed a motion to enlarge time. The City claims that this omission resulted in the\n\nO'Neills' waiver of any right to recover fees and costs.\n\n       Neither party cited in its briefing what we consider to be the controlling authority,\n\nGoucher v. J.R. Simplot Co.7 In Goucher, the defendant filed a motion in limine the first\n\nday of trial, in violation of the time requirements of CR 6(d).8 Our Supreme Court\nrejected the plaintiff's contention that the trial court erred in considering the motion,\n\nstating, \"'CR 6(d) is not jurisdictional, and that reversal for failure to comply requires a\n\nshowing of prejudice.'\"9 A party establishes prejudice by showing \"a lack of actual\n\nnotice, a lack of time to prepare for the motion, and no opportunity to provide\n\ncountervailing oral argument and submit case authority.\"10\n       The City has offered no meaningful distinction between the time requirements of\n\nCR 6(d) and CR 54(d)(2), and we see none. The identification in CR 6(b) of specific\n\n         not extend the time for taking any action under rules 50(b), 52(b), 59(b),\n         59(d), and 60(b).\n       7 104 Wn.2d 662, 709 P.2d 774 (1985).\n       8 Goucher, 104 Wn.2d at 664-65. CR 6(d) states,\n         A written motion, other than one which may be heard ex parte, and\n         notice of the hearing thereof shall be served not later than 5 days before\n         the time specified for the hearing, unless a different period is fixed by\n         these rules or by order of the court. Such an order may for cause shown\n         be made on ex parte application. When a motion is supported by\n         affidavit, the affidavit shall be served with the motion; and, except as\n         otherwise provided in rule 59(c), opposing affidavits may be served not\n         later than 1 day before the hearing, unless the court permits them to be\n         served at some other time.\n       9 Goucher, 104 Wn.2d at 665 (quoting Brown v. Safewav Stores, Inc., 94 Wn.2d\n359, 364, 617 P.2d 704 (1980)); Loveless v. Yantis, 82 Wn.2d 754, 759-60, 513 P.2d\n1023(1973).\n       10 Zimnv v. Lovric, 59 Wn. App. 737, 740, 801 P.2d 259 (1990) (citing Goucher,\n 104 Wn.2d at 665; Loveless, 82 Wn.2d at 759-60).\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 7\n\n\n\n\ntime requirements in rules that cannot be enlarged strongly supports the conclusion that\n\nGoucher applies to the other time requirements of the civil rules.         Here, the City\n\nconceded at oral argument that it demonstrated no prejudice to the trial court.\n\nTherefore, even if the O'Neills failed to comply with the 10-day time limit, they did not\n\nwaive their right to recover fees.\n\n        The City cites Corey v. Pierce County in support of its position. But Corey merely\n\naffirmed a trial court's exercise of discretion to enforce the time requirements of CR\n\n54(d)(2) and did not address whether a court must enforce them.11\n\n        In view of our resolution of the City's claim, we need not, and do not, resolve the\n\nO'Neills' assertion that the stipulated judgment for damages was not a judgment for\n\npurpose of CR 54(d)(2). However, we do address two matters that arose in this case\n\nand occur with disturbing frequency—statements of additional authorities and motions\n\nto strike.\n\n\n        At the direction of the panel deciding this case, a case manager contacted\n\ncounsel for the parties and asked them to be prepared to discuss a case not cited in\n\ntheir briefing, Goucher v. J.R. Simplot Co.       Shortly afterward, the O'Neills filed a\n\nstatement of additional authorities listing Goucher, two cases cited in Goucher, and two\n\nother cases. This filing provided no new information and wasted the time of the court.\n\nRAP 10.8 allows parties to file statements of additional authorities. We view this rule as\n\nbeing intended to provide parties an opportunity to cite authority decided after the\n\n\n\n\n        11 Corey, 154 Wn. App. at 774.\n                                            -7-\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 8\n\n\n\n\ncompletion of briefing. We do not view it as being intended to permit parties to submit\n\nto the court cases that they failed to timely identify when preparing their briefs.\n\n       The City moved to strike a sentence in the O'Neills' brief, stating, \"While there\n\nexist unpublished authority, post dating [sic] Corey, rejecting Defendants' CR 54(d)(2)\n\nwaiver claims in a stipulated judgment context, there is no known case, published or\n\notherwise, accepting the arguments Defendants make here in the stipulated judgment\n\ncontext.\"   The City also asks us to impose sanctions on the O'Neills for citing\n\nunpublished authority.\n\n       GR 14.1(a) prohibits a party from citing as authority an unpublished opinion of\n\nthe court of appeals. Although the O'Neills refer to \"unpublished authority,\" they do not\n\nrely on any unpublished decisions to support their arguments. Rather, they made the\n\nquoted statement as part of their claim that no authority supports the City's waiver\n\nargument. The City provides no basis to strike the cited sentence from the O'Neills'\n\nbrief or to impose sanctions. We deny the City's motion and request for sanctions.\n\n       Because of the frequency with which litigants file motions to strike portions of\n\nbriefs we quote two pertinent authorities: \"Motions to strike sentences or sections out of\n\nbriefs waste everyone's time.\"12\n\n       No one at the Court of Appeals goes through the record or the briefs with\n       a stamp or scissors to prevent the judges who are hearing the case from\n       seeing material deemed irrelevant or prejudicial. So long as there is an\n       opportunity (as there was here) to include argument in the party's brief,\n       the brief is the appropriate vehicle for pointing out allegedly extraneous\n       materials—not a separate motion to strike.[13]\n\n       12 Redwood v. Dobson, 476 F.3d 462, 471 (7th Cir. 2007).\n       13 Enastrom v. Goodman, 166 Wn. App. 905, 909 n.2, 271 P.3d 959, review\ndenied, 175Wn.2d 1004(2012).\n                                              -8-\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 9\n\n\n\n          The O'Neills request attorney fees on appeal under RAP 18.1 and RCW\n\n42.56.550(4), which permits a prevailing requester in a Public Records Act action to\n\nrecover all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred in connection with the\n\naction.     To determine the reasonableness of attorney fees, the court calculates a\n\nlodestar figure.14 This requires the court to determine the number of hours reasonably\n\nexpended in the litigation.15 The court limits the lodestar to hours reasonably expended\n\nand therefore discounts hours spent on unsuccessful claims, duplicated effort, or\n\notherwise unproductive time.16\n\n          A party in Public Records Act litigation may recover attorney fees only for work\n\non successful issues.17 When a party may recover fees on only some of its claims, the\n\naward must reflect a segregation of the time spent on the varying claims.18 The court\n\nseparates time spent on theories essential to the successful claim from time spent on\n\ntheories related to other claims.19 But \"[i]f the court finds that claims are so related that\n\nsegregation is not reasonable, then it need not segregate the attorney fees.\"20\n          RCW 42.56.550(4) \"shall be liberally construed to promote . . . full access to\n\npublic records.\"21 It provides for a more liberal recovery of costs than does RCW\n\n          14 Bowers v.

In recognition of\n\nthe strong public policy underlying the Public Records Act, we award the O'Neills\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal, subject to the foregoing limitations.\n\n      The O'Neills also ask that we impose sanctions against the City under RAP\n\n18.9(a), which permits an appellate court to impose sanctions on a party or counsel\n\n\"who uses these rules for the purpose of delay, files a frivolous appeal, or fails to\n\ncomply with these rules to pay terms or compensatory damages to any other party who\n\nhas been harmed by the delay or the failure to comply or to pay sanctions to the court.\"\n\nThe O'Neills allege, \"Defendants' claims they could not have submitted discovery any\n\nsooner than the day after submitting the Agreed Order to the court for approval is not\n\ncredible or logical. Defendants clearly sought to negotiate a contract and Agreed Order\n\nthey had no intention of performing.\" They assert, \"This appeal and the Defendants'\n\narguments to void their contractual obligations have no merit.\"\n\n      An appeal is not frivolous or brought for purposes of delay if it involves\n\n\"'debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ.'\"24       Because the City\n\npresented debatable arguments about the applicability of CR 54(d)(2), we conclude that\n\n\n\n\n      22 Am.

FILED: August 18, 2014\n\n\n       Leach, J. — The city of Shoreline and Deputy Mayor Maggie Fimia (collectively\n\nCity) appeal a trial court decision awarding costs and attorney fees to Beth and Doug\n\nO'Neill under the Public Records Act.1 The City claims that the O'Neills lost their right to\n\nthis recovery because they filed their fee request more than 10 days after the court\n\nentered a stipulated judgment on their damage claim. Because the City fails to show\n\nprejudice from the O'Neills' failure to file their fee request within the time required by CR\n\n54(d)(2), we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n        Ch. 42.56 RCW.\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 2\n\n\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n\n       In 2006, the O'Neills sued the City, alleging violations of the Public Records Act.2\nOn August 2, 2012, on remand from our Supreme Court, the trial court granted partial\nsummary judgment in favor of the O'Neills. In its order, the court stated,\n               The Court HEREBY Orders that pursuant to RCW 42.56.550(4)\n       Plaintiffs shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and all costs\n       incurred in this action to date, and statutory penalties, to be determined\n       after subsequent briefing and argument. Plaintiffs shall be entitled to an\n       award of reasonable attorney's fees and all costs incurred in connection\n       with such fee and penalty motions, the amounts of which shall be\n       determined by the Court in conjunction with the fee and penalty motions.\nThe court denied the City's motion for reconsideration.\n\n       On September 18, 2012, the City made an offer of judgment to the O'Neills. This\noffer stated,\n\n                The Defendants, pursuant to CR 68, offer to allow judgment to be\n       entered against them in this matter for $100,000.00 (One Hundred\n       Thousand Dollars and Zero Cents) for daily penalties. This amount does\n       not include costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred to date, which shall\n       be awarded in an amount to be determined by the Superior Court after\n       subsequent briefing and argument.\n\nThe O'Neills accepted this offer on September 27, 2012.\n\n        On October 9, 2012, the trial court entered a stipulated judgment on the offer and\n\n acceptance, which stated,\n\n        This matter came before the Court for entry of judgment under CR 68 on\n        the O'Neills' acceptance of the City of Shoreline's and Maggie Fimia's\n        offer of judgment for $100,000.00 (One Hundred Thousand Dollars and\n        Zero Cents) for daily penalties only.

This\n      amount does not include costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred to date,\n      which shall be awarded in an amount to be determined by the Superior\n      Court after subsequent briefing and argument.\n\n       On September 28, 2012, after the O'Neills accepted the City's offer of judgment\n\nbut before the court entered its judgment on the offer, the City sought discovery about\n\nthe amount of attorney fees. The O'Neills responded to the City's discovery requests on\n\nOctober 29, 2012. On November 1, the City sent a letter to the O'Neills stating,\n\n       You accepted the offer of judgment on September 24, 2012, the court\n       entered the final judgment on October 8, 2012 [sic] and a copy of the\n       signed order was provided to you on October 11, 2012. King County\n       Superior Court Rule 54(d)(2) required you to submit your claim for\n       attorneys' fees no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment, i.e.,\n       October 18, 2012. An alternative deadline is not provided by the court's\n       October 8, 2012 order or the Public Records Act. Thus, it is the City's and\n       Fimia's position that you have waived any claim for attorneys' fees and\n       any subsequently filed request must be denied by the court as untimely.\n       See Corev v. Pierce County, 154 Wn. App 752, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010)\n       (despite successful recovery of a judgment for wages and salary owed,\n       plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was properly denied due to her failure\n       to file her attorney's fees request within the 10 day time limitation under\n       CR 54(d)(2)).\n\n       Therefore, although your discovery responses are deficient, issues\n       regarding production of records responsive to the discovery requests\n       appear to be moot.\n\n       On November 5, 2012, the O'Neills moved for determination ofthe amount of the\n\nfee and cost award. On November 6, they responded to the City's letter, asserting,\n\n\"Defendants had no intention of pursuing the completely improper discovery requests\n\nthey issued. Defendants clearly issued it solely to delay any filing of a fee motion so\n they could make the argument the fee motion was waived.\" In response, the City\n argued that the O'Neills waived their right to attorney fees because they failed to comply\n\fNo. 70657-8-1/4\n\n\n\nwith the 10-day time limit in CR 54(d). The O'Neills replied that the 10-day time limit did\nnot apply, contending that the court's judgment on the offer and acceptance was not a\njudgment for the purposes of CR 54(d) because it did not contain a judgment summary,\nas RCW 4.64.030(2)(a) required. The O'Neills also asserted that the City made its\ndiscovery request \"to delay a fee motion filing\" and claimed that if the 10-day limit\napplied, they had demonstrated excusable neglect. The City filed a surreply asking the\ncourt to strike the fee motion as untimely on the basis that the O'Neills failed to file a CR\n\n6 motion to excuse their failure to meet the 10-day deadline and find that they had not\n\nshown excusable neglect.\n\n       At a hearing on the O'Neills' fee motion, the court told the City, \"I'm not\nconcerned about the 54 issue, so let's just talk about your rates.\" The record contains\n\nno finding of excusable neglect. The court granted the O'Neills' motion.\n       On June 28, 2013, the trial court entered an order awarding the O'Neills\n$428,966.18 for fees and $9,588.79 for costs. The court denied the City's motion for\n reconsideration.\n\n       The City appeals.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The parties ask us to determine if, in the absence of a finding of excusable\n neglect, the trial court had the legal authority to enter an order awarding fees and costs\n when the O'Neills filed their request for this relief more than 10 days after the court\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 5\n\n\n\n\nentered judgment on the offer for damages and its acceptance. We review this question\n\nof law de novo.3\n\n      We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.4 A\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or is based on\n\nuntenable grounds.5\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n\n       The City contends that the trial court erred by considering the O'Neills' motion for\n\ndetermination of the amount of fees and costs because they filed it more than 10 days\n\nafter the court entered a stipulated judgment for damages in their favor.         The City\n\nasserts that the trial court must, but did not, make a finding of excusable neglect before\n\nit could consider the O'Neills' untimely motion. We disagree.\n\n       CR 54(d)(2) requires a party seeking attorney fees and expenses to file a claim\n\nby motion \"no later than 10 days after entry of judgment.\" CR 6(b) provides procedures\nfor enlarging the time specified in this rule.6 CR 6(b) specifically prohibits extending the\n\n\n       3 Klem v.

Here, the City\n\nconceded at oral argument that it demonstrated no prejudice to the trial court.\n\nTherefore, even if the O'Neills failed to comply with the 10-day time limit, they did not\n\nwaive their right to recover fees.\n\n        The City cites Corey v. Pierce County in support of its position. But Corey merely\n\naffirmed a trial court's exercise of discretion to enforce the time requirements of CR\n\n54(d)(2) and did not address whether a court must enforce them.11\n\n        In view of our resolution of the City's claim, we need not, and do not, resolve the\n\nO'Neills' assertion that the stipulated judgment for damages was not a judgment for\n\npurpose of CR 54(d)(2). However, we do address two matters that arose in this case\n\nand occur with disturbing frequency—statements of additional authorities and motions\n\nto strike.\n\n\n        At the direction of the panel deciding this case, a case manager contacted\n\ncounsel for the parties and asked them to be prepared to discuss a case not cited in\n\ntheir briefing, Goucher v. J.R. Simplot Co.       Shortly afterward, the O'Neills filed a\n\nstatement of additional authorities listing Goucher, two cases cited in Goucher, and two\n\nother cases. This filing provided no new information and wasted the time of the court.\n\nRAP 10.8 allows parties to file statements of additional authorities. We view this rule as\n\nbeing intended to provide parties an opportunity to cite authority decided after the\n\n\n\n\n        11 Corey, 154 Wn. App. at 774.\n                                            -7-\n\fNo. 70657-8-1 / 8\n\n\n\n\ncompletion of briefing. We do not view it as being intended to permit parties to submit\n\nto the court cases that they failed to timely identify when preparing their briefs.\n\n       The City moved to strike a sentence in the O'Neills' brief, stating, \"While there\n\nexist unpublished authority, post dating [sic] Corey, rejecting Defendants' CR 54(d)(2)\n\nwaiver claims in a stipulated judgment context, there is no known case, published or\n\notherwise, accepting the arguments Defendants make here in the stipulated judgment\n\ncontext.\"   The City also asks us to impose sanctions on the O'Neills for citing\n\nunpublished authority.\n\n       GR 14.1(a) prohibits a party from citing as authority an unpublished opinion of\n\nthe court of appeals. Although the O'Neills refer to \"unpublished authority,\" they do not\n\nrely on any unpublished decisions to support their arguments. Rather, they made the\n\nquoted statement as part of their claim that no authority supports the City's waiver\n\nargument. The City provides no basis to strike the cited sentence from the O'Neills'\n\nbrief or to impose sanctions. We deny the City's motion and request for sanctions.\n\n       Because of the frequency with which litigants file motions to strike portions of\n\nbriefs we quote two pertinent authorities: \"Motions to strike sentences or sections out of\n\nbriefs waste everyone's time.\"12\n\n       No one at the Court of Appeals goes through the record or the briefs with\n       a stamp or scissors to prevent the judges who are hearing the case from\n       seeing material deemed irrelevant or prejudicial. So long as there is an\n       opportunity (as there was here) to include argument in the party's brief,\n       the brief is the appropriate vehicle for pointing out allegedly extraneous\n       materials—not a separate motion to strike.[13]\n\n       12 Redwood v.

To determine the reasonableness of attorney fees, the court calculates a\n\nlodestar figure.14 This requires the court to determine the number of hours reasonably\n\nexpended in the litigation.15 The court limits the lodestar to hours reasonably expended\n\nand therefore discounts hours spent on unsuccessful claims, duplicated effort, or\n\notherwise unproductive time.16\n\n          A party in Public Records Act litigation may recover attorney fees only for work\n\non successful issues.17 When a party may recover fees on only some of its claims, the\n\naward must reflect a segregation of the time spent on the varying claims.18 The court\n\nseparates time spent on theories essential to the successful claim from time spent on\n\ntheories related to other claims.19 But \"[i]f the court finds that claims are so related that\n\nsegregation is not reasonable, then it need not segregate the attorney fees.\"20\n          RCW 42.56.550(4) \"shall be liberally construed to promote . . . full access to\n\npublic records.\"21 It provides for a more liberal recovery of costs than does RCW\n\n          14 Bowers v.

In recognition of\n\nthe strong public policy underlying the Public Records Act, we award the O'Neills\n\nreasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal, subject to the foregoing limitations.\n\n      The O'Neills also ask that we impose sanctions against the City under RAP\n\n18.9(a), which permits an appellate court to impose sanctions on a party or counsel\n\n\"who uses these rules for the purpose of delay, files a frivolous appeal, or fails to\n\ncomply with these rules to pay terms or compensatory damages to any other party who\n\nhas been harmed by the delay or the failure to comply or to pay sanctions to the court.\"\n\nThe O'Neills allege, \"Defendants' claims they could not have submitted discovery any\n\nsooner than the day after submitting the Agreed Order to the court for approval is not\n\ncredible or logical. Defendants clearly sought to negotiate a contract and Agreed Order\n\nthey had no intention of performing.\" They assert, \"This appeal and the Defendants'\n\narguments to void their contractual obligations have no merit.\"\n\n      An appeal is not frivolous or brought for purposes of delay if it involves\n\n\"'debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ.'\"24       Because the City\n\npresented debatable arguments about the applicability of CR 54(d)(2), we conclude that\n\n\n\n\n      22 Am.
