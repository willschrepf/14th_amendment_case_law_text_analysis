During that time, the inmates were\n\nallegedly prohibited from exercising outdoors, although they were brought\n\nto a “recreation room” five times each week. The alleged prohibition on\n\noutdoor exercise led the two inmates to sue the prison warden and the\n\ndirector of the Colorado Department of Corrections, invoking 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 and claiming violation of the Eighth Amendment. For these claims,\n\nthe inmates relied largely on a published opinion in our court, Perkins v.\n\nKansas Department of Corrections, 165 F.3d 803 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n     The warden and director moved to dismiss, arguing that (1) the\n\nalleged prohibition on outdoor exercise did not violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment and (2) qualified immunity applies. For these arguments, the\n\nwarden and director distinguish Perkins, relying largely on an unpublished\n\nopinion in our court, Ajaj v. United States, 293 F. App’x 575 (10th Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n     The district court denied the motion to dismiss, reasoning that the\n\ntwo inmates had stated a plausible claim for relief. Because the warden and\n\ndirector enjoy qualified immunity, we reverse. We conclude that even if\n\nthe alleged prohibition on outdoor exercise had violated the Eighth\n\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\fAmendment, the underlying constitutional right would not have been\n\nclearly established.\n\n      The right would not have been clearly established because existing\n\nprecedent would have left the constitutional question within the realm of\n\nreasonable debate. The underlying right turns on our opinion in Perkins.\n\nBut Perkins can be read either expansively or narrowly. Under an\n\nexpansive reading, Perkins would squarely prohibit the alleged denial of\n\noutdoor exercise for eleven months. But, under a narrow reading, Perkins\n\nwould apply only to denials of out-of-cell exercise—a situation not present\n\nhere. We need not decide which reading is correct. Because Perkins is\n\nambiguous, our opinions do not clearly establish that an eleven-month\n\ndeprivation of outdoor exercise would violate the Eighth Amendment.\n\nI.    Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n      Before addressing the merits, we must ensure our jurisdiction. Steel\n\nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998). The two inmates\n\nchallenge jurisdiction based on the absence of certain factual findings in\n\ndistrict court. This challenge fails, for we have jurisdiction under the\n\ncollateral-order doctrine.\n\n      In appeals from district court decisions, we generally obtain\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which creates appellate jurisdiction\n\nover “final decisions.” In this case, the warden and director are appealing\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\fthe district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss. 1 This denial is not a final\n\njudgment. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 671-72 (2009) (recognizing\n\nthat a similar denial did not constitute a final judgment). But under the\n\ncollateral-order doctrine, some rulings are immediately appealable\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of a final judgment. Id.; Cohen v. Beneficial\n\nIndus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949). These rulings contain\n\ndecisions that are collateral to the merits but too important for us to deny\n\nreview and too independent of the underlying claim for us to postpone\n\nreview. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 671.\n\n      Here the district court denied qualified immunity to the warden and\n\ndirector, reasoning that the underlying constitutional right had been clearly\n\nestablished. This ruling generally falls within the collateral-order doctrine,\n\nfor qualified immunity serves to protect the defendant not just from\n\npersonal liability but also from the ordeal of litigation. Plumhoff v.\n\nRickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2019 (2014).\n\n      The collateral-order doctrine is triggered only if the appeal turns on a\n\n“‘purely legal issue.’” Ortiz v. Jordan, 562 U.S. 180, 188 (2011) (quoting\n\nJohnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 313 (1995)). Thus, we may not reconsider\n\n\n1\n     The defendants’ motion was titled “Motion to Dismiss or Motion for\nSummary Judgment.” This motion included arguments for summary\njudgment that are not presently before us. We therefore consider the\nmotion solely as a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                                       4\n\fa district court’s assessment of which facts could be proven at trial. Walton\n\nv. Powell, 821 F.3d 1204, 1209-10 (10th Cir. 2016).\n\n      The issue here is legal, not factual. Because qualified immunity\n\narises here on a motion to dismiss, we must credit all of the plaintiffs’\n\nwell-pleaded allegations. Schwartz v. Booker, 702 F.3d 573, 579 (10th Cir.\n\n2012). Thus, our decision regarding qualified immunity does not hinge on\n\nany factual disputes. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. 2 In the absence of factual\n\ndisputes, we confront a purely legal issue: whether the underlying\n\nconstitutional right was clearly established. Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 188. Thus,\n\nwe have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral-order doctrine.\n\nII.   The Standard of Review, the Standard for Qualified Immunity,\n      and the Plaintiffs’ Pleading Burden\n\n      Qualified immunity protects public officials who are required to\n\nexercise their discretion, shielding them from personal liability for civil\n\ndamages. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982); Schwartz,\n\n\n2\n       The inmates argue that jurisdiction is absent because the warden and\ndirector base their argument on the differences between the facts here and\nin our prior cases. We disagree. The warden and director are asserting\nqualified immunity based on the facts alleged in the inmates’ complaint.\nThe warden and director refer to the facts in our prior cases only to shed\nlight on whether the underlying constitutional right was clearly\nestablished. These so-called arguments about “facts” are, in reality,\ncentered on the abstract legal principle of whether the inmates’ alleged\nfacts were governed by our existing precedents. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 672\n(stating that the denial of a motion to dismiss, rejecting a defense of\nqualified immunity, turned on an issue of law and was therefore\nimmediately appealable).\n\n                                      5\n\f702 F.3d at 579. This type of immunity applies when a public official’s\n\nconduct does not violate clearly established rights that a reasonable person\n\nwould have known about. Schwartz, 702 F.3d at 579.\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss\n\nbased on qualified immunity. Id. In conducting this review, we consider\n\nwhether the plaintiffs have alleged facts showing\n\n           that the defendants violated a constitutional right and\n\n           that the right was clearly established.\n\nSee id. But if the right were not clearly established, we may find qualified\n\nimmunity without deciding the constitutionality of the conduct. Pearson v.\n\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236-42 (2009).\n\n      A constitutional right is clearly established when a Tenth Circuit\n\nprecedent is on point, making the constitutional violation apparent.\n\nMascorro v. Billings, 656 F.3d 1198, 1208 (10th Cir. 2011). 3 This\n\nprecedent cannot define the right at a high level of generality. Ashcroft v.\n\n\n3\n      Alternatively, a right can be clearly established by a Supreme Court\nprecedent or by the weight of authority from case law in other circuits.\nRoska ex rel. Roska v. Peterson, 328 F.3d 1230, 1248 (10th Cir. 2003). But\nthe plaintiffs do not rely on Supreme Court precedent or the weight of\nauthority in other circuits; thus, we do not consider these potential sources\nfor a clearly established right. See Washington v. Unified Gov’t of\nWyandotte Cty., 847 F.3d 1192, 1201 n.3 (10th Cir. 2017) (stating that the\nplaintiff must identify the authorities that create the clearly established\nright); Cox v. Glanz, 800 F.3d 1231, 1247 (10th Cir. 2015) (noting that we\nneed not consider out-of-circuit authority unless the plaintiff brings this\nauthority to our attention).\n\n                                      6\n\fal-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 742 (2011). Rather, the precedent must be\n\nparticularized to the facts. White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017) (per\n\ncuriam). But even when such a precedent exists, subsequent Tenth Circuit\n\ncases may conflict with or clarify the earlier precedent, rendering the law\n\nunclear. See Lane v. Franks, 134 S. Ct. 2369, 2382-83 (2014).\n\n      A precedent is often particularized when it involves materially\n\nsimilar facts. See White, 137 S. Ct. at 552. But the precedent may be\n\nadequately particularized even if the facts differ, for general precedents\n\nmay clearly establish the law when the defendant’s conduct “‘obvious[ly]’”\n\nviolates the law. See id. (quoting Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 199\n\n(2004) (per curiam)). Thus, a right is clearly established when a precedent\n\ninvolves “‘materially similar conduct’” or applies “‘with obvious clarity’”\n\nto the conduct at issue. Estate of Reat v. Rodriguez, 824 F.3d 960, 964-65\n\n(10th Cir. 2016) (emphasis in Estate of Reat) (quoting Buck v. City of\n\nAlbuquerque, 549 F.3d 1269, 1290 (10th Cir. 2008)), cert. denied, ___ U.S.\n\n___, 137 S. Ct. 1434 (2017) (Mem.).\n\n      By requiring precedents involving materially similar conduct or\n\nobvious applicability, we allow personal liability for public officials only\n\nwhen our precedent puts the constitutional violation “‘beyond debate.’”\n\nWhite, 137 S. Ct. at 551 (quoting Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308\n\n(2015) (per curiam)). Thus, qualified immunity protects all officials except\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fthose who are “‘plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\n\nlaw.’” Id. (quoting Mullenix, 136 S. Ct. at 308).\n\n      In the present case, we apply this test in light of the plaintiffs’\n\npleading burden for a § 1983 claim based on the Eighth Amendment. See\n\nDeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 971 (10th Cir. 2001). To satisfy this\n\nburden, the plaintiffs must make two plausible allegations: (1) the\n\nconditions were “‘sufficiently serious’ to implicate constitutional\n\nprotection” and (2) the warden and director acted with “‘deliberate\n\nindifference’” to the inmates’ health. Id. (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511\n\nU.S. 825, 834 (1994)).\n\n      This appeal focuses on the first requirement, which addresses the\n\nseriousness of the deprivation. Id. The plaintiffs allege a deprivation of the\n\nright to exercise outdoors for roughly eleven months. For the sake of\n\nargument, we may assume that this deprivation would violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Even with this assumption, the warden and director would\n\nenjoy qualified immunity because the underlying constitutional right had\n\nnot been clearly established.\n\n      Roughly three decades ago, we recognized a consensus in the case\n\nlaw regarding the importance of outdoor exercise for prisoners: “There is\n\nsubstantial agreement among the cases . . . that some form of regular\n\noutdoor exercise is extremely important to the psychological and physical\n\nwell being of inmates . . . .” Bailey v. Shillinger, 828 F.2d 651, 653 (10th\n\n                                       8\n\fCir. 1987) (per curiam). But we also made clear that a denial of outdoor\n\nexercise does not per se violate the Eighth Amendment. Id.\n\n       In the absence of a per se violation, courts must examine the totality\n\nof the circumstances. Perkins v. Kan. Dep’t of Corr., 165 F.3d 803, 810 n.8\n\n(10th Cir. 1999). These circumstances include the length of the\n\ndeprivation. See DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 974 (10th Cir. 2001)\n\n(stating that the length of time that an inmate is exposed to the conditions\n\n“is often of prime importance” under the Eighth Amendment); Craig v.\n\nEberly, 164 F.3d 490, 495 (10th Cir. 1998) (stating that the inquiry under\n\nthe Eighth Amendment turns in part on the duration of the deprivation).\n\nIII.   The alleged constitutional right was not clearly established.\n\n       The plaintiffs rely on our published opinion in Perkins v. Kansas\n\nDepartment of Corrections. In Perkins, a prisoner invoked the Eighth\n\nAmendment, alleging a continuing inability to exercise outside of his cell\n\nfor more than nine months. Perkins, 165 F.3d at 806-07, 809. The district\n\ncourt dismissed the claim, and we reversed. Id. at 805, 810.\n\n       In reversing, we expressed our holding in terms of the denial of\n\n“outdoor exercise.” Id. at 810. But, as noted above, the plaintiff in Perkins\n\nhad alleged the inability to exercise not only outdoors but also anywhere\n\noutside of his cell. Id. at 806-07. The resulting issue is whether our\n\nholding was\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f           expansive, prohibiting the extended denial of exercise outdoors\n            or\n\n           narrow, prohibiting only the extended denial of exercise\n            outside of the cell.\n\n      The plaintiffs embrace the expansive interpretation of Perkins. This\n\ninterpretation is reasonable based on four facts:\n\n      1.    Our court referred seven times to the plaintiff’s deprivation of\n            “outdoor exercise.” Id. at 805-06, 810.\n\n      2.    Our court expressed the holding in terms of the denial of\n            outdoor exercise. Id. at 810.\n\n      3.    Our court relied in part on Bailey v. Shillinger, which had held\n            that “some form of regular outdoor exercise is extremely\n            important to the psychological and physical well being of\n            inmates.” Id. at 810 (quoting Bailey v. Shillinger, 828 F.2d\n            651, 653 (10th Cir. 1987) (per curiam)); see pp. 8-9, above.\n\n      4.    A person deprived of out-of-cell exercise is, logically, also\n            deprived of outdoor exercise. So, a precedent regarding the\n            denial of “outdoor” exercise could encompass every situation\n            involving the denial of out-of-cell exercise. But the reverse is\n            not true. If the court meant to create a precedent regarding the\n            denial of “out-of-cell” exercise, one might not expect the\n            holding to be framed more broadly in terms of “outdoor”\n            exercise.\n\n      The warden and director embrace the narrow interpretation of\n\nPerkins, insisting that it applies only to deprivations of out-of-cell\n\nexercise. This interpretation also appears reasonable based on the content\n\nof Perkins and the later unpublished opinion in Ajaj v. United States, 293\n\nF. App’x 575 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\n      Perkins contains three features supporting a narrow interpretation:\n\n\n                                      10\n\f      1.     The plaintiff alleged deprivation of exercise anywhere outside\n             of his cell, not just outdoors. Id. at 807.\n\n      2.     The court relied in part on Housley v. Dodson, which had\n             involved a deprivation of exercise outside of the prisoner’s cell\n             rather than just outdoors. Id. at 810 (citing Housley v. Dodson,\n             41 F.3d 597, 599 (10th Cir. 1994)).\n\n      3.     The court cited multiple cases from other circuits involving\n             out-of-cell exercise. Id.\n\n      In addition, a narrow interpretation is supported by our unpublished\n\nopinion in Ajaj, where we held that a year-long deprivation of outdoor\n\nexercise did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Ajaj v. United States, 293\n\nF. App’x 575, 584 (10th Cir. 2008); see Quinn v. Young, 780 F.3d 998,\n\n1012 n.4 (10th Cir. 2015) (“A recent unpublished opinion . . . further\n\nconfirms our view that the Officers had no guidance concerning the\n\npropriety of the challenged [conduct] from extant clearly established\n\nlaw.”). If Perkins is read broadly, Ajaj might appear to conflict with\n\nPerkins. 4\n\n      Which reading of Perkins is correct? We need not decide that today.\n\nFor now, it is enough to conclude that the question is within the realm of\n\n\n4\n      The Ajaj majority did not cite Perkins. In a concurrence, then-Chief\nJudge Henry implied that Perkins had established a precedent involving the\ndenial of outdoor exercise. See Ajaj, 293 F. App’x at 590 (Henry, C.J.,\nconcurring). But Chief Judge Henry then seemed to detract from this\napproach, concluding that the defendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity in part because “prison officials [had] afforded [Mr. Ajaj]\nregular solitary indoor exercise opportunities.” Id. at 591.\n\n\n                                      11\n\freasonable debate, for Perkins can be read either expansively or narrowly.\n\nSee A.M. ex rel. F.M. v. Holmes, 830 F.3d 1123, 1147 & n.12 (10th Cir.\n\n2016) (concluding that the law was not clearly established when the\n\nplaintiff had relied on an opinion that “could be reasonably read” in a way\n\nthat led the defendant to “reasonably believe[] (even if mistakenly)” that\n\nhis actions were permissible); see also Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v.\n\nRedding, 557 U.S. 364, 378-79 (2009) (concluding that the law was not\n\nclearly established by a prior Supreme Court opinion because it had been\n\nread differently by “well-reasoned” judges in cases that were “numerous\n\nenough”).\n\n     The availability of conflicting interpretations is unsurprising in light\n\nof our competing principles guiding interpretation of precedents like\n\nPerkins. On the one hand, “[t]he language of a judicial decision must be\n\ninterpreted with reference to the circumstances of the particular case and\n\nthe question under consideration.” Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of\n\nJudicial Precedent 80 (2016). In Perkins, these circumstances involved the\n\ndenial of any exercise opportunities outside of the prisoner’s cell. See\n\npp. 9-11, above.\n\n     But on the other hand, “‘[t]he discovery of what facts are material in\n\nany decision is by no means easy.’” Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of\n\nJudicial Precedent 80 (2016) (citation omitted). Generally, we ascertain\n\nthe materiality of individual facts based on which ones are emphasized in a\n\n                                     12\n\fgiven opinion. See id. at 81 (“Most cases combine law and fact in ways\n\nthat emphasize the central role of the facts.”). In Perkins, the court\n\nappeared to emphasize that the plaintiff was prohibited from exercising\n\noutdoors. See pp. 9-10, above.\n\n      At a minimum, Perkins would not render the warden and director\n\n“plainly incompetent” for failing to recognize a constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst an eleven-month ban on outdoor exercise. Perkins’s ambiguity\n\nmeans that our circuit has not clearly established a right to outdoor\n\nexercise over an eleven-month period. As a result, the warden and director\n\nare entitled to qualified immunity. 5\n\nIV.   The defendants did not knowingly violate the Constitution.\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized that liability extends not only to\n\n“‘plainly incompetent’” officials but also to officials who “‘knowingly\n\nviolate the law.’” White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017) (per curiam)\n\n(quoting Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308 (2015) (per curiam)); see\n\nZiglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. ___, 2017 WL 2621317, slip. op. at 29 (June 19,\n\n\n5\n      The two inmates also rely on Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1260\n(10th Cir. 2006) and Housley v. Dodson, 41 F.3d 597, 599 (10th Cir. 1994).\nBut Fogle’s discussion of the duration of the deprivation was based on the\nstandard for frivolousness and the subjective prong of the Eighth\nAmendment. See Lowe v. Raemisch, No. 16-1300, slip. op. at 8-10 (10th\nCir. July 25, 2017) (to be published). And Housley involved the denial of\nexercise anywhere outside the cell (rather than a ban on outdoor exercise).\nSee id. at 10. These differences could reasonably have led the warden and\ndirector to question the applicability of Fogle and Housley.\n\n                                        13\n\f2017). Based on this language, the plaintiffs allege that the warden and\n\ndirector knew that they were violating the Constitution in light of a district\n\ncourt opinion addressing similar conditions at the same prison. Appellees’\n\nResp. Br. at 24-25 (citing Anderson v. Colorado, 887 F. Supp. 2d 1133 (D.\n\nColo. 2012)).\n\n      We reject this argument based on a key factual distinction with the\n\ndistrict court case, a conflict with Supreme Court precedent, and the\n\npresence of an erroneous assumption.\n\n      First, the deprivation in the district court’s earlier case spanned\n\ntwelve years. Anderson v. Colorado, 887 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 1138 (D. Colo.\n\n2012). Here the alleged deprivation lasted only about eleven months.\n\n      Second, the Supreme Court rejected a nearly identical argument in\n\nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731 (2011). There the Court concluded that a\n\ndistrict court opinion, which identified the same defendant and said that\n\nhis actions had been unconstitutional, did not clearly establish the\n\nunderlying right because a district court’s holding is not controlling in any\n\njurisdiction. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741-42. The same is true here.\n\n      Third, the plaintiffs suggest that a defendant’s knowledge affects the\n\navailability of qualified immunity. We reject this suggestion, for there is a\n\nsingle standard: “whether it would have been clear to a reasonable officer\n\nthat the alleged conduct ‘was unlawful in the situation he confronted.’”\n\nZiglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. ___, 2017 WL 2621317, slip. op. at 29 (June 19,\n\n                                      14\n\f2017) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2002)). If this standard\n\nis met, the defendant would be either plainly incompetent or a knowing\n\nviolator of the law. See id. (“If so, then the defendant officer must have\n\nbeen either incompetent or else a knowing violator of the law, and thus not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.”).\n\n      For these reasons, the district court’s earlier ruling does not preclude\n\nqualified immunity. See Lowe v. Raemisch, No. 16-1300, slip op. at Part\n\n2(d) (10th Cir. July 25, 2017) (to be published).\n\nV.    Disposition\n\n      We conclude that the warden and director did not violate a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional right. Thus, the district court erred in denying\n\nthe motion to dismiss.\n\n      Reversed and remanded with instructions to grant the motion to\n\ndismiss the personal-capacity claims based on qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\f",

During that time, the inmates were\n\nallegedly prohibited from exercising outdoors, although they were brought\n\nto a “recreation room” five times each week. The alleged prohibition on\n\noutdoor exercise led the two inmates to sue the prison warden and the\n\ndirector of the Colorado Department of Corrections, invoking 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 and claiming violation of the Eighth Amendment. For these claims,\n\nthe inmates relied largely on a published opinion in our court, Perkins v.\n\nKansas Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157433\"><a href=\"/opinion/157433/perkins-v-kansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n     The warden and director moved to dismiss, arguing that (1) the\n\nalleged prohibition on outdoor exercise did not violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment and (2) qualified immunity applies. For these arguments, the\n\nwarden and director distinguish Perkins, relying largely on an unpublished\n\nopinion in our court, Ajaj v. United States, 293 F. App’x 575 (10th Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n     The district court denied the motion to dismiss, reasoning that the\n\ntwo inmates had stated a plausible claim for relief. Because the warden and\n\ndirector enjoy qualified immunity, we reverse. We conclude that even if\n\nthe alleged prohibition on outdoor exercise had violated the Eighth\n\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\fAmendment, the underlying constitutional right would not have been\n\nclearly established.\n\n      The right would not have been clearly established because existing\n\nprecedent would have left the constitutional question within the realm of\n\nreasonable debate. The underlying right turns on our opinion in Perkins.\n\nBut Perkins can be read either expansively or narrowly. Under an\n\nexpansive reading, Perkins would squarely prohibit the alleged denial of\n\noutdoor exercise for eleven months. But, under a narrow reading, Perkins\n\nwould apply only to denials of out-of-cell exercise—a situation not present\n\nhere. We need not decide which reading is correct. Because Perkins is\n\nambiguous, our opinions do not clearly establish that an eleven-month\n\ndeprivation of outdoor exercise would violate the Eighth Amendment.\n\nI.    Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n      Before addressing the merits, we must ensure our jurisdiction. Steel\n\nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (1998). The two inmates\n\nchallenge jurisdiction based on the absence of certain factual findings in\n\ndistrict court. This challenge fails, for we have jurisdiction under the\n\ncollateral-order doctrine.\n\n      In appeals from district court decisions, we generally obtain\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which creates appellate jurisdiction\n\nover “final decisions.” In this case, the warden and director are appealing\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\fthe district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss. 1 This denial is not a final\n\njudgment. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671-72 (2009) (recognizing\n\nthat a similar denial did not constitute a final judgment). But under the\n\ncollateral-order doctrine, some rulings are immediately appealable\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of a final judgment. Id.; Cohen v. Beneficial\n\nIndus. Loan Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (1949). These rulings contain\n\ndecisions that are collateral to the merits but too important for us to deny\n\nreview and too independent of the underlying claim for us to postpone\n\nreview. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 671.\n\n      Here the district court denied qualified immunity to the warden and\n\ndirector, reasoning that the underlying constitutional right had been clearly\n\nestablished. This ruling generally falls within the collateral-order doctrine,\n\nfor qualified immunity serves to protect the defendant not just from\n\npersonal liability but also from the ordeal of litigation. Plumhoff v.\n\nRickard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2675750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2675750/plumhoff-v-rickard/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2012</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2019 (2014).\n\n      The collateral-order doctrine is triggered only if the appeal turns on a\n\n“‘purely legal issue.’” Ortiz v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188 (2011) (quoting\n\nJohnson v.

Thus, we may not reconsider\n\n\n1\n     The defendants’ motion was titled “Motion to Dismiss or Motion for\nSummary Judgment.” This motion included arguments for summary\njudgment that are not presently before us. We therefore consider the\nmotion solely as a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n                                       4\n\fa district court’s assessment of which facts could be proven at trial. Walton\n\nv. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209-10 (10th Cir. 2016).\n\n      The issue here is legal, not factual. Because qualified immunity\n\narises here on a motion to dismiss, we must credit all of the plaintiffs’\n\nwell-pleaded allegations. Schwartz v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">702</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 (10th Cir.\n\n2012). Thus, our decision regarding qualified immunity does not hinge on\n\nany factual disputes. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. 2 In the absence of factual\n\ndisputes, we confront a purely legal issue: whether the underlying\n\nconstitutional right was clearly established. Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 188. Thus,\n\nwe have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral-order doctrine.\n\nII.   The Standard of Review, the Standard for Qualified Immunity,\n      and the Plaintiffs’ Pleading Burden\n\n      Qualified immunity protects public officials who are required to\n\nexercise their discretion, shielding them from personal liability for civil\n\ndamages. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807 (1982); Schwartz,\n\n\n2\n       The inmates argue that jurisdiction is absent because the warden and\ndirector base their argument on the differences between the facts here and\nin our prior cases. We disagree. The warden and director are asserting\nqualified immunity based on the facts alleged in the inmates’ complaint.\nThe warden and director refer to the facts in our prior cases only to shed\nlight on whether the underlying constitutional right was clearly\nestablished. These so-called arguments about “facts” are, in reality,\ncentered on the abstract legal principle of whether the inmates’ alleged\nfacts were governed by our existing precedents. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 672\n(stating that the denial of a motion to dismiss, rejecting a defense of\nqualified immunity, turned on an issue of law and was therefore\nimmediately appealable).\n\n                                      5\n\f702 F.3d at 579. This type of immunity applies when a public official’s\n\nconduct does not violate clearly established rights that a reasonable person\n\nwould have known about. Schwartz, 702 F.3d at 579.\n\n      We review de novo the district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss\n\nbased on qualified immunity. Id. In conducting this review, we consider\n\nwhether the plaintiffs have alleged facts showing\n\n           that the defendants violated a constitutional right and\n\n           that the right was clearly established.\n\nSee id. But if the right were not clearly established, we may find qualified\n\nimmunity without deciding the constitutionality of the conduct. Pearson v.\n\nCallahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236-42 (2009).\n\n      A constitutional right is clearly established when a Tenth Circuit\n\nprecedent is on point, making the constitutional violation apparent.\n\nMascorro v.

Ashcroft v.\n\n\n3\n      Alternatively, a right can be clearly established by a Supreme Court\nprecedent or by the weight of authority from case law in other circuits.\nRoska ex rel. Roska v.

But\nthe plaintiffs do not rely on Supreme Court precedent or the weight of\nauthority in other circuits; thus, we do not consider these potential sources\nfor a clearly established right. See Washington v. Unified Gov’t of\nWyandotte Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201 n.3 (10th Cir. 2017) (stating that the\nplaintiff must identify the authorities that create the clearly established\nright); Cox v.

Rather, the precedent must be\n\nparticularized to the facts. White v. Pauly, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (2017) (per\n\ncuriam). But even when such a precedent exists, subsequent Tenth Circuit\n\ncases may conflict with or clarify the earlier precedent, rendering the law\n\nunclear. See Lane v. Franks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2679557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2679557/lane-v-franks/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2382-83 (2014).\n\n      A precedent is often particularized when it involves materially\n\nsimilar facts. See White, 137 S. Ct. at 552. But the precedent may be\n\nadequately particularized even if the facts differ, for general precedents\n\nmay clearly establish the law when the defendant’s conduct “‘obvious[ly]’”\n\nviolates the law. See id. (quoting Brosseau v. Haugen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199\n\n(2004) (per curiam)). Thus, a right is clearly established when a precedent\n\ninvolves “‘materially similar conduct’” or applies “‘with obvious clarity’”\n\nto the conduct at issue. Estate of Reat v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308\n\n(2015) (per curiam)). Thus, qualified immunity protects all officials except\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fthose who are “‘plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\n\nlaw.’” Id. (quoting Mullenix, 136 S. Ct. at 308).\n\n      In the present case, we apply this test in light of the plaintiffs’\n\npleading burden for a § 1983 claim based on the Eighth Amendment. See\n\nDeSpain v. Uphoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161306\"><a href=\"/opinion/161306/despain-v-uphoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 971 (10th Cir. 2001). To satisfy this\n\nburden, the plaintiffs must make two plausible allegations: (1) the\n\nconditions were “‘sufficiently serious’ to implicate constitutional\n\nprotection” and (2) the warden and director acted with “‘deliberate\n\nindifference’” to the inmates’ health. Id. (quoting Farmer v.

Id. The plaintiffs allege a deprivation of the\n\nright to exercise outdoors for roughly eleven months. For the sake of\n\nargument, we may assume that this deprivation would violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment. Even with this assumption, the warden and director would\n\nenjoy qualified immunity because the underlying constitutional right had\n\nnot been clearly established.\n\n      Roughly three decades ago, we recognized a consensus in the case\n\nlaw regarding the importance of outdoor exercise for prisoners: “There is\n\nsubstantial agreement among the cases . . . that some form of regular\n\noutdoor exercise is extremely important to the psychological and physical\n\nwell being of inmates . . . .” Bailey v.

The alleged constitutional right was not clearly established.\n\n       The plaintiffs rely on our published opinion in Perkins v. Kansas\n\nDepartment of Corrections. In Perkins, a prisoner invoked the Eighth\n\nAmendment, alleging a continuing inability to exercise outside of his cell\n\nfor more than nine months. Perkins, 165 F.3d at 806-07, 809. The district\n\ncourt dismissed the claim, and we reversed. Id. at 805, 810.\n\n       In reversing, we expressed our holding in terms of the denial of\n\n“outdoor exercise.” Id. at 810. But, as noted above, the plaintiff in Perkins\n\nhad alleged the inability to exercise not only outdoors but also anywhere\n\noutside of his cell. Id. at 806-07. The resulting issue is whether our\n\nholding was\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f           expansive, prohibiting the extended denial of exercise outdoors\n            or\n\n           narrow, prohibiting only the extended denial of exercise\n            outside of the cell.\n\n      The plaintiffs embrace the expansive interpretation of Perkins. This\n\ninterpretation is reasonable based on four facts:\n\n      1.    Our court referred seven times to the plaintiff’s deprivation of\n            “outdoor exercise.” Id. at 805-06, 810.\n\n      2.    Our court expressed the holding in terms of the denial of\n            outdoor exercise. Id. at 810.\n\n      3.    Our court relied in part on Bailey v. Shillinger, which had held\n            that “some form of regular outdoor exercise is extremely\n            important to the psychological and physical well being of\n            inmates.” Id. at 810 (quoting Bailey v. Shillinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493980\"><a href=\"/opinion/493980/scott-w-bailey-v-duane-shillinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n            <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (10th Cir. 1987) (per curiam)); see pp. 8-9, above.\n\n      4.    A person deprived of out-of-cell exercise is, logically, also\n            deprived of outdoor exercise. So, a precedent regarding the\n            denial of “outdoor” exercise could encompass every situation\n            involving the denial of out-of-cell exercise. But the reverse is\n            not true. If the court meant to create a precedent regarding the\n            denial of “out-of-cell” exercise, one might not expect the\n            holding to be framed more broadly in terms of “outdoor”\n            exercise.\n\n      The warden and director embrace the narrow interpretation of\n\nPerkins, insisting that it applies only to deprivations of out-of-cell\n\nexercise. This interpretation also appears reasonable based on the content\n\nof Perkins and the later unpublished opinion in Ajaj v. United States, 293\n\nF. App’x 575 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\n      Perkins contains three features supporting a narrow interpretation:\n\n\n                                      10\n\f      1.     The plaintiff alleged deprivation of exercise anywhere outside\n             of his cell, not just outdoors. Id. at 807.\n\n      2.     The court relied in part on Housley v. Dodson, which had\n             involved a deprivation of exercise outside of the prisoner’s cell\n             rather than just outdoors. Id. at 810 (citing Housley v. Dodson,\n             </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683237\"><a href=\"/opinion/683237/jim-r-housley-v-cd-dodson-larry-williams-ed-covey-rick-webb-jm-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599 (10th Cir. 1994)).\n\n      3.     The court cited multiple cases from other circuits involving\n             out-of-cell exercise. Id.\n\n      In addition, a narrow interpretation is supported by our unpublished\n\nopinion in Ajaj, where we held that a year-long deprivation of outdoor\n\nexercise did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Ajaj v. United States, 293\n\nF. App’x 575, 584 (10th Cir. 2008); see Quinn v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1012 n.4 (10th Cir. 2015) (“A recent unpublished opinion . . . further\n\nconfirms our view that the Officers had no guidance concerning the\n\npropriety of the challenged [conduct] from extant clearly established\n\nlaw.”). If Perkins is read broadly, Ajaj might appear to conflict with\n\nPerkins. 4\n\n      Which reading of Perkins is correct? We need not decide that today.\n\nFor now, it is enough to conclude that the question is within the realm of\n\n\n4\n      The Ajaj majority did not cite Perkins. In a concurrence, then-Chief\nJudge Henry implied that Perkins had established a precedent involving the\ndenial of outdoor exercise. See Ajaj, 293 F. App’x at 590 (Henry, C.J.,\nconcurring). But Chief Judge Henry then seemed to detract from this\napproach, concluding that the defendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity in part because “prison officials [had] afforded [Mr. Ajaj]\nregular solitary indoor exercise opportunities.” Id. at 591.\n\n\n                                      11\n\freasonable debate, for Perkins can be read either expansively or narrowly.\n\nSee A.M. ex rel.

Holmes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1147 & n.12 (10th Cir.\n\n2016) (concluding that the law was not clearly established when the\n\nplaintiff had relied on an opinion that “could be reasonably read” in a way\n\nthat led the defendant to “reasonably believe[] (even if mistakenly)” that\n\nhis actions were permissible); see also Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v.\n\nRedding, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145852\"><a href=\"/opinion/145852/safford-unified-school-dist-1-v-redding/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378-79 (2009) (concluding that the law was not\n\nclearly established by a prior Supreme Court opinion because it had been\n\nread differently by “well-reasoned” judges in cases that were “numerous\n\nenough”).\n\n     The availability of conflicting interpretations is unsurprising in light\n\nof our competing principles guiding interpretation of precedents like\n\nPerkins. On the one hand, “[t]he language of a judicial decision must be\n\ninterpreted with reference to the circumstances of the particular case and\n\nthe question under consideration.” Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of\n\nJudicial Precedent 80 (2016). In Perkins, these circumstances involved the\n\ndenial of any exercise opportunities outside of the prisoner’s cell. See\n\npp. 9-11, above.\n\n     But on the other hand, “‘[t]he discovery of what facts are material in\n\nany decision is by no means easy.’” Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of\n\nJudicial Precedent 80 (2016) (citation omitted). Generally, we ascertain\n\nthe materiality of individual facts based on which ones are emphasized in a\n\n                                     12\n\fgiven opinion. See id. at 81 (“Most cases combine law and fact in ways\n\nthat emphasize the central role of the facts.”). In Perkins, the court\n\nappeared to emphasize that the plaintiff was prohibited from exercising\n\noutdoors. See pp. 9-10, above.\n\n      At a minimum, Perkins would not render the warden and director\n\n“plainly incompetent” for failing to recognize a constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst an eleven-month ban on outdoor exercise. Perkins’s ambiguity\n\nmeans that our circuit has not clearly established a right to outdoor\n\nexercise over an eleven-month period. As a result, the warden and director\n\nare entitled to qualified immunity. 5\n\nIV.   The defendants did not knowingly violate the Constitution.\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized that liability extends not only to\n\n“‘plainly incompetent’” officials but also to officials who “‘knowingly\n\nviolate the law.’” White v.

See Lowe v. Raemisch, No. 16-1300, slip. op. at 8-10 (10th\nCir. July 25, 2017) (to be published). And Housley involved the denial of\nexercise anywhere outside the cell (rather than a ban on outdoor exercise).\nSee id. at 10. These differences could reasonably have led the warden and\ndirector to question the applicability of Fogle and Housley.\n\n                                        13\n\f2017). Based on this language, the plaintiffs allege that the warden and\n\ndirector knew that they were violating the Constitution in light of a district\n\ncourt opinion addressing similar conditions at the same prison. Appellees’\n\nResp. Br. at 24-25 (citing Anderson v. Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.\n\nColo. 2012)).\n\n      We reject this argument based on a key factual distinction with the\n\ndistrict court case, a conflict with Supreme Court precedent, and the\n\npresence of an erroneous assumption.\n\n      First, the deprivation in the district court’s earlier case spanned\n\ntwelve years. Anderson v. Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1138 (D. Colo.\n\n2012). Here the alleged deprivation lasted only about eleven months.\n\n      Second, the Supreme Court rejected a nearly identical argument in\n\nAshcroft v. al-Kidd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217703\"><a href=\"/opinion/217703/ashcroft-v-al-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011). There the Court concluded that a\n\ndistrict court opinion, which identified the same defendant and said that\n\nhis actions had been unconstitutional, did not clearly establish the\n\nunderlying right because a district court’s holding is not controlling in any\n\njurisdiction. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 741-42. The same is true here.\n\n      Third, the plaintiffs suggest that a defendant’s knowledge affects the\n\navailability of qualified immunity. We reject this suggestion, for there is a\n\nsingle standard: “whether it would have been clear to a reasonable officer\n\nthat the alleged conduct ‘was unlawful in the situation he confronted.’”\n\nZiglar v. Abbasi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2621317</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, slip. op. at 29 (June 19,\n\n                                      14\n\f2017) (quoting Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (2002)). If this standard\n\nis met, the defendant would be either plainly incompetent or a knowing\n\nviolator of the law. See id. (“If so, then the defendant officer must have\n\nbeen either incompetent or else a knowing violator of the law, and thus not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.”).\n\n      For these reasons, the district court’s earlier ruling does not preclude\n\nqualified immunity. See Lowe v. Raemisch, No. 16-1300, slip op. at Part\n\n2(d) (10th Cir. July 25, 2017) (to be published).\n\nV.    Disposition\n\n      We conclude that the warden and director did not violate a clearly\n\nestablished constitutional right. Thus, the district court erred in denying\n\nthe motion to dismiss.\n\n      Reversed and remanded with instructions to grant the motion to\n\ndismiss the personal-capacity claims based on qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\f</pre>",
