Sec. 1651 (1982) directed to the Honorable Russell G. Clark, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri. They argue that orders entered by Judge Clark directing an increase in real estate taxes for property located in the Kansas City, Missouri School District and a surcharge on the state income tax are in excess of his jurisdiction.

After contact by the Kansas City, Missouri School District, the petitioners stated that the order was not binding upon them as they were not parties to Jenkins (their motion to intervene having been denied) and that the levy would not be adjusted.  On September 28, 1987 KCMSD filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief to bar obstruction of the September 15, 1987 order.  The following day, Judge Clark entered a temporary restraining order against the county officials, ordering that they immediately take all steps necessary to adjust the school property tax levy to the rate of $4 per $100 assessed valuation, to collect the levy at that rate for the 1987 year, and to refrain from engaging in or participating in any acts or activities that would interfere with such adjustment.

Petitioners argue generally that the judicial power of the United States does not extend to the levying of state and local taxes, and that there has been no proper exercise of such power in this case.  We are satisfied petitioners' argument is more properly addressed on appeal rather than by writ of prohibition.
