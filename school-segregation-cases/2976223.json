In seven issues, Jespersen\n\ncontends the trial court erred by (1) granting surnrnaryjudgment in favor of appellees on Jespersen’s\n\nclaims based on pregnancy and disability discrimination, violation of section 92.0081 of the property\n\ncode, and breach of contract, and on appellees’ counterclaim for breach of contract; (2) awarding\n\nappellees attorney’s fees; and (3) awarding appellees court costs related to the taking of videotaped\n\ndepositions and obtaining copies of depositions. We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\f                                            Background\n\n        On February 29. 2008. Jespersen was hired to work as a leasing agent for CNCa property\n\n management company that provided on-site management and staff to Sweetwater Ranch, an\n\n apartment complex. In Mardi 2008, Jespersen signed a lease for an apartment at Sweetwater Ranch\n\n and received a discount on the rent because she was employed by CNC.\n\n        There were positions at Sweetwater Ranch for a property manager. an assistant manager, and\n\n two leasing agents. In 2008, CNC was having difficulty filling the positions. According to\n\nJespersen, when she started work, she was the only full time employee in the office at Sweetwater\n\nRanch and was required to work overtime “all the time.” Employees from other properties assisted\n\nat Sweetwatcr Ranch. One of these employees, Sarah McMillan, worked as the acting manager at\n\nSweetwatcr Ranch between March 2008 and July 2008. MeMillan was pregnant at the time.\n\nMcMillan confirmed Sweetwater Ranch was short-staffed and that she worked every day.\n\n        ShortLy after Jespersen started working at Sweetwater Ranch, she learned she was pregnant\n\nwith twins. On April 14, 2008, Jespersen saw Dr. Asuneion Acosta for an upper respiratory\n\ninfection. Dr. Acosta provided a note stating Jespersen needed “at least 2 days off within 7 days\n\nperiod.” After receiving Dr. Acosta’s note, CNC provided Jespersen with two days off during every\n\nseven-day period.\n\n       On May 15,2008. Jespersen saw Dr. lCimberlyChesshir, an obstetrician. At some point after\n\nthe visit Jespemen requested to work twenty hours per week. Jespersen admitted she did not have\n\na note from Dr. Chesshir restricting her work schedule to twenty hours per week, but stated Chesshir\n\nprescribed limited activity during the office visit. According to Jespersen, she informed Pam\n\nLindsey, CNC’s regional supervisor, of Dr. Chesshir’s orders, and Lindsey responded that she\n\nneeded two full-time employees. Lindsey, however, recalled Jespersen saying “it was too much, too\n\n\n\n                                               —2—\n\f stressful for her, she couldn’t do it anti that she was quitting” and that Jespersen left “right then.”\n\n On May 23, 2008, Lindsey completed a Personnel Change Form that stated Jespersen quit without\n\n notice and was not eligible to be rehircd.\n\n        Jespersen subsequently requested three weeks of medical leave. Lynda Goldstein, CNC’s\n\nhuman resources director, testified that Jespersen had not been employed a sufficient period oftime\n\nto be eligible for sick leave or for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). CNC,\n\ntherefore, treated Jespersen as resigning because she was required to take medical leave. According\n\nto Goldstein, this designation allowed Jespersen to be eligible to be rehired.\n\n        Tobi Beck began working as the assistant manager at Sweetwater Ranch on May 27, 2008\n\nand resigned in October 2008 due to stress from working sixty to eighty hours per week. Beck\n\ntestified it would have been helpful to have somebody working twenty hours per week to answer the\n\nphones. At Lindsey’s direction, Beck sent Jespersen a letter on May 29, 2008 stating that, effective\n\nJune 1st, Jespersen’s rent would be $956 per month “due to the fact ofemployment separation with\n\nCNC” and that there was balance due of $225.00 for a security deposit. On June 17, 2008,\n\nSweetwater Ranch sent Jespersen a notice that she still owed $221 for June’s rent\n\n        On June 19,2008, Jespersen sent an email to Dada Miles, CNC’s regional vice-president\n\nabout the June 17th notice. In the email, Jespersen indicated she had been told “two weeks ago” by\n\nher doctor that she could return to work if she did not work “a lot of overtime,” but Lindsey would\n\nnot allow Jespersen to return to work. Jespersen told Miles that Beck said she was working by\n\nherself and no one had been hired for Jespersen’s position. Miles asked Jespersen to obtain a\n\ndoctor’s note for a full release to return to work without restrictions. Pursuant to CNC’s policies,\n\nany employee returning from medical leave of more than two days was required to provide a note\n\nfrom the employee’s doctor.\n\n\n\n\n                                                —3—\n\f         \\Vhen she was hired, .lespersen received a job description for the Ieasmg auc nt position that\n\n stated the physical demands of’ the job included “constant walking. 6oldstein prepared the job\n\n description in either 2000 or 21)07 based on an existing job description, her knowledge from working\n\n fbr a property management company, and conversations about the leasing agent job with ten or\n\n fiFteen employees oICNC. including its regional supervisors and vicepresidents. She also received\n\n input on the job description from individuals belonging to a human resources association comprised\n\nof’ “property management people.\n\n          Jespersen, however, testified that she was not required to walk constantly in her job at\n\nSweetwater Ranch.          McMillan also testified that leasing agents were not constantly walking.\n\nAccording to Kimberly Kennedy, Sweetwater Ranch’s property manager in lebrtiary 2008. a leasing\n\nagent walked several hours during the day, hut did not walk eight hours per day. Beck testified that\n\na leasing agent’s main job was to walk prospective tenants around the property, hut a leasing agent\n\nwas not required to walk constantly. Beck also testified, however, that the amount of walking\n\nrequired of a leasing agent varied on a daily basis. Some days were spent entirely in the office; some\n\ndays, the leasing agent spent “every minute” showing apartments, was walking constantly, and\n\nclimbed a lot of stairs.\n\n        On June 26, 2008, Jespersen obtained a note from Dr. Chesshir stating that she could return\n\nto work forty hours per week, was not restricted, and could do “some walking.”          According to\n\nGoldstein. the job description for a leasing agent required constant walking and, with restrictions on\n\nher ability to walk, Jespersen could not do long periods of walking that might be required on any\n\nparticular day.   Jespersen also could not do marketing, inspection, and comparison of other\n\nproperties. Miles testified a leasing agent could perform the job doing some walking, but admitted\n\nthat, if Sweetwater Ranch was not fully staffed, a leasing agent would be required to do more\n\f nalkiiw. Accordine to Goldstein. she and Miles aerced that, based on the ob descnption, property\n\n neLds and si 11mg issuLs, Swcetn ater Ranch also needed Ic smg agents r ho wet e availabic to ork\n\n overtime. Goldstein and Miles discussed the situation and did not believe that     Jespersen   had been\n\n released to work within the job requirements. CNC did        not   reinstate Jespersen because she was\n\n unable to provide a lull release from her doctor.\n\n        At some point, Jespersen called Miles and asked if. because Jespersen’s position had been\n\nfilled, she had been terminated. Miles responded that Jespersen was terminated when her doctor said\n\nshe could not work and Jespersen left the Sweetwater Ranch ollice.       Jespersen indicated   her doctor\n\nhad said she could work only twenty hours per week and Lindsey said she needed two full-time\n\nleasing agents.   Jespersen then asked what the “paperwork” stated about the reason lbr her\n\ntermination. Miles stated she had not seen the paperwork.\n\n        Jespersen then spoke to Goldstein and asked if her       position   had been filled. Goldstein\n\nresponded that someone had been hired .Je spersen asked if that meant she had been terminated.\n\nGoldstein responded that Jespersen had resigned tbr medical reasons and was eligible to be rehired.\n\nJespersen denied that she had resigned. Goldstein stated that Jesperson had to take medical leave,\n\nand CNC considered an employee on medical leave who was not covered by FMLA to have\n\nresigned. Jespersen said she did not have to take leave because she was available to work twenty\n\nhours a week. Goldstein stated they did not have any part-time positions available.\n\n       On July 9, 2008, Jespersen sent an email   to   Sweetwater Ranch giving notice that she would\n\nvacate her apartment on August 9th. On July 11, 2008, Beck saw Jespersen moving her belongings\n\nout of the apartment. On July 16, 2008, Beck received notice that Jespersen’s check for the July rent\n\nhad been returned due   to   insufficient ftLnds. Pamela White, the manager of Sweetwater Ranch in\n\nJuly 2008, and Beck then went into Jespersen’s apartment to confirm she had moved out of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 —5\n\f apartment. 1 here was trash, hut no furniture, in the apartment and there was some (larnagc to the\n\n apartment that needed to he repaired. Beck posted a notice inside the front door of the apartment\n\n statmu Sweetwater Ranch considered the apartment to be abandoned. Jespersen (11(1 not respond to\n\n the notice, Beck also assessed charges for cleaning and repairing the apartment. On July 24, 2008,\n\n Jespersen brought her cable box to Sweetwater Ranch’s office. According to Jespersen, she planned\n\n to clean the apartment that day, but Beck said she could not return to the apartment. At Lindsey’s\n\n instruction, Heck then had the locks to the apartment changed.\n\n            Jespersen tiled this suit alleging appellees had breached the lease by locking her out of the\n\n apartment and overcharging her for certain fees.’ Jespersen subsequently amended her petition to\n\n allege additional claims for pregnancy and disability discrimination aH(l for violation of section\n\n 92.008 I of the property code. Jespersen filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on\n\n appellees’ counterclaim for breach of contract on grounds appellees had no evidence it tendered\n\nperformance, that Jespersen breached the contract, or that appellees suffered any damages.\n                                                                                  2\n\nAppellees filed a combined traditional and no—evidence motion for summary judgment on\n\nJespersen’s claims. As to Jespersen’s pregnancy and disability discrimination claims, appellees\n\nmoved for summary judgment on grounds (1) Jespersen had no evidence she was qualified for the\n\nleasing agent position or that appellecs treated any non-pregnant or non-disabled employees more\n\nfavorably, (2) Jespersen had no evidence she was disabled or that appellees regarded her as disabled\n\nand the summary judgment evidence conclusively established appellees did not regard Jespersen as\n\n\n\n\n      On October 23, 2008. Jespersen filed a complaint with the Texas Workforce Commission complaining of sex and disability\n                                                                                                                                discrimination.\nOn July 6. 2009. the FWC dismissed the complaint because it was unable to conclude the information obtained established any\n                                                                                                                            statutory violation.\nThe TWC notified Jespersen that she a had a right to file a civil action based on the allegatiotis.\n\n\n      Jespersen also tnoved for summary judgment on grouttds appellees had no evidence to support nineteen affirmative defenses,\n                                                                                                                                 We will address\n   —\n\n\n\n\nthese affirmative defenses only if necessary to the resolution of an issue on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    —6-\n\f disabled: and (3 Jeseoen had no c’ idence to rebut appeliecs’ lcgitinate. nondiscriiiiinatorv\n\n reasons for its employment actions.

Finally. appellces moved thr\n\n summary judgment on its counterclaim for breach of contract and on Jespersen ‘s claim fbr breach\n\n of contract on grounds the evidence established as a matter of law that Jespersen breached the lease\n\n and appellees did not breach the lease.\n\n        Jespersen filed a traditional motion for summary judgment on her pregnancy discrimination,\n\nbreach of contract, and violation ol’ the property code claims and on appellees’ counterclaim for\n\nbreach of contract. As to her pregnancy discrimination claim, Jespersen argued the evidence\n\nestablished as a matter of law that she was terminated because of conditions related to her pregnancy.\n\nShe also contended she was entitled to summary judgment on her claim for breach of contract and\n\nappellees’ counterclaim lbr breach of contract because the evidence established she fully performed\n\nunder the agreement and that appeflees breached the lease agreement by locking her out of her\n\napartment. Finally, she asserted her claim tor a violation of the property code was established as a\n\nmatter of law because appellees changed the locks on her apartment and did not post the notice\n\nrequired by section 92.008 1.\n\n        The trial court granted appellecs motion for summary judgment, dismissed Jespersen’s\n\nclaims, and found that Jespersen was liable to appellees for breach of contract. The trial court\n\nordered that “[a]ttorneys’ fees and damages associated with Jespersen’sj breach of contract shall\n\nbe assessed at a hearing to be set by the Court.” Appellees filed a request for assessment of damages.\n\nattorney’s fees, and costs, relying on evidence attached to the request and to appellees’ motion for\n\f summary judgment. icspersen filed a response to appetite’s request. but o(Thred no additional\n\n evidence. After a hearing, the trial court awarded appellees $3,421 .38 as damages for Jespersen’s\n\n breach of contract, $21,023.03 for attorney’s fees, and $8,029.45 for costs.\n\n                                       Summary Judgment\n\n        In her first five issues, Jcspcrscn argues the trial court erred by granting summary judgment\n\non Jespcrsen’s claims based on pregnancy and disability discrimination, violation ofsection 92.0081\n\nof the property code, and breach ofcontract, and on appellees’ counterclaim for breach of contract.\n\n                                        Standard ofReview\n\n        We review a summaryjudgment de novo.

Jespersen argues she was replaced on a temporary basis\n\nby Beck, who was not pregnant, while appellees argue Jespersen was replaced by McMillan. who\n\nwas pregnant. Although neither McMillan, the acting property manager, nor Beck, the assistant\n\nmanager. were hired as a leasing agent, there was evidence they both performed some of the\n\nfunctions of a leasing agent after Jespersen stopped working at Sweetwater Ranch. Therefore,\n\n\n\n\n                                                   —12—\n\f Jespcrsen failed to produce any evidence that she was replaced by someone outside the protected\n\n class. Further, Jespersen produced no evidence that appellecs did not require the person who\n\n replaced her to have the ability to walk constantly and to work overtime. Because Jespersen failed\n\n to produce any evidence that she was replaced by someone outside of her protected class or others\n\n similarly situated were treated more favorably, she failed to establish a prima fade case of\n\n discrimination.\n\n        Further, even ifJespersen had successfully established a prima fade case ofdiscrimination,\n\nappellees articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for refusing to reinstate .Jespersen’s\n\nemployment. La. Jespersen was not reinstated to the leasing agentjob because she could not perform\n\nthe duties of the job due to medical reasons and the job had been offered to another applicant See\n\nDarLs’., 14 F.3d at 108748 (plaintiff’s physical inability to perform job was legitimate reason for not\n\nhiring plaintiff). Jespersen offered no evidence that these reasons were a pretext for discrimination.\n\n        To raise a fact issue on the pretext element of a discrimination claim, the employee must\n\npresent evidence proving the reasons stated by the employer were not its true reasons, but were a\n\npretext for discrimination, or the reasons were not credible. Reeves, 530 U.S. at 143; Chandler v.\n\nCSCApplied Technologies, LLC, 376 S.W.3d 802,814 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Distj 2012, pet.\n\nfiled) (quoting Elgaghil i Tarrant Cnty. Junior CoIL, 45 S.W.3d 133, 139 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth\n\n2000, pet. denied)). An employee can avoid summary judgment if the evidence, taken as a whole,\n\ncreates a fact issue “as to whether each of the employer’s stated reasons was not what actually\n\nmotivated the employer and creates a reasonable inference that [pregnancy or disability] was a\n\ndeterminative factor in the actions the [employee] is now complaining about.” Chandler, 376\n\nS.W.3d at 814 (emphasis in original) (quoting Elgaghil, 45 S.W.3d at 140); see also Little v.

The issue at\n\nthe pretext stage is not whether the employer made an erroneous decision: it is whether the decision,\n\neven if incorrect, was the real reason for the termination. Sandctad, 309 F’.3d at 899; Mavherrv v,\n\nJought Aircraft (‘a.. 55 F.3d I 086, 1091 (5th Cir. 1995).          The employer “is entitled to he\n\nunreasonable so long as it does not act with discriminatory animus.” Sands’tad, 309 F.3d at 899. if\n\nthe employee intends to show the explanation is so unreasonable it must be pretextual. it is the\n\nemployee’s burden to proffer evidence creating      a   fact issue regarding reasonableness. Id. An\n\nemployee’s subjective belief that she suffered       an   adverse employment action as a result of\n\ndiscrimination, without more, is insufficient to survive a summary judgment motion. Afiehael, 3 14\n\nS.W.3d at 69192 (quoting McC’oy v. Tex. instruments, /nc., 183 S.W.3d 548, 555 (Tex.\n\nApp.-—DaIlas 2006, no pet.)).\n\n          Jespersen maintains she produced evidence that appellees’ reasons for not letting her return\n\nto the leasing agent’s job was a pretext for discrimination through evidence the ability to constantly\n\nwalk and to work overtime were not essential functions of a leasing agent’s job and that Beck told\n\nJespersen on June 17, 2008 that no one had been hired for Jespersen’s position. However, CNC’s\n\nsick leave policy required every employee who was on medical leave for more than two days to\n\nprovide a doctor’s note   before being allowed to return to work. Miles asked Jespersen to provide\n\n\n\n\n                                                —14—\n\fa note from her doctor releasing .Jespsersen to work. Jespersen did not provide the note to CNC until\n\nJune 27, 2008. Goldstein testified the teasing agent job had been offered to another applicant and\n\nwas no longer available. Jespersen offered no evidence a leasing agent position at Sweetwater Ranch\n\nwas available after she provided Dr. Chesshir’s note to CNC.\n\n        Goldstein also testified Jespersen was not reinstated because Dr. Chesshir did not release\n\nJespersen for constant walking or to work more than forty hours per week. The evidence was\n\nundisputed there were no part-time leasing agent positions at Sweetwater Ranch and that employees\n\nat Sweetwater Ranch, including borrowed employees such as McMillan, were required to work\n\novertime on a regular basis. Further, the job description for a leasing agent at Sweetwater Ranch\n\nstated the physical demands for the job included constant walking. Jespersen points to her\n\ntestimony, as well as testimony from Miles, Kennedy, Beck, and McMillan, that a leasing agent was\n\nnot required to constantly walk. However, Goldstein believed that on any particular day. a leasing\n\nagent could be required to walk the entire day. Beck confirmed the walking requirements differed\n\nfrom day to day and that, on any given day, the leasing agent might be required to walk the entire\n\ntime. Miles also confinned that, due to the fact Sweetwater Ranch was not fully staffed, more\n\nwalking could be required of a leasing agent There is no evidence Goldstein did not believe\n\nJespersen was unable to perform the job of leasing agent because she could not walk constantly and\n\ncould not work overtime. Further, there is no evidence any applicant for the job who was not\n\ndisabled or not pregnant, but was unable to work overtime or to constantly walk, was treated any\n\ndifferently than Jespersen.\n\n       Jespersen disagrees with appellees’ decision not to allow her to return to work. However\n\nappellees do not have the burden to prove their legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale is correct.\n\nMcCoy, 183 S.W.3d at 556; see also Little v.

Jespersen does not dispute most ofher belongings were moved out of\n\nthe apartment prior to July 24, 2008. On July 16. 2008, Swectwater Ranch was notified that\n\nJespersen’s check for the July rent had been returned due to insufficient fluids. White and Beck\n\nentered Jespersen’s apartment and, in their opinion, believed Jespersen had moved her belongings\n\nout of the apartment. The lease required Sweetwater Ranch to post a notice on the inside of any\n\napartment that it believed had been abandoned by the tenant Beck posted this notice. Pursuant to\n\nthe lease, Jespersen had two days to dispute whether she had abandoned the apartment. Jespersen\n\nfailed to do so. Accordingly, under the lease, Jespersen abandoned the apartment prior to July 24,\n\n2008 and no longer had any right ofpossession to the apartment. On July 24,2008, Jespersen was\n\ntold she could not return to the apartment. Sweetwater Ranch then changed the locks to the\n\napartment.\n\n       Asrelevanttothiscase,atenantundersection92.008l isa”personwhoisauthorizedbya\n\nlease to occupy a dwelling to the exclusion ofall others.” TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 92.00 1(6) (West\n\n2007). On July 24, 2008, Jespersen was not authorized by a lease to occupy her apartment and,\n\ntherefore, was nota tenant forpurposes of section 92.0081. Accordingly, the trial court did not err\n\nby granting summaryjudgment for appellees on Jespersen’s claim for violation ofsection 92.0081.\n\nWe resolve Jespersen’s third issue against her.\n\n                                       Breach ofContract\n\n       In her fourth and fifth issues, Jespersen argues the trial court erred by granting summary\n\n\n\n                                              —18—\n\fjudgment in favor ofappcllecs on their counterclaim for breach ot contract and on Jesperscns claim\n\ntiw breach of contract.

The trial court, however, did not grant smnmarv judgment on the amount of damages\n\nJespersen was required to pay. Rather, after a hearing that was essentially a bench trial on stipulated\n\nevidence, the trial court flnind both the amount of damages and attorney s ti/es that appellees were\n\nentitled to recover.\n\n        The elements of a breach of contract claim are (1) the existence of a valid contract, (2) the\n\nplaintifFs perkrmance or tendered performance, (3 ) Ihe deti/ndant ‘s breach of’ the contract, and (4)\n\ndamages as a result of the breach, /1KB Hendrick, LP, 380 S.W.3d at 234. Appellees moved for\n\nsummary judgment on their breach ofcontract counterclaim on grounds Jespersen breached the lease\n\nby (1) failing to pay rent through the termination of the lease, (2) keeping a pet in her apartment\n\nwithout written authorization and without paying the required pet deposit, (3) I’ailing to provide\n\nproper notice she was moving out of the apartment, and (4) failing to pay cleaning and damage\n\ncharges and late payment fees, Jespersen admitted that she kept a pet in her apartment without the\n\nwritten authorization required by the lease. Further, although the lease specifically prohibited notice\n\nthat Jespersen was moving out of the apartment from being given by email, Jespersen does not\n\ndispute that she attempted to provide notice by email in violation of the lease provisions. Finally,\n\n.Jespersen admitted she did not pay cleaning and damage charges and late payment fees, but disputed\n\nthe reasonableness of those fees. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by finding as a matter of law\n\nthat Jespersen was liable to appellecs for breach of contract.\n\n       Jespersen moved for summary judgment on her breach of contract claim on grounds she\n\f established asainatter ol lan that she complied with her obligations under the lease and that\n\n  IppelleLs hteaclid the Ic is. by implopet Iv mere    ismg   her ient   O\\   erchargmg her for eleanim and\n\n repair of the apartment. preventine her I nun cleaning the apartment, and instructing her to leave the\n\n property. Appellees moved     for   summary judgment on Jespersen’s breach of contract claims on\n\n grounds it did not improperly increase Jespersen’s rent, it charged Jespersen reasonable fifes for\n\n cleanin2 and rcpairinu the apartment.   it   did not improperly exclude Jespersen from the apartment,\n\n and Jespersen had not been damaged.\n\n         We turn first to the issue of whether the       evidence    conclusively established Jespersen\n\n complied with her obligation to pay rent under the lease. Jespersen admitted her check for the Jul\n\n 2008 rent was returned for insufficient funds, but argues she did not owe any rent for July because\n\n she had been overpaying her rent under the terms of the lease Jespersen’s lease provided for            t\n\n\n monthly rent ot$96. I lowever, an addendum to the lease stated Jespersen was to receive a prorated\n\n concession of$ 157 per month and a “preferred employer discount” of $159.80 per month. Section\n\n 10 of the lease stated:\n\n        Receiving an employee discount of 20%. Resident will pay $639.20 plus utilities in\n        the amount of $37.00 making amount due a month $676.20. Lease will he on a\n        month to month basis; if employee is terminated she will 37 [sic] days to vacate\n        apartment.\n\n.lespersen contends the $157 prorated concession and the $1 59.8() preferred employer discount in the\n\naddendum were required to be deducted from the $639.20 rent in section 10 of the lease, rather than\n\nfrom the market rent of $956. Based on these calculations, she contends she had a credit balance of\n\n$426.60 in July 200$.\n\n       White testified there is generally a special rate that Sweetwater Ranch offered to prospective\n\ntenants that was less than the market rate. The difference between the market price and the special\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20—\n\f price is considered to be a concession and a monthly discount from the market rent. Employees who\n\n lived at Sweetwater Ranch received a twenty percent discount from the market rent. However, this\n\n discount was sometimes taken off the special rate, rather than the market rate. Jespersen’s employee\n\ndiscount was calculated this way.\n\n        The lease stated the market rate for Jespersen’s apartment was $956. Jespersen received a\n\nmonthly concession of $157, making the monthly rent.owed $799. Twenty percent of $799 is\n\n$159.80. the amount ofthe “preferred employer discount,” making the monthly rent owned $639.20.\n\nThis is the exact amount stated in section 10 of the lease. Reading the entire lease, we conclude\n\nJespersen’s initial rent under the lease was $639.20. The evidence established that when Jespersen\n\nstopped working for CNC, she was no longer entitled to the employee discount. Sweetwater Ranch\n\ninitially notified Jespersen that she also would no longer receive the concession of$ 157. However,\n\nSweetwater Ranch ultimately determined Jespersen would continue to receive the concession. Her\n\nmonthly rent then changed to $799 per month plus utilities. We conclude the evidence conclusively\n\nestablished appellees did not overcharge Jespersen for rent.\n\n        We next turn to Jcspersen’s argument that appellees breached the lease by assessing excessive\n\ncharges for cleaning and repairing the property and by preventing her from returning to and cleaning\n\nthe apartment on July 24, 2008. The evidence conclusively established that, after Jespersen\n\nabandoned the apartment, it was necessary to clean and perform some repairs on the apartment.\n\nPursuant to the lease, Sweetwater Ranch was entitled to charge Jespersen for this work, and it is\n\nundisputed Jespersen did not pay the assessed charges. However, the trial court did not grant\n\nsummaryjudgment to appellees as to the amount ofthe fees and charges they were entitled to recover.\n\nRather, it held an evidentiary hearing as to the amount of damages, including the fees and charges.\n\nFinally, as set out above, because Jespersen abandoned the apartment on July 16,2008, she was not\n\n\n\n\n                                               —21—\n\fentitled to return to the property on July 24, 2008.\n\n        We conclude the trial court did not err by granting summaryjudgment dismissing Jcspersen’s\n\nbreach of contact claim and determining Jespersen was liable to appellees for breach of contract\n\nAccordingly, we resolve Jespersen’s fourth and fifth issues against her.\n\n                                           Attorney’s Fees\n\n        In her sixth issue, Jespersen complains the trial court erred by awarding appellees attorney’s\n\nfees because appellecs (1) failed to plead for attorney’s fees as to Jespersen’s discrimination claims\n\nand Jespersen did not try the issue by consent, (2) failed to disclose any calculations or evidence of\n\nthe claimed attorney’s fees in response to Jespersen’s discovery request, (3) failed to disclose an\n\nexpert opinion from a qualified witness to support the request for attorney’s fees, and (4) failed to\n\nmake a demand for attorney’s fees as required by section 38.001 of the civil practice and remedies\n\ncode. Jespersen also contends CNC was not entitled to attorney’s fees because it was not a party to\n\nthe lease.\n\n        We turn first to Jespersen’s complaint the trial court erred by not excluding appellees’\n\nevidence of attorney’s fees. Jesperscn objected to the evidence on grounds that appellees failed to\n\nadequately disclose theircalculation of attorney’s fees and their expertwitness’s opinion on attorney’s\n\nfees in response to Jespersen’s request for disclosure. See TEx. R.

Therefore,\n\nappellees were not required to make a demand on Jespersen for payment before seeking to recover\n\ntheir attorney’s fees for Jespersen’s breach of contract.\n\n        We finally turn to Jespemen’s complaint the trial court erred by awarding CNC, a non-party\n\nto the lease, attorney’s fees on its breach ofcontract counterclaim. Jespersen sued CNC for breaching\n\nthe lease. CNC answered, asserting a general denial followed by a number of affirmative defenses\n\nand brought a counterclaim for breach of contract. One of the affirmative defenses raised by CNC\n\nwas that Jespersen could not recover against CNC on a breach of contract claim because CNC was\n\nnot a party to the lease. Jespersen argues CNC judicially admitted in the affirmative defense that it\n\nwas not a party to the lease and, therefore, CNC is not entitled to recover attorney’s fees on its\n\ncounterclaim.

We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\f                                            Background\n\n        On February 29. 2008. Jespersen was hired to work as a leasing agent for CNCa property\n\n management company that provided on-site management and staff to Sweetwater Ranch, an\n\n apartment complex. In Mardi 2008, Jespersen signed a lease for an apartment at Sweetwater Ranch\n\n and received a discount on the rent because she was employed by CNC.\n\n        There were positions at Sweetwater Ranch for a property manager. an assistant manager, and\n\n two leasing agents. In 2008, CNC was having difficulty filling the positions. According to\n\nJespersen, when she started work, she was the only full time employee in the office at Sweetwater\n\nRanch and was required to work overtime “all the time.” Employees from other properties assisted\n\nat Sweetwatcr Ranch. One of these employees, Sarah McMillan, worked as the acting manager at\n\nSweetwatcr Ranch between March 2008 and July 2008. MeMillan was pregnant at the time.\n\nMcMillan confirmed Sweetwater Ranch was short-staffed and that she worked every day.\n\n        ShortLy after Jespersen started working at Sweetwater Ranch, she learned she was pregnant\n\nwith twins. On April 14, 2008, Jespersen saw Dr. Asuneion Acosta for an upper respiratory\n\ninfection. Dr. Acosta provided a note stating Jespersen needed “at least 2 days off within 7 days\n\nperiod.” After receiving Dr. Acosta’s note, CNC provided Jespersen with two days off during every\n\nseven-day period.\n\n       On May 15,2008. Jespersen saw Dr. lCimberlyChesshir, an obstetrician. At some point after\n\nthe visit Jespemen requested to work twenty hours per week. Jespersen admitted she did not have\n\na note from Dr. Chesshir restricting her work schedule to twenty hours per week, but stated Chesshir\n\nprescribed limited activity during the office visit. According to Jespersen, she informed Pam\n\nLindsey, CNC’s regional supervisor, of Dr. Chesshir’s orders, and Lindsey responded that she\n\nneeded two full-time employees. Lindsey, however, recalled Jespersen saying “it was too much, too\n\n\n\n                                               —2—\n\f stressful for her, she couldn’t do it anti that she was quitting” and that Jespersen left “right then.”\n\n On May 23, 2008, Lindsey completed a Personnel Change Form that stated Jespersen quit without\n\n notice and was not eligible to be rehircd.\n\n        Jespersen subsequently requested three weeks of medical leave. Lynda Goldstein, CNC’s\n\nhuman resources director, testified that Jespersen had not been employed a sufficient period oftime\n\nto be eligible for sick leave or for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). CNC,\n\ntherefore, treated Jespersen as resigning because she was required to take medical leave. According\n\nto Goldstein, this designation allowed Jespersen to be eligible to be rehired.\n\n        Tobi Beck began working as the assistant manager at Sweetwater Ranch on May 27, 2008\n\nand resigned in October 2008 due to stress from working sixty to eighty hours per week. Beck\n\ntestified it would have been helpful to have somebody working twenty hours per week to answer the\n\nphones. At Lindsey’s direction, Beck sent Jespersen a letter on May 29, 2008 stating that, effective\n\nJune 1st, Jespersen’s rent would be $956 per month “due to the fact ofemployment separation with\n\nCNC” and that there was balance due of $225.00 for a security deposit. On June 17, 2008,\n\nSweetwater Ranch sent Jespersen a notice that she still owed $221 for June’s rent\n\n        On June 19,2008, Jespersen sent an email to Dada Miles, CNC’s regional vice-president\n\nabout the June 17th notice. In the email, Jespersen indicated she had been told “two weeks ago” by\n\nher doctor that she could return to work if she did not work “a lot of overtime,” but Lindsey would\n\nnot allow Jespersen to return to work. Jespersen told Miles that Beck said she was working by\n\nherself and no one had been hired for Jespersen’s position. Miles asked Jespersen to obtain a\n\ndoctor’s note for a full release to return to work without restrictions. Pursuant to CNC’s policies,\n\nany employee returning from medical leave of more than two days was required to provide a note\n\nfrom the employee’s doctor.\n\n\n\n\n                                                —3—\n\f         \\Vhen she was hired, .lespersen received a job description for the Ieasmg auc nt position that\n\n stated the physical demands of’ the job included “constant walking. 6oldstein prepared the job\n\n description in either 2000 or 21)07 based on an existing job description, her knowledge from working\n\n fbr a property management company, and conversations about the leasing agent job with ten or\n\n fiFteen employees oICNC. including its regional supervisors and vicepresidents. She also received\n\n input on the job description from individuals belonging to a human resources association comprised\n\nof’ “property management people.\n\n          Jespersen, however, testified that she was not required to walk constantly in her job at\n\nSweetwater Ranch.          McMillan also testified that leasing agents were not constantly walking.\n\nAccording to Kimberly Kennedy, Sweetwater Ranch’s property manager in lebrtiary 2008. a leasing\n\nagent walked several hours during the day, hut did not walk eight hours per day. Beck testified that\n\na leasing agent’s main job was to walk prospective tenants around the property, hut a leasing agent\n\nwas not required to walk constantly. Beck also testified, however, that the amount of walking\n\nrequired of a leasing agent varied on a daily basis. Some days were spent entirely in the office; some\n\ndays, the leasing agent spent “every minute” showing apartments, was walking constantly, and\n\nclimbed a lot of stairs.\n\n        On June 26, 2008, Jespersen obtained a note from Dr. Chesshir stating that she could return\n\nto work forty hours per week, was not restricted, and could do “some walking.”          According to\n\nGoldstein. the job description for a leasing agent required constant walking and, with restrictions on\n\nher ability to walk, Jespersen could not do long periods of walking that might be required on any\n\nparticular day.   Jespersen also could not do marketing, inspection, and comparison of other\n\nproperties. Miles testified a leasing agent could perform the job doing some walking, but admitted\n\nthat, if Sweetwater Ranch was not fully staffed, a leasing agent would be required to do more\n\f nalkiiw.

Goldstein and Miles discussed the situation and did not believe that     Jespersen   had been\n\n released to work within the job requirements. CNC did        not   reinstate Jespersen because she was\n\n unable to provide a lull release from her doctor.\n\n        At some point, Jespersen called Miles and asked if. because Jespersen’s position had been\n\nfilled, she had been terminated. Miles responded that Jespersen was terminated when her doctor said\n\nshe could not work and Jespersen left the Sweetwater Ranch ollice.       Jespersen indicated   her doctor\n\nhad said she could work only twenty hours per week and Lindsey said she needed two full-time\n\nleasing agents.   Jespersen then asked what the “paperwork” stated about the reason lbr her\n\ntermination. Miles stated she had not seen the paperwork.\n\n        Jespersen then spoke to Goldstein and asked if her       position   had been filled. Goldstein\n\nresponded that someone had been hired .Je spersen asked if that meant she had been terminated.\n\nGoldstein responded that Jespersen had resigned tbr medical reasons and was eligible to be rehired.\n\nJespersen denied that she had resigned. Goldstein stated that Jesperson had to take medical leave,\n\nand CNC considered an employee on medical leave who was not covered by FMLA to have\n\nresigned. Jespersen said she did not have to take leave because she was available to work twenty\n\nhours a week. Goldstein stated they did not have any part-time positions available.\n\n       On July 9, 2008, Jespersen sent an email   to   Sweetwater Ranch giving notice that she would\n\nvacate her apartment on August 9th. On July 11, 2008, Beck saw Jespersen moving her belongings\n\nout of the apartment. On July 16, 2008, Beck received notice that Jespersen’s check for the July rent\n\nhad been returned due   to   insufficient ftLnds. Pamela White, the manager of Sweetwater Ranch in\n\nJuly 2008, and Beck then went into Jespersen’s apartment to confirm she had moved out of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 —5\n\f apartment. 1 here was trash, hut no furniture, in the apartment and there was some (larnagc to the\n\n apartment that needed to he repaired.

Jespersen (11(1 not respond to\n\n the notice, Beck also assessed charges for cleaning and repairing the apartment. On July 24, 2008,\n\n Jespersen brought her cable box to Sweetwater Ranch’s office. According to Jespersen, she planned\n\n to clean the apartment that day, but Beck said she could not return to the apartment. At Lindsey’s\n\n instruction, Heck then had the locks to the apartment changed.\n\n            Jespersen tiled this suit alleging appellees had breached the lease by locking her out of the\n\n apartment and overcharging her for certain fees.’ Jespersen subsequently amended her petition to\n\n allege additional claims for pregnancy and disability discrimination aH(l for violation of section\n\n 92.008 I of the property code.

As to Jespersen’s pregnancy and disability discrimination claims, appellees\n\nmoved for summary judgment on grounds (1) Jespersen had no evidence she was qualified for the\n\nleasing agent position or that appellecs treated any non-pregnant or non-disabled employees more\n\nfavorably, (2) Jespersen had no evidence she was disabled or that appellees regarded her as disabled\n\nand the summary judgment evidence conclusively established appellees did not regard Jespersen as\n\n\n\n\n      On October 23, 2008.

As to her pregnancy discrimination claim, Jespersen argued the evidence\n\nestablished as a matter of law that she was terminated because of conditions related to her pregnancy.\n\nShe also contended she was entitled to summary judgment on her claim for breach of contract and\n\nappellees’ counterclaim lbr breach of contract because the evidence established she fully performed\n\nunder the agreement and that appeflees breached the lease agreement by locking her out of her\n\napartment. Finally, she asserted her claim tor a violation of the property code was established as a\n\nmatter of law because appellees changed the locks on her apartment and did not post the notice\n\nrequired by section 92.008 1.\n\n        The trial court granted appellecs motion for summary judgment, dismissed Jespersen’s\n\nclaims, and found that Jespersen was liable to appellees for breach of contract.

Jespersen offered no evidence that these reasons were a pretext for discrimination.\n\n        To raise a fact issue on the pretext element of a discrimination claim, the employee must\n\npresent evidence proving the reasons stated by the employer were not its true reasons, but were a\n\npretext for discrimination, or the reasons were not credible.

However, CNC’s\n\nsick leave policy required every employee who was on medical leave for more than two days to\n\nprovide a doctor’s note   before being allowed to return to work.

Jespersen did not provide the note to CNC until\n\nJune 27, 2008. Goldstein testified the teasing agent job had been offered to another applicant and\n\nwas no longer available. Jespersen offered no evidence a leasing agent position at Sweetwater Ranch\n\nwas available after she provided Dr. Chesshir’s note to CNC.\n\n        Goldstein also testified Jespersen was not reinstated because Dr. Chesshir did not release\n\nJespersen for constant walking or to work more than forty hours per week. The evidence was\n\nundisputed there were no part-time leasing agent positions at Sweetwater Ranch and that employees\n\nat Sweetwater Ranch, including borrowed employees such as McMillan, were required to work\n\novertime on a regular basis. Further, the job description for a leasing agent at Sweetwater Ranch\n\nstated the physical demands for the job included constant walking. Jespersen points to her\n\ntestimony, as well as testimony from Miles, Kennedy, Beck, and McMillan, that a leasing agent was\n\nnot required to constantly walk. However, Goldstein believed that on any particular day. a leasing\n\nagent could be required to walk the entire day. Beck confirmed the walking requirements differed\n\nfrom day to day and that, on any given day, the leasing agent might be required to walk the entire\n\ntime. Miles also confinned that, due to the fact Sweetwater Ranch was not fully staffed, more\n\nwalking could be required of a leasing agent There is no evidence Goldstein did not believe\n\nJespersen was unable to perform the job of leasing agent because she could not walk constantly and\n\ncould not work overtime. Further, there is no evidence any applicant for the job who was not\n\ndisabled or not pregnant, but was unable to work overtime or to constantly walk, was treated any\n\ndifferently than Jespersen.\n\n       Jespersen disagrees with appellees’ decision not to allow her to return to work.

Jespersen does not dispute most ofher belongings were moved out of\n\nthe apartment prior to July 24, 2008. On July 16. 2008, Swectwater Ranch was notified that\n\nJespersen’s check for the July rent had been returned due to insufficient fluids. White and Beck\n\nentered Jespersen’s apartment and, in their opinion, believed Jespersen had moved her belongings\n\nout of the apartment. The lease required Sweetwater Ranch to post a notice on the inside of any\n\napartment that it believed had been abandoned by the tenant Beck posted this notice. Pursuant to\n\nthe lease, Jespersen had two days to dispute whether she had abandoned the apartment. Jespersen\n\nfailed to do so. Accordingly, under the lease, Jespersen abandoned the apartment prior to July 24,\n\n2008 and no longer had any right ofpossession to the apartment. On July 24,2008, Jespersen was\n\ntold she could not return to the apartment. Sweetwater Ranch then changed the locks to the\n\napartment.\n\n       Asrelevanttothiscase,atenantundersection92.008l isa”personwhoisauthorizedbya\n\nlease to occupy a dwelling to the exclusion ofall others.” TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 92.00 1(6) (West\n\n2007). On July 24, 2008, Jespersen was not authorized by a lease to occupy her apartment and,\n\ntherefore, was nota tenant forpurposes of section 92.0081. Accordingly, the trial court did not err\n\nby granting summaryjudgment for appellees on Jespersen’s claim for violation ofsection 92.0081.\n\nWe resolve Jespersen’s third issue against her.\n\n                                       Breach ofContract\n\n       In her fourth and fifth issues, Jespersen argues the trial court erred by granting summary\n\n\n\n                                              —18—\n\fjudgment in favor ofappcllecs on their counterclaim for breach ot contract and on Jesperscns claim\n\ntiw breach of contract.

The trial court, however, did not grant smnmarv judgment on the amount of damages\n\nJespersen was required to pay. Rather, after a hearing that was essentially a bench trial on stipulated\n\nevidence, the trial court flnind both the amount of damages and attorney s ti/es that appellees were\n\nentitled to recover.\n\n        The elements of a breach of contract claim are (1) the existence of a valid contract, (2) the\n\nplaintifFs perkrmance or tendered performance, (3 ) Ihe deti/ndant ‘s breach of’ the contract, and (4)\n\ndamages as a result of the breach, /1KB Hendrick, LP, 380 S.W.3d at 234. Appellees moved for\n\nsummary judgment on their breach ofcontract counterclaim on grounds Jespersen breached the lease\n\nby (1) failing to pay rent through the termination of the lease, (2) keeping a pet in her apartment\n\nwithout written authorization and without paying the required pet deposit, (3) I’ailing to provide\n\nproper notice she was moving out of the apartment, and (4) failing to pay cleaning and damage\n\ncharges and late payment fees, Jespersen admitted that she kept a pet in her apartment without the\n\nwritten authorization required by the lease. Further, although the lease specifically prohibited notice\n\nthat Jespersen was moving out of the apartment from being given by email, Jespersen does not\n\ndispute that she attempted to provide notice by email in violation of the lease provisions. Finally,\n\n.Jespersen admitted she did not pay cleaning and damage charges and late payment fees, but disputed\n\nthe reasonableness of those fees. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by finding as a matter of law\n\nthat Jespersen was liable to appellecs for breach of contract.\n\n       Jespersen moved for summary judgment on her breach of contract claim on grounds she\n\f established asainatter ol lan that she complied with her obligations under the lease and that\n\n  IppelleLs hteaclid the Ic is. by implopet Iv mere    ismg   her ient   O\\   erchargmg her for eleanim and\n\n repair of the apartment. preventine her I nun cleaning the apartment, and instructing her to leave the\n\n property. Appellees moved     for   summary judgment on Jespersen’s breach of contract claims on\n\n grounds it did not improperly increase Jespersen’s rent, it charged Jespersen reasonable fifes for\n\n cleanin2 and rcpairinu the apartment.   it   did not improperly exclude Jespersen from the apartment,\n\n and Jespersen had not been damaged.\n\n         We turn first to the issue of whether the       evidence    conclusively established Jespersen\n\n complied with her obligation to pay rent under the lease. Jespersen admitted her check for the Jul\n\n 2008 rent was returned for insufficient funds, but argues she did not owe any rent for July because\n\n she had been overpaying her rent under the terms of the lease Jespersen’s lease provided for            t\n\n\n monthly rent ot$96. I lowever, an addendum to the lease stated Jespersen was to receive a prorated\n\n concession of$ 157 per month and a “preferred employer discount” of $159.80 per month. Section\n\n 10 of the lease stated:\n\n        Receiving an employee discount of 20%. Resident will pay $639.20 plus utilities in\n        the amount of $37.00 making amount due a month $676.20. Lease will he on a\n        month to month basis; if employee is terminated she will 37 [sic] days to vacate\n        apartment.\n\n.lespersen contends the $157 prorated concession and the $1 59.8() preferred employer discount in the\n\naddendum were required to be deducted from the $639.20 rent in section 10 of the lease, rather than\n\nfrom the market rent of $956. Based on these calculations, she contends she had a credit balance of\n\n$426.60 in July 200$.\n\n       White testified there is generally a special rate that Sweetwater Ranch offered to prospective\n\ntenants that was less than the market rate. The difference between the market price and the special\n\n\n\n\n                                                   20—\n\f price is considered to be a concession and a monthly discount from the market rent. Employees who\n\n lived at Sweetwater Ranch received a twenty percent discount from the market rent. However, this\n\n discount was sometimes taken off the special rate, rather than the market rate. Jespersen’s employee\n\ndiscount was calculated this way.\n\n        The lease stated the market rate for Jespersen’s apartment was $956. Jespersen received a\n\nmonthly concession of $157, making the monthly rent.owed $799. Twenty percent of $799 is\n\n$159.80. the amount ofthe “preferred employer discount,” making the monthly rent owned $639.20.\n\nThis is the exact amount stated in section 10 of the lease. Reading the entire lease, we conclude\n\nJespersen’s initial rent under the lease was $639.20. The evidence established that when Jespersen\n\nstopped working for CNC, she was no longer entitled to the employee discount. Sweetwater Ranch\n\ninitially notified Jespersen that she also would no longer receive the concession of$ 157. However,\n\nSweetwater Ranch ultimately determined Jespersen would continue to receive the concession. Her\n\nmonthly rent then changed to $799 per month plus utilities. We conclude the evidence conclusively\n\nestablished appellees did not overcharge Jespersen for rent.\n\n        We next turn to Jcspersen’s argument that appellees breached the lease by assessing excessive\n\ncharges for cleaning and repairing the property and by preventing her from returning to and cleaning\n\nthe apartment on July 24, 2008. The evidence conclusively established that, after Jespersen\n\nabandoned the apartment, it was necessary to clean and perform some repairs on the apartment.\n\nPursuant to the lease, Sweetwater Ranch was entitled to charge Jespersen for this work, and it is\n\nundisputed Jespersen did not pay the assessed charges. However, the trial court did not grant\n\nsummaryjudgment to appellees as to the amount ofthe fees and charges they were entitled to recover.\n\nRather, it held an evidentiary hearing as to the amount of damages, including the fees and charges.\n\nFinally, as set out above, because Jespersen abandoned the apartment on July 16,2008, she was not\n\n\n\n\n                                               —21—\n\fentitled to return to the property on July 24, 2008.\n\n        We conclude the trial court did not err by granting summaryjudgment dismissing Jcspersen’s\n\nbreach of contact claim and determining Jespersen was liable to appellees for breach of contract\n\nAccordingly, we resolve Jespersen’s fourth and fifth issues against her.\n\n                                           Attorney’s Fees\n\n        In her sixth issue, Jespersen complains the trial court erred by awarding appellees attorney’s\n\nfees because appellecs (1) failed to plead for attorney’s fees as to Jespersen’s discrimination claims\n\nand Jespersen did not try the issue by consent, (2) failed to disclose any calculations or evidence of\n\nthe claimed attorney’s fees in response to Jespersen’s discovery request, (3) failed to disclose an\n\nexpert opinion from a qualified witness to support the request for attorney’s fees, and (4) failed to\n\nmake a demand for attorney’s fees as required by section 38.001 of the civil practice and remedies\n\ncode. Jespersen also contends CNC was not entitled to attorney’s fees because it was not a party to\n\nthe lease.\n\n        We turn first to Jespersen’s complaint the trial court erred by not excluding appellees’\n\nevidence of attorney’s fees. Jesperscn objected to the evidence on grounds that appellees failed to\n\nadequately disclose theircalculation of attorney’s fees and their expertwitness’s opinion on attorney’s\n\nfees in response to Jespersen’s request for disclosure. See TEx. R. Civ. p. 193.6 (absent finding of\n\ngood cause or lack of unfair surprise or prejudice, party who fails to timely respond to discovery\n\nrequest may not introduce into evidence material that was not timely disclosed or offer testimony of\n\nwitness (other than named party) who was not timely identified).

(“Generally, an appellate\n\ncourt reviews a trial court’s decision to award attorney’s fees for an abuse of discretion.”).\n\n        In their counterclaim, appellees sought attorney’s fees based on paragraph 32 of the lease.\n\nThis provision sfltes   Unless a party is seeking exemplary punitive sentimental or peisonal-inury\n\f damages. the prevailing party may recover from the non-prevailing party attorney’s fees and all other\n\n litigation costs.” ‘Parties are free to contract for a fcc-recovery standard either looser or stricter than”\n\n those in chapter 3K of the civil practice and remedies code. lnirrcosstinenic,l (isp.

Therefore,\n\nappellees were not required to make a demand on Jespersen for payment before seeking to recover\n\ntheir attorney’s fees for Jespersen’s breach of contract.\n\n        We finally turn to Jespemen’s complaint the trial court erred by awarding CNC, a non-party\n\nto the lease, attorney’s fees on its breach ofcontract counterclaim. Jespersen sued CNC for breaching\n\nthe lease. CNC answered, asserting a general denial followed by a number of affirmative defenses\n\nand brought a counterclaim for breach of contract. One of the affirmative defenses raised by CNC\n\nwas that Jespersen could not recover against CNC on a breach of contract claim because CNC was\n\nnot a party to the lease. Jespersen argues CNC judicially admitted in the affirmative defense that it\n\nwas not a party to the lease and, therefore, CNC is not entitled to recover attorney’s fees on its\n\ncounterclaim. However, “[a]n affirmative defensive pleading following a general denial is not a\n\njudicial admission.” McRoy v.
