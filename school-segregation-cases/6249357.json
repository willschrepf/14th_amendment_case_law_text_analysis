INTRODUCTION\n              In this appeal, Kaleb Basey argues the Alaska State Troopers (AST) must\ncomply with his requests for certain public records. The State contends the requested\nrecords are statutorily exempt from disclosure because the records pertain to currently\npending federal cases: a criminal case against Basey and a related civil suit he brought\nagainst various state employees. We conclude the State has not established that\ndisclosure of these records “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement\nproceedings”1 or that either of these pending actions “involv[es] a public agency”2 as\nrequired by the statutory exceptions the State cites.\nII.      FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n              Basey was the subject of a joint criminal investigation conducted by AST\nand the Fort Wainwright Criminal Investigation Division. He is now a party to two\nfederal cases stemming from that investigation. First, Basey was indicted by a federal\ngrand jury in December 2014 and is the defendant in a federal criminal case.3 Second,\nBasey brought a federal civil rights lawsuit in January 2016 against more than a dozen\nnamed individuals, including AST officers, based on their alleged actions during the\ninvestigation and his arrest.4\n              In September 2016 Basey filed two public records requests with AST. He\nsought records related to his specific investigation, records related to AST’s use of\n\n\n         1\n              AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A).\n         2\n              AS 40.25.122.\n         3\n            Indictment, United States v. Basey, No. 4:14-CR-00028 (D. Alaska filed\nDec. 16, 2014).\n         4\n              Complaint, Basey v. Hansen, No. 4:16-CV-00004 (D. Alaska filed Jan. 15,\n2016).\n\n                                           -2-                                    7214\n\n\fmilitary search authorizations, and disciplinary and training certification records for two\nAST investigators who are defendants in the civil case.5 About a week later AST denied\nBasey’s requests on the basis that all of the information he requested pertained to\npending litigation. Basey appealed to the Commissioner of the Department of Public\nSafety,6 challenging AST’s determination that the records were not disclosable and\narguing that any nondisclosable information could be redacted. The Commissioner\ndenied the appeal. The denial letter stated that the requested records “pertain to a matter\nthat is currently the subject of civil and/or criminal litigation to which [Basey is] a party”\nand that pursuant to AS 40.25.122 the records “continue to be unavailable through [a\npublic records request] and must be obtained in accordance with court rules.”\n              Basey subsequently filed a complaint in superior court to compel AST to\nproduce the records. The State filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that two statutory\nexceptions justified the denial of Basey’s requests. First, the State claimed that\n“[AS] 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) authorizes refusal to disclose records when the records pertain\nto a pending criminal prosecution,” and it asked the court to take judicial notice of the\npending federal criminal case. Second, the State claimed “[AS] 40.25.122 authorizes\nrefusal to disclose records when the requestor is a party in a pending civil lawsuit that\nrelates to the sought after records,” and it asked the court to take judicial notice of the\npending federal civil case. The State attached a redacted version of the federal civil\ncomplaint to its motion.\n\n\n       5\n              Basey apparently believes these records are relevant to — among other\nthings — his theory that AST has a pattern of using military search authorizations for\ncivilian investigations in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1385 (2012).\nSee generally United States v. Dreyer, 804 F.3d 1266, 1272-77 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc)\n(discussing and applying the Posse Comitatus Act).\n       6\n              See 2 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 96.340(a) (Supp. 2016).\n\n                                             -3-                                        7214\n\n\f             Basey opposed the motion, challenging the State’s characterizations of the\ncited statutory exceptions. Citing Brady v. State7 and an attorney general opinion,8 he\nargued that the AS 40.25.122 litigation exception applies only when the requestor is\n“involved in litigation with the state” and that he had named individual persons, not the\nState, in his civil suit.    (Emphasis in original.)       Basey also argued that the\nAS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) law-enforcement exception did not apply because the State had\nnot “made a sufficient showing . . . that disclosure of the requested records and\ninformation would reasonably interfere with enforcement proceedings.”9\n             Without holding a hearing, the superior court dismissed the case with\nprejudice “[b]ased upon the reasoning in [the State’s] Motion to Dismiss.”\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n             The State did not indicate the procedural basis for its motion to dismiss, nor\ndid the superior court do so in granting the motion. We construe the motion as one to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Alaska Civil Rule 12(b)(6),10 which we\n\n\n\n\n       7\n             965 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1998).\n       8\n             1994 INFORMAL OP. ATT’Y GEN. 99.\n       9\n              Basey also argued that the State had violated 2 AAC 96.330 (Supp. 2016)\nby failing to segregate and redact nondisclosable information to provide otherwise\ndisclosable records. He renews this argument on appeal, but we do not address it as we\nreverse on other grounds. The superior court may address it on remand as appropriate.\n       10\n             See Shooshanian v. Wagner, 672 P.2d 455, 461 (Alaska 1983) (explaining\nthat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion “tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint’s allegations”\n(quoting Dworkin v. First Nat’l Bank of Fairbanks, 444 P.2d 777, 779 (Alaska 1968))).\nOur disposition of this appeal would be the same were we instead to construe the motion\nas one for summary judgment. See Alaska R. Civ. P. 56.\n\n                                           -4-                                       7214\n\n\freview de novo.11 Under Rule 12(b)(6) “[a] complaint should not be dismissed ‘unless\nit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim’\nthat would entitle him to some form of relief.”12 This case also presents questions of\nstatutory interpretation, which we decide “using our independent judgment.”13 We\nconsider the statute’s “text, legislative history, and purpose.”14\nIV.    DISCUSSION\n              “[T]here is a strong commitment in Alaska ‘to ensuring broad public access\nto government records.’ ”15 Consequently, “[e]very person has a right to inspect a public\nrecord in the state,” subject to certain exceptions set forth in statute.16 These exceptions\nare “narrowly construe[d]” in order to further the legislative policy of broad access,17 and\nthe State generally bears the burden of showing that a record is not subject to\n\n\n\n\n       11\n              Larson v.

Litigation Exception (AS 40.25.122)\n              Alaska Statute 40.25.122 provides that documents relating to litigation\ninvolving a “public agency”19 are subject to disclosure, with one exception:\n              A public record that is subject to disclosure and copying\n              under AS 40.25.110-40.25.120 remains a public record\n              subject to disclosure and copying even if the record is used\n              for, included in, or relevant to litigation, including law\n              enforcement proceedings, involving a public agency, except\n              that with respect to a person involved in litigation, the records\n              sought shall be disclosed in accordance with the rules of\n              procedure applicable in a court or an administrative\n              adjudication. In this section, “involved in litigation” means\n              a party to litigation or representing a party to litigation,\n              including obtaining public records for the party.\n\nBasey was unquestionably “involved in litigation” when he submitted his records\nrequests, but he asserts that the exception does not apply because he was not involved\nin litigation with a public agency. Rather, he was involved in litigation with individual\nstate officers he sued in their personal capacity. The State responds that the exception\n\n       18\n              Anchorage Sch. Dist. v. Anchorage Daily News, 779 P.2d 1191, 1193\n(Alaska 1989); see also Fuller, 113 P.3d at 665 (“There is a presumption in favor of\ndisclosure of public documents.”); cf. Gwich’in Steering Comm., 10 P.3d at 579\n(explaining that for a public official to invoke the deliberate process privilege, the official\n“must show as a threshold matter that the communication is both ‘predecisional’ and\n‘deliberative’ ”).\n       19\n             “ ‘[P]ublic agency’ means a political subdivision, department, institution,\nboard, commission, division, authority, public corporation, council, committee, or other\ninstrumentality of the state or a municipality; ‘public agency’ includes the University of\nAlaska and the Alaska Railroad Corporation.” AS 40.25.220(2).\n\n                                             -6-                                         7214\n\n\fapplies but does not cite any authority for its position or otherwise develop its\nargument.20 Implicit in the State’s unsupported argument is a contention that the\nlitigation exception applies whenever the requestor is involved in litigation, regardless\nof whether a public agency is a party to the litigation.\n              Both Basey’s narrow reading of the litigation exception and the State’s\nbroad reading are plausible on the face of AS 40.25.122: the statute’s first clause refers\nto “litigation . . . involving a public agency,” but the second clause — containing the\nexception — refers only to “litigation.” Basey’s is the more natural construction, though.\nGenerally, “each part . . . of a statute should be construed with every other part . . . so as\nto produce a harmonious whole.”21 The litigation exception contained in the second\nclause of AS 40.25.122 is an apparent exception to the first clause: the clauses are joined\nwith the conjunction “except,” and they both refer to the same subject matter. When the\nclauses are read together, the litigation exception exempts fromdisclosure certain records\n\n\n       20\n               The State comes close to making an argument when it asserts that Basey\n“properly could obtain the sought after materials via the discovery rules applicable in the\ncriminal prosecution and civil rights cases, not via a public records request.” But the\nState did not make this argument in the superior court and offers no support for it now,\nother than a general citation to “Federal Criminal Rule 16 and Federal Civil Rules 27­\n37.” And the State does not explain why the supposed availability of the documents\nunder the rules of discovery renders them unavailable under the Public Records Act.\nCf. Rowan B., Sr. v. State, Dep’t of Health & Soc. Servs., Office of Children’s Servs.,\n320 P.3d 1152, 1156 (Alaska 2014) (explaining that the Public Records Act and\ndiscovery rules “[b]oth provide access to information, but they do so for different reasons\nand provide different types of access”). We treat this point as waived. See Hagen v.\nStrobel, 353 P.3d 799, 805 (Alaska 2015). In contrast with the State, Basey cites\npertinent case law and attorney general opinions in support of his argument. See Brady\nv. State, 965 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1998); 1993-99 FORMAL OP. ATT’Y GEN. 1; 1994 INFORMAL\nOP. ATT’Y GEN. 99.\n       21\n              Ward v. State, Dep’t of Pub. Safety, 288 P.3d 94, 99 (Alaska 2012) (quoting\nForest v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 830 P.2d 778, 781 (Alaska 1992)).\n\n                                             -7-                                        7214\n\n\fotherwise disclosable under the first clause of the section — that is, certain records “used\nfor, included in, or relevant to litigation . . . involving a public agency.”22 The exception\ntherefore applies only when the litigation involves a public agency.\n              The history of the litigation exception confirms this interpretation. The\napparent precursor to AS 40.25.122 is a regulation drafted by the Department of Law and\nadopted in 1982. Former 6 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 95.150 provided that if\na “requestor . . . is in litigation with an agency in a judicial or administrative forum,\ndisclosure of . . . records relevant to that litigation or reasonably likely to lead to the\ndiscovery of relevant evidence is governed by the rules or orders in that forum.”23 In a\nletter presenting 6 AAC 95.150 and related regulations, Attorney General Wilson\nCondon explained that the regulation was a response to an “attempt” the preceding year\n“by an attorney in the midst of litigation to carry on discovery of evidence outside the\nparameters of the court rules.”24 According to Attorney General Condon, the attorney’s\nuse of the Public Records Act to obtain discovery had “intruded on the state’s ability to\n\n       22\n              AS 40.25.122 (emphasis added). Cf. N. Alaska Envtl. Ctr. v. State, Dep’t\nof Nat. Res., 2 P.3d 629, 635-36 (Alaska 2000) (reasoning that a statute’s exemption of\npermit issuances from a written-findings requirement otherwise applicable to “disposals”\nimplies that permit issuances are “disposals”); 2A NORMAN J. SINGER & SHAMBIE\nSINGER, STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION § 47:11, at 326 (7th ed. 2014)\n(“Exceptions, like provisos, restrict general legislative language.”).\n       23\n              Former 6 AAC 95.150 (eff. 10/8/1982; repealed 11/6/1994) (emphasis\nadded). Another pertinent regulation, still in effect, is 2 AAC 96.220 (Supp. 2016). It\nprovides: “[A] public agency may inquire whether [the requestor] is a party, or\nrepresents a party, involved in litigation with the state or a public agency to which the\nrequested record is relevant. If so, the [requestor] shall be informed to make the request\nin accordance with applicable court rules.” While 2 AAC 96.220 does not state that the\nlitigation exception applies only when the requestor is involved in litigation with a public\nagency, it strongly implies that this is the case.\n       24\n              1982 INFORMAL OP.

(1990).\n\n                                            -9-                                       7214\n\n\fenacted statute,32 and it is now codified at AS 40.25.122.33 After the Senate’s version of\nH.B. 405 had passed both chambers, Attorney General Douglas Baily sent a bill review\nletter to Governor Steve Cowper in which he discussed the litigation exception.34 He\nwrote that AS 40.25.122 was “consistent with . . . 6 AAC 95.150 and [did] not change\nexisting law.”35\n              The foregoing history shows that the litigation exception was initially\nconceived to protect the State during litigation — to ensure that the State receives the\nprotections afforded by the rules of discovery. Attorney General Condon cited this\npurpose when he presented former 6 AAC 95.150, and in fact 6 AAC 95.150 only\napplied when the requestor was in “litigation with an agency.” There is no indication\nthat the legislature intended a different purpose when it enacted AS 40.25.122. To the\ncontrary, the Department of Law’s substantial involvement in drafting H.B. 405 and its\napproval of adding a litigation provision to the bill suggest that AS 40.25.122 was\nintended as a statutory replacement for 6 AAC 95.150. Attorney General Baily’s\ncontemporaneous interpretation of AS 40.25.122 strongly supports this conclusion.36\n\n      32\n              Ch. 200, § 6, SLA 1990.\n      33\n             The litigation provision was originally codified at AS 09.25.122 but was\nlater renumbered as AS 40.25.122.

Kinney Shoe Corp., 938 P.2d 997, 1000 n.7 (Alaska\n1997) . Here, Attorney General Baily’s interpretation is entitled to significant deference\ngiven that the Department of Law drafted the original version of the litigation exception,\n                                                                             (continued...)\n                                           -10-                                      7214\n\n\fThe history of the litigation exception thus indicates the exception was intended to apply\nonly when the requestor is involved in litigation “involving a public agency.”37\n              Former Attorney General Bruce Botelho reached the same conclusion in\na 1994 informal opinion.38 He referred to the legislative history, citing Attorney General\nBaily’s bill review letter and former 6 AAC 95.150.39 He further explained that “[t]here\nare legitimate public policy reasons for differentiating between record requests made by\nparties involved in litigation against the state and those made by other parties”:\n              When the state is involved in the litigation, requiring the\n              discovery rules to apply to documents sought by the other\n              side ensures that the state is not disadvantaged in litigation by\n              its public records statutes. . . . [I]t ensures equal footing for\n              the state. This analysis simply does not apply when the state\n              isn’t a party to the litigation.[40]\nAttorney General Botelho briefly addressed this issue again in a formal opinion to the\nCommissioner of the Department of Public Safety on “requests for public release of . . .\nlaw enforcement records.”41 There too he concluded that the litigation exception applies\n\n\n\n\n       36\n               (...continued)\nformer 6 AAC 95.150, and was substantially involved in drafting H.B. 405.

State.45 We wrote that the statute “limits access to otherwise\npublic records by ‘person[s] involved in litigation’ with the State.”46 That case did not\npresent the question whether the litigation exception applies only when the requestor is\n\n\n\n\n       42\n              Id. at 3-4 & n.3 (emphasis in original).\n       43\n              Id. at 3.\n       44\n             See Bullock v.

Basey’s complaint refers to his criminal\ncase, but that case is being prosecuted by the federal government, not the State. The\nfederal government is not a “public agency” as defined in the Public Records Act.50\n\n\n\n\n       47\n               Rather, we addressed an equal protection challenge to the litigation\nexception, finding the challenge inadequately briefed and thus waived. Id. at 19. We\nalso reviewed the superior court’s dismissal on summary judgment of a claim that state\nofficials retaliated against a litigant by applying the AS 40.25.122 litigation exception\n“overbroadly.” Id. at 22. We held that the claim was properly dismissed because an\nofficial’s “letter offering to permit [the litigant] access to all public records, if [he] would\ncommit in writing not to use such access to gather documents for litigation, rebut[ted]\nany inference that officials were acting with retaliatory intent.” Id.\n       48\n              See VECO, Inc. v. Rosebrock, 970 P.2d 906, 922 (Alaska 1999) (“Dicta is\ndefined as ‘[o]pinions of a judge which do not embody the resolution or determination\nof the specific case before the court.’ ” (alteration in orginal) (quoting BLACK’S LAW\nDICTIONARY 454 (6th ed. 1990))); see also Joseph v. State, 26 P.3d 459, 468-69 (Alaska\n2001) (“Dictum is not holding.”).\n       49\n               The State also assumed in Brady that this was the correct reading. See Brief\nof Appellees at 12 n.1, Brady, 965 P.2d 1 (No. S-07916), 1997 WL 34617347, at *12 n.1\n(stating that AS 40.25.122 applied “because the [appellants were] involved in litigation\nwith the State”).\n       50\n              AS 40.25.220(2); see supra note 19.\n\n                                             -13-                                         7214\n\n\f              The State requested that the superior court take judicial notice of Basey’s\ncivil case,51 but no public agency is a party to that case either. Rather, Basey’s civil\ncomplaint names a number of individual state officials as defendants, and explicitly states\nBasey is suing them “[i]n their individual capacities.”52 Basey brought his complaint\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal\nBureau of Narcotics,53 neither of which provides for a cause of action against a state or\nstate agency.54\n              The State has not argued that Basey’s civil or criminal case “involv[es] a\npublic agency” in some way other than a public agency being a party to the case, and we\ndo not address this possibility. In other words, we decline to decide whether a public\nagency might be involved in litigation for the purpose of AS 40.25.122 even though it\n\n\n       51\n                Basey argues the superior court erred in taking “judicial notice of disputed\nmatters outside the pleadings without converting the motion to dismiss [into a motion for\nsummary judgment] or explicitly stating that said matters were being excluded.” See\nPedersen v. Blythe, 292 P.3d 182, 185 (Alaska 2012) (“[J]ust as it does when converting\na motion to dismiss [to a motion for summary judgment], the court must give notice . . .\nof its intent to take judicial notice and ‘afford [the parties] an opportunity to dispute the\nfacts judicially noticed.’ ” (quoting Schwartz v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., 374\nF. Supp. 564, 579 (E.D. Pa. 1974))). Since we reverse the superior court on other\ngrounds, we do not address this argument.\n       52\n              Complaint, supra note 4, at 1.\n       53\n              403 U.S. 388 (1971); see Complaint, supra note 4, at 2.\n       54\n               See State, Dep’t of Corr. v. Heisey, 271 P.3d 1082, 1095 (Alaska 2012) (“A\nBivens claim is a judicially created claim which gives relief to plaintiffs claiming federal\nconstitutional violations by federal agents.” (emphasis added)); State, Dep’t of Health\n& Soc.

We conclude it was error for the superior court to grant the State’s\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to AS 40.25.122.\n      B.     Law-Enforcement-Interference Exception (AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A))\n             The State invokes an additional exception to the Public Records Act.\nAlaska Statute 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) provides that law enforcement records are not subject\nto production under the Public Records Act if disclosing them “could reasonably be\nexpected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Although Basey is involved in an\nenforcement proceeding as a defendant in a federal criminal action, he contends the State\nfailed to show that disclosure of the requested records could reasonably be expected to\ninterfere with the federal proceeding. Echoing the argument that it made in the superior\ncourt, the State responds — without elaboration — that AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) allows\nAST “to decline to disclose the [requested records] in light of their being the subject\nmatter of the pending criminal prosecution.”\n             We need not decide today precisely what kind of showing the State must\nmake to invoke AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A). It suffices to say the State cannot invoke the\nlaw-enforcement-interference exception merely by pointing to a pending criminal case\ninvolving the requestor. If the legislature had intended to create a per se exception that\napplies any time the requestor is being prosecuted — even by the federal government and\nnot the State — the legislature would not have required that the requested records be\n“reasonably . . . expected to interfere” with the prosecution.55\n             Based on the record before the court, dismissing Basey’s complaint\npursuant to AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) was error. Basey’s complaint referred to his federal\ncriminal prosecution, but nothing in the complaint shows “beyond doubt” that disclosure\n\n\n      55\n             AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A).\n\n                                           -15-                                     7214\n\fof the requested records could reasonably be expected to interfere with the federal\ncriminal case.56 Even if we assume that the superior court converted the motion to\ndismiss into one for summary judgment,57 it was error to grant summary judgment on the\nbasis of this exception.58 The State did not offer any evidence showing — and did not\neven allege — that disclosure of the requested records could reasonably be expected to\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings.59\nV.     CONCLUSION\n              Because the State failed to show that the litigation exception or the law­\nenforcement-interference exception applies, we REVERSE the superior court’s grant of\nthe State’s motion to dismiss and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n       56\n             Larson v.

INTRODUCTION\n              In this appeal, Kaleb Basey argues the Alaska State Troopers (AST) must\ncomply with his requests for certain public records. The State contends the requested\nrecords are statutorily exempt from disclosure because the records pertain to currently\npending federal cases: a criminal case against Basey and a related civil suit he brought\nagainst various state employees. We conclude the State has not established that\ndisclosure of these records “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement\nproceedings”1 or that either of these pending actions “involv[es] a public agency”2 as\nrequired by the statutory exceptions the State cites.\nII.      FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n              Basey was the subject of a joint criminal investigation conducted by AST\nand the Fort Wainwright Criminal Investigation Division. He is now a party to two\nfederal cases stemming from that investigation. First, Basey was indicted by a federal\ngrand jury in December 2014 and is the defendant in a federal criminal case.3 Second,\nBasey brought a federal civil rights lawsuit in January 2016 against more than a dozen\nnamed individuals, including AST officers, based on their alleged actions during the\ninvestigation and his arrest.4\n              In September 2016 Basey filed two public records requests with AST. He\nsought records related to his specific investigation, records related to AST’s use of\n\n\n         1\n              AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A).\n         2\n              AS 40.25.122.\n         3\n            Indictment, United States v. Basey, No. 4:14-CR-00028 (D. Alaska filed\nDec. 16, 2014).\n         4\n              Complaint, Basey v. Hansen, No. 4:16-CV-00004 (D. Alaska filed Jan. 15,\n2016).\n\n                                           -2-                                    7214\n\n\fmilitary search authorizations, and disciplinary and training certification records for two\nAST investigators who are defendants in the civil case.5 About a week later AST denied\nBasey’s requests on the basis that all of the information he requested pertained to\npending litigation. Basey appealed to the Commissioner of the Department of Public\nSafety,6 challenging AST’s determination that the records were not disclosable and\narguing that any nondisclosable information could be redacted. The Commissioner\ndenied the appeal. The denial letter stated that the requested records “pertain to a matter\nthat is currently the subject of civil and/or criminal litigation to which [Basey is] a party”\nand that pursuant to AS 40.25.122 the records “continue to be unavailable through [a\npublic records request] and must be obtained in accordance with court rules.”\n              Basey subsequently filed a complaint in superior court to compel AST to\nproduce the records. The State filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that two statutory\nexceptions justified the denial of Basey’s requests. First, the State claimed that\n“[AS] 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) authorizes refusal to disclose records when the records pertain\nto a pending criminal prosecution,” and it asked the court to take judicial notice of the\npending federal criminal case. Second, the State claimed “[AS] 40.25.122 authorizes\nrefusal to disclose records when the requestor is a party in a pending civil lawsuit that\nrelates to the sought after records,” and it asked the court to take judicial notice of the\npending federal civil case.

Litigation Exception (AS 40.25.122)\n              Alaska Statute 40.25.122 provides that documents relating to litigation\ninvolving a “public agency”19 are subject to disclosure, with one exception:\n              A public record that is subject to disclosure and copying\n              under AS 40.25.110-40.25.120 remains a public record\n              subject to disclosure and copying even if the record is used\n              for, included in, or relevant to litigation, including law\n              enforcement proceedings, involving a public agency, except\n              that with respect to a person involved in litigation, the records\n              sought shall be disclosed in accordance with the rules of\n              procedure applicable in a court or an administrative\n              adjudication. In this section, “involved in litigation” means\n              a party to litigation or representing a party to litigation,\n              including obtaining public records for the party.\n\nBasey was unquestionably “involved in litigation” when he submitted his records\nrequests, but he asserts that the exception does not apply because he was not involved\nin litigation with a public agency.

When the\nclauses are read together, the litigation exception exempts fromdisclosure certain records\n\n\n       20\n               The State comes close to making an argument when it asserts that Basey\n“properly could obtain the sought after materials via the discovery rules applicable in the\ncriminal prosecution and civil rights cases, not via a public records request.” But the\nState did not make this argument in the superior court and offers no support for it now,\nother than a general citation to “Federal Criminal Rule 16 and Federal Civil Rules 27­\n37.” And the State does not explain why the supposed availability of the documents\nunder the rules of discovery renders them unavailable under the Public Records Act.\nCf.

The\napparent precursor to AS 40.25.122 is a regulation drafted by the Department of Law and\nadopted in 1982. Former 6 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 95.150 provided that if\na “requestor . . . is in litigation with an agency in a judicial or administrative forum,\ndisclosure of . . . records relevant to that litigation or reasonably likely to lead to the\ndiscovery of relevant evidence is governed by the rules or orders in that forum.”23 In a\nletter presenting 6 AAC 95.150 and related regulations, Attorney General Wilson\nCondon explained that the regulation was a response to an “attempt” the preceding year\n“by an attorney in the midst of litigation to carry on discovery of evidence outside the\nparameters of the court rules.”24 According to Attorney General Condon, the attorney’s\nuse of the Public Records Act to obtain discovery had “intruded on the state’s ability to\n\n       22\n              AS 40.25.122 (emphasis added).

To the\ncontrary, the Department of Law’s substantial involvement in drafting H.B. 405 and its\napproval of adding a litigation provision to the bill suggest that AS 40.25.122 was\nintended as a statutory replacement for 6 AAC 95.150.

This analysis simply does not apply when the state\n              isn’t a party to the litigation.[40]\nAttorney General Botelho briefly addressed this issue again in a formal opinion to the\nCommissioner of the Department of Public Safety on “requests for public release of . . .\nlaw enforcement records.”41 There too he concluded that the litigation exception applies\n\n\n\n\n       36\n               (...continued)\nformer 6 AAC 95.150, and was substantially involved in drafting H.B. 405.

We conclude it was error for the superior court to grant the State’s\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to AS 40.25.122.\n      B.     Law-Enforcement-Interference Exception (AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A))\n             The State invokes an additional exception to the Public Records Act.\nAlaska Statute 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) provides that law enforcement records are not subject\nto production under the Public Records Act if disclosing them “could reasonably be\nexpected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Although Basey is involved in an\nenforcement proceeding as a defendant in a federal criminal action, he contends the State\nfailed to show that disclosure of the requested records could reasonably be expected to\ninterfere with the federal proceeding. Echoing the argument that it made in the superior\ncourt, the State responds — without elaboration — that AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) allows\nAST “to decline to disclose the [requested records] in light of their being the subject\nmatter of the pending criminal prosecution.”\n             We need not decide today precisely what kind of showing the State must\nmake to invoke AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A). It suffices to say the State cannot invoke the\nlaw-enforcement-interference exception merely by pointing to a pending criminal case\ninvolving the requestor. If the legislature had intended to create a per se exception that\napplies any time the requestor is being prosecuted — even by the federal government and\nnot the State — the legislature would not have required that the requested records be\n“reasonably . . . expected to interfere” with the prosecution.55\n             Based on the record before the court, dismissing Basey’s complaint\npursuant to AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A) was error. Basey’s complaint referred to his federal\ncriminal prosecution, but nothing in the complaint shows “beyond doubt” that disclosure\n\n\n      55\n             AS 40.25.120(a)(6)(A).\n\n                                           -15-                                     7214\n\fof the requested records could reasonably be expected to interfere with the federal\ncriminal case.56 Even if we assume that the superior court converted the motion to\ndismiss into one for summary judgment,57 it was error to grant summary judgment on the\nbasis of this exception.58 The State did not offer any evidence showing — and did not\neven allege — that disclosure of the requested records could reasonably be expected to\ninterfere with enforcement proceedings.59\nV.     CONCLUSION\n              Because the State failed to show that the litigation exception or the law­\nenforcement-interference exception applies, we REVERSE the superior court’s grant of\nthe State’s motion to dismiss and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n       56\n             Larson v.
