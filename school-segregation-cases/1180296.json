(“FACES”), is a private,\n\nnon-profit organization with religious, educational, and social features.1 FACES was\n\nformed in 2006 to provide enrichment opportunities for homeschooled children. Its\n\nfounders are Catholic parents and the majority, though not all, of the members are\n\nCatholic. When this dispute arose, FACES offered a number of educational courses to its\n\nhigh-school-aged members, none of which related to religion. FACES also sponsored\n\nsocial events. In fall 2008, FACES sponsored a dance, and one FACES parent, Elizabeth\n\nBridgewater, requested special dietary accommodations for her child, Alyssa, who\n\nplanned to attend.       Alyssa suffers from a dietary condition that can cause a life-\n\nthreatening allergic reaction if she eats certain foods. The Bridgewaters were unhappy\n\nwith FACES’ response to their request and filed an accommodation complaint with the\n\nIndiana Civil Rights Commission (“ICRC”).               The following month, the family was\n\nexpelled from FACES. They filed an additional complaint with the ICRC, alleging that\n\nFACES had retaliated against them because they filed the accommodation complaint.\n\n       FACES moved to dismiss the accommodation and retaliation complaints, arguing\n\nthat the ICRC did not have jurisdiction over FACES, which it characterized as a religious\n\n       1\n          According to FACES’ founders, the term “fishers” was “deliberately worked into the\norganization’s name so as to reflect the idea that Christ was a fisher of men and the members of FACES\nwere engaged in a Christian endeavor.” Appellant’s Br. p. 10.\n                                                  2\n\forganization. An administrative law judge (“ALJ”) ultimately ruled that the ICRC had\n\njurisdiction under Indiana’s Civil Rights Law (“the civil rights law”) because FACES\n\n“relates to” education. The same ALJ later ruled on the merits of the Bridgewaters’\n\ncomplaints and concluded that FACES did not commit an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice because it accommodated Alyssa’s dietary needs, but did commit an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice by expelling the Bridgewater family after they filed the\n\naccommodation complaint. The ALJ awarded the Bridgwaters $5000 in damages and\n\nordered FACES to: (1) cease and desist from retaliating against persons because they\n\nfiled a complaint with the ICRC; (2) post a link to the ALJ’s order on all websites on\n\nwhich they communicated information about the case; and (3) offer reinstatement of the\n\nBridgewater family to full membership, including all benefits. Both parties appealed the\n\norder to the ICRC. The order was affirmed in all respects, except the amount of damages\n\nwas decreased.\n\n      Both parties now appeal. The main issues raised on appeal relate to the ICRC’s\n\njurisdiction over FACES and the corrective action FACES was ordered to undertake. In\n\naddition, the parties challenge the ALJ’s conclusions as to accommodation, retaliation,\n\nand damages. We conclude that the nature and features of FACES make the organization\n\nsufficiently related to education such that the ICRC’s jurisdiction is proper, and we\n\nuphold the ALJ’s conclusions, with one exception. We find the ALJ’s order that FACES\n\npost its decision on all websites on which they communicated information regarding the\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fcase to be unconstitutional compelled speech, and we reverse this portion of the order.\n\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                  Facts and Procedural History\n\n        FACES was formed in 2006 by two Catholic mothers, Virginia Zender and\n\nVanessa Alexander. It is a private, non-profit organization incorporated in Indiana since\n\n2007.    See Appellant’s App. p. 43-45.           FACES receives charitable funding from\n\norganizations such as the United Way and is recognized under section 501(c)(3) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\n        FACES has religious, educational, and social features. According to FACES’\n\nfounders, the organization was created to provide “a group where teenagers could get\n\ntogether to learn and socialize in an environment consistent with their Catholic faith,”\n\nAppellant’s Br. p. 8, and\n\n        to implement the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, more\n        specifically: (1) the teaching that parents have primary responsibility for the\n        education of their children; and (2) the teaching that members of the church\n        should demonstrate solidarity and fraternal charity as they endeavor to live\n        their vocation by educating children in their faith and preparing them to\n        serve the common good.\n\nId. at 9. FACES has both Catholic and non-Catholic members.\n\n        Around the time of the events in this case, FACES offered courses for its high-\n\nschool-aged members in subjects such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, computer\n\nprogramming, speech, drama, biology, and French. Members had to pay a fee and sign a\n\nwaiver of liability to enroll in the courses. See Appellant’s App. p. 78. Once enrolled,\n\nFACES members “me[t] once per week for some thirty weeks during the school year” in\n                                              4\n\fpublic spaces such as local libraries and bookstores. Id. at 40, 81-82. The weekly\n\nmeeting would begin at 9:00 a.m. and last until approximately 4:00 p.m. Id. at 77. Some\n\nweekly meetings would end after 4:00 p.m., when students were given tests at the end of\n\nthe day. Id. The courses offered by FACES were taught by volunteer teachers, and, at\n\nother times, by Zender and Alexander. Id. at 79. Some of the courses, like French and\n\nbiology, were taught using textbooks, while others were taught using teacher-generated\n\nmaterials. Id. at 67, 79-80. FACES did not offer any religious courses when this dispute\n\narose. FACES did not issue grades, transcripts, or diplomas. In addition to providing\n\neducational courses, FACES sponsored social activities.\n\n       The Bridgewater family joined FACES in 2007. Elizabeth Bridgewater and her\n\ndaughter Alyssa were particularly involved in the group. In fall 2008, FACES planned to\n\nhost an “All Souls’ Masquerade Ball” to coincide with the Catholic feast day of All\n\nSouls’ Day. Elizabeth was assigned the task of planning the ball, which was to be held at\n\nthe Ritz Charles in Carmel. Elizabeth frequently communicated with Ritz Charles staff to\n\nplan the event, including the menu. Because Elizabeth’s daughter Alyssa suffers from\n\neosinophilic esophagitis (“EE”), a condition that requires Alyssa to adhere to a strict diet\n\nto avoid a life-threatening allergic reaction in which her ability to breathe and swallow is\n\nimpaired or even stopped altogether, Elizabeth told Ritz Charles staff that she and Alyssa\n\nwould need to eat different meals from the other attendees.2 When Elizabeth told Zender\n\n       2\n          Eosinophilic esophagitis causes a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) to build up in the\nesophagus as a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux. When that happens, the eosinophils can\ninflame or injure the esophageal tissue. See http://www.mayoclinic.org/eosinophilic-esophagitis/ (last\nvisited April 30, 2013). The parties dispute whether Alyssa’s condition qualifies as a disability. The\n                                                  5\n\fand Alexander of this plan, Alexander told Elizabeth that she would take over the\n\nplanning duties and told Elizabeth to stop contacting the Ritz Charles.\n\n        Months later, when speaking with Alexander about the ball, Elizabeth learned that\n\nthe menu for the ball included chicken. Elizabeth told Alexander that Alyssa could not\n\neat chicken and would need beef instead. Alexander rejected this idea, telling Elizabeth\n\nthat the boys attending the ball would be jealous if Alyssa received steak and they did\n\nnot. Some time later, Elizabeth followed up on the issue in an email to Alexander and\n\nZender, again requesting that Elizabeth be allowed to order steak, and offering to pay the\n\nprice difference.      If steak was offensive, Elizabeth asked if Alyssa could order a\n\nhamburger. Alexander and Zender rejected Elizabeth’s proposed solutions. Elizabeth\n\nresponded by asking if the Bridgewaters could supply their own dinner for Alyssa, and, if\n\nso, whether they would receive a discount on the ticket price for the ball. Alexander and\n\nZender said that the Bridgewaters could bring Alyssa’s meal, but told Elizabeth that there\n\nwould be no ticket-price adjustment.\n\n        The dispute continued. In October 2008, the Bridgewaters wrote to the FACES\n\nboard—which consisted of Zender, Alexander, and a third woman, Margaret Beard—that\n\nAlyssa would be humiliated if her mother were to bring her meal to the ball. The\n\nBridgewaters said that the Ritz Charles was willing to prepare a special meal for Alyssa,\n\nand renewed their request that this be allowed. They did not receive a response from the\n\n\nBridgewaters argue that FACES has waived any challenge to Alyssa’s condition by raising the issue for\nthe first time in its reply brief. We agree that this issue was not properly raised before FACES’ reply\nbrief. See Ind. Appellate Rule 46(C) (“No new issues shall be raised in the reply brief.”). Therefore, for\npurposes of this appeal, we assume that Alyssa has a disability as a matter of law.\n                                                    6\n\fboard. On October 9, 2008, the Bridgewaters filed a discrimination complaint with the\n\nICRC, alleging that FACES had discriminated against Alyssa by refusing to provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation for her medical condition at the ball. FACES responded,\n\nstating that reasonable accommodations had been provided and Alyssa had not been\n\nprohibited from attending the event.\n\n       Ultimately, the Bridgewaters ordered Alyssa a separate meal from the Ritz\n\nCharles, which they paid for. Alyssa attended the ball on November 2, 2008, without\n\nincident.\n\n       Four days after the ball, the Bridgewaters received a letter from FACES telling\n\nthem that they were being expelled from the organization. The letter gave four reasons\n\nfor the expulsion: (1) Elizabeth had voiced concerns about a FACES class to a teacher\n\nrather than to the FACES board; (2) Elizabeth had, on one occasion, refused to leave a\n\nclassroom when asked; (3) Alyssa brought a tape recorder to one of her classes; and (4)\n\nElizabeth made contact with the Ritz Charles after Alexander had told her not to do so.\n\nId. at 531-32. FACES’ decision came as a surprise to the Bridgewaters, who had never\n\nbefore been told of any complaints about their behavior.\n\n       Elizabeth responded in writing to the reasons for the family’s expulsion. She\n\nexplained that her discussion with a teacher was not related to instruction, but rather the\n\ndispute about Alyssa and the ball. Elizabeth denied having stayed in the classroom after\n\nbeing asked to leave, and she stated that there was no rule prohibiting students from using\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\ftape recorders in FACES classes. Finally, she stated that she contacted the Ritz Charles\n\nafter being instructed not to in order to discuss Alyssa, not on behalf of FACES.\n\n       In November 2008, the ICRC issued a notice stating that probable cause existed to\n\nbelieve that FACES had committed an unlawful discriminatory practice. Id. at 33-35.\n\nThe same day, the Bridgwaters amended their complaint to include the allegation that the\n\nunlawful discrimination had occurred in education and/or public accommodations\n\nbecause of Alyssa’s disability. The Bridgewaters also filed a second complaint with the\n\nICRC, alleging that FACES had unlawfully retaliated against the family by expelling\n\nthem because they had filed an accommodation complaint with the ICRC. FACES\n\ndenied that it had retaliated against the Bridgewaters and moved to dismiss the\n\ncomplaints, arguing that the ICRC did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over FACES\n\nbecause it was a religious organization—not an educational one as the Bridgewaters\n\nclaimed.\n\n       A hearing was held before an ALJ for the ICRC. Following the hearing, the ALJ\n\nruled for the Bridgewaters, concluding that the ICRC had jurisdiction over the\n\naccommodation complaint.      The ALJ explained that the civil rights law prohibited\n\ndiscrimination “relating to” education. And the ALJ concluded that FACES was indeed\n\nrelated to education:\n\n       FACES is a religious-based not[-]for[-]profit corporation recognized as\n       such under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. FACES was\n       formed by a group of parents of home schooled children and its purpose is\n       to provide educational, spiritual, and social enhancement for those children\n       by providing them with opportunities to interact with other adolescents that\n       are not inherent in the home schooling experience. FACES admits family\n                                            8\n\f        affiliates who desire a Catholic environment and who pay a modest annual\n        fee. It meets once a week for some thirty weeks during the school year and\n        periodically for limited social engagements, such as the ball out of which\n        this case arose. At the time of its motion, FACES had eleven family\n        affiliates.\n\n        FACES is a small organization that has genuinely selective criteria for\n        membership. It does not offer goods, services, or facilities to the general\n        public and, for that reason, is not a public accommodation as that term is\n        defined in the [civil rights law].\n\n        [T]here is no provision defining, for purposes of the [civil rights law], what\n        education is. It is clear . . . that “[e]very discriminatory practice relating to\n        . . . education . . . shall be considered unlawful unless . . . specifically\n        exempted from this chapter.” IC 22-9-1-3(1) (emphasis added).\n\n        FACES argues that the [civil rights law] should not be interpreted to apply\n        because to do so would excessively entangle the [civil rights law] with\n        religion, entanglement that would violate both the United States\n        Constitution, U.S. Const., Am. 1, and the Indiana Constitution, Ind. Const.,\n        Art. 1, §§ 3 and 4.\n\n        As reasonable as that argument is, it has no application to the issues raised\n        in this particular case. There is no reason to believe that an inquiry into\n        whether FACES refused to provide a reasonable accommodation to\n        Alyssa’s food allergies would require any consideration of matters at the\n        core of FACES’ religious basis.\n\nId. at 116 (formatting altered). In light of the ALJ’s ruling that the ICRC had jurisdiction\n\nover the complaint, the ICRC consolidated the Bridgewaters’ accommodation and\n\nretaliation complaints and conducted a two-day hearing on the matters in September\n\n2010.\n\n        A year later, the ALJ entered its order with findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. Id. at 9-22. The ALJ found that FACES did not commit an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice, explaining that FACES “did provide a reasonable accommodation for Alyssa\n\n                                               9\n\f[at] the ball. It may not have been the ideal accommodation and it was not the specific\n\naccommodation in Elizabeth’s most recent request for accommodation, but it was a\n\nreasonable accommodation.” Id. at 16. The ALJ also noted that “what was reasonable\n\nfor FACES, a tiny organization putting on its very first ball and being operated by\n\nvolunteers for whom FACES is not their primary occupation” might not have been\n\nreasonable for a larger, more established and professional organization. Id.\n\n       However, the ALJ concluded that FACES did commit an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice when it expelled the Bridgewater family from the organization in retaliation for\n\nfiling the accommodation complaint, saying, “the decision to expel the Bridgewaters is\n\ntoo close in time to the filing of the complaint to consider it coincidental.” Id. at 17. The\n\nALJ addressed each of FACES’ stated reasons for expelling the family:\n\n       One [reason] involved direct contact with a volunteer teacher, which does\n       violate a FACES policy; however, it is hardly uncommon to contact the\n       person with whom one has an issue. It is unworthy of credence that a\n       violation of this policy would be a motive for expulsion.\n\n       The second reason cited was a refusal to leave a class when requested. The\n       e-mail from the teacher [that] Zender solicited reflects that Elizabeth left\n       when the teacher arrived, not that she refused to leave when requested.\n       This, then, [could not] have been a reason for the expulsion.\n\n       Another reason cited by FACES for expelling the Bridgewaters is Alyssa’s\n       use of a tape recorder. This behavior, like that involved with the first\n       reason, is fairly typical behavior and in this instance, FACES does not cite\n       a rule or a policy it contravened. This reason, too, is unlikely to have\n       caused the expulsion.\n\n       The fourth reason cited by FACES – contacting the Ritz after being told not\n       to – does have some validity and would carry more weight if it were not so\n       tied in with the event that led to the filing of the [accommodation]\n       complaint.\n                                             10\n\fId. at 17-18 (formatting altered). Finally, the ALJ explained that there could be “no\n\ndoubt that Alyssa experienced emotional distress as a result of being dismissed from\n\nFACES because of the filing of the [accommodation] complaint.” Id. at 18. The ALJ\n\nnoted that Alyssa had been professionally treated for psychological conditions and had\n\nmedication prescribed. Id. But the ALJ also noted that not all of Alyssa’s stress was\n\nattributable to the dismissal: “some of that distress is doubtlessly attributed to how\n\nFACES dealt with the food issue at the ball, which has been found to be lawful, and it is\n\nprobable that some of her distress arose from factors in her life that have nothing to do\n\nwith FACES.” Id. The ALJ awarded Alyssa $5000 in damages.\n\n       The ALJ ordered FACES to undertake the following corrective action: (1) cease\n\nand desist from retaliating against persons because they filed a complaint with the ICRC;\n\n(2) post a link to the ALJ’s order on all websites on which they communicated\n\ninformation about the case; and (3) offer reinstatement of the Bridgewater family to full\n\nmembership, including all benefits. Id. at 21.\n\n       Both parties appealed the order.      FACES challenged the ALJ’s conclusions\n\nregarding jurisdiction, retaliation, and corrective action. The Bridgewaters challenged\n\nthe ALJ’s conclusions regarding accommodation and damages. After additional briefing\n\nand argument before the ICRC chairperson and other commission members, the ICRC\n\nissued its order, affirming the ALJ’s order in all respects, except for the original amount\n\nof damages awarded to the Bridgewaters. Id. at 23-25. The ICRC reduced the amount of\n\ndamages to $2500, saying that the previous damage award was “too high.” Id. at 24.\n                                            11\n\f        Both parties now appeal. The ICRC appears as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the\n\nBridgewater family.3\n\n                                      Discussion and Decision\n\n        This case requires interpretation of Indiana’s civil rights law. The purpose of the\n\ncivil rights law is set forth in Indiana Code section 22-9-1-2 and provides:\n\n        Sec. 2. (a) It is the public policy of the state to provide all of its citizens\n        equal opportunity for education, employment, access to public\n        conveniences and accommodations . . . and to eliminate segregation or\n        separation based solely on race . . . disability . . . since such segregation is\n        an impediment to equal opportunity. Equal education and employment\n        opportunities and equal access to and use of public accommodations and\n        equal opportunity for acquisition of real property are hereby declared to be\n        civil rights.\n\nIndiana Code section 22-9-1-6 vests the ICRC with the authority to “receive and\n\ninvestigate complaints alleging discriminatory practices.” Included in the definition of\n\nunlawful discrimination is “every discriminatory practice relating to . . . education . . . .”\n\nInd. Code § 22-9-1-3(1)(4). The civil rights law does not explain what “relates to”\n\neducation, and the nature of this case, which involves both religion and education, makes\n\nthis inquiry complicated. What “relates to” education under Indiana’s civil rights law is\n\nthe threshold, first-impression issue disputed by the parties, and the first question facing\n\nthis Court.4 And because this case involves religion, First-Amendment principles act as a\n\nconstitutional “check” on our decision.\n\n\n        3\n         We held oral argument in this case on March 19, 2013. We thank the parties for their able\nadvocacy.\n        4\n          The parties’ briefs focus on the issue of what “relates to” education, and they spend very little\ntime discussing the other jurisdictional basis at issue—whether FACES is a public accommodation. See\n                                                    12\n\f       Where the ICRC has jurisdiction, the civil rights law prohibits retaliation against\n\nany person who files a complaint—or is otherwise involved in related proceedings—with\n\nthe ICRC.      Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(g).         The civil rights law’s definition of “person”\n\nincludes one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, organizations, cooperatives,\n\nand legal representatives, among others.               Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(a).         If the ICRC\n\ndetermines that a person has committed an unlawful discriminatory practice, it shall order\n\nthat person to “cease and desist from the unlawful discriminatory practice and require[e]\n\nthe person to take further affirmative action . . . .” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(j). The ICRC\n\nmay order the person who committed unlawful discrimination to pay damages and post a\n\nnotice of Indiana’s public policy concerning civil rights and the person’s compliance with\n\nthat policy, among other actions. Id.\n\n       After concluding that the ICRC had jurisdiction over the Bridgewaters’ complaints\n\nand that FACES had committed an unlawful discriminatory practice in its retaliatory\n\nexpulsion of the Bridgewaters, the ALJ ordered FACES to take corrective action;\n\nspecifically, to cease and desist from retaliating against persons because they filed a\n\ncomplaint with the ICRC, post a link to the order on any websites on which it\n\ncommunicated information regarding this case, and offer reinstatement to the\n\nBridgewater family. Whether the ICRC can order FACES to do this is the second major\n\nquestion posed in this appeal.\n\n\nInd. Code § 22-9-1-3(m) (“‘Public accommodation’ means any establishment that caters or offers its\nservices or facilities or goods to the general public.”). The ALJ determined that FACES was not a public\naccommodation, and we agree. See Appellant’s App. p. 116. For this reason and because the parties\ndevote the majority of their briefs to the educational argument, we do not address this secondary issue.\n                                                  13\n\f        The remaining issues relate to the ALJ’s conclusions about whether FACES\n\ncommitted unlawful discriminatory practices. The Bridgewaters also ask this Court to\n\nreinstate the original amount of damages ordered by the ALJ.\n\n        When reviewing an administrative decision, we must determine “whether\n\nsubstantial evidence, together with any reasonable inferences that flow from such\n\nevidence, support the [agency’s] findings and conclusions.” Zeller Elevator Co. v. Slygh,\n\n796 N.E.2d 1198, 1206 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003) (citing Walker v. Muscatatuck State Dev.\n\nCtr., 694 N.E.2d 258 (Ind. 1998)), trans. denied. We do not reweigh the evidence or\n\njudge the credibility of witnesses, and we consider only the evidence most favorable to\n\nthe ICRC’s findings. Id. (citing McClain v. Review Bd. of Ind. Dep’t of Workforce Dev.,\n\n693 N.E.2d 1314 (Ind. 1998)). However, if the question before us is primarily a legal\n\nquestion, “we do not grant the same degree of deference to the [agency’s] decision, for\n\nlaw is the province of the judiciary and our constitutional system empowers the courts to\n\ndraw legal conclusions.” Id. (citing Walker, 694 N.E.2d at 266).\n\n                                           I. Jurisdiction\n\n        FACES first challenges the ALJ’s conclusion that the ICRC has jurisdiction over\n\nFACES because it “relates to” education.5 Because the civil rights law does not explain\n\nwhat “relates to” education, we must determine how this phrase should be defined.\n\n\n\n        5\n          In its brief, FACES set forth an additional argument regarding jurisdiction. It claimed that the\nemployer exclusions found in Indiana Code section 22-9-1-3 should apply to a discriminatory practice\n“relating to” education, even if it does not involve employment. See Appellant’s App. p. 33-35.\nHowever, at oral argument, FACES abandoned this claim. See Oral Arg. Video Tr. 21:00-40. Therefore,\nwe need not address this argument.\n                                                   14\n\fFACES also argues that permitting the ICRC to assert its jurisdiction here would\n\nconstitute religious entanglement and violate the First Amendment.\n\n       When courts construe statutes, the goal is to determine and give effect to the\n\nlegislature’s intent. Cooper Indus., LLC v. City of South Bend, 899 N.E.2d 1274, 1283\n\n(Ind. 2009). The first place courts look for evidence is the statutory language. Id. We\n\nexamine statutes as a whole and presume the legislature intended the statute’s language to\n\nbe applied logically and consistent with the statute’s underlying policy. Id. Thus, we can\n\nlook to the underlying purpose of the provisions and to similar sections within the Indiana\n\nCode for guidance. Id. at 1284. Another factor to consider when determining legislative\n\nintent is the statute’s location within the Indiana Code. Januchowski v. N. Ind. Commuter\n\nTransp. Dist., 905 N.E.2d 1041, 1045 (Ind. Ct. App. 2009), trans. denied.\n\n       The ALJ concluded that the “relates to” education requirement was satisfied here.\n\nSee Appellant’s App. p. 116.         At oral argument, the parties offered different\n\ninterpretations of this phrase. FACES argued that in order for a group to “relate to”\n\neducation, it must be a formal institution whose primary purpose is education. Oral Arg.\n\nVideo Tr. 09:38, 12:30-13:04. FACES argued that its primary purpose was religion, not\n\neducation. The Bridgewaters, however, argued that determining whether a group “relates\n\nto” education should be a case-specific inquiry, guided by a number of factors, one of\n\nwhich might be religion. Id. at 53:35-54:12. But there is no easy interpretation due to the\n\nnature of this case. We have before us a religious organization founded by Catholic\n\nparents to provide enrichment opportunities for their homeschooled children. FACES\n\n                                            15\n\fargues—and we do not question—that religion permeates all of its activities.\n\nNonetheless, the majority of FACES’ enrichment opportunities are educational, and\n\nsecular in substance.\n\n       Homeschooling and religion are two areas in which people can largely expect to\n\nbe free of government regulation, and often they are intertwined. Parents have many\n\nreasons for choosing to homeschool their children, but a common reason is a desire to\n\nprovide moral or religious instruction. In this instance, parents make a conscious choice\n\nto place themselves outside state authority as it relates to their child’s education. And\n\nsome parents may, like those here did, opt to supplement their child’s homeschooling in a\n\nmanner consistent with their religious beliefs. We are sensitive to this and wary of\n\nintruding upon their freedom to do so. And yet we believe that a group—even a religious\n\none—may take certain steps to place itself within the purview of the ICRC in this state.\n\nIn determining whether this has occurred, we believe it is necessary to consider the\n\ngroup’s nature and educational features; particularly the level of the group’s formality\n\nand the delivery and substance of the education it provides.\n\n       Here, FACES has taken steps to formalize itself. It was incorporated in 2007. It\n\nreceives charitable funding from organizations such as the United Way and is recognized\n\nunder section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.          It has a board of directors\n\nconsisting of its founders and a third group member. This formality also extends to the\n\ndelivery of the education offered.    FACES offered courses for its high-school-aged\n\nmembers in subjects such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, computer programming,\n\n                                            16\n\fspeech, drama, biology, and French. Members had to pay a fee and sign a waiver of\n\nliability to enroll in the courses and once enrolled, met weekly for some thirty weeks\n\nduring the school year in public spaces such as local libraries and bookstores. Classes\n\nbegan at 9:00 a.m. and continued until approximately 4:00 p.m., although some meetings\n\nwould end after 4:00 p.m. when students were being tested. Courses were taught by\n\nvolunteer teachers and sometimes by adult members, using textbooks or teacher-\n\ngenerated materials. As to the substance of the education, none of the classes offered\n\nwhen this dispute arose pertained to religion. In light of these facts, we conclude that\n\nFACES is sufficiently related to education such that the ICRC’s jurisdiction is proper.\n\n       This is not to say that FACES is somehow not “religious enough.” Nor do we\n\nconclude that FACES’ religious purpose is secondary to, or any less important than, its\n\neducational purpose. We are tasked with giving effect to the plain language of the\n\nstatute, which prohibits unlawful discrimination in “every discriminatory practice relating\n\nto . . . education . . . .” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(1)(4). The statute does not include\n\ncomparative language, and we decline to add it. We must simply determine whether the\n\n“relating to” requirement is satisfied. In the case before us, we conclude that it is.6\n\n       And there is no need to insert a comparative feature into our analysis. The First\n\nAmendment functions as a constitutional safeguard in this respect and would preempt any\n\nunconstitutional application of Indiana’s civil rights law. The United States Supreme\n\n       6\n           FACES argues that our holding will produce an absurd result. It argues that if FACES is\n“related to” education, then play dates, study groups, and booster clubs, among others, could also be\n“related to” education. See Appellant’s App. p. 24. We disagree. By considering the level of formality\nand the nature of the education involved, we can exclude these examples.\n                                                 17\n\fCourt has held that the First Amendment prohibits governmental interference with\n\nreligious tenets—matters of faith, doctrine, or government of religious institutions. See\n\nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and Sch. v. Equal Emp’t Opportunity\n\nComm’n, 132 S. Ct. 694 (2012). FACES’ main argument with respect to Hosanna-Tabor\n\nis that its First-Amendment analysis applies to the remedies ordered by the ICRC, and we\n\naddress that issue later in this opinion. See infra, p. 24-29. However, FACES also cites\n\nHosanna-Tabor for the proposition that permitting the ICRC to assert its jurisdiction here\n\nwould constitute religious entanglement and violate the First Amendment. We cannot\n\nagree. The ICRC inquired into FACES’ accommodation of Alyssa’s dietary needs and\n\nretaliatory expulsion of the Bridgewater family.          There is simply no religious\n\nentanglement issue here—there is no evidence that either of these inquiries resulted in\n\ngovernmental interference with the tenets of the Catholic faith.\n\n                                    II. ALJ Decisions\n\n       Having concluded that the ICRC has jurisdiction over this matter, we now\n\nconsider the ALJ’s decisions. The Bridgewaters argue that the ALJ erred both in finding\n\nthat FACES reasonably accommodated Alyssa at the ball and by reducing the amount of\n\ndamages, and FACES argues that the ALJ erred in finding that it engaged in unlawful\n\nretaliation.\n\n                      A. Disability and Reasonable Accommodation\n\n       FACES does not contend until its reply brief that Alyssa is not disabled as a matter\n\nof law, so that argument is waived. Ind. Appellate Rule 46(C) (“No new issues shall be\n\n                                            18\n\fraised in the reply brief.”). Therefore, for purposes of this appeal, we assume that Alyssa\n\nhas a disability as a matter of law.\n\n       On the other hand, the Bridgewaters argue that the ALJ erred in finding that\n\nAlyssa was reasonably accommodated at the ball. They contend that FACES’ suggestion\n\nfor accommodating Alyssa’s dietary restrictions—having Elizabeth bring Alyssa a meal\n\nfrom home—deprived her of the right to be served food prepared by the Ritz Charles like\n\nevery other child at the event. While Alyssa was able to have a special meal prepared by\n\nthe Ritz Charles, the Bridgewaters argue that this was still discriminatory because no\n\ndiscount was given for her ticket, meaning that Alyssa had to pay twice for one meal\n\nwhen no one else did. We disagree.\n\n       The provided accommodation need only be reasonable and not optimal, see\n\nKersting v. Wal-Mart, 250 F.3d 1109, 1116 (7th Cir. 2001), so FACES acted in\n\ncompliance with the law when it accepted Elizabeth’s proposal of bringing a meal from\n\nhome. While this option may not have been ideal, it was a reasonable accommodation, as\n\nit was the best way to ensure the safety of the food for Alyssa. In the end, Elizabeth\n\nchose to pursue another course of action, but that does not mean that FACES did not act\n\nreasonably in accepting her original proposal for accommodating Alyssa at the event.\n\nWe therefore find that there is sufficient evidence to support the ALJ’s finding that\n\nAlyssa was reasonably accommodated.\n\n                                       B. Retaliation\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       FACES contends that the ALJ erred in finding that it engaged in unlawful\n\nretaliation by expelling the Bridgewaters. In order to succeed on a retaliation claim, a\n\nplaintiff must first show a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence. Powdertech, Inc. v. Joganic, 776 N.E.2d 1251, 1262 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002).\n\nThen, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate and nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for its action. If the defendant is able to carry that burden, then the plaintiff has\n\nthe chance to show again by a preponderance of the evidence that the explanation given\n\nby the defendant is a pretext. Id. Pretext may be demonstrated by showing that the stated\n\nreason for action has no basis in fact; that the stated reason was not the actual reason for\n\naction although it is based on fact; or that the stated reason is insufficient to warrant the\n\naction taken by the defendant. See Dale v. J.G. Bowers, Inc., 709 N.E.2d 366, 369 (Ind.\n\nCt. App. 1999). Additionally, proximity in time between the filing of a complaint and the\n\nretaliatory action may be considered evidence that the stated reason for the defendant’s\n\naction is a pretext. See Whirlpool Corp. v. Vanderburgh Cnty.-City of Evansville Human\n\nRelations Comm’n, 875 N.E.2d 751, 758 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007).\n\n       The ALJ found that the Bridgewaters met their burden of making a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination. Indiana Code section 22-9-1-6(g) prohibits “any person from\n\ndischarging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating against any other person because the\n\nperson filed a complaint . . . .” By showing that they were expelled by FACES only\n\ntwenty-two days after FACES received notice of the original accommodation complaint,\n\nAppellant’s App. p. 20, the ALJ determined that the Bridgewaters met this initial burden.\n\n                                             20\n\f       FACES gave four reasons for its decision to expel the Bridgewaters: (1) Elizabeth\n\nhad voiced concerns about a FACES class to a teacher rather than to the FACES board;\n\n(2) Elizabeth had, on one occasion, refused to leave a classroom when asked; (3) Alyssa\n\nbrought a tape recorder to one of her classes; and (4) Elizabeth made contact with the\n\nRitz Charles after Alexander had told her not to do so. Id. at 16. Elizabeth responded in\n\nwriting, explaining each of the actions.\n\n       In its decision that FACES engaged in retaliation by expelling the Bridgewaters,\n\nthe ALJ found that none of the four reasons given by FACES for the expulsion were\n\nlikely to be the true motive for its action. Id. at 17-18. While the ALJ found that having\n\ndirect contact with a volunteer teacher is against FACES policy, it was “unworthy of\n\ncredence that a violation of this policy would be a motive for expulsion.” Id. at 17. The\n\nALJ also found that the evidence showed that Elizabeth did leave the classroom when the\n\nteacher arrived on the instance in question and there is no FACES rule or policy that\n\nprohibits tape recording a class. Id. at 17-18. Finally, the ALJ did find that contacting\n\nthe Ritz Charles after being told not to might carry some weight in this decision if it were\n\nnot so tied in to the event that led to the actual filing of the original complaint. Id. at 18.\n\nTherefore, the ALJ found that none of the reasons cited by FACES were sufficient to\n\nwarrant expulsion of the Bridgewaters, and the Bridgewaters had met their burden of\n\nshowing that the reasons stated by FACES were pretexts for unlawful retaliation.\n\n       FACES, however, contends that these findings by the ALJ are erroneous, arguing\n\nthat the ALJ focused solely on the temporal proximity between the filing of the complaint\n\n                                              21\n\fand the expulsion of the Bridgewaters as the basis for the ALJ’s conclusion. Appellant’s\n\nBr. p. 54. FACES also argues that the ALJ disregarded both the decisions made by the\n\nmothers who ran the group as not “good enough,” and Elizabeth’s “meddling” in the\n\narrangements for the ball when coming to its decision.\n\n      FACES’ argument is simply a request that we reweigh the evidence, which we\n\nmay not do. On appeal, we are to determine “whether substantial evidence, together with\n\nany reasonable inferences that flow from such evidence, support the [agency’s] findings\n\nand conclusions.” Zeller Elevator Co., 796 N.E.2d at 1206. We are not to reweigh the\n\nevidence, and we consider only the evidence most favorable to the ICRC’s findings.\n\nViewing the evidence in this light, we find that there is sufficient evidence here to\n\nsupport the ALJ’s findings.\n\n                                      C. Damages\n\n      The Bridgewaters contend that the ICRC erred in reducing the amount of damages\n\nawarded to Alyssa. The civil rights law provides that, as a remedy for discriminatory\n\nbehavior, the Commission may require a person to take “further affirmative action as will\n\neffectuate the purpose of this chapter, including but not limited to the power: (A) to\n\nrestore the complainant’s losses incurred as a result of discriminatory treatment, as the\n\ncommission may deem necessary to assure justice . . . .” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(k)(A).\n\nThe statute permits the ICRC to award damages for both economic and emotional\n\ndistress. Ind. Civil Rights Comm’n v. Alder, 714 N.E.2d 632, 637 (Ind. 1999) (citations\n\nomitted). Here, the ALJ awarded the Bridgewaters $5000 in damages. On appeal to the\n\n                                           22\n\fICRC, the commission reduced the damage award to $2500, saying that the previous\n\namount was too high.\n\n      As the ALJ explained, Alyssa suffered emotional distress as a result of a\n\ncombination of factors: being expelled from FACES, how FACES handled the food issue\n\nat the ball, and a number of other issues unrelated to FACES. Alyssa suffered no\n\neconomic losses. Although the Bridgewaters make a very detailed argument that Alyssa\n\nsuffered severe emotional damage, we do not reweigh the evidence or judge the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, and we consider only the evidence most favorable to the ICRC’s\n\nfindings. Zeller Elevator Co., 796 N.E.2d at 1206. And contrary to the Bridgewaters’\n\nclaim, an unexplained change by an agency is not, by definition, arbitrary and capricious.\n\nSee Ind. State Bd. of Registration and Educ. for Health Facility Admrs. v. Cummings, 180\n\nInd. App. 164, 387 N.E.2d 491 (1979) (agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if it is\n\nnot supported by adequate written reasons), reh’g denied. As the ICRC explained, the\n\nprevious amount of damages was too high. See Appellant’s App. p. 24. Given that some\n\nof Alyssa’s emotional distress was related to FACES, while some was not, and that she\n\nsuffered no economic damages, we cannot say that this conclusion was error.\n\n      FACES also challenges the ALJ’s damage award, arguing that any award was\n\ninappropriate. But in doing so, they mischaracterize the award as one for “damages for\n\nexpelling the Bridgewaters . . . .” Appellant’s Br. p. 4. The damages resulted from\n\nFACES’ retaliatory expulsion of the Bridgewater family and the emotional distress\n\nAlyssa suffered as a result. Had the ALJ awarded damages for a justified expulsion of\n\n                                           23\n\fthe Bridgewater family—and here, the ALJ rejected the reasons given by FACES—\n\nFACES could argue that the damages were inappropriate. Because we affirm the ALJ’s\n\nconclusion that the Bridgewaters were expelled in retaliation for filing the\n\naccommodation complaint, we reject FACES’ argument on this issue.\n\n                                        III. Corrective Action\n\n        After finding that FACES unlawfully retaliated against the Bridgewaters for filing\n\nan accommodation complaint, the ALJ not only awarded Alyssa damages, but also\n\nordered FACES to take the following corrective action: (1) cease and desist from\n\nretaliating against persons because they filed a complaint with the ICRC; (2) post a link\n\nto the ALJ’s order on all websites on which they communicated information about the\n\ncase; and (3) offer reinstatement of the Bridgewater family to full membership, including\n\nall benefits. FACES does not challenge the “cease and desist” provision,7 but it does\n\nchallenge the requirements that it, as a religious organization, be forced to reinstate the\n\nBridgewater family into the organization and post the ICRC’s decision on its website\n\nunder the following three United States Supreme Court cases.\n\n            A. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC\n\n        FACES first argues that the ALJ’s decision must be reversed because the\n\nministerial exception within the First Amendment prevents the ICRC from interfering\n\nwith FACES’ religious liberty. In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and\n\n\n        7\n          FACES notes that it would challenge this provision for its lack of detail, but it is choosing not to\nbecause it will not resume its operation if it is subject to the jurisdiction of the ICRC. See Appellant’s Br.\np. 57.\n                                                     24\n\fSchool v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Cheryl Perich worked as a\n\nteacher at a school that had as its mission to offer a “Christ-centered education” to\n\nstudents. 132 S. Ct. at 699. Perich was classified as a “called” teacher, meaning that she\n\nwas “regarded as having been called to [her] vocation by God through a congregation”\n\nand had completed certain academic requirements. Id. Perich taught kindergarten for\n\nfour years and fourth grade for one year at Hosanna-Tabor before she was diagnosed with\n\nnarcolepsy and had to take disability leave. Id. at 700. Six months later, Perich still had\n\nnot returned to work, so the congregation voted to offer her “peaceful release” where the\n\ncongregation would pay for some of her health insurance premiums and Perich would\n\nresign as a called teacher. However, Perich refused to resign, and she was fired about\n\nthree months later. Id.\n\n       Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(EEOC), contending that she had been fired in violation of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC then brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging\n\nthat Perich was fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Id. at 701.\n\nPerich sought either reinstatement to her former job or front pay, back pay, compensatory\n\nand punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and other injunctive relief. Id.\n\n       Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment on the grounds of the ministerial\n\nexception within the First Amendment, and the district court granted it. The district court\n\nfound that “Hosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her out to the world as\n\nsuch long before this litigation began.” Id. Because of that, the district court found that it\n\n                                             25\n\fcould not inquire into the reasons for Perich’s firing. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth\n\nCircuit vacated and remanded the decision.            It acknowledged the existence of the\n\nministerial exception but found that Perich was not a minister because her duties were\n\nidentical to those of a lay teacher. Id. at 701-02.\n\n       The Supreme Court took the case and noted that “the Courts of Appeal have\n\nuniformly recognized the existence of a ‘ministerial exception,’ grounded in the First\n\nAmendment, that precludes application of such legislation to claims concerning the\n\nemployment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.” Id. at 705.\n\nThe Court went on to agree that such a ministerial exception existed and found that it\n\napplied to this particular case.\n\n       In determining whether the ministerial exception applied, the Court looked at “all\n\nthe circumstances of [Perich’s] employment,” id. at 707, which generally included the\n\nfacts that Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a minister and Perich held herself out as a\n\nminister. Specifically, Hosanna-Tabor issued Perich a “diploma of vocation” that gave\n\nher the title “Minister of Religion, Commissioned,” Perich completed eight ministerial-\n\nrelated college-level courses, obtained the endorsement of her local Synod district, passed\n\nan oral examination, claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that was only\n\navailable to individuals earning compensation for ministry, and regarded herself as a\n\nminister at Hosanna-Tabor. Id. at 707-08. The Court also found that the amount of time\n\nthat a person spends doing ministerial activities should be a factor when determining if\n\nshe is a minister, but should not be the sole consideration.\n\n                                              26\n\f       After taking into account all of the above factors, the Court determined that Perich\n\nwas a minister and therefore subject to the ministerial exception of the First Amendment.\n\nTherefore, Perich could not bring suit to challenge her termination, as Hosanna-Tabor\n\nhad the sole authority to “select and control who will minister to the faithful.” Id. at 709.\n\nHowever, the Court clearly stated that its decision applied only to the type of case before\n\nit—“an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister, challenging her\n\nchurch’s decision to fire her.” Id. at 710. The Court went on to say, “we hold only that\n\nthe ministerial exception bars such a suit. We express no view on whether the exception\n\nbars other types of suit . . . . There will be time enough to address the applicability of the\n\nexception to other circumstances if and when they arise.” Id. (Emphasis added).\n\n       In light of this decision, FACES contends that the ICRC’s corrective action\n\ndecision must be reversed, specifically the reinstatement of the Bridgewaters, because it\n\nviolates the right to religious liberty by interfering with the group’s goal of “minister[ing]\n\nto one another and striv[ing] to model religious beliefs and virtues.” Appellant’s Br. p.\n\n61. It argues that this is the precise harm the Supreme Court was trying to prevent in\n\nHosanna-Tabor. FACES equates it being able to determine its members with a church\n\nhaving the sole authority to select its ministers, arguing that there is no material\n\ndifference between the two. We disagree.\n\n       The Court took great care to ensure that its holding was narrowly tailored and\n\nspecific to instances where “an employer is a religious group and the employee is one of\n\nthe groups’ ministers.” Id. at 699. This is not an employment case, FACES is not a\n\n                                             27\n\freligious employer, and the ICRC is not ordering FACES to make anyone a minister.\n\nTherefore, the logic behind the decision in Hosanna-Tabor is inapplicable to the present\n\ncase.\n\n        Even if we were to find that the ministerial exception applies here, FACES’\n\nactions would still not be immune from ICRC corrective action. FACES expelled the\n\nBridgewaters for reasons completely unrelated to religion. The ministerial exception\n\nonly prevents outside interference when “[s]uch action interferes with the internal\n\ngovernance of the church, depriving the church of control over the selection of those who\n\nwill personify its beliefs.” Id. at 706. Since reinstatement of the Bridgewaters involves\n\nno governmental interference with the tenets of the Catholic faith and would not affect\n\nthe ability of FACES to express its religious beliefs, even if Hosanna-Tabor did apply,\n\nFACES’ argument would still fail.\n\n                            B. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\n\n        FACES also argues that the ALJ’s corrective-action decision must be reversed due\n\nto the right of expressive association guaranteed by the First Amendment. In making this\n\nargument, FACES points to Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), for\n\nsupport.\n\n        In Boy Scouts, James Dale was an assistant scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 73\n\nand also the co-president of the Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance. Id. at 644-45.\n\nA newspaper published an interview with Dale and a picture identifying him as the co-\n\npresident of the Lesbian/Gay Alliance, and later that month, his membership with the\n\n                                           28\n\fBoy Scouts was revoked because the organization “specifically forbid membership to\n\nhomosexuals.” Id. at 645. Dale filed suit, alleging that the Boy Scouts had violated New\n\nJersey’s public accommodation statute by revoking his membership based on his sexual\n\norientation. The public accommodation statute prevented discrimination on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation in places of public accommodation.\n\n       The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the Boy Scouts was a place of public\n\naccommodation and therefore subject to the public-accommodation law. It then found\n\nthat the Boy Scouts violated the law when it revoked Dale’s membership based on his\n\nsexual orientation. Id. at 646. The New Jersey Supreme Court also looked at the First\n\nAmendment right to association involved in the case and found that the Boy Scouts’\n\n“large size, nonselectivity, inclusive rather than exclusive purpose, and practice of\n\ninviting or allowing nonmembers to attend meetings, establish that the organization is not\n\nsufficiently personal or private to warrant constitutional protection under freedom of\n\nintimate association.” Id. (internal citation omitted). The Court also found that Dale’s\n\nmembership did not affect the Boy Scouts’ ability to carry out its various purposes. Id. at\n\n647.\n\n       The United States Supreme Court, however, disagreed. Focusing on whether the\n\napplication of the New Jersey public-accommodation law violated the First Amendment,\n\nthe Supreme Court reversed and held that the Boy Scouts could revoke Dale’s\n\nmembership. Forcing the Boy Scouts to keep Dale as a member, it reasoned, would\n\nviolate the group’s freedom of expressive association. Id. at 655-56.\n\n                                            29\n\f       To determine if a group is eligible for First Amendment protection for expressive\n\nassociation, it first must be determined if the group actually engages in expressive\n\nassociation. That means that the group “must engage in some form of expression,\n\nwhether it be public or private.” Id. at 648. In regards to the Boy Scouts, the Supreme\n\nCourt looked at its mission statement, Scout Oath, and Scout Law, and determined that it\n\nhad a clear general mission. To accomplish that mission, “the scoutmasters and assistant\n\nscoutmasters inculcate [the youth members] with the Boy Scouts’ values—both expressly\n\nand by example.” Id. at 649-50. Seeking to transmit a system of values was determined\n\nto be expressive activity, so the Boy Scouts were eligible for First Amendment\n\nprotection. Id. at 650.\n\n       After determining that the Boy Scouts engaged in expressive activity, the Supreme\n\nCourt then undertook an inquiry to determine if “the forced inclusion of Dale as an\n\nassistant scoutmaster would significantly affect the Boy Scouts’ ability to advocate public\n\nor private viewpoints.” Id. While not everyone would agree that homosexual behavior\n\nwas antithetical to “morally straight” and “clean” values that the Boy Scouts seek to\n\nimpart, the organization itself sincerely and consistently held that belief. However, it is\n\nonly the organization’s view that matters, as “it is not the role of the courts to reject a\n\ngroup’s expressed values because they disagree with those values or find them internally\n\ninconsistent.” Id. at 651. The Supreme Court held, therefore, that it must give deference\n\nto a group’s assertions concerning the nature of its expression and what would impair that\n\nexpression. And because the Boy Scouts believed homosexuality was inconsistent with\n\n                                            30\n\fits values, and Dale’s presence as an assistant scoutmaster would interfere with its ability\n\nto not promote a view that is contrary to its beliefs, forcing Dale’s membership upon the\n\nBoy Scouts would be a violation of its freedom of expressive association.\n\n       It is important to note, however, that the Supreme Court states in its opinion that\n\nthe freedom of expressive association is not an absolute freedom. Id. at 648. It can be\n\n“overridden by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the\n\nsuppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive\n\nof associational freedoms.” Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted); see also Bd. of\n\nDirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549 (1987).\n\n       FACES contends that this holding makes the ALJ’s corrective action of requiring\n\nreinstatement of the Bridgewaters unconstitutional because it violates its freedom of\n\nexpressive association. The first inquiry that must be made in this case is whether\n\nFACES engages in expressive association.           Expressive association is defined as\n\n“associat[ing] with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic,\n\neducational, religious, and cultural ends.” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622\n\n(1984). FACES notes that its objective was\n\n       to implement the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, more\n       specifically: (1) the teaching that parents have primary responsibility for the\n       education of their children; and (2) the teaching that members of the church\n       should demonstrate solidarity and fraternal charity as they endeavor to live\n       their vocation by educating children in their faith and preparing them to\n       serve the common good.\n\nAppellant’s Br. p. 9. Alexander also stated that her purpose in forming the group was to\n\nprovide “a group where teenagers could get together to learn and socialize in an\n                                      31\n\fenvironment consistent with their Catholic faith.” Id. at 8. We find that these purposes\n\nfall within the definition of “expressive association,” so we next must determine if the\n\nBridgewaters’ forced inclusion would interfere with FACES’ freedom of expressive\n\nassociation and ability to advocate its desired viewpoints.\n\n       FACES argues that it chose to expel the Bridgewaters because Elizabeth’s\n\n“insubordinate, obstreperous, and mean-spirited” behavior “threatened the group’s efforts\n\nto achieve the high ideals it was created to foster as well as the very existence of the\n\ngroup.” Id. at 62. This argument misses the mark. The ALJ found that the Bridgewaters\n\nwere expelled from FACES in retaliation for filing an accommodation complaint, and we\n\ndo not reweigh evidence.         Therefore, FACES’ allegation that it chose to expel the\n\nBridgewaters because Elizabeth’s “insubordinate, obstreperous, and mean-spirited”\n\nbehavior “threatened the group’s efforts to achieve the high ideals it was created to foster\n\nas well as the very existence of the group,” Appellant’s Br. p. 62, is without merit. In\n\nother words, we cannot go behind the ALJ’s factual findings.\n\n       Since the ALJ found that the Bridgewaters were expelled for reasons that did not\n\nimplicate FACES’ expressive association, requiring that FACES allow the Bridgewaters\n\nback into the group does not violate FACES’ right to expressive association and is not\n\nunconstitutional.8\n\n\n       8\n          Our colleague would construe the phrase “related to education” more narrowly than we do\nunder these circumstances. Here, he argues that to the extent FACES must readmit Alyssa, she should be\nallowed to participate in educational activities only—not social activities. Social activities are an\nimportant component of a child’s education in that they teach respect for others, responsibility, and a\nsense of community. These lessons are learned not only in the academic setting but also during\nextracurricular activities such as clubs and social functions like proms or other dances. FACES’\n                                                  32\n\f       C. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California\n\n       Finally, FACES contends that the ALJ’s order that it “post a link to these Findings\n\nOf Fact, Conclusions Of Law, And Order on all websites on which they have\n\ncommunicated information regarding this case,” Appellant’s App. p. 21, also violates the\n\nFirst Amendment because it constitutes compelled speech.\n\n       In Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California, a\n\ncourt order requiring Pacific Gas and Electric to put a newsletter written by a third party,\n\nToward Utility Rate Normalization, in its billing envelope was found to be a violation of\n\nPacific Gas and Electric’s First Amendment rights. 475 U.S. 1, 20-21 (1986). The\n\nSupreme Court reasoned that Pacific Gas owned the space inside the billing envelope,\n\nand requiring it to include a newsletter with the views of a third party was “forced\n\nassociation with potentially hostile views [that] . . . risks forcing [Pacific Gas and\n\nElectric] to speak where it would prefer to remain silent.” Id. at 18.\n\n       Because this order compelled speech, it “could be valid if it were a narrowly\n\ntailored means of serving a compelling state interest.” Id. at 19. Applying this strict\n\nscrutiny test, the Supreme Court found that although the interest in “fair and effective\n\nutility regulation may be compelling,” the order was not narrowly tailored.                        Id.\n\nTherefore, strict scrutiny was not met and the order was reversed. Id. at 21.\n\n       Like in Pacific Gas, we find that while there is a compelling state interest at stake\n\nhere—eradicating discrimination—the ALJ’s order was not narrowly tailored. The ALJ\n\neducation encompasses both academic and social aspects, and therefore we respectfully disagree with our\ncolleague.\n                                                  33\n\fordered that FACES post the decision “on all websites on which they have communicated\n\ninformation regarding this case,” Appellant’s App. p. 21 (emphasis added), which we\n\nfind to be a more expansive requirement than was necessary to serve the compelling state\n\ninterest at stake. All websites on which they have communicated information regarding\n\nthis case could include countless message boards, comments made on news stories, and a\n\nvast array of other websites on the internet. By potentially requiring speech from FACES\n\non so many websites, the ALJ’s order was not narrowly tailored, and as a result, strict\n\nscrutiny is not met. We therefore hold that this portion of the ALJ’s order must be\n\nreversed.\n\n      Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nBRADFORD, J., concurs.\n\nBAILEY, J., concurs in result with separate opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f                              IN THE\n                    COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA\n\nFISHERS ADOLESCENT CATHOLIC                     )\nENRICHMENT SOCIETY, INC.,                       )\n                                                )\n       Appellant-Respondent,                    )\n                                                )\n              vs.                               )\n                                                )   No. 93A02-1202-EX-145\nELIZABETH BRIDGEWATER o/b/o                     )\nALYSSA BRIDGEWATER,                             )\n                                                )\n       Appellee-Complainant.                    )\n\n\nBAILEY, Judge, Concurring in Result.\n\n       Elizabeth, having elected to homeschool her daughter, Alyssa, and to associate\n\nwith FACES for the purposes of educational and social enrichment, nevertheless filed a\n\ncomplaint with the ICRC concerning FACES’s alleged violation of Alyssa’s civil rights.\n\nFACES ended the Bridgewaters’ involvement with the group. Concluding that FACES’s\n\ndecision to end Alyssa’s membership in the group amounted to retaliation under\n\nIndiana’s civil rights laws, the ICRC imposed a $2,500 fine upon FACES and enjoined\n\nand mandated certain conduct as the end-point of this dispute between a parent and a\n\nreligiously-oriented private club. The dispute centered on the child’s dietary needs at a\n\nsingle social event conducted outside the ordinary timeframe of the club’s educational\n\nactivities.\n\n                                           35\n\f       While I agree with the majority that the ICRC could, within its specialized\n\nexpertise, find that FACES retaliated against Alyssa, and I agree that the ICRC was not\n\nwithin its authority to impose all of the sanctions it did, I would reach these conclusions\n\non significantly narrower grounds than does the majority. I therefore respectfully concur\n\nin result.\n\n       As the majority notes, the ICRC is an agency with specialized expertise in the\n\nmatters that come before it. Ind. Civil Rights Comm’n v. Alder, 714 N.E.2d 632, 635-36\n\n(Ind. 1999). Among the ICRC’s areas of expertise are questions of civil rights violations\n\nand retaliatory conduct in response to the lodging of complaints raising claims of civil\n\nrights violations. Such civil rights violations include discrimination in matters “relating\n\nto … education.” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(l). Thus, “[w]e give deference to the expertise of\n\nthe agency and will not reverse simply because we may have reached a different result\n\nthan the [ICRC].”      Alder, 714 N.E.2d at 635.       “However, although an agency’s\n\ninterpretation of a statute is entitled to great weight, courts rather than administrative\n\nagencies must resolve questions of statutory construction.” Id. at 636. As with statutory\n\nconstruction, subject matter jurisdiction is also a purely legal area that we review de novo\n\nupon appeal. M-Plan, Inc. v. Ind. Comprehensive Health Ins. Ass’n, 809 N.E.2d 834,\n\n837 (Ind. 2004).\n\n       What matters “relat[e] to … education” is left undefined by the Indiana Civil\n\nRights Law (“ICRL”). Arguing over whether the ICRC had jurisdiction to hear the\n\nBridgewaters’ complaint, whether the ICRC had jurisdiction to find that FACES\n\n                                            36\n\fretaliated against the Bridgewaters, and over the scope of the damages to which Alyssa\n\nmay or may not have been entitled, the parties offer differing interpretations of the\n\nstatutory language.\n\n       Mindful that the ICRL provides that it “shall be construed broadly to effectuate its\n\npurpose,” I.C. § 22-9-1-2(f), I think this Court can affirm the ICRC’s order for damages\n\nagainst FACES without addressing the definitional and jurisdictional questions associated\n\nwith the disputed statutory language.       This is because, in addition to the statutory\n\nauthority the ICRC possesses to address claims of discrimination, it also has statutory\n\nauthority to “prevent any person[9] from discharging, expelling, or otherwise\n\ndiscriminating against any other person because the person filed a complaint, testified in\n\nany hearing before this commission, or in any way assisted the commission in any matter\n\nunder its investigation.” I.C. § 22-9-1-6(g). That is, the ICRL affords a remedy where\n\none person has filed a complaint, as a result of which another person engages in any form\n\nof retaliatory conduct against the complainant.              Retaliatory conduct is itself\n\ndiscriminatory under the terms of the statute, then, and a remedy may be afforded to an\n\nindividual harmed by retaliation even where the underlying claim advanced by the\n\ncomplaint is ultimately found to be without merit.\n\n       While there is little or no Indiana case law interpreting subsection 22-9-1-6(g) as it\n\napplies to retaliation against members of an educational or social-group environment, as\n\nFACES appears to be, I think the majority properly adopts the employment-related\n\n       9\n          A “person” is defined as “one (1) or more individuals … associations, organizations …\ncorporations … cooperatives … and other organized groups of persons.” I.C. § 22-9-1-3(a).\n                                              37\n\fstandards for evaluating a claim and reviewing a finding of retaliation in this context. I\n\ntherefore concur with the majority to the extent it concludes that the ICRC properly\n\napplied this standard and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when it found that\n\nFACES retaliated against the Bridgewaters as a result of Elizabeth’s decision to file a\n\ncomplaint.\n\n       I also concur with the majority’s decision to the extent it affirms the ICRC’s\n\n$2500 award for damages resulting from FACES’s retaliation. Indeed, because the ICRC\n\nfound that FACES made reasonable accommodations at the Masquerade Ball for\n\nAlyssa’s condition, it is clear from the ICRC’s order that the only reason damages were\n\nawarded was the Commission’s finding that FACES’s decision to eject Alyssa from the\n\ngroup was pretextual. That order is consistent with the purpose of a separate remedy for\n\nretaliation, which is to ensure that those reporting alleged civil rights violations are\n\nprotected from retaliation for filing a claim; failure to protect an individual for reporting\n\nan alleged violation “ultimately undermines a critically important public policy.”\n\nFrampton v. Cent. Ind. Gas Co., 260 Ind. 249, 253, 297 N.E.2d 425, 428 (1973)\n\n(establishing a cause of action for retaliatory discharge in at-will employment\n\nrelationships where an employee alleged that he was subject to retaliation for exercising\n\nhis statutory right to seek worker’s compensation benefits); see Crawford v. Metro. Gov’t\n\nof Nashville and Davidson Cnty., Tenn., 555 U.S. 271, 279 (2009) (noting that the\n\n“‘primary objective’” of the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964 is “‘avoid[ing] harm’ to employees”).\n\n                                             38\n\f      While I concur in these matters, I do so reluctantly. This is so because I do not\n\nthink that matters “relating to … education,” as provided by the ICRL, ought to\n\nencompass so broad a range of activities as to include a quintessentially social function\n\nlike the Masquerade Ball. That is especially so where the group offering the social\n\nfunction is not a formal school, but rather a small organization of volunteers who, for\n\nthirty days of the year, work together to provide social and other forms of enrichment for\n\nchildren whom they have decided to homeschool.\n\n      In this context, I do not think the reach of the ICRL extends so far as to encompass\n\na social activity like the Masquerade Ball. Put more simply: I do not think, based upon\n\nthe language of the ICRL, that the ICRC would have properly had subject matter\n\njurisdiction over the Bridgewaters’ complaint were it not for FACES’s retaliatory\n\nconduct.\n\n      It seems to me beyond the pale of the ICRL—a statute enacted in the wake of the\n\nupheavals of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s—to conclude that such social\n\noccasions as a Masquerade Ball, held not under the auspices of a formalized school but\n\nby a group of volunteers, are events “relating to … education” such that a member of\n\nFACES is the victim of a civil rights violation when the group will not accommodate her\n\ndietary conditions. Thus, to the extent the ICRC’s order would require that FACES\n\nreadmit Alyssa as a member of the group, I part from the majority and would hold that\n\nthe order only extends to those activities of FACES that are specifically educational\n\nrather than social—that is, FACES’s regularly-scheduled events during which academic\n\n                                           39\n\fenrichment activities like language, computer, and other such classes are offered. While I\n\nrecognize that we are to interpret the ICRL “broadly to effectuate its purpose,” I would\n\nnot conclude that, by the statute’s language, its purposes extend so far as to conclude that\n\nFACES was required to accommodate Alyssa’s dietary needs at the Masquerade Ball.\n\n       That said, I do not agree with FACES that it should be entirely exempt from the\n\nICRC’s jurisdiction. In Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983), the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court held that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could\n\nrevoke the nonprofit tax status of an organization where the IRS’s decision advanced a\n\ncompelling government interest and the decision “substantially outweigh[ed] whatever\n\nburden denial of tax benefits” imposed upon the nonprofit organization, even where the\n\norganization implemented those policies on religious grounds. Id. at 604. In Bob Jones,\n\nthe question before the Court was whether the IRS could revoke the university’s\n\nnonprofit tax status because of its ban on dating and marriage between students of\n\ndifferent races, where opposing racial discrimination was recognized as a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest. Id. at 603-605.\n\n       Here, FACES has argued that because it is a religiously-oriented organization, it\n\nshould be entirely free to add or remove members on nearly any basis. I cannot agree;\n\nindeed, to take FACES’s position would be to hold, in a manner implicitly contrary to the\n\nSupreme Court in the Bob Jones case, that government agencies could have no role at all\n\nin enforcing various laws because those agencies would simply lack jurisdiction over\n\nsuch religiously-minded institutions. It is disingenuous for an organization like FACES\n\n                                            40\n\fto claim the benefits of tax-exempt status, yet ignore with impunity other laws that have\n\nan equally broad-ranged effect.\n\n      I also part from the majority in its rationale for reversing that portion of the\n\nICRC’s order requiring that FACES post notices on its websites. I think there is no need\n\nto turn to constitutional interpretation to resolve this matter, and we should avoid\n\nconstitutional declarations where other, non-constitutional means are available to resolve\n\na dispute. Founds. of East Chicago, Inc. v. City of East Chicago, 927 N.E.2d 900, 905\n\n(Ind. 2010). The ICRL provides the ICRC with authority to require notice posting:\n\n      [the ICRC] shall cause to be served … an order ... requiring the person to\n      take further affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this\n      chapter, including but not limited to the power:\n      ***\n      (B) to require the posting of notice setting forth the public policy of Indiana\n      concerning civil rights and respondent's compliance with the policy in\n      places of public accommodations.\n\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-6(j). A “public accommodation” is “any establishment that caters or offers\n\nits services or facilities or goods to the general public.” I.C. § 22-9-1-3(m). Because\n\nFACES lacks a fixed meeting location or other premises of its own, the ICRC ordered\n\nFACES to post the required notice on any website it operates.\n\n      Yet the ICRC has not found that FACES is a place of public accommodation;\n\nindeed, the ICRC acknowledged that FACES is religiously oriented, limits its\n\nmembership, and does not hold itself out as open to the general public.         The statute\n\nauthorizes the ICRC to order posting of a notice “in places of public accommodations.”\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-6(j)(B). FACES has no physical premises, and I would not hold that any\n                                            41\n\fwebsite operated by FACES is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of\n\nthe ICRL, because FACES does not hold itself out as providing services to the general\n\npublic. See I.C. § 22-9-1-3(m). Because we can properly construe the ICRL to reverse\n\nthat portion of the order that requires FACES to post notice on its websites, I would not\n\nturn to the First Amendment analysis that the majority relies upon to strike the applicable\n\nportion of the ICRC’s order here.\n\n      Though I concur in result, I am less sanguine than the majority about the\n\nlikelihood that expressive association will not be chilled by the result we reach today.\n\nRecognizing the risk that forced inclusion of members could adversely affect the public\n\nor private expression of a group’s principles, the Supreme Court in Boy Scouts of\n\nAmerica v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), held that forced inclusion of a homosexual Scout\n\nleader infringed upon the Boy Scouts of America’s First Amendment right to expressive\n\nassociation when the Boy Scouts had consistently expressed as among its values its\n\nopposition to homosexuality.\n\n      Here, there was evidence that the Bridgewaters’ involvement with FACES\n\nresulted in disorder and interference in the activities of the organization due to\n\nElizabeth’s and Alyssa’s conduct. FACES could have expelled them from membership\n\nin the organization, and any order requiring their readmission would have, I think,\n\ninfringed upon FACES’s First Amendment right to expressive association for, as the\n\nCourt in Dale observed, “‘[f]reedom of association … plainly presupposes a freedom not\n\nto associate.’” Id. at 648 (quoting Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623\n\n                                            42\n\f(1984)). Had the Bridgewaters been expelled from the group before the dispute over the\n\nmenu at the Masquerade Ball and been advised plainly and honestly that the reason for\n\nthe expulsion was Elizabeth’s and Alyssa’s disruptive conduct, any attempt at forced\n\nreintegration of the Bridgewaters into FACES would have raised serious questions about\n\ninfringement upon FACES’s right to expressive association.\n\n       But that is not what happened here. FACES’s expulsion of the Bridgewaters in\n\nthis case, the announced reasons for which were the Bridgewaters’ disruptiveness, was\n\nfound to be retaliatory because of its sequence and timing. And while I concur in the\n\nmajority’s resolution of the matter, I think it important to state clearly that it is only\n\nFACES’s retaliation, as found by the ICRC, that prevents the ICRC’s order from\n\namounting to an infringement upon the group’s right to expressive association.\n\n       I think it unfortunate that we have been brought into a private dispute between two\n\nreligiously-oriented parties who have chosen not to engage the public education system.\n\nYet one seeks to entangle the other in a quest for accommodation typically required of\n\npublic educational institutions, while the other has organized itself in a way that seeks to\n\nexempt the group almost entirely from our state’s civil rights laws while claiming special\n\nstatus under the tax code.\n\n       I do not think that the legislature’s broad intent when it enacted our civil rights\n\nstatutes involved making the ICRC and our courts arbiters of such private disputes as\n\nhave arisen between FACES and the Bridgewaters. But constrained by the language of\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\fthe statute and mindful of our obligation to avoid constitutional questions, I reluctantly,\n\nbut respectfully, concur in result.\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\f",

(“FACES”), is a private,\n\nnon-profit organization with religious, educational, and social features.1 FACES was\n\nformed in 2006 to provide enrichment opportunities for homeschooled children. Its\n\nfounders are Catholic parents and the majority, though not all, of the members are\n\nCatholic. When this dispute arose, FACES offered a number of educational courses to its\n\nhigh-school-aged members, none of which related to religion. FACES also sponsored\n\nsocial events. In fall 2008, FACES sponsored a dance, and one FACES parent, Elizabeth\n\nBridgewater, requested special dietary accommodations for her child, Alyssa, who\n\nplanned to attend.       Alyssa suffers from a dietary condition that can cause a life-\n\nthreatening allergic reaction if she eats certain foods. The Bridgewaters were unhappy\n\nwith FACES’ response to their request and filed an accommodation complaint with the\n\nIndiana Civil Rights Commission (“ICRC”).               The following month, the family was\n\nexpelled from FACES. They filed an additional complaint with the ICRC, alleging that\n\nFACES had retaliated against them because they filed the accommodation complaint.\n\n       FACES moved to dismiss the accommodation and retaliation complaints, arguing\n\nthat the ICRC did not have jurisdiction over FACES, which it characterized as a religious\n\n       1\n          According to FACES’ founders, the term “fishers” was “deliberately worked into the\norganization’s name so as to reflect the idea that Christ was a fisher of men and the members of FACES\nwere engaged in a Christian endeavor.” Appellant’s Br. p. 10.\n                                                  2\n\forganization. An administrative law judge (“ALJ”) ultimately ruled that the ICRC had\n\njurisdiction under Indiana’s Civil Rights Law (“the civil rights law”) because FACES\n\n“relates to” education. The same ALJ later ruled on the merits of the Bridgewaters’\n\ncomplaints and concluded that FACES did not commit an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice because it accommodated Alyssa’s dietary needs, but did commit an unlawful\n\ndiscriminatory practice by expelling the Bridgewater family after they filed the\n\naccommodation complaint. The ALJ awarded the Bridgwaters $5000 in damages and\n\nordered FACES to: (1) cease and desist from retaliating against persons because they\n\nfiled a complaint with the ICRC; (2) post a link to the ALJ’s order on all websites on\n\nwhich they communicated information about the case; and (3) offer reinstatement of the\n\nBridgewater family to full membership, including all benefits. Both parties appealed the\n\norder to the ICRC. The order was affirmed in all respects, except the amount of damages\n\nwas decreased.\n\n      Both parties now appeal. The main issues raised on appeal relate to the ICRC’s\n\njurisdiction over FACES and the corrective action FACES was ordered to undertake. In\n\naddition, the parties challenge the ALJ’s conclusions as to accommodation, retaliation,\n\nand damages. We conclude that the nature and features of FACES make the organization\n\nsufficiently related to education such that the ICRC’s jurisdiction is proper, and we\n\nuphold the ALJ’s conclusions, with one exception. We find the ALJ’s order that FACES\n\npost its decision on all websites on which they communicated information regarding the\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fcase to be unconstitutional compelled speech, and we reverse this portion of the order.\n\nWe affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                  Facts and Procedural History\n\n        FACES was formed in 2006 by two Catholic mothers, Virginia Zender and\n\nVanessa Alexander. It is a private, non-profit organization incorporated in Indiana since\n\n2007.    See Appellant’s App. p. 43-45.           FACES receives charitable funding from\n\norganizations such as the United Way and is recognized under section 501(c)(3) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\n        FACES has religious, educational, and social features. According to FACES’\n\nfounders, the organization was created to provide “a group where teenagers could get\n\ntogether to learn and socialize in an environment consistent with their Catholic faith,”\n\nAppellant’s Br. p. 8, and\n\n        to implement the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, more\n        specifically: (1) the teaching that parents have primary responsibility for the\n        education of their children; and (2) the teaching that members of the church\n        should demonstrate solidarity and fraternal charity as they endeavor to live\n        their vocation by educating children in their faith and preparing them to\n        serve the common good.\n\nId. at 9. FACES has both Catholic and non-Catholic members.\n\n        Around the time of the events in this case, FACES offered courses for its high-\n\nschool-aged members in subjects such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, computer\n\nprogramming, speech, drama, biology, and French. Members had to pay a fee and sign a\n\nwaiver of liability to enroll in the courses. See Appellant’s App. p. 78. Once enrolled,\n\nFACES members “me[t] once per week for some thirty weeks during the school year” in\n                                              4\n\fpublic spaces such as local libraries and bookstores. Id. at 40, 81-82. The weekly\n\nmeeting would begin at 9:00 a.m. and last until approximately 4:00 p.m. Id. at 77. Some\n\nweekly meetings would end after 4:00 p.m., when students were given tests at the end of\n\nthe day. Id. The courses offered by FACES were taught by volunteer teachers, and, at\n\nother times, by Zender and Alexander. Id. at 79. Some of the courses, like French and\n\nbiology, were taught using textbooks, while others were taught using teacher-generated\n\nmaterials. Id. at 67, 79-80. FACES did not offer any religious courses when this dispute\n\narose. FACES did not issue grades, transcripts, or diplomas. In addition to providing\n\neducational courses, FACES sponsored social activities.\n\n       The Bridgewater family joined FACES in 2007. Elizabeth Bridgewater and her\n\ndaughter Alyssa were particularly involved in the group. In fall 2008, FACES planned to\n\nhost an “All Souls’ Masquerade Ball” to coincide with the Catholic feast day of All\n\nSouls’ Day. Elizabeth was assigned the task of planning the ball, which was to be held at\n\nthe Ritz Charles in Carmel. Elizabeth frequently communicated with Ritz Charles staff to\n\nplan the event, including the menu. Because Elizabeth’s daughter Alyssa suffers from\n\neosinophilic esophagitis (“EE”), a condition that requires Alyssa to adhere to a strict diet\n\nto avoid a life-threatening allergic reaction in which her ability to breathe and swallow is\n\nimpaired or even stopped altogether, Elizabeth told Ritz Charles staff that she and Alyssa\n\nwould need to eat different meals from the other attendees.2 When Elizabeth told Zender\n\n       2\n          Eosinophilic esophagitis causes a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) to build up in the\nesophagus as a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux. When that happens, the eosinophils can\ninflame or injure the esophageal tissue. See http://www.mayoclinic.org/eosinophilic-esophagitis/ (last\nvisited April 30, 2013). The parties dispute whether Alyssa’s condition qualifies as a disability. The\n                                                  5\n\fand Alexander of this plan, Alexander told Elizabeth that she would take over the\n\nplanning duties and told Elizabeth to stop contacting the Ritz Charles.\n\n        Months later, when speaking with Alexander about the ball, Elizabeth learned that\n\nthe menu for the ball included chicken. Elizabeth told Alexander that Alyssa could not\n\neat chicken and would need beef instead. Alexander rejected this idea, telling Elizabeth\n\nthat the boys attending the ball would be jealous if Alyssa received steak and they did\n\nnot. Some time later, Elizabeth followed up on the issue in an email to Alexander and\n\nZender, again requesting that Elizabeth be allowed to order steak, and offering to pay the\n\nprice difference.      If steak was offensive, Elizabeth asked if Alyssa could order a\n\nhamburger. Alexander and Zender rejected Elizabeth’s proposed solutions. Elizabeth\n\nresponded by asking if the Bridgewaters could supply their own dinner for Alyssa, and, if\n\nso, whether they would receive a discount on the ticket price for the ball. Alexander and\n\nZender said that the Bridgewaters could bring Alyssa’s meal, but told Elizabeth that there\n\nwould be no ticket-price adjustment.\n\n        The dispute continued. In October 2008, the Bridgewaters wrote to the FACES\n\nboard—which consisted of Zender, Alexander, and a third woman, Margaret Beard—that\n\nAlyssa would be humiliated if her mother were to bring her meal to the ball. The\n\nBridgewaters said that the Ritz Charles was willing to prepare a special meal for Alyssa,\n\nand renewed their request that this be allowed. They did not receive a response from the\n\n\nBridgewaters argue that FACES has waived any challenge to Alyssa’s condition by raising the issue for\nthe first time in its reply brief. We agree that this issue was not properly raised before FACES’ reply\nbrief. See Ind. Appellate Rule 46(C) (“No new issues shall be raised in the reply brief.”). Therefore, for\npurposes of this appeal, we assume that Alyssa has a disability as a matter of law.\n                                                    6\n\fboard. On October 9, 2008, the Bridgewaters filed a discrimination complaint with the\n\nICRC, alleging that FACES had discriminated against Alyssa by refusing to provide a\n\nreasonable accommodation for her medical condition at the ball. FACES responded,\n\nstating that reasonable accommodations had been provided and Alyssa had not been\n\nprohibited from attending the event.\n\n       Ultimately, the Bridgewaters ordered Alyssa a separate meal from the Ritz\n\nCharles, which they paid for. Alyssa attended the ball on November 2, 2008, without\n\nincident.\n\n       Four days after the ball, the Bridgewaters received a letter from FACES telling\n\nthem that they were being expelled from the organization. The letter gave four reasons\n\nfor the expulsion: (1) Elizabeth had voiced concerns about a FACES class to a teacher\n\nrather than to the FACES board; (2) Elizabeth had, on one occasion, refused to leave a\n\nclassroom when asked; (3) Alyssa brought a tape recorder to one of her classes; and (4)\n\nElizabeth made contact with the Ritz Charles after Alexander had told her not to do so.\n\nId. at 531-32. FACES’ decision came as a surprise to the Bridgewaters, who had never\n\nbefore been told of any complaints about their behavior.\n\n       Elizabeth responded in writing to the reasons for the family’s expulsion. She\n\nexplained that her discussion with a teacher was not related to instruction, but rather the\n\ndispute about Alyssa and the ball. Elizabeth denied having stayed in the classroom after\n\nbeing asked to leave, and she stated that there was no rule prohibiting students from using\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\ftape recorders in FACES classes. Finally, she stated that she contacted the Ritz Charles\n\nafter being instructed not to in order to discuss Alyssa, not on behalf of FACES.\n\n       In November 2008, the ICRC issued a notice stating that probable cause existed to\n\nbelieve that FACES had committed an unlawful discriminatory practice. Id. at 33-35.\n\nThe same day, the Bridgwaters amended their complaint to include the allegation that the\n\nunlawful discrimination had occurred in education and/or public accommodations\n\nbecause of Alyssa’s disability. The Bridgewaters also filed a second complaint with the\n\nICRC, alleging that FACES had unlawfully retaliated against the family by expelling\n\nthem because they had filed an accommodation complaint with the ICRC. FACES\n\ndenied that it had retaliated against the Bridgewaters and moved to dismiss the\n\ncomplaints, arguing that the ICRC did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over FACES\n\nbecause it was a religious organization—not an educational one as the Bridgewaters\n\nclaimed.\n\n       A hearing was held before an ALJ for the ICRC. Following the hearing, the ALJ\n\nruled for the Bridgewaters, concluding that the ICRC had jurisdiction over the\n\naccommodation complaint.      The ALJ explained that the civil rights law prohibited\n\ndiscrimination “relating to” education. And the ALJ concluded that FACES was indeed\n\nrelated to education:\n\n       FACES is a religious-based not[-]for[-]profit corporation recognized as\n       such under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. FACES was\n       formed by a group of parents of home schooled children and its purpose is\n       to provide educational, spiritual, and social enhancement for those children\n       by providing them with opportunities to interact with other adolescents that\n       are not inherent in the home schooling experience. FACES admits family\n                                            8\n\f        affiliates who desire a Catholic environment and who pay a modest annual\n        fee. It meets once a week for some thirty weeks during the school year and\n        periodically for limited social engagements, such as the ball out of which\n        this case arose. At the time of its motion, FACES had eleven family\n        affiliates.\n\n        FACES is a small organization that has genuinely selective criteria for\n        membership. It does not offer goods, services, or facilities to the general\n        public and, for that reason, is not a public accommodation as that term is\n        defined in the [civil rights law].\n\n        [T]here is no provision defining, for purposes of the [civil rights law], what\n        education is. It is clear . . . that “[e]very discriminatory practice relating to\n        . . . education . . . shall be considered unlawful unless . . . specifically\n        exempted from this chapter.” IC 22-9-1-3(1) (emphasis added).\n\n        FACES argues that the [civil rights law] should not be interpreted to apply\n        because to do so would excessively entangle the [civil rights law] with\n        religion, entanglement that would violate both the United States\n        Constitution, U.S. Const., Am. 1, and the Indiana Constitution, Ind. Const.,\n        Art. 1, §§ 3 and 4.\n\n        As reasonable as that argument is, it has no application to the issues raised\n        in this particular case. There is no reason to believe that an inquiry into\n        whether FACES refused to provide a reasonable accommodation to\n        Alyssa’s food allergies would require any consideration of matters at the\n        core of FACES’ religious basis.\n\nId. at 116 (formatting altered). In light of the ALJ’s ruling that the ICRC had jurisdiction\n\nover the complaint, the ICRC consolidated the Bridgewaters’ accommodation and\n\nretaliation complaints and conducted a two-day hearing on the matters in September\n\n2010.\n\n        A year later, the ALJ entered its order with findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. Id. at 9-22. The ALJ found that FACES did not commit an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice, explaining that FACES “did provide a reasonable accommodation for Alyssa\n\n                                               9\n\f[at] the ball. It may not have been the ideal accommodation and it was not the specific\n\naccommodation in Elizabeth’s most recent request for accommodation, but it was a\n\nreasonable accommodation.” Id. at 16. The ALJ also noted that “what was reasonable\n\nfor FACES, a tiny organization putting on its very first ball and being operated by\n\nvolunteers for whom FACES is not their primary occupation” might not have been\n\nreasonable for a larger, more established and professional organization. Id.\n\n       However, the ALJ concluded that FACES did commit an unlawful discriminatory\n\npractice when it expelled the Bridgewater family from the organization in retaliation for\n\nfiling the accommodation complaint, saying, “the decision to expel the Bridgewaters is\n\ntoo close in time to the filing of the complaint to consider it coincidental.” Id. at 17. The\n\nALJ addressed each of FACES’ stated reasons for expelling the family:\n\n       One [reason] involved direct contact with a volunteer teacher, which does\n       violate a FACES policy; however, it is hardly uncommon to contact the\n       person with whom one has an issue. It is unworthy of credence that a\n       violation of this policy would be a motive for expulsion.\n\n       The second reason cited was a refusal to leave a class when requested. The\n       e-mail from the teacher [that] Zender solicited reflects that Elizabeth left\n       when the teacher arrived, not that she refused to leave when requested.\n       This, then, [could not] have been a reason for the expulsion.\n\n       Another reason cited by FACES for expelling the Bridgewaters is Alyssa’s\n       use of a tape recorder. This behavior, like that involved with the first\n       reason, is fairly typical behavior and in this instance, FACES does not cite\n       a rule or a policy it contravened. This reason, too, is unlikely to have\n       caused the expulsion.\n\n       The fourth reason cited by FACES – contacting the Ritz after being told not\n       to – does have some validity and would carry more weight if it were not so\n       tied in with the event that led to the filing of the [accommodation]\n       complaint.\n                                             10\n\fId. at 17-18 (formatting altered). Finally, the ALJ explained that there could be “no\n\ndoubt that Alyssa experienced emotional distress as a result of being dismissed from\n\nFACES because of the filing of the [accommodation] complaint.” Id. at 18. The ALJ\n\nnoted that Alyssa had been professionally treated for psychological conditions and had\n\nmedication prescribed. Id. But the ALJ also noted that not all of Alyssa’s stress was\n\nattributable to the dismissal: “some of that distress is doubtlessly attributed to how\n\nFACES dealt with the food issue at the ball, which has been found to be lawful, and it is\n\nprobable that some of her distress arose from factors in her life that have nothing to do\n\nwith FACES.” Id. The ALJ awarded Alyssa $5000 in damages.\n\n       The ALJ ordered FACES to undertake the following corrective action: (1) cease\n\nand desist from retaliating against persons because they filed a complaint with the ICRC;\n\n(2) post a link to the ALJ’s order on all websites on which they communicated\n\ninformation about the case; and (3) offer reinstatement of the Bridgewater family to full\n\nmembership, including all benefits. Id. at 21.\n\n       Both parties appealed the order.      FACES challenged the ALJ’s conclusions\n\nregarding jurisdiction, retaliation, and corrective action. The Bridgewaters challenged\n\nthe ALJ’s conclusions regarding accommodation and damages. After additional briefing\n\nand argument before the ICRC chairperson and other commission members, the ICRC\n\nissued its order, affirming the ALJ’s order in all respects, except for the original amount\n\nof damages awarded to the Bridgewaters. Id. at 23-25. The ICRC reduced the amount of\n\ndamages to $2500, saying that the previous damage award was “too high.” Id. at 24.\n                                            11\n\f        Both parties now appeal. The ICRC appears as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the\n\nBridgewater family.3\n\n                                      Discussion and Decision\n\n        This case requires interpretation of Indiana’s civil rights law. The purpose of the\n\ncivil rights law is set forth in Indiana Code section 22-9-1-2 and provides:\n\n        Sec. 2. (a) It is the public policy of the state to provide all of its citizens\n        equal opportunity for education, employment, access to public\n        conveniences and accommodations . . . and to eliminate segregation or\n        separation based solely on race . . . disability . . . since such segregation is\n        an impediment to equal opportunity. Equal education and employment\n        opportunities and equal access to and use of public accommodations and\n        equal opportunity for acquisition of real property are hereby declared to be\n        civil rights.\n\nIndiana Code section 22-9-1-6 vests the ICRC with the authority to “receive and\n\ninvestigate complaints alleging discriminatory practices.” Included in the definition of\n\nunlawful discrimination is “every discriminatory practice relating to . . . education . . . .”\n\nInd. Code § 22-9-1-3(1)(4). The civil rights law does not explain what “relates to”\n\neducation, and the nature of this case, which involves both religion and education, makes\n\nthis inquiry complicated. What “relates to” education under Indiana’s civil rights law is\n\nthe threshold, first-impression issue disputed by the parties, and the first question facing\n\nthis Court.4 And because this case involves religion, First-Amendment principles act as a\n\nconstitutional “check” on our decision.\n\n\n        3\n         We held oral argument in this case on March 19, 2013. We thank the parties for their able\nadvocacy.\n        4\n          The parties’ briefs focus on the issue of what “relates to” education, and they spend very little\ntime discussing the other jurisdictional basis at issue—whether FACES is a public accommodation. See\n                                                    12\n\f       Where the ICRC has jurisdiction, the civil rights law prohibits retaliation against\n\nany person who files a complaint—or is otherwise involved in related proceedings—with\n\nthe ICRC.      Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(g).         The civil rights law’s definition of “person”\n\nincludes one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, organizations, cooperatives,\n\nand legal representatives, among others.               Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(a).         If the ICRC\n\ndetermines that a person has committed an unlawful discriminatory practice, it shall order\n\nthat person to “cease and desist from the unlawful discriminatory practice and require[e]\n\nthe person to take further affirmative action . . . .” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(j). The ICRC\n\nmay order the person who committed unlawful discrimination to pay damages and post a\n\nnotice of Indiana’s public policy concerning civil rights and the person’s compliance with\n\nthat policy, among other actions. Id.\n\n       After concluding that the ICRC had jurisdiction over the Bridgewaters’ complaints\n\nand that FACES had committed an unlawful discriminatory practice in its retaliatory\n\nexpulsion of the Bridgewaters, the ALJ ordered FACES to take corrective action;\n\nspecifically, to cease and desist from retaliating against persons because they filed a\n\ncomplaint with the ICRC, post a link to the order on any websites on which it\n\ncommunicated information regarding this case, and offer reinstatement to the\n\nBridgewater family. Whether the ICRC can order FACES to do this is the second major\n\nquestion posed in this appeal.\n\n\nInd. Code § 22-9-1-3(m) (“‘Public accommodation’ means any establishment that caters or offers its\nservices or facilities or goods to the general public.”). The ALJ determined that FACES was not a public\naccommodation, and we agree. See Appellant’s App. p. 116. For this reason and because the parties\ndevote the majority of their briefs to the educational argument, we do not address this secondary issue.\n                                                  13\n\f        The remaining issues relate to the ALJ’s conclusions about whether FACES\n\ncommitted unlawful discriminatory practices. The Bridgewaters also ask this Court to\n\nreinstate the original amount of damages ordered by the ALJ.\n\n        When reviewing an administrative decision, we must determine “whether\n\nsubstantial evidence, together with any reasonable inferences that flow from such\n\nevidence, support the [agency’s] findings and conclusions.” Zeller Elevator Co. v.

However, if the question before us is primarily a legal\n\nquestion, “we do not grant the same degree of deference to the [agency’s] decision, for\n\nlaw is the province of the judiciary and our constitutional system empowers the courts to\n\ndraw legal conclusions.” Id.

Jurisdiction\n\n        FACES first challenges the ALJ’s conclusion that the ICRC has jurisdiction over\n\nFACES because it “relates to” education.5 Because the civil rights law does not explain\n\nwhat “relates to” education, we must determine how this phrase should be defined.\n\n\n\n        5\n          In its brief, FACES set forth an additional argument regarding jurisdiction. It claimed that the\nemployer exclusions found in Indiana Code section 22-9-1-3 should apply to a discriminatory practice\n“relating to” education, even if it does not involve employment. See Appellant’s App. p. 33-35.\nHowever, at oral argument, FACES abandoned this claim. See Oral Arg. Video Tr. 21:00-40. Therefore,\nwe need not address this argument.\n                                                   14\n\fFACES also argues that permitting the ICRC to assert its jurisdiction here would\n\nconstitute religious entanglement and violate the First Amendment.\n\n       When courts construe statutes, the goal is to determine and give effect to the\n\nlegislature’s intent.

Ct. App. 2009), trans. denied.\n\n       The ALJ concluded that the “relates to” education requirement was satisfied here.\n\nSee Appellant’s App. p. 116.         At oral argument, the parties offered different\n\ninterpretations of this phrase. FACES argued that in order for a group to “relate to”\n\neducation, it must be a formal institution whose primary purpose is education. Oral Arg.\n\nVideo Tr. 09:38, 12:30-13:04. FACES argued that its primary purpose was religion, not\n\neducation. The Bridgewaters, however, argued that determining whether a group “relates\n\nto” education should be a case-specific inquiry, guided by a number of factors, one of\n\nwhich might be religion. Id. at 53:35-54:12. But there is no easy interpretation due to the\n\nnature of this case. We have before us a religious organization founded by Catholic\n\nparents to provide enrichment opportunities for their homeschooled children. FACES\n\n                                            15\n\fargues—and we do not question—that religion permeates all of its activities.\n\nNonetheless, the majority of FACES’ enrichment opportunities are educational, and\n\nsecular in substance.\n\n       Homeschooling and religion are two areas in which people can largely expect to\n\nbe free of government regulation, and often they are intertwined. Parents have many\n\nreasons for choosing to homeschool their children, but a common reason is a desire to\n\nprovide moral or religious instruction. In this instance, parents make a conscious choice\n\nto place themselves outside state authority as it relates to their child’s education. And\n\nsome parents may, like those here did, opt to supplement their child’s homeschooling in a\n\nmanner consistent with their religious beliefs. We are sensitive to this and wary of\n\nintruding upon their freedom to do so. And yet we believe that a group—even a religious\n\none—may take certain steps to place itself within the purview of the ICRC in this state.\n\nIn determining whether this has occurred, we believe it is necessary to consider the\n\ngroup’s nature and educational features; particularly the level of the group’s formality\n\nand the delivery and substance of the education it provides.\n\n       Here, FACES has taken steps to formalize itself. It was incorporated in 2007. It\n\nreceives charitable funding from organizations such as the United Way and is recognized\n\nunder section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.          It has a board of directors\n\nconsisting of its founders and a third group member. This formality also extends to the\n\ndelivery of the education offered.    FACES offered courses for its high-school-aged\n\nmembers in subjects such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, computer programming,\n\n                                            16\n\fspeech, drama, biology, and French. Members had to pay a fee and sign a waiver of\n\nliability to enroll in the courses and once enrolled, met weekly for some thirty weeks\n\nduring the school year in public spaces such as local libraries and bookstores. Classes\n\nbegan at 9:00 a.m. and continued until approximately 4:00 p.m., although some meetings\n\nwould end after 4:00 p.m. when students were being tested. Courses were taught by\n\nvolunteer teachers and sometimes by adult members, using textbooks or teacher-\n\ngenerated materials. As to the substance of the education, none of the classes offered\n\nwhen this dispute arose pertained to religion. In light of these facts, we conclude that\n\nFACES is sufficiently related to education such that the ICRC’s jurisdiction is proper.\n\n       This is not to say that FACES is somehow not “religious enough.” Nor do we\n\nconclude that FACES’ religious purpose is secondary to, or any less important than, its\n\neducational purpose. We are tasked with giving effect to the plain language of the\n\nstatute, which prohibits unlawful discrimination in “every discriminatory practice relating\n\nto . . . education . . . .” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(1)(4). The statute does not include\n\ncomparative language, and we decline to add it. We must simply determine whether the\n\n“relating to” requirement is satisfied. In the case before us, we conclude that it is.6\n\n       And there is no need to insert a comparative feature into our analysis. The First\n\nAmendment functions as a constitutional safeguard in this respect and would preempt any\n\nunconstitutional application of Indiana’s civil rights law. The United States Supreme\n\n       6\n           FACES argues that our holding will produce an absurd result. It argues that if FACES is\n“related to” education, then play dates, study groups, and booster clubs, among others, could also be\n“related to” education. See Appellant’s App. p. 24. We disagree. By considering the level of formality\nand the nature of the education involved, we can exclude these examples.\n                                                 17\n\fCourt has held that the First Amendment prohibits governmental interference with\n\nreligious tenets—matters of faith, doctrine, or government of religious institutions. See\n\nHosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and Sch. v. Equal Emp’t Opportunity\n\nComm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620673\"><a href=\"/opinion/620673/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-and-school-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012). FACES’ main argument with respect to Hosanna-Tabor\n\nis that its First-Amendment analysis applies to the remedies ordered by the ICRC, and we\n\naddress that issue later in this opinion. See infra, p. 24-29. However, FACES also cites\n\nHosanna-Tabor for the proposition that permitting the ICRC to assert its jurisdiction here\n\nwould constitute religious entanglement and violate the First Amendment. We cannot\n\nagree. The ICRC inquired into FACES’ accommodation of Alyssa’s dietary needs and\n\nretaliatory expulsion of the Bridgewater family.          There is simply no religious\n\nentanglement issue here—there is no evidence that either of these inquiries resulted in\n\ngovernmental interference with the tenets of the Catholic faith.\n\n                                    II. ALJ Decisions\n\n       Having concluded that the ICRC has jurisdiction over this matter, we now\n\nconsider the ALJ’s decisions. The Bridgewaters argue that the ALJ erred both in finding\n\nthat FACES reasonably accommodated Alyssa at the ball and by reducing the amount of\n\ndamages, and FACES argues that the ALJ erred in finding that it engaged in unlawful\n\nretaliation.\n\n                      A. Disability and Reasonable Accommodation\n\n       FACES does not contend until its reply brief that Alyssa is not disabled as a matter\n\nof law, so that argument is waived. Ind. Appellate Rule 46(C) (“No new issues shall be\n\n                                            18\n\fraised in the reply brief.”). Therefore, for purposes of this appeal, we assume that Alyssa\n\nhas a disability as a matter of law.\n\n       On the other hand, the Bridgewaters argue that the ALJ erred in finding that\n\nAlyssa was reasonably accommodated at the ball. They contend that FACES’ suggestion\n\nfor accommodating Alyssa’s dietary restrictions—having Elizabeth bring Alyssa a meal\n\nfrom home—deprived her of the right to be served food prepared by the Ritz Charles like\n\nevery other child at the event. While Alyssa was able to have a special meal prepared by\n\nthe Ritz Charles, the Bridgewaters argue that this was still discriminatory because no\n\ndiscount was given for her ticket, meaning that Alyssa had to pay twice for one meal\n\nwhen no one else did. We disagree.\n\n       The provided accommodation need only be reasonable and not optimal, see\n\nKersting v. Wal-Mart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773350\"><a href=\"/opinion/773350/james-kersting-v-wal-mart-stores-inc-6025-aka-wal-mart-distribution/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1116 (7th Cir. 2001), so FACES acted in\n\ncompliance with the law when it accepted Elizabeth’s proposal of bringing a meal from\n\nhome. While this option may not have been ideal, it was a reasonable accommodation, as\n\nit was the best way to ensure the safety of the food for Alyssa. In the end, Elizabeth\n\nchose to pursue another course of action, but that does not mean that FACES did not act\n\nreasonably in accepting her original proposal for accommodating Alyssa at the event.\n\nWe therefore find that there is sufficient evidence to support the ALJ’s finding that\n\nAlyssa was reasonably accommodated.\n\n                                       B. Retaliation\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       FACES contends that the ALJ erred in finding that it engaged in unlawful\n\nretaliation by expelling the Bridgewaters. In order to succeed on a retaliation claim, a\n\nplaintiff must first show a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence. Powdertech, Inc. v. Joganic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2071599\"><a href=\"/opinion/2071599/powdertech-inc-v-joganic/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1262 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002).\n\nThen, the burden shifts to the defendant to show a legitimate and nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for its action. If the defendant is able to carry that burden, then the plaintiff has\n\nthe chance to show again by a preponderance of the evidence that the explanation given\n\nby the defendant is a pretext. Id. Pretext may be demonstrated by showing that the stated\n\nreason for action has no basis in fact; that the stated reason was not the actual reason for\n\naction although it is based on fact; or that the stated reason is insufficient to warrant the\n\naction taken by the defendant. See Dale v. J.G. Bowers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2166878\"><a href=\"/opinion/2166878/dale-v-jg-bowers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 (Ind.\n\nCt. App. 1999). Additionally, proximity in time between the filing of a complaint and the\n\nretaliatory action may be considered evidence that the stated reason for the defendant’s\n\naction is a pretext. See Whirlpool Corp. v. Vanderburgh Cnty.-City of Evansville Human\n\nRelations Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032705\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032705/whirlpool-corp-v-vanderburgh-county-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007).\n\n       The ALJ found that the Bridgewaters met their burden of making a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination. Indiana Code section 22-9-1-6(g) prohibits “any person from\n\ndischarging, expelling, or otherwise discriminating against any other person because the\n\nperson filed a complaint . . . .” By showing that they were expelled by FACES only\n\ntwenty-two days after FACES received notice of the original accommodation complaint,\n\nAppellant’s App. p. 20, the ALJ determined that the Bridgewaters met this initial burden.\n\n                                             20\n\f       FACES gave four reasons for its decision to expel the Bridgewaters: (1) Elizabeth\n\nhad voiced concerns about a FACES class to a teacher rather than to the FACES board;\n\n(2) Elizabeth had, on one occasion, refused to leave a classroom when asked; (3) Alyssa\n\nbrought a tape recorder to one of her classes; and (4) Elizabeth made contact with the\n\nRitz Charles after Alexander had told her not to do so. Id. at 16. Elizabeth responded in\n\nwriting, explaining each of the actions.\n\n       In its decision that FACES engaged in retaliation by expelling the Bridgewaters,\n\nthe ALJ found that none of the four reasons given by FACES for the expulsion were\n\nlikely to be the true motive for its action. Id. at 17-18. While the ALJ found that having\n\ndirect contact with a volunteer teacher is against FACES policy, it was “unworthy of\n\ncredence that a violation of this policy would be a motive for expulsion.” Id. at 17. The\n\nALJ also found that the evidence showed that Elizabeth did leave the classroom when the\n\nteacher arrived on the instance in question and there is no FACES rule or policy that\n\nprohibits tape recording a class. Id. at 17-18. Finally, the ALJ did find that contacting\n\nthe Ritz Charles after being told not to might carry some weight in this decision if it were\n\nnot so tied in to the event that led to the actual filing of the original complaint. Id. at 18.\n\nTherefore, the ALJ found that none of the reasons cited by FACES were sufficient to\n\nwarrant expulsion of the Bridgewaters, and the Bridgewaters had met their burden of\n\nshowing that the reasons stated by FACES were pretexts for unlawful retaliation.\n\n       FACES, however, contends that these findings by the ALJ are erroneous, arguing\n\nthat the ALJ focused solely on the temporal proximity between the filing of the complaint\n\n                                              21\n\fand the expulsion of the Bridgewaters as the basis for the ALJ’s conclusion. Appellant’s\n\nBr. p. 54. FACES also argues that the ALJ disregarded both the decisions made by the\n\nmothers who ran the group as not “good enough,” and Elizabeth’s “meddling” in the\n\narrangements for the ball when coming to its decision.\n\n      FACES’ argument is simply a request that we reweigh the evidence, which we\n\nmay not do. On appeal, we are to determine “whether substantial evidence, together with\n\nany reasonable inferences that flow from such evidence, support the [agency’s] findings\n\nand conclusions.” Zeller Elevator Co., 796 N.E.2d at 1206. We are not to reweigh the\n\nevidence, and we consider only the evidence most favorable to the ICRC’s findings.\n\nViewing the evidence in this light, we find that there is sufficient evidence here to\n\nsupport the ALJ’s findings.\n\n                                      C. Damages\n\n      The Bridgewaters contend that the ICRC erred in reducing the amount of damages\n\nawarded to Alyssa. The civil rights law provides that, as a remedy for discriminatory\n\nbehavior, the Commission may require a person to take “further affirmative action as will\n\neffectuate the purpose of this chapter, including but not limited to the power: (A) to\n\nrestore the complainant’s losses incurred as a result of discriminatory treatment, as the\n\ncommission may deem necessary to assure justice . . . .” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-6(k)(A).\n\nThe statute permits the ICRC to award damages for both economic and emotional\n\ndistress. Ind. Civil Rights Comm’n v. Alder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853842\"><a href=\"/opinion/853842/indiana-civil-rights-comn-v-alder/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637 (Ind. 1999) (citations\n\nomitted). Here, the ALJ awarded the Bridgewaters $5000 in damages. On appeal to the\n\n                                           22\n\fICRC, the commission reduced the damage award to $2500, saying that the previous\n\namount was too high.\n\n      As the ALJ explained, Alyssa suffered emotional distress as a result of a\n\ncombination of factors: being expelled from FACES, how FACES handled the food issue\n\nat the ball, and a number of other issues unrelated to FACES. Alyssa suffered no\n\neconomic losses. Although the Bridgewaters make a very detailed argument that Alyssa\n\nsuffered severe emotional damage, we do not reweigh the evidence or judge the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, and we consider only the evidence most favorable to the ICRC’s\n\nfindings. Zeller Elevator Co., 796 N.E.2d at 1206. And contrary to the Bridgewaters’\n\nclaim, an unexplained change by an agency is not, by definition, arbitrary and capricious.\n\nSee Ind.

As the ICRC explained, the\n\nprevious amount of damages was too high. See Appellant’s App. p. 24. Given that some\n\nof Alyssa’s emotional distress was related to FACES, while some was not, and that she\n\nsuffered no economic damages, we cannot say that this conclusion was error.\n\n      FACES also challenges the ALJ’s damage award, arguing that any award was\n\ninappropriate. But in doing so, they mischaracterize the award as one for “damages for\n\nexpelling the Bridgewaters . . . .” Appellant’s Br. p. 4. The damages resulted from\n\nFACES’ retaliatory expulsion of the Bridgewater family and the emotional distress\n\nAlyssa suffered as a result. Had the ALJ awarded damages for a justified expulsion of\n\n                                           23\n\fthe Bridgewater family—and here, the ALJ rejected the reasons given by FACES—\n\nFACES could argue that the damages were inappropriate. Because we affirm the ALJ’s\n\nconclusion that the Bridgewaters were expelled in retaliation for filing the\n\naccommodation complaint, we reject FACES’ argument on this issue.\n\n                                        III. Corrective Action\n\n        After finding that FACES unlawfully retaliated against the Bridgewaters for filing\n\nan accommodation complaint, the ALJ not only awarded Alyssa damages, but also\n\nordered FACES to take the following corrective action: (1) cease and desist from\n\nretaliating against persons because they filed a complaint with the ICRC; (2) post a link\n\nto the ALJ’s order on all websites on which they communicated information about the\n\ncase; and (3) offer reinstatement of the Bridgewater family to full membership, including\n\nall benefits. FACES does not challenge the “cease and desist” provision,7 but it does\n\nchallenge the requirements that it, as a religious organization, be forced to reinstate the\n\nBridgewater family into the organization and post the ICRC’s decision on its website\n\nunder the following three United States Supreme Court cases.\n\n            A. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC\n\n        FACES first argues that the ALJ’s decision must be reversed because the\n\nministerial exception within the First Amendment prevents the ICRC from interfering\n\nwith FACES’ religious liberty. In Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and\n\n\n        7\n          FACES notes that it would challenge this provision for its lack of detail, but it is choosing not to\nbecause it will not resume its operation if it is subject to the jurisdiction of the ICRC. See Appellant’s Br.\np. 57.\n                                                     24\n\fSchool v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Cheryl Perich worked as a\n\nteacher at a school that had as its mission to offer a “Christ-centered education” to\n\nstudents. 132 S. Ct. at 699. Perich was classified as a “called” teacher, meaning that she\n\nwas “regarded as having been called to [her] vocation by God through a congregation”\n\nand had completed certain academic requirements. Id. Perich taught kindergarten for\n\nfour years and fourth grade for one year at Hosanna-Tabor before she was diagnosed with\n\nnarcolepsy and had to take disability leave. Id. at 700. Six months later, Perich still had\n\nnot returned to work, so the congregation voted to offer her “peaceful release” where the\n\ncongregation would pay for some of her health insurance premiums and Perich would\n\nresign as a called teacher. However, Perich refused to resign, and she was fired about\n\nthree months later. Id.\n\n       Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n(EEOC), contending that she had been fired in violation of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC then brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging\n\nthat Perich was fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Id. at 701.\n\nPerich sought either reinstatement to her former job or front pay, back pay, compensatory\n\nand punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and other injunctive relief. Id.\n\n       Hosanna-Tabor moved for summary judgment on the grounds of the ministerial\n\nexception within the First Amendment, and the district court granted it. The district court\n\nfound that “Hosanna-Tabor treated Perich like a minister and held her out to the world as\n\nsuch long before this litigation began.” Id. Because of that, the district court found that it\n\n                                             25\n\fcould not inquire into the reasons for Perich’s firing. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth\n\nCircuit vacated and remanded the decision.            It acknowledged the existence of the\n\nministerial exception but found that Perich was not a minister because her duties were\n\nidentical to those of a lay teacher. Id. at 701-02.\n\n       The Supreme Court took the case and noted that “the Courts of Appeal have\n\nuniformly recognized the existence of a ‘ministerial exception,’ grounded in the First\n\nAmendment, that precludes application of such legislation to claims concerning the\n\nemployment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.” Id. at 705.\n\nThe Court went on to agree that such a ministerial exception existed and found that it\n\napplied to this particular case.\n\n       In determining whether the ministerial exception applied, the Court looked at “all\n\nthe circumstances of [Perich’s] employment,” id. at 707, which generally included the\n\nfacts that Hosanna-Tabor held Perich out as a minister and Perich held herself out as a\n\nminister. Specifically, Hosanna-Tabor issued Perich a “diploma of vocation” that gave\n\nher the title “Minister of Religion, Commissioned,” Perich completed eight ministerial-\n\nrelated college-level courses, obtained the endorsement of her local Synod district, passed\n\nan oral examination, claimed a special housing allowance on her taxes that was only\n\navailable to individuals earning compensation for ministry, and regarded herself as a\n\nminister at Hosanna-Tabor. Id. at 707-08. The Court also found that the amount of time\n\nthat a person spends doing ministerial activities should be a factor when determining if\n\nshe is a minister, but should not be the sole consideration.\n\n                                              26\n\f       After taking into account all of the above factors, the Court determined that Perich\n\nwas a minister and therefore subject to the ministerial exception of the First Amendment.\n\nTherefore, Perich could not bring suit to challenge her termination, as Hosanna-Tabor\n\nhad the sole authority to “select and control who will minister to the faithful.” Id. at 709.\n\nHowever, the Court clearly stated that its decision applied only to the type of case before\n\nit—“an employment discrimination suit brought on behalf of a minister, challenging her\n\nchurch’s decision to fire her.” Id. at 710. The Court went on to say, “we hold only that\n\nthe ministerial exception bars such a suit. We express no view on whether the exception\n\nbars other types of suit . . . . There will be time enough to address the applicability of the\n\nexception to other circumstances if and when they arise.” Id. (Emphasis added).\n\n       In light of this decision, FACES contends that the ICRC’s corrective action\n\ndecision must be reversed, specifically the reinstatement of the Bridgewaters, because it\n\nviolates the right to religious liberty by interfering with the group’s goal of “minister[ing]\n\nto one another and striv[ing] to model religious beliefs and virtues.” Appellant’s Br. p.\n\n61. It argues that this is the precise harm the Supreme Court was trying to prevent in\n\nHosanna-Tabor. FACES equates it being able to determine its members with a church\n\nhaving the sole authority to select its ministers, arguing that there is no material\n\ndifference between the two. We disagree.\n\n       The Court took great care to ensure that its holding was narrowly tailored and\n\nspecific to instances where “an employer is a religious group and the employee is one of\n\nthe groups’ ministers.” Id. at 699. This is not an employment case, FACES is not a\n\n                                             27\n\freligious employer, and the ICRC is not ordering FACES to make anyone a minister.\n\nTherefore, the logic behind the decision in Hosanna-Tabor is inapplicable to the present\n\ncase.\n\n        Even if we were to find that the ministerial exception applies here, FACES’\n\nactions would still not be immune from ICRC corrective action. FACES expelled the\n\nBridgewaters for reasons completely unrelated to religion. The ministerial exception\n\nonly prevents outside interference when “[s]uch action interferes with the internal\n\ngovernance of the church, depriving the church of control over the selection of those who\n\nwill personify its beliefs.” Id. at 706. Since reinstatement of the Bridgewaters involves\n\nno governmental interference with the tenets of the Catholic faith and would not affect\n\nthe ability of FACES to express its religious beliefs, even if Hosanna-Tabor did apply,\n\nFACES’ argument would still fail.\n\n                            B. Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\n\n        FACES also argues that the ALJ’s corrective-action decision must be reversed due\n\nto the right of expressive association guaranteed by the First Amendment. In making this\n\nargument, FACES points to Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), for\n\nsupport.\n\n        In Boy Scouts, James Dale was an assistant scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 73\n\nand also the co-president of the Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance. Id. at 644-45.\n\nA newspaper published an interview with Dale and a picture identifying him as the co-\n\npresident of the Lesbian/Gay Alliance, and later that month, his membership with the\n\n                                           28\n\fBoy Scouts was revoked because the organization “specifically forbid membership to\n\nhomosexuals.” Id. at 645. Dale filed suit, alleging that the Boy Scouts had violated New\n\nJersey’s public accommodation statute by revoking his membership based on his sexual\n\norientation. The public accommodation statute prevented discrimination on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation in places of public accommodation.\n\n       The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the Boy Scouts was a place of public\n\naccommodation and therefore subject to the public-accommodation law. It then found\n\nthat the Boy Scouts violated the law when it revoked Dale’s membership based on his\n\nsexual orientation. Id. at 646. The New Jersey Supreme Court also looked at the First\n\nAmendment right to association involved in the case and found that the Boy Scouts’\n\n“large size, nonselectivity, inclusive rather than exclusive purpose, and practice of\n\ninviting or allowing nonmembers to attend meetings, establish that the organization is not\n\nsufficiently personal or private to warrant constitutional protection under freedom of\n\nintimate association.” Id. (internal citation omitted). The Court also found that Dale’s\n\nmembership did not affect the Boy Scouts’ ability to carry out its various purposes. Id. at\n\n647.\n\n       The United States Supreme Court, however, disagreed. Focusing on whether the\n\napplication of the New Jersey public-accommodation law violated the First Amendment,\n\nthe Supreme Court reversed and held that the Boy Scouts could revoke Dale’s\n\nmembership. Forcing the Boy Scouts to keep Dale as a member, it reasoned, would\n\nviolate the group’s freedom of expressive association. Id. at 655-56.\n\n                                            29\n\f       To determine if a group is eligible for First Amendment protection for expressive\n\nassociation, it first must be determined if the group actually engages in expressive\n\nassociation. That means that the group “must engage in some form of expression,\n\nwhether it be public or private.” Id. at 648. In regards to the Boy Scouts, the Supreme\n\nCourt looked at its mission statement, Scout Oath, and Scout Law, and determined that it\n\nhad a clear general mission. To accomplish that mission, “the scoutmasters and assistant\n\nscoutmasters inculcate [the youth members] with the Boy Scouts’ values—both expressly\n\nand by example.” Id. at 649-50. Seeking to transmit a system of values was determined\n\nto be expressive activity, so the Boy Scouts were eligible for First Amendment\n\nprotection. Id. at 650.\n\n       After determining that the Boy Scouts engaged in expressive activity, the Supreme\n\nCourt then undertook an inquiry to determine if “the forced inclusion of Dale as an\n\nassistant scoutmaster would significantly affect the Boy Scouts’ ability to advocate public\n\nor private viewpoints.” Id. While not everyone would agree that homosexual behavior\n\nwas antithetical to “morally straight” and “clean” values that the Boy Scouts seek to\n\nimpart, the organization itself sincerely and consistently held that belief. However, it is\n\nonly the organization’s view that matters, as “it is not the role of the courts to reject a\n\ngroup’s expressed values because they disagree with those values or find them internally\n\ninconsistent.” Id. at 651. The Supreme Court held, therefore, that it must give deference\n\nto a group’s assertions concerning the nature of its expression and what would impair that\n\nexpression. And because the Boy Scouts believed homosexuality was inconsistent with\n\n                                            30\n\fits values, and Dale’s presence as an assistant scoutmaster would interfere with its ability\n\nto not promote a view that is contrary to its beliefs, forcing Dale’s membership upon the\n\nBoy Scouts would be a violation of its freedom of expressive association.\n\n       It is important to note, however, that the Supreme Court states in its opinion that\n\nthe freedom of expressive association is not an absolute freedom. Id. at 648. It can be\n\n“overridden by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the\n\nsuppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive\n\nof associational freedoms.” Id. (internal quotation and citation omitted); see also Bd. of\n\nDirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111879\"><a href=\"/opinion/111879/board-of-directors-of-rotary-intl-v-rotary-club-of-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (1987).\n\n       FACES contends that this holding makes the ALJ’s corrective action of requiring\n\nreinstatement of the Bridgewaters unconstitutional because it violates its freedom of\n\nexpressive association. The first inquiry that must be made in this case is whether\n\nFACES engages in expressive association.           Expressive association is defined as\n\n“associat[ing] with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic,\n\neducational, religious, and cultural ends.” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622\n\n(1984). FACES notes that its objective was\n\n       to implement the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, more\n       specifically: (1) the teaching that parents have primary responsibility for the\n       education of their children; and (2) the teaching that members of the church\n       should demonstrate solidarity and fraternal charity as they endeavor to live\n       their vocation by educating children in their faith and preparing them to\n       serve the common good.\n\nAppellant’s Br. p. 9. Alexander also stated that her purpose in forming the group was to\n\nprovide “a group where teenagers could get together to learn and socialize in an\n                                      31\n\fenvironment consistent with their Catholic faith.” Id. at 8. We find that these purposes\n\nfall within the definition of “expressive association,” so we next must determine if the\n\nBridgewaters’ forced inclusion would interfere with FACES’ freedom of expressive\n\nassociation and ability to advocate its desired viewpoints.\n\n       FACES argues that it chose to expel the Bridgewaters because Elizabeth’s\n\n“insubordinate, obstreperous, and mean-spirited” behavior “threatened the group’s efforts\n\nto achieve the high ideals it was created to foster as well as the very existence of the\n\ngroup.” Id. at 62. This argument misses the mark. The ALJ found that the Bridgewaters\n\nwere expelled from FACES in retaliation for filing an accommodation complaint, and we\n\ndo not reweigh evidence.         Therefore, FACES’ allegation that it chose to expel the\n\nBridgewaters because Elizabeth’s “insubordinate, obstreperous, and mean-spirited”\n\nbehavior “threatened the group’s efforts to achieve the high ideals it was created to foster\n\nas well as the very existence of the group,” Appellant’s Br. p. 62, is without merit. In\n\nother words, we cannot go behind the ALJ’s factual findings.\n\n       Since the ALJ found that the Bridgewaters were expelled for reasons that did not\n\nimplicate FACES’ expressive association, requiring that FACES allow the Bridgewaters\n\nback into the group does not violate FACES’ right to expressive association and is not\n\nunconstitutional.8\n\n\n       8\n          Our colleague would construe the phrase “related to education” more narrowly than we do\nunder these circumstances. Here, he argues that to the extent FACES must readmit Alyssa, she should be\nallowed to participate in educational activities only—not social activities. Social activities are an\nimportant component of a child’s education in that they teach respect for others, responsibility, and a\nsense of community. These lessons are learned not only in the academic setting but also during\nextracurricular activities such as clubs and social functions like proms or other dances. FACES’\n                                                  32\n\f       C. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California\n\n       Finally, FACES contends that the ALJ’s order that it “post a link to these Findings\n\nOf Fact, Conclusions Of Law, And Order on all websites on which they have\n\ncommunicated information regarding this case,” Appellant’s App. p. 21, also violates the\n\nFirst Amendment because it constitutes compelled speech.\n\n       In Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California, a\n\ncourt order requiring Pacific Gas and Electric to put a newsletter written by a third party,\n\nToward Utility Rate Normalization, in its billing envelope was found to be a violation of\n\nPacific Gas and Electric’s First Amendment rights. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111596\"><a href=\"/opinion/111596/pacific-gas-elec-co-v-public-util-commn-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20-21 (1986). The\n\nSupreme Court reasoned that Pacific Gas owned the space inside the billing envelope,\n\nand requiring it to include a newsletter with the views of a third party was “forced\n\nassociation with potentially hostile views [that] . . . risks forcing [Pacific Gas and\n\nElectric] to speak where it would prefer to remain silent.” Id. at 18.\n\n       Because this order compelled speech, it “could be valid if it were a narrowly\n\ntailored means of serving a compelling state interest.” Id. at 19. Applying this strict\n\nscrutiny test, the Supreme Court found that although the interest in “fair and effective\n\nutility regulation may be compelling,” the order was not narrowly tailored.                        Id.\n\nTherefore, strict scrutiny was not met and the order was reversed. Id. at 21.\n\n       Like in Pacific Gas, we find that while there is a compelling state interest at stake\n\nhere—eradicating discrimination—the ALJ’s order was not narrowly tailored. The ALJ\n\neducation encompasses both academic and social aspects, and therefore we respectfully disagree with our\ncolleague.\n                                                  33\n\fordered that FACES post the decision “on all websites on which they have communicated\n\ninformation regarding this case,” Appellant’s App. p. 21 (emphasis added), which we\n\nfind to be a more expansive requirement than was necessary to serve the compelling state\n\ninterest at stake. All websites on which they have communicated information regarding\n\nthis case could include countless message boards, comments made on news stories, and a\n\nvast array of other websites on the internet.

Concluding that FACES’s\n\ndecision to end Alyssa’s membership in the group amounted to retaliation under\n\nIndiana’s civil rights laws, the ICRC imposed a $2,500 fine upon FACES and enjoined\n\nand mandated certain conduct as the end-point of this dispute between a parent and a\n\nreligiously-oriented private club. The dispute centered on the child’s dietary needs at a\n\nsingle social event conducted outside the ordinary timeframe of the club’s educational\n\nactivities.\n\n                                           35\n\f       While I agree with the majority that the ICRC could, within its specialized\n\nexpertise, find that FACES retaliated against Alyssa, and I agree that the ICRC was not\n\nwithin its authority to impose all of the sanctions it did, I would reach these conclusions\n\non significantly narrower grounds than does the majority. I therefore respectfully concur\n\nin result.\n\n       As the majority notes, the ICRC is an agency with specialized expertise in the\n\nmatters that come before it. Ind. Civil Rights Comm’n v. Alder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853842\"><a href=\"/opinion/853842/indiana-civil-rights-comn-v-alder/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635-36\n\n(Ind. 1999). Among the ICRC’s areas of expertise are questions of civil rights violations\n\nand retaliatory conduct in response to the lodging of complaints raising claims of civil\n\nrights violations. Such civil rights violations include discrimination in matters “relating\n\nto … education.” Ind. Code § 22-9-1-3(l). Thus, “[w]e give deference to the expertise of\n\nthe agency and will not reverse simply because we may have reached a different result\n\nthan the [ICRC].”      Alder, 714 N.E.2d at 635.       “However, although an agency’s\n\ninterpretation of a statute is entitled to great weight, courts rather than administrative\n\nagencies must resolve questions of statutory construction.” Id. at 636. As with statutory\n\nconstruction, subject matter jurisdiction is also a purely legal area that we review de novo\n\nupon appeal. M-Plan, Inc. v. Ind. Comprehensive Health Ins. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"852907\"><a href=\"/opinion/852907/m-plan-inc-v-indiana-comp-health-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n837 (Ind. 2004).\n\n       What matters “relat[e] to … education” is left undefined by the Indiana Civil\n\nRights Law (“ICRL”). Arguing over whether the ICRC had jurisdiction to hear the\n\nBridgewaters’ complaint, whether the ICRC had jurisdiction to find that FACES\n\n                                            36\n\fretaliated against the Bridgewaters, and over the scope of the damages to which Alyssa\n\nmay or may not have been entitled, the parties offer differing interpretations of the\n\nstatutory language.\n\n       Mindful that the ICRL provides that it “shall be construed broadly to effectuate its\n\npurpose,” I.C. § 22-9-1-2(f), I think this Court can affirm the ICRC’s order for damages\n\nagainst FACES without addressing the definitional and jurisdictional questions associated\n\nwith the disputed statutory language.       This is because, in addition to the statutory\n\nauthority the ICRC possesses to address claims of discrimination, it also has statutory\n\nauthority to “prevent any person[9] from discharging, expelling, or otherwise\n\ndiscriminating against any other person because the person filed a complaint, testified in\n\nany hearing before this commission, or in any way assisted the commission in any matter\n\nunder its investigation.” I.C. § 22-9-1-6(g). That is, the ICRL affords a remedy where\n\none person has filed a complaint, as a result of which another person engages in any form\n\nof retaliatory conduct against the complainant.              Retaliatory conduct is itself\n\ndiscriminatory under the terms of the statute, then, and a remedy may be afforded to an\n\nindividual harmed by retaliation even where the underlying claim advanced by the\n\ncomplaint is ultimately found to be without merit.\n\n       While there is little or no Indiana case law interpreting subsection 22-9-1-6(g) as it\n\napplies to retaliation against members of an educational or social-group environment, as\n\nFACES appears to be, I think the majority properly adopts the employment-related\n\n       9\n          A “person” is defined as “one (1) or more individuals … associations, organizations …\ncorporations … cooperatives … and other organized groups of persons.” I.C. § 22-9-1-3(a).\n                                              37\n\fstandards for evaluating a claim and reviewing a finding of retaliation in this context. I\n\ntherefore concur with the majority to the extent it concludes that the ICRC properly\n\napplied this standard and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously when it found that\n\nFACES retaliated against the Bridgewaters as a result of Elizabeth’s decision to file a\n\ncomplaint.\n\n       I also concur with the majority’s decision to the extent it affirms the ICRC’s\n\n$2500 award for damages resulting from FACES’s retaliation. Indeed, because the ICRC\n\nfound that FACES made reasonable accommodations at the Masquerade Ball for\n\nAlyssa’s condition, it is clear from the ICRC’s order that the only reason damages were\n\nawarded was the Commission’s finding that FACES’s decision to eject Alyssa from the\n\ngroup was pretextual. That order is consistent with the purpose of a separate remedy for\n\nretaliation, which is to ensure that those reporting alleged civil rights violations are\n\nprotected from retaliation for filing a claim; failure to protect an individual for reporting\n\nan alleged violation “ultimately undermines a critically important public policy.”\n\nFrampton v.

This is so because I do not\n\nthink that matters “relating to … education,” as provided by the ICRL, ought to\n\nencompass so broad a range of activities as to include a quintessentially social function\n\nlike the Masquerade Ball. That is especially so where the group offering the social\n\nfunction is not a formal school, but rather a small organization of volunteers who, for\n\nthirty days of the year, work together to provide social and other forms of enrichment for\n\nchildren whom they have decided to homeschool.\n\n      In this context, I do not think the reach of the ICRL extends so far as to encompass\n\na social activity like the Masquerade Ball. Put more simply: I do not think, based upon\n\nthe language of the ICRL, that the ICRC would have properly had subject matter\n\njurisdiction over the Bridgewaters’ complaint were it not for FACES’s retaliatory\n\nconduct.\n\n      It seems to me beyond the pale of the ICRL—a statute enacted in the wake of the\n\nupheavals of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s—to conclude that such social\n\noccasions as a Masquerade Ball, held not under the auspices of a formalized school but\n\nby a group of volunteers, are events “relating to … education” such that a member of\n\nFACES is the victim of a civil rights violation when the group will not accommodate her\n\ndietary conditions. Thus, to the extent the ICRC’s order would require that FACES\n\nreadmit Alyssa as a member of the group, I part from the majority and would hold that\n\nthe order only extends to those activities of FACES that are specifically educational\n\nrather than social—that is, FACES’s regularly-scheduled events during which academic\n\n                                           39\n\fenrichment activities like language, computer, and other such classes are offered. While I\n\nrecognize that we are to interpret the ICRL “broadly to effectuate its purpose,” I would\n\nnot conclude that, by the statute’s language, its purposes extend so far as to conclude that\n\nFACES was required to accommodate Alyssa’s dietary needs at the Masquerade Ball.\n\n       That said, I do not agree with FACES that it should be entirely exempt from the\n\nICRC’s jurisdiction. In Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110938\"><a href=\"/opinion/110938/bob-jones-univ-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court held that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could\n\nrevoke the nonprofit tax status of an organization where the IRS’s decision advanced a\n\ncompelling government interest and the decision “substantially outweigh[ed] whatever\n\nburden denial of tax benefits” imposed upon the nonprofit organization, even where the\n\norganization implemented those policies on religious grounds. Id. at 604. In Bob Jones,\n\nthe question before the Court was whether the IRS could revoke the university’s\n\nnonprofit tax status because of its ban on dating and marriage between students of\n\ndifferent races, where opposing racial discrimination was recognized as a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest. Id. at 603-605.\n\n       Here, FACES has argued that because it is a religiously-oriented organization, it\n\nshould be entirely free to add or remove members on nearly any basis. I cannot agree;\n\nindeed, to take FACES’s position would be to hold, in a manner implicitly contrary to the\n\nSupreme Court in the Bob Jones case, that government agencies could have no role at all\n\nin enforcing various laws because those agencies would simply lack jurisdiction over\n\nsuch religiously-minded institutions. It is disingenuous for an organization like FACES\n\n                                            40\n\fto claim the benefits of tax-exempt status, yet ignore with impunity other laws that have\n\nan equally broad-ranged effect.\n\n      I also part from the majority in its rationale for reversing that portion of the\n\nICRC’s order requiring that FACES post notices on its websites. I think there is no need\n\nto turn to constitutional interpretation to resolve this matter, and we should avoid\n\nconstitutional declarations where other, non-constitutional means are available to resolve\n\na dispute.

The ICRL provides the ICRC with authority to require notice posting:\n\n      [the ICRC] shall cause to be served … an order ... requiring the person to\n      take further affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this\n      chapter, including but not limited to the power:\n      ***\n      (B) to require the posting of notice setting forth the public policy of Indiana\n      concerning civil rights and respondent's compliance with the policy in\n      places of public accommodations.\n\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-6(j). A “public accommodation” is “any establishment that caters or offers\n\nits services or facilities or goods to the general public.” I.C. § 22-9-1-3(m). Because\n\nFACES lacks a fixed meeting location or other premises of its own, the ICRC ordered\n\nFACES to post the required notice on any website it operates.\n\n      Yet the ICRC has not found that FACES is a place of public accommodation;\n\nindeed, the ICRC acknowledged that FACES is religiously oriented, limits its\n\nmembership, and does not hold itself out as open to the general public.         The statute\n\nauthorizes the ICRC to order posting of a notice “in places of public accommodations.”\n\nI.C. § 22-9-1-6(j)(B). FACES has no physical premises, and I would not hold that any\n                                            41\n\fwebsite operated by FACES is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of\n\nthe ICRL, because FACES does not hold itself out as providing services to the general\n\npublic. See I.C. § 22-9-1-3(m). Because we can properly construe the ICRL to reverse\n\nthat portion of the order that requires FACES to post notice on its websites, I would not\n\nturn to the First Amendment analysis that the majority relies upon to strike the applicable\n\nportion of the ICRC’s order here.\n\n      Though I concur in result, I am less sanguine than the majority about the\n\nlikelihood that expressive association will not be chilled by the result we reach today.\n\nRecognizing the risk that forced inclusion of members could adversely affect the public\n\nor private expression of a group’s principles, the Supreme Court in Boy Scouts of\n\nAmerica v.

FACES could have expelled them from membership\n\nin the organization, and any order requiring their readmission would have, I think,\n\ninfringed upon FACES’s First Amendment right to expressive association for, as the\n\nCourt in Dale observed, “‘[f]reedom of association … plainly presupposes a freedom not\n\nto associate.’” Id. at 648 (quoting Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623\n\n                                            42\n\f(1984)). Had the Bridgewaters been expelled from the group before the dispute over the\n\nmenu at the Masquerade Ball and been advised plainly and honestly that the reason for\n\nthe expulsion was Elizabeth’s and Alyssa’s disruptive conduct, any attempt at forced\n\nreintegration of the Bridgewaters into FACES would have raised serious questions about\n\ninfringement upon FACES’s right to expressive association.\n\n       But that is not what happened here. FACES’s expulsion of the Bridgewaters in\n\nthis case, the announced reasons for which were the Bridgewaters’ disruptiveness, was\n\nfound to be retaliatory because of its sequence and timing. And while I concur in the\n\nmajority’s resolution of the matter, I think it important to state clearly that it is only\n\nFACES’s retaliation, as found by the ICRC, that prevents the ICRC’s order from\n\namounting to an infringement upon the group’s right to expressive association.\n\n       I think it unfortunate that we have been brought into a private dispute between two\n\nreligiously-oriented parties who have chosen not to engage the public education system.\n\nYet one seeks to entangle the other in a quest for accommodation typically required of\n\npublic educational institutions, while the other has organized itself in a way that seeks to\n\nexempt the group almost entirely from our state’s civil rights laws while claiming special\n\nstatus under the tax code.\n\n       I do not think that the legislature’s broad intent when it enacted our civil rights\n\nstatutes involved making the ICRC and our courts arbiters of such private disputes as\n\nhave arisen between FACES and the Bridgewaters. But constrained by the language of\n\n\n\n                                            43\n\fthe statute and mindful of our obligation to avoid constitutional questions, I reluctantly,\n\nbut respectfully, concur in result.\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\f</pre>",
