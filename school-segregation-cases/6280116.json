After a lengthy trial in 1990, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that Defendants—the two institutions and the individuals charged\n\nwith their operation—were violating class members’ federal constitutional and\n\nstatutory rights. The district court ordered the parties to develop a plan to cure the\n\n\n                                            2\n\fviolations, and the plan was implemented over the ensuing years through several\n\nconsent decrees and other court-approved agreements (collectively, consent decrees).\n\nAlthough the two institutions closed in the 1990s, the district court has continued to\n\nmonitor whether Defendants are in compliance with the obligations set forth in those\n\nconsent decrees (decree obligations). And in the twenty-five years since the court’s\n\ninitial ruling, the parties have agreed to, and the court has approved, numerous\n\nadditional decree obligations of varying specificity with which Defendants must\n\ncomply before the court will discontinue its oversight. As of the district court’s most\n\nrecent order, Defendants had yet to fulfill over 300 decree obligations.\n\n      In August 2015, Defendants moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n60(b)(5) to vacate all consent decrees and to terminate the court’s oversight, arguing\n\nthat changed factual circumstances warrant the requested relief. The district court\n\ndenied the motion in June 2016. Defendants appealed. We vacate the 2016 Order and\n\nremand for the district court to decide whether Defendants are currently violating\n\nclass members’ federal constitutional or statutory rights and to reassess the equity of\n\ncontinuing federal oversight with the benefit of that determination.\n\n                               I.     BACKGROUND\n\n      To provide context for this dispute, we begin with an overview of the\n\nprocedural history of this multi-decade litigation. We then examine the district\n\ncourt’s ruling on Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion under the governing legal\n\nstandard.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                                A.     Litigation History\n\n       In July 1987, twenty-one developmentally disabled individuals brought this\n\nclass action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. In their\n\ncomplaint, Plaintiffs challenged the conditions of institutionalization at Fort Stanton\n\nHospital and Training School (Fort Stanton) and Los Lunas Hospital and Training\n\nSchool (Los Lunas), both of which were state-supported institutions for the\n\ndevelopmentally disabled in New Mexico. Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training\n\nSch. (Jackson II), 964 F.2d 980, 985 (10th Cir. 1992). Plaintiffs sought to correct the\n\nfederal constitutional and statutory deficiencies of the conditions at Fort Stanton and\n\nLos Lunas. Id. They also requested relief permitting developmentally disabled\n\npersons residing at the institutions to live in integrated family-like settings within the\n\ncommunity. Id.\n\n       In June 1988, the district court allowed more than 125 parents and guardians\n\nof residents at Fort Stanton and Los Lunas to intervene. Id. Like Plaintiffs,\n\nIntervenors sought to bring the conditions at the two institutions into compliance\n\nwith federal constitutional and statutory law. Id. But Intervenors opposed Plaintiffs’\n\nefforts to require mandatory transfer of the institutions’ residents to community-\n\nbased facilities. Id.\n\n       In June 1989, the district court certified a class of “all persons who at that time\n\nresided at [Fort Stanton] or [Los Lunas], all persons who would become residents of\n\nthe institutions during the pendency of the action, and all persons who had been\n\ntransferred from these two institutions to other facilities funded by [D]efendants.” Id.\n\n                                            4\n\f1.    The 1990 Order\n\n      After a prolonged trial, the district court issued, on December 28, 1990, an\n\nextensive Memorandum Opinion and Order (1990 Order). Jackson v. Fort Stanton\n\nHosp. & Training Sch. (Jackson I), 757 F. Supp. 1243 (D.N.M. 1990), rev’d in part,\n\n964 F.2d 980 (10th Cir. 1992). In the 1990 Order, the court “made detailed findings\n\nof fact regarding almost every aspect of the conditions” at the two institutions,\n\nJackson II, 964 F.2d at 986, and determined that the conditions were statutorily and\n\nconstitutionally deficient in eighteen areas, Jackson I, 757 F. Supp. at 1315–16.1 The\n\ncourt concluded that Defendants were discriminating against class members in\n\nviolation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by failing to provide adequate\n\naccommodations for severely handicapped residents capable of residing in a\n\ncommunity setting, while simultaneously serving less severely handicapped\n\nindividuals in the community. See id. at 1297–99; see also 29 U.S.C. § 794. And the\n\ncourt ruled that Defendants were violating class members’ substantive due process\n\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307\n\n(1982). See Jackson I, 757 F. Supp. at 1305–13. Specifically, the court ruled that\n\n      1\n         The eighteen areas of deficiencies are: (1) individual program plans; (2)\nmedical records; (3) discharge plans; (4) data collection; (5) qualified mental\nretardation professional services; (6) behavior management; (7) use of physical\nrestraints; (8) prevention of abuse of residents; (9) reduction of accidents and injuries\nto residents; (10) reports of abuse, accidents, and injuries; (11) staff supervision; (12)\npreservice training of staff; (13) in-service training of staff; (14) sufficiency of\nprofessional staff; (15) adaptive equipment; (16) functional and chronologically age\nappropriate programming; (17) coordination between residential areas and training\nprogram areas; and (18) inadequate space in training program areas. Jackson v. Fort\nStanton Hosp. & Training Sch., 757 F. Supp. 1243, 1316–17 (D.N.M. 1990).\n\n                                            5\n\fDefendants were violating due process by failing to provide residents of the two\n\ninstitutions with minimally adequate medical care; by failing “to provide reasonable\n\nconditions of safety for the residents”; by physically restraining residents as a result\n\nof understaffing; by failing to provide “minimally adequate training” to the residents;\n\nand by failing to implement recommendations by interdisciplinary treatment teams\n\n(Teams)—consisting of qualified professionals—that certain of these residents should\n\nbe placed in community settings. Id. at 1306–07, 1312.2\n\n      The district court ordered the parties to work together in good faith “to\n\nformulate by agreement a plan to correct” the eighteen areas of deficiencies at the\n\ntwo institutions. Id. at 1315. The court required the parties to formulate a “detailed\n\nwritten policy to be adopted by and followed at each institution,” to designate\n\npersons responsible at each institution for implementing the correction plans, to\n\ndescribe the “strategies to be adopted by each institution” in order to ensure\n\nsuccessful implementation of the correction plans, and to develop a “detailed\n\ntimetable establishing deadlines by which specific components of the correction plan\n\n\n      2\n        The district court further concluded that Defendants violated class members’\nsubstantive due process rights by “considering the present availability of community\nservices when determining whether to recommend the residents for community\nplacement.” Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training Sch. (Jackson II), 964 F.2d\n980, 986 (10th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, the district court permanently enjoined\nDefendants “from permitting [Teams] to take into account the availability or lack of\navailability of community services in reaching a recommendation as to whether a\nresident should be served in the community.” Id. On appeal, we reversed this portion\nof the 1990 Order, holding that the district court erred in ruling that due process\nrequired Defendants be enjoined from permitting Teams to consider the availability\nof community services when making treatment decisions. Id. at 992.\n\n                                            6\n\ffor each deficiency will be achieved.” Id. at 1316. The court also set September 10,\n\n1991, as the deadline for “complete correction of all deficiencies.” Id. And the court\n\nrequired the parties to describe the “[m]eans of assuring continued compliance with\n\nappropriate standards after correction of the deficiencies has been achieved.” Id.\n\n         The court further ordered Defendants to prepare, by March 1, 1991, “a written\n\nplan of transfer to an appropriate community setting for each resident whose [Team]\n\nhas recommended placement in a community setting.” Id. at 1317. The court urged\n\nPlaintiffs to confer in good faith with Defendants to resolve any concerns Plaintiffs\n\nmay have with the proposed plans and to amend the plans accordingly. Id. at 1316–\n\n17. The court also afforded Plaintiffs the opportunity to “file with the court and serve\n\non [D]efendants a statement of any remaining objections they may have to, and their\n\nproposals for amending, any particular plan.” Id.\n\n         Over the next several years, the district court entered various remedial orders\n\nand continued to oversee enforcement of those orders.3 See Jackson v. Los Lunas Ctr.\n\n(Jackson III), No. CIV 87-839-JAP/KBM, 2016 WL 9777237, at *2 (D.N.M. June 14,\n\n2016).\n\n\n\n\n         3\n         In late 1993, Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint by interlineation to\nassert a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Plaintiffs’ proposed\nclaim asserted that Defendants violated the ADA by excluding class members with\ndisabilities from certain public programs and places of public accommodation and\nservice and by segregating class members from their communities by congregating\nthem in Fort Stanton and Los Lunas. In early 1994, the court granted Plaintiffs’\nmotion.\n                                             7\n\f2.     The 1994 Stipulation Concerning Fort Stanton\n\n       In 1994, New Mexico elected to close Fort Stanton by 1995 and to transfer all\n\nof the residents at the institution to community-based services. In April 1994, the\n\nparties filed a joint motion under Rule 60(b) and Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\n\nJail, 502 U.S. 367 (1992), to modify portions of the district court’s 1990 Order, and\n\nto terminate the 1990 Order’s requirements as to Fort Stanton upon closure of that\n\nfacility.\n\n       The district court found the parties’ joint motion “well-taken” and determined\n\nthat “the proposed modification is consistent with the rights of the classmembers.”\n\nJA Vol. 3 at 582. As a result, the court relieved Defendants from making further\n\nimprovements to Fort Stanton. In doing so, the court stated, “[i]n the event that all\n\nclassmembers have been transferred from Fort Stanton to appropriate settings by\n\nJuly 31, 1995, this Order and all portions of the [1990 Order] concerning corrections\n\nof deficiencies . . . at Fort Stanton will hereby be terminated.” Id. at 584.\n\n3.     The 1997 Joint Stipulation on Disengagement (JSD) and Plan of Action\n\n       In October 1997, the parties presented the court with the JSD, a Plan of\n\nAction, and a joint motion requesting the court’s approval of the JSD. According to\n\nthe parties’ stipulation, the JSD “does not seek a remedy for past violations of\n\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights.” JA Vol. 7 at 1403. It is instead\n\ndesigned to prevent future harm by ensuring that “Plaintiffs’ rights are not violated in\n\nthe community settings.” Id. at 1394. To that end, the JSD “defines the further\n\nactions and requirements” that Defendants had to complete, “and the services,\n\n                                            8\n\fsupports, and benefits” that Defendants had to provide to class members, in order for\n\nDefendants to comply with their obligations under the court’s existing orders. JA\n\nVol. 4 at 622.\n\n       The JSD acknowledges Defendants’ “substantial efforts to develop a non-\n\ndiscriminatory service system for persons with developmental disabilities and to\n\nprovide appropriate community living arrangements and supports to classmembers.”\n\nId. at 620. And it states Defendants had made “efforts to reasonably accommodate\n\nthe residents of Fort Stanton and Los Lunas in community settings.” Id. at 621. As a\n\nresult of those efforts, Fort Stanton closed in March 1995 when all its residents had\n\ntransitioned to community settings, and Los Lunas closed in July 1997 when its last\n\nresident transitioned to the community.\n\n       The JSD also includes a process for judicial disengagement of Defendants’\n\ndecree obligations. And it identifies the “Continued Improvement of Community\n\nServices” as an area subject to disengagement. The Continuous Improvement\n\nobligations address “a quality improvement approach that requires Defendants to\n\nachieve a certain score on an annual audit.” Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *2\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In the order denying Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion that is the subject of this appeal, the district court recognized that Defendants\n\nhave achieved disengagement from fifty-six of the seventy Continuous Improvement\n\nobligations. Id.\n\n       The parties identified additional obligations in the Plan of Action, which\n\nDefendant Department of Health developed “to [e]nhance the Community Service\n\n                                           9\n\fSystem” for persons with developmental disabilities. JA Vol. 4 at 629. The Plan of\n\nAction contains “a narrative, desired outcomes, and specific activities for thirteen\n\ncomponents of the community service system.”4 Id. Those thirteen components are\n\ncontained in the Plan of Action’s thirteen attached appendices. Two more appendices\n\nwere later added by consent of the parties.\n\n      After holding a fairness hearing, the district court issued, in December 1997,\n\nan order approving the JSD and the Plan of Action. The court noted the JSD “does\n\nnot call for immediate dismissal of this lawsuit,” but instead “contemplates continued\n\njudicial oversight that could extend well into the next [millennium].” Id. at 801. The\n\ncourt further observed that the JSD “states the parties’ intention to fulfill most of the\n\nactivities described in the Plan of Action by December 31, 1998, but makes an\n\nexception for certain requirements that may not be met until December 31, 2000.” Id.\n\n4.    The 2005 Stipulation to Resolve Motion for Noncompliance (Appendix A)\n\n      In May 2004, Plaintiffs moved for an order to show cause and for further\n\nremedial relief to require Defendants to comply with the court’s December 1997\n\norder approving the JSD and the Plan of Action. In June 2004, Plaintiffs moved for\n\nan Order to Reengage Effective Case Management, Desired Outcome A, Under the\n\nPlan of Action.\n\n\n\n      4\n        The thirteen components are (1) quality enhancement, (2) community\nincident management system, (3) training, (4) management information systems, (5)\nindividual service planning, (6) case management, (7) behavioral services, (8) crisis\nresponse, (9) sexuality, (10) supported employment, (11) assistive technology, (12)\nmedical services, and (13) regional offices.\n                                           10\n\f      In May 2005, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation on Agreed Actions to Comply\n\nwith Joint Stipulation of Disengagement and Plan of Action and to Resolve Pending\n\nMotions to Show Cause and to Re-engage (2005 Stipulation). Attached to the 2005\n\nStipulation is “Appendix A[:] Agreed Actions to Address Contempt Motions”\n\n(Appendix A). JA Vol. 10 at 1903. The 2005 Stipulation states that it “is intended to\n\nobligate Defendants to take certain actions outside the Plan of Action as more\n\nspecifically outlined in Appendix A.” Id. at 1898. “[T]he actions identified in\n\nAppendix A are intended to facilitate compliance with the JSD, to promote\n\ncompletion of . . . Audit Recommendations, to further address Case Management\n\neven though Plan of Action Desired Outcomes related to Case Management have\n\nbeen previously disengaged by an order of the Court and to address certain aspects of\n\nVocational Rehabilitation.” Id. at 1898–99. The 2005 Stipulation clarifies that it is\n\nnot intended to change or modify the terms of the JSD, which remain in effect. And it\n\nfurther states that Defendants “agree to implement all of the actions identified and\n\nlisted in Appendix A,” and that the parties agree some of the Appendix A actions\n\nsupplanted or modified activities listed in the Plan of Action. Id. at 1899.\n\n      Appendix A imposes 107 specific obligations on Defendants. Some of the\n\nobligations are identified as “complete,” while many obligations were scheduled to\n\nbe completed by May 2006 or in 2007. Although those deadlines were not met,\n\nDefendants represent that one third of the activities in Appendix A have been\n\ndisengaged. Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *4.\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f       The district court issued an order adopting the parties’ stipulation the same day\n\nthe parties submitted it.\n\n5.     The 2012 Order\n\n       In mid-July 2010, Plaintiffs filed another Motion for Further Remedial Relief\n\nto Remedy Noncompliance. After full briefing, the district court denied the motion\n\nwithout prejudice so Plaintiffs could refile after an evidentiary hearing scheduled for\n\nJune 2011.\n\n       On April 26, 2011—the day before the pretrial conference for the evidentiary\n\nhearing—Defendants filed a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to terminate all remaining orders\n\nand to conclude the court’s oversight. Defendants maintained that they have made\n\nmore than a reasonable effort to comply with the court’s orders, that they have\n\nsubstantially complied with all existing orders, and that changed factual conditions\n\nmake continuing compliance substantially more onerous. The court held the motion\n\nin abeyance and suspended briefing on it until the completion of the evidentiary\n\nhearing, which occurred from June 13 to June 17, 2011. Jackson III, 2016 WL\n\n9777237, at *4. The court later terminated the pending Rule 60(b)(5) motion without\n\ndeciding its merits. Id. at *4 n.12.\n\n       In November 2011, after the evidentiary hearing, Plaintiffs filed a Renewed\n\nMotion for Further Remedial Relief to Remedy Noncompliance. Plaintiffs argued that\n\nDefendants had failed to comply with the JSD, the Plan of Action, Appendix A, the\n\nRehabilitation Act, and the ADA (collectively, decrees). Plaintiffs also asked the\n\ncourt to appoint a Jackson Compliance Administrator (Compliance Administrator) to\n\n                                          12\n\foversee and ensure Defendants’ compliance. In October 2012, the district court\n\nissued a 206-page, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (2012 Order). The court\n\npraised Defendants’ “innovations and progress,” but determined that Defendants\n\nwere still in substantial noncompliance with the decree obligations. JA Vol. 25 at\n\n5303. Indeed, the court identified instances of noncompliance in the areas of health,\n\nsafety, and supported employment.\n\n      Based on the evidence before it, however, the court stated it “is unable to\n\nconclude that Defendants have violated the Rehabilitation Act and ADA.” The court\n\nexplained:\n\n      To start with, the Court could not conclude that Defendants have\n      discriminated against severely disabled class members with respect to\n      the provision of health care services. In fact, the Court commends\n      Defendants for accommodating those severely disabled class members\n      who live in rural New Mexico by providing them meaningful access to\n      health care services . . . and for developing more and better health care\n      services directed to severely disabled persons. There is, however, a\n      question as to whether Defendants violated the Rehabilitation Act and\n      ADA by intentionally denying severely disabled class members\n      supported employment services equivalent to those received by less\n      severely disabled persons. Unfortunately, that question of disparate\n      treatment cannot be analyzed at this time, but must be further briefed.\n      On the other hand, the Court was unable to find a violation of the\n      Rehabilitation Act and ADA when severely disabled class members\n      choose to participate in segregated, congregate day services while less\n      severely disabled persons more often chose to engage in supported\n      employment.\n\nId. at 5304–05.\n\n      The court also noted that Defendants “are close to substantially complying\n\nwith [their] obligations,” and suggested that “the parties reconsider the descriptions\n\nof the more broadly stated obligations and restate them in language that makes the\n\n                                          13\n\fobligations achievable.” Id. at 5303–04. After all, “many of the obligations are\n\ndescribed in language that is more aspirational in nature than operational.” Id. at\n\n5304. Finally, the court granted Plaintiffs’ request to appoint a Compliance\n\nAdministrator, who could “prod Defendants into final substantial compliance.”5 Id. at\n\n5305.\n\n6.      The 2015 Revised Table IV\n\n        After the district court issued its 2012 Order, the parties were to develop a\n\nconsolidated remedial plan in the areas of health, safety, and supported employment\n\nto address the identified violations. See Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *6. The\n\nparties, counsel, the Compliance Administrator, and the court then worked together\n\nfor over two years before finalizing a consolidated plan. Id.\n\n        In June 2015, the parties jointly filed the 2015 Revised Table IV—which is a\n\nfinal list of objectives in the areas of health, safety, and supported employment—\n\nalong with evaluative components (or disengagement criteria) and projected\n\ncompletion dates for each objective. In November 2015, the parties jointly filed a\n\nStipulated Agreement on Disengagement Process for Revised Table IV. Under the\n\n\n        5\n         After the court issued its 2012 Order, Plaintiffs moved to modify the 2012\nOrder with respect to their claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.\nPlaintiffs asked the court to delete its findings and conclusions “on all discrimination\nclaims regarding severity of disability and segregation,” to strike those portions of\ntheir November 2011 Renewed Motion for Remedial Relief to Remedy\nNoncompliance based on the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, and to vacate the\npertinent sections from its 2012 Order. JA Vol. 25 at 5308–09. The court denied the\nmotion to modify, but, on its own initiative, granted Plaintiffs leave to file a motion\nseeking relief on their disparate treatment claim. Plaintiffs never filed a motion\nseeking relief on that claim.\n                                            14\n\fagreed-upon disengagement process, Defendants would submit a request for\n\ndisengagement of a specific decree objective to the Compliance Administrator, who\n\nwould then make a written “determination” on whether the disengagement criteria\n\nhad been met. If the Compliance Administrator did not agree that the criteria had\n\nbeen met, then Defendants could withdraw their request for a determination or pursue\n\na disengagement motion with the court.\n\n      The court noted that, as of May 2016, the Compliance Administrator had\n\nissued approximately three determinations on Defendants’ requests, with roughly 197\n\ndecree obligations remaining for which the Compliance Administrator had not issued\n\npreliminary determinations. Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *7 n.20. The court\n\nalso stated Revised Table IV did not replace or modify existing decree obligations\n\nthat were not the subject of Plaintiffs’ Renewed Noncompliance Motion and the\n\ncourt’s 2012 Order. Id. at *8. Thus, Defendants must demonstrate substantial\n\ncompliance with the earlier outstanding decree obligations, in addition to those listed\n\nin Revised Table IV. Id. The court estimated that, between the JSD, the Plan of\n\nAction, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV, Defendants must still show substantial\n\ncompliance with approximately 307 decree obligations. Id. at *9.\n\n               B. District Court’s Denial of Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) Motion\n\n      In August 2015, Defendants filed their current motion under Rule 60(b)(5),\n\narguing that factual circumstances have changed to the extent that the district court\n\nshould vacate all remaining orders and conclude its oversight entirely. Defendants\n\nidentified four changed factual circumstances they claim warrant vacatur of all\n\n                                          15\n\fpertinent decrees and termination of the case. First, Defendants argued that their\n\ndecree obligations have increased in number and complexity to the point they will\n\nnever be able to satisfy the “labyrinth of obligations” that are ever-changing, ever-\n\nincreasing, and not subject to objective measurement. Jackson III, 2016 WL\n\n9777237, at *11.\n\n       Second, Defendants argued that some of their obligations are now outdated:\n\n       1) the JSD provisions about community practice improvements at [Los\n       Lunas], which are no longer relevant as that institution closed in 1997;\n       2) the JSD formulate for disengagement of the Continuous Improvement\n       outcomes, which is “convoluted,” “confusing,” and “unworkable”;\n       3) the JSD Continuous Improvement obligations that “are no longer\n       programmatically sound and are no longer the desire” of [class\n       members],” and that are not relevant to the present-day needs of [class\n       members]; 4) the 1997 Plan of Action obligations that have been\n       “morphed into new requirements” under Revised Table IV and that are\n       “long detached from remedying the original constitutional issues”; and\n       5) Appendix A obligations that consist of vague and aspirational\n       language, making disengagement impossible.\n\nId. at *12 (citations omitted).\n\n       Third, while conceding they have not substantially complied with all their\n\ndecree obligations, Defendants maintained they have remedied all constitutional\n\nviolations. Id. They argued they have thus attained the “objects” of the consent\n\ndecrees, and they have corrected all eighteen areas of deficiencies the district court\n\nidentified in its 1990 Order. Id. at 12–13. And if more is required, they insisted, this\n\ncase will remain a never-ending process of continuing quality control. Id. at 12.\n\n       Fourth, Defendants argued that the increased litigation costs inhibit New\n\nMexico’s ability to fund other important programs. Id. at *12–13. For instance, New\n\n\n                                           16\n\fMexico has spent more than $50 million related to this litigation in the last eight\n\nyears. Id. at *12. And, as of 2009, the average yearly cost to provide services to class\n\nmembers had risen from $67,290.00 to $135,535.00 per class member, while New\n\nMexico’s $32,992.00 per capita income was the ninth lowest in the United States. Id.\n\nat *13.\n\n      Based on these four changed circumstances, Defendants contended that notions\n\nof federalism supported their request for relief. Indeed, they argued that federalism\n\nconcerns are heightened here because the consent decrees have the effect of dictating\n\nstate and local budget priorities and improperly depriving state officials of their\n\ndesignated legislative and executive powers. Id. at *13.\n\n      In an order issued in June 2016, the court ruled that Defendants had not met\n\ntheir burden to show the existence of a significant change in fact warranting vacatur\n\nof all pertinent orders and termination of the case. First, the court stated that “while\n\nDefendants’ obligations are onerous,” Defendants never identified when these\n\nasserted changed factual circumstances occurred; indeed, “[s]ome of the complained\n\nabout developments have been happening for years.” Id. at *14.\n\n      Next, the court concluded that Defendants have not shown that the objects of\n\nthe pertinent decrees have been attained. While the court recognized that the decrees\n\nwere designed to restore class members to the position they would have occupied\n\nabsent violations of federal law, the court stated that the “more specific ‘essential\n\npurposes’” of those decrees “are to provide class members with adequate health care,\n\na reasonably safe environment, and supported employment opportunities.” Id.\n\n                                           17\n\f(quoting 2012 Order at 33). And based on Defendants’ concessions that they have not\n\nsubstantially complied with all the decree obligations, the court concluded that\n\nDefendants “have not fulfilled the essential purposes of the pertinent decrees.” Id.\n\n      Further, the court found Defendants’ assertion that they long ago remedied all\n\nconstitutional violations to be “somewhat misleading.” Id. at *14–15. The court\n\nexplained that the decree obligations in the JSD, the Plan of Action, and Appendix A\n\n“all flowed from [its] original findings of [federal] violations in 1990.” Id. at *15.\n\nAnd it noted that Revised Table IV was developed in response to the 2012 findings of\n\napproximately 100 decree violations. Id. The court stated that it “correlated its\n\nspecific findings of violations in 2012 with enumerated requirements in the JSD, Plan\n\nof Action, and Appendix A.” Id. “Stated differently, the October 2012 violations\n\nevolved from compliance issues concerning obligations that first appeared in the\n\nJSD, Plan of Action, and Appendix A that Defendants had not yet satisfied.” Id.\n\n      The court also took issue with Defendants’ characterization of the 2012 Order\n\nas finding no ongoing violations of federal law. The court clarified that it had made\n\nno findings in its 2012 Order on continuing violations of federal law. Id. Although\n\nPlaintiffs had argued that Defendants violated the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA,\n\nthe court ruled then that “there was not sufficient evidence of discrimination under”\n\neither Act. Id. But the court explained that it was not asked, and thus made no\n\nfindings on, whether Defendants otherwise continued to violate class members’\n\nconstitutional rights. Id. With respect to the 2016 motion to terminate oversight, the\n\ndistrict court likewise did not resolve the question of current compliance with federal\n\n                                           18\n\flaw, stating it “is not in the position to assess, and, therefore, cannot conclude that\n\nDefendants are no longer violating constitutional or federal law.” Id. at *16. But\n\n“[b]ecause all of [the] outstanding obligations grew out of the Court’s 1990 Order\n\nand/or the related 2012 findings of violations,” the district court concluded that\n\n“Defendants have not convinced the Court that they have satisfied the essential\n\npurposes of the JSD, Plan of Action, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV.” Id. at 16.\n\n      The court then rejected Defendants’ claim that principles of federalism\n\ndictated the termination of oversight. The court acknowledged that the Supreme\n\nCourt, in Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433 (2009), stated that federalism concerns are\n\nheightened when a consent decree has the effect of dictating state budget allocations.\n\nId. And it conceded that “increasing fees and costs associated with this litigation are\n\ndetrimental to the State’s interest.” Id. But the court reasoned that “first and\n\nforemost,” the Horne Court asked if the State had fulfilled its obligations under\n\nfederal law and achieved the objectives of the pertinent order. Id. The district court\n\nanswered that question in the negative, stating: “Unlike Horne, Defendants have not\n\nshown that they have fulfilled their outstanding obligations, ‘by other means.’” Id. at\n\n*17 (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 439).\n\n      Ultimately, the court concluded that Defendants “have not come close to\n\nshowing that vacatur of all of the orders and decrees is suitably tailored to the\n\nproposed changed circumstances.” Id. Nor have Defendants “demonstrated that a\n\ndurable remedy is in place sufficient to justify vacatur of all of the Court’s orders.”\n\nId. at *18. In other words, Defendants had not shown “that it is unlikely that the\n\n                                            19\n\fprohibited conditions or actions will recur.” Id. (quoting LaShawn A. ex rel. Moore v.\n\nFenty, 701 F. Supp. 2d 84, 111 (D.D.C. 2010), aff’d sub nom. LaShawn A. ex rel.\n\nMoore v. Gray, 412 F. App’x 315 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). The court therefore denied the\n\nmotion.\n\n                                  II.    ANALYSIS\n\n      On appeal, Defendants assert that the district court abused its discretion when\n\nit denied their Rule 60(b)(5) motion. Defendants contend significant changes in\n\nfactual circumstances warrant termination of all consent decrees and of the court’s\n\noversight. Specifically, they claim that compliance with the decrees has become\n\nsubstantially more onerous, the decrees have become unworkable due to unforeseen\n\nobstacles, and continued enforcement of the decrees would be detrimental to the\n\npublic interest. They also argue that the district court misapplied Horne by requiring\n\nthem to show attainment of specific essential purposes identified by the district court\n\nrather than compliance with federal law.\n\n                             A.     Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n      Before addressing the merits, we must first resolve the parties’ dispute about\n\nwhether the district court’s June 2016 order is a final, appealable order under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291. We have appellate jurisdiction over “final decisions of the district\n\ncourts of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291. “A ‘final decision’ is ordinarily one\n\nthat ‘ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but\n\nexecute the judgment.’” Hayes Fam. Tr. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 845 F.3d\n\n997, 1003 (10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233\n\n                                           20\n\f(1945)); see also D&H Marketers, Inc. v. Freedom Oil & Gas, Inc., 744 F.2d 1443,\n\n1444 (10th Cir. 1984) (en banc) (stating that § 1291 “has consistently been held to\n\nrequire the termination of all matters as to all parties and causes of action before an\n\nappeal may be taken”). “[P]ut differently,” a final decision is “one by which the\n\ndistrict court ‘disassociates itself from a case.’” McClendon v. City of Albuquerque,\n\n630 F.3d 1288, 1292 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Swint v. Chambers Cty. Comm’n, 514\n\nU.S. 35, 42 (1995)). Although “a final judgment is the paradigmatic ‘final decision’\n\nappealable under § 1291,” not “every case with a final judgment in it is appealable.”\n\nId. Instead, “every post-judgment decision must be assessed on its own terms to\n\ndetermine whether it is a final decision amenable to appeal.” Id. at 1293.\n\n       As relevant here, “[t]he general rules governing our review of a district court’s\n\norder granting or denying a Rule 60(b) motion are fairly well settled.” Stubblefield v.\n\nWindsor Capital Grp., 74 F.3d 990, 993 (10th Cir. 1996). “We have jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to reach the merits of an appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion, provided the ruling or judgment the Rule 60(b) motion challenged was a final\n\ndecision of the district court.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n\nMcClendon, 630 F.3d at 1294 (recognizing that a district court’s denial of a Rule\n\n60(b) motion “usually qualif[ies] as [a] final decision[] for purposes of § 1291\n\nbecause [it] usually signal[s] that the district court’s business is done, that it has\n\ndisassociated itself from the case, [and] that we may act without stepping on the\n\ndistrict court’s toes”).\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f      Here, Defendants moved under Rule 60(b) to vacate all pertinent orders—the\n\nJSD, the Plan of Action, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV—and to terminate this\n\ncase. The parties and district court agree that the pertinent orders are consent decrees.\n\nSee Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *9. And all agree that consent decrees are, in\n\neffect, final decisions within the meaning of Rule 60(b). See Johnson v. Lodge #93 of\n\nFraternal Order of Police, 393 F.3d 1096, 1101 (10th Cir. 2004) (“A consent decree\n\nis a negotiated agreement that is entered as a judgment of the court. Consent decrees\n\n. . . have characteristics both of contracts and of final judgments on the merits.”\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); see also V.T.A., Inc. v. Airco, Inc., 597 F.2d 220,\n\n224 (10th Cir. 1979) (noting that when “the underlying judgment was by consent [it]\n\nhas the same force and effect for [Rule] 60(b) purposes as a judgment rendered on the\n\nmerits following trial”). Because the pertinent orders are consent decrees that are\n\nfinal orders under Rule 60(b), it necessarily follows that the district court’s June 2016\n\norder denying relief under Rule 60(b)(5) from those consent decrees is also final and\n\nappealable under § 1291. See Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, 365 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.\n\n2004) (“Because consent decrees are considered final judgments we have jurisdiction\n\nto review the claims raised in the motion to vacate the consent decrees pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.” (citation omitted)).\n\n      Plaintiffs disagree. Relying on McClendon, they argue the district court’s June\n\n2016 order is not a final, appealable order because it signals that more litigation is on\n\nthe way. Plaintiffs believe future litigation will occur when they inevitably file\n\nanother motion for remedial relief to remedy Defendants’ noncompliance with the\n\n                                           22\n\fconsent decrees. In other words, the June 2016 Order is not final because the district\n\ncourt will continue to monitor Defendants’ compliance with its prior consent decrees\n\n(i.e., the JSD, the Plan of Action, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV).\n\n       But under McClendon, that the district court may have to continue to oversee\n\nDefendants’ compliance with the consent decrees is not enough to strip the June 2016\n\norder of its status as a final decision. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether the June\n\n2016 order will result in more litigation on the merits in the district court. See\n\nMcClendon, 630 F.3d at 1292–94. If the June 2016 order “ensures litigation on the\n\nmerits will continue in the district court,” then it is not final under § 1291. Id. at\n\n1293. But if it does not, and it is otherwise a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion\n\nchallenging a final decision of the district court, then it is a final decision under\n\n§ 1291. See id. at 1293–94; Jeff D., 365 F.3d at 850.\n\n       Under this formulation, the June 2016 order is a final, appealable decision.\n\nFirst, the June 2016 order does not signal that more litigation on the merits is on the\n\nway. In fact, the 1990 order, which followed a lengthy trial, resolved the merits of the\n\nlitigation, and the district court retained jurisdiction only to oversee implementation\n\nof the ensuing consent decrees. Second, as discussed above, the 2016 order denied a\n\nRule 60(b) motion challenging several final decisions of the district court.\n\n       To be sure, the June 2016 order does not result in the district court dissociating\n\nitself from the case. Much the opposite, it means the district court will, as it has since\n\nit issued the 1990 Order, continue to oversee Defendants’ compliance with the\n\npertinent consent decrees. But this fact alone does not deprive us of jurisdiction.\n\n                                            23\n\fAfter all, each decree was a final, appealable decision under § 1291, even though the\n\ndistrict court continued to oversee each decree’s implementation. See Johnson, 393\n\nF.3d at 1101; V.T.A., 597 F.2d at 224. If the district court’s continued oversight\n\nwould not have divested us of appellate jurisdiction then, it should not do so now.\n\n      In sum, the finality test asks whether the ruling challenged in the denied Rule\n\n60(b) motion was “a final decision of the district court.” Stubblefield, 74 F.3d at 993.\n\nHere, that test is met. The June 2016 order is a final, appealable order and, thus, we\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction under § 1291.\n\n                           B.     The Rule 60(b)(5) Motion\n\n      We now turn to Defendants’ argument that termination of all pertinent orders\n\nand of this case is appropriate due to significant changes in factual circumstances.\n\nOur analysis proceeds in three parts. First, we discuss the relevant standard of\n\nreview. Second, we outline the law governing Rule 60(b)(5) motions in institutional\n\nreform litigation. Third, we apply that standard to the facts of this case.\n\n1.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review a district court’s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1009 (10th Cir. 2000). In\n\nthe Rule 60(b) context, we review the district court’s ruling only “to determine if a\n\ndefinite, clear or unmistakable error occurred below.” Zurich N. Am. v. Matrix Serv.,\n\nInc. 426 F.3d 1281, 1289 (10th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). “A\n\nreviewing court may reverse only if it finds a complete absence of a reasonable basis\n\nand is certain that the decision is wrong.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). “A\n\n                                            24\n\fclear example of an abuse of discretion exists where the trial court fails to consider\n\nthe applicable legal standard or the facts upon which the exercise of its discretionary\n\njudgment is based.” Ohlander v. Larson, 114 F.3d 1531, 1537 (10th Cir. 1997). An\n\nappeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion raises for our review only the district\n\ncourt’s order denying the motion, and not the underlying judgment itself. Servants of\n\nParaclete, 204 F.3d at 1009.\n\n2.    Legal Standard\n\n      A Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment is an extraordinary remedy and\n\nmay be granted only in exceptional circumstances. Id.; see V.T.A., Inc., 597 F.2d at\n\n223 n.7 (10th Cir. 1979). The motion may not be used as a substitute for direct\n\nappeal. See Servants of Paraclete, 204 F.3d at 1009.\n\n      Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment or order if “[1] the judgment has\n\nbeen satisfied, released, or discharged; [2] it is based on an earlier judgment that has\n\nbeen reversed or vacated; or [3] applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) (emphasis added). Use of the disjunctive “or” demonstrates\n\n“that each of the provision’s three grounds for relief is independently sufficient and\n\ntherefore that relief may be warranted even if [a movant has] not ‘satisfied’ the\n\noriginal order.” Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 454 (2009). Defendants seek relief on\n\nthe ground that ongoing enforcement of the pertinent decrees is no longer equitable.\n\n      We now turn to a discussion of the limits of federal involvement in\n\ninstitutional reform litigation and of the two leading Supreme Court cases addressing\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fthe no-longer-equitable basis for Rule 60(b)(5) relief: Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk\n\nCounty Jail, 502 U.S. 367 (1992), and Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433 (2009).\n\n      a.     Consent Decrees Generally\n\n      A consent decree “entered in federal court must be directed to protecting\n\nfederal interests.” Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437 (2004). The consent decree\n\n“must spring from, and serve to resolve, a dispute within the court’s subject-matter\n\njurisdiction.” Id. (citing Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 525 (1986)).\n\n      Equity requires a federal court fashioning and implementing a consent decree\n\nto focus on three factors. See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280 (1977). First, a\n\nfederal consent decree must “be remedial in nature” and thus “designed as nearly as\n\npossible to restore the victims of [illegal] conduct to the position they would have\n\noccupied in the absence of such conduct.” Id. at 280 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      Second, the nature and scope of the remedy provided by a federal consent\n\ndecree depends on the nature and scope of the federal-law violation. Id. at 280, 282.\n\nThis means a “federal-court decree[] must directly address and relate to the [federal-\n\nlaw] violation itself.” Id. at 282. And it must be “tailored to cure the condition that\n\noffends” federal law. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). But a decree exceeds\n\nappropriate limits if it is “aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate\n\n[federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.” Id.\n\n      Third, federal courts “must take into account the interests of state and local\n\nauthorities in managing their own affairs,” consistent with the demands of federal\n\n                                           26\n\flaw. Id. at 280–81. Indeed, principles of federalism require that federal courts give\n\n“significant weight to the views of government officials,” and that “state officials\n\nwith front-line responsibility for administering [a state program] be given latitude\n\nand substantial discretion.” Frew, 540 U.S. at 442 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Importantly, federal consent decrees are temporary solutions that may be kept\n\nin place only as long as necessary to cure an unlawful condition. See Missouri v.\n\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88-89 (1995). The Supreme Court has cautioned that federal\n\ncourts should not continue their “oversight of state programs for long periods of time\n\n. . . absent an ongoing violation of federal law.” Frew, 540 U.S. at 441. Thus, a\n\n“federal court must exercise its equitable powers to ensure that when the objects of\n\nthe decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the State’s obligations is\n\nreturned promptly to the State and its officials.” Id. at 442. Keeping a consent decree\n\nin place any longer than necessary to assure compliance with federal law risks\n\nviolating principles of federalism and “improperly depriv[ing] future officials of their\n\ndesignated legislative and executive powers.” Id. at 441; see also John B v. Emkes,\n\n710 F.3d 394, 398 (6th Cir. 2013) (stating that a consent decree “may remain in force\n\nonly as long as it continues to remedy a violation of federal law”); United States v.\n\nWashington, 573 F.3d 701, 710 (9th Cir. 2009) (“The [Supreme] Court has repeatedly\n\nreminded us that institutional reform injunctions were meant to be temporary\n\nsolutions, not permanent interventions, and could be kept in place only so long as the\n\nviolation continued.”).\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\f       b.     Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail\n\n       In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 372 (1992), pretrial\n\ndetainees held at a county jail in Massachusetts sued the county, state, and related\n\nentities, claiming they were being held under unconstitutional conditions. The district\n\ncourt ruled that conditions at the jail were constitutionally deficient; thus, the district\n\ncourt enjoined the state defendants from, among other things, housing two or more\n\ninmates in a single cell. Id. at 372–73. When conditions at the jail did not improve,\n\nthe district court ordered the state defendants to renovate another existing facility to\n\nserve as a substitute detention center. Id. at 373–74. The First Circuit affirmed and\n\nordered that the jail be closed unless the state defendants timely presented a plan to\n\ncreate a constitutionally adequate facility for the pretrial detainees. Id. at 374.\n\n       Days before the deadline to present a plan for a new facility, the state\n\ndefendants submitted a plan to create a substitute facility with only single-occupancy\n\ncells, and the district court entered a consent decree obligating the state defendants to\n\nconstruct a facility containing 309 single occupancy rooms. Id. at 374–75. When the\n\ninmate population outpaced population projections, the parties moved the district\n\ncourt to modify the decree to provide a facility with an increased number of cells. Id.\n\nat 375–76. The district court granted the modification on the condition that “single-\n\ncell occupancy is maintained” under the new plan for the facility. Id. at 376.\n\n       The state defendants again moved to modify the consent decree, this time to\n\nallow for double bunking of male detainees in roughly one-third of the cells in the\n\nnew jail. Id. The state defendants attributed the need for a second modification to a\n\n                                            28\n\ffurther increase in the population of pretrial detainees. Id. The state defendants\n\nargued that the continued increase in the pretrial detainee population—a change in\n\nfact—coupled with a change in law regarding the constitutionality of double bunking\n\npretrial detainees, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), supported the requested\n\nmodification. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 376. The district court denied the motion, in part,\n\nbecause the state defendants failed to make a “clear showing of [a] grievous wrong\n\nevoked by new and unforeseen conditions.” Id. at 377 (quoting United States v. Swift\n\n& Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119 (1932)). The district court explained that modification\n\nwould violate a primary purpose of the decree—to provide for a separate cell for each\n\ndetainee—although it never decided whether double celling would be\n\nunconstitutional. Id. at 377. The First Circuit affirmed. Id.\n\n      The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded so the lower courts could\n\napply the proper standard to modification requests under Rule 60(b)(5). See id. at\n\n393. The Court began by emphasizing the need for flexibility when considering a\n\nmotion for modification of a consent decree in institutional reform litigation. Id. at\n\n380–83. After all, consent decrees in such cases “often remain in place for extended\n\nperiods of time, [meaning] the likelihood of significant changes occurring during the\n\nlife of the decree is increased.” Id. at 380. The Court further explained that the\n\nexperience of the Courts of Appeals “demonstrated that a flexible approach is often\n\nessential to achieving the goals of reform litigation,” as the Courts of Appeals\n\nobserved that consent decrees frequently “reach beyond the parties involved directly\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\fin the suit and impact [] the public’s right to the sound and efficient operation of its\n\ninstitutions.” Id. at 381 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The Court then outlined what a movant must show when seeking modification\n\nof a consent decree under Rule 60(b)(5). The party seeking modification of a consent\n\ndecree bears the burden of showing that “a significant change either in factual\n\nconditions or in law” warrants revision of the decree. Id. at 384. Changed factual\n\ncircumstances may warrant modification of a consent decree when the changed\n\ncircumstances “make compliance with the decree substantially more onerous,” when\n\n“a decree proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,” or when\n\n“enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public\n\ninterest.” Id. at 384. A party need not show that a change in fact was both unforeseen\n\nand unforeseeable. Id. at 385.\n\n      Conversely, a court should deny a party’s request for a modification under\n\nRule 60(b)(5) if the party merely establishes that “it is no longer convenient [for the\n\nmoving party] to live with the terms of a consent decree.” Id. at 383. Furthermore, a\n\nmodification should be denied “where a party relies upon events that actually were\n\nanticipated at the time it entered into a decree.” Id. at 385. The Court explained:\n\n      If it is clear that a party anticipated changing conditions that would\n      make performance of the decree more onerous but nevertheless agreed\n      to the decree, that party would have to satisfy a heavy burden to\n      convince a court that it agreed to the decree in good faith, made a\n      reasonable effort to comply with the decree, and should be relieved of\n      the undertaking under Rule 60(b).\n\nId.\n\n\n                                           30\n\f       If a party meets its burden of establishing a change in fact that warrants\n\nmodification of a consent decree, the district court should examine “whether the\n\nproposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.” Id. at 391.\n\nThis analysis focuses on whether the proposed modification “is tailored to resolve the\n\nproblems created by the change in circumstances.” Id. In performing this analysis, a\n\ncourt must bear in mind that the public interest and principles of federalism require a\n\nfederal court to defer to state or local government officials and to consider a state or\n\nlocal government’s financial constraints. Id. at 392. But a modification “must not\n\ncreate or perpetuate a constitutional violation.” Id. at 391. Additionally, in accord\n\nwith the requirement that a modification be tailored to the change in circumstances,\n\nthe existence of a change in circumstances often will not justify a modification to the\n\nconsent decree that lowers the terms of the consent decree to “the constitutional\n\nfloor.” Id. In this sense, a court modifying a consent decree may “do no more” to the\n\nconsent decree than is warranted by the change in circumstances and “should not\n\n‘turn aside to inquire whether some of the provisions of the decree . . . could have\n\nbeen opposed with success if the defendants had offered opposition.’” Id. at 391-92\n\n(quoting United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 116-17 (1932)). Thus, even\n\nwhere a change in circumstances occurs, the plaintiff will retain those benefits\n\nsecured under the consent decree that are not impugned by the change in\n\ncircumstances. See id.\n\n      The Court then instructed the district court on remand to first consider whether\n\nthe purported change in factual circumstances—the upsurge in the pretrial detainee\n\n                                           31\n\fpopulation—was foreseen by the state defendants. Id. at 385. But the Court also\n\nadvised that the district court erred by concluding that modification was\n\ninappropriate simply because it would not provide for a separate cell for each\n\ndetainee. The Court explained:\n\n       Even if the decree is construed as an undertaking by [the state\n       defendants] to provide single cells for pretrial detainees, to relieve\n       [them] from that promise based on changed conditions does not\n       necessarily violate the basic purpose of the decree. That purpose was to\n       provide a remedy for what had been found, based on a variety of factors,\n       including double celling, to be unconstitutional conditions obtaining in\n       the [jail]. If modification of one term of a consent decree defeats the\n       purpose of the decree, obviously modification would be all but\n       impossible. That cannot be the rule. The District Court was thus in error\n       in holding that . . . modification of the single cell requirement was\n       necessarily forbidden.\n\nId. at 387.\n\n       c.     Horne v. Flores\n\n       In Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 439 (2009), the Supreme Court was again\n\ntasked with determining whether the lower courts applied the correct standard in\n\ndenying a Rule 60(b)(5) motion. There, a class of English Language-Learner (ELL)\n\nstudents and their parents in Arizona sued the state for violating the Equal\n\nEducational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires a state “to take\n\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by\n\nits students in its instructional programs.” Id. at 438–39. After a trial, the district\n\ncourt concluded that “defendants were violating the EEOA because the amount of\n\nfunding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\ffunding) was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs\n\nof ELL instruction.” Id. at 441.\n\n       Over the next several years, the district court entered various additional orders\n\nand injunctions aimed at improving the state’s ELL incremental funding. Id. For\n\ninstance, the court ordered the state to “prepare a cost study to establish the proper\n\nappropriation to effectively implement ELL programs.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). And it later required the state to, within ninety days of the order’s issuance,\n\n“appropriately and constitutionally fund the state’s ELL programs taking into account\n\nthe [court’s] previous orders.” Id. After the state failed to comply with these orders,\n\nthe district court held the state in contempt and imposed a fine for every day until the\n\nstate came into compliance. Id. at 442.\n\n       After accruing over $20 million in fines, the state legislature passed HB 2064,\n\na bill that was designed “to implement a permanent funding solution to the problems\n\nidentified” by the district court. Id. The Governor allowed HB 2064 to become law\n\nwithout her signature, and the state presented it to the district court for approval. Id.\n\nat 443. Because the Governor did not approve of HB 2064’s funding provisions, two\n\nmembers of the state legislature intervened to support the bill. Id. Intervenors then\n\nmoved to “purge” the district court’s contempt order in light of HB 2064 and, in the\n\nalternative, for relief under Rule 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances. Id. The\n\ndistrict court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion because HB 2064 “did not establish a\n\nfunding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all\n\nelements of ELL instruction.” Id. at 444 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\n                                            33\n\fNinth Circuit affirmed, stating that “relief would be appropriate only if petitioners\n\nhad shown either that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL\n\nprograms in Arizona or that Arizona had altered its funding model.” Id. at 445\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed. The Court first reiterated that a party may move\n\nto modify or vacate an order under Rule 60(b)(5) if “‘a significant change either in\n\nfactual conditions or in law’ renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the public\n\ninterest.’” Id. at 447 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384). “[O]nce a party carries this\n\nburden, a court abuses its discretion when it refuses to modify an injunction or\n\nconsent decree in light of such changes.” Id. at 447–49 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       The Court then stressed that Rule 60(b)(5) serves an important function in\n\ninstitutional reform litigation for three reasons. Id. First, injunctions and consent\n\ndecrees in such cases often remain in place for many years, “and the passage of time\n\nfrequently brings about changed circumstances” (e.g., “changes in the nature of the\n\nunderlying problem” and “new policy insights”) “that warrant reexamination of the\n\noriginal judgment.” Id. at 448. Second, injunctions and decrees in reform cases tend\n\nto “raise sensitive federalism concerns” because such cases often “involve[] areas of\n\ncore state responsibility.” Id. And those federalism concerns “are heightened when\n\n. . . a federal court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.”\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f      Recognizing that states have limited resources, the Court expressed sensitivity\n\ntoward the fact that “[w]hen a federal court orders that money be appropriated for\n\none program, the effect is often to take funds away from other important programs.”\n\nId. Third, seemingly endless injunctions and decrees in these types of cases\n\ncommonly “bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their\n\npredecessors and may thereby ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated\n\nlegislative and executive powers.’” Id. at 449 (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441).\n\nSuccessor officials may bring new insights and solutions to ongoing “problems of\n\nallocating revenues and resources,” but overbroad or outdated decrees may inhibit\n\ntheir ability to respond to those problems and fulfill their duties as democratically-\n\nelected officials. Id. In sum, a long-lasting and unmodified consent decree not only\n\nraises serious federalism concerns but it may also restrain the opportunities for the\n\nclass protected by the decree because an overbroad and unyielding decree limits\n\nfinancial resources available to governments for the implementation of new\n\ninnovations and policies that may serve the needs of the protected class better than\n\nthe requirements embodied in the decree.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, courts must take a flexible approach to motions\n\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) where the moving party seeks relief from a long-lasting decree.\n\nId. at 450. This flexible approach “seeks to return control to state and local officials\n\nas soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied.” Id. at 451. To that end,\n\ncourts must be wary “that ‘federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are\n\naimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate federal law or does not flow\n\n                                           35\n\ffrom such a violation.’” Id. at 450 (quoting Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282). “‘If a federal\n\nconsent decree is not limited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal\n\nlaw,’ it may ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and\n\nexecutive powers.’” Id. (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441).\n\n      Accordingly, “a critical question in [the] Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the\n\nobjective of the [challenged decree] has been achieved.” Id. (citing Frew, 540 U.S. at\n\n442). “If a durable remedy has been implemented, continued enforcement of the\n\norder is not only unnecessary, but improper.” Id. (citing Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282).\n\n      Applying these standards, the Court in Horne concluded that the Ninth Circuit\n\nerred in two ways. First, instead of applying a flexible approach, the Ninth Circuit\n\n“used a heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to federalism concerns.”\n\nId. at 451. Based on the federalism concerns, application of a flexible approach was\n\n“critical.” Id. at 452. The Court instructed that application of the flexible approach\n\nrequires that “‘[w]hen the objects of the decree have been attained’—namely, when\n\n[compliance with federal law] has been achieved—‘responsibility for discharging the\n\nState’s obligations must be returned to the State and its officials.’” Id. (quoting Frew,\n\n540 U.S. at 442).\n\n      Second, the Court held that instead of “inquiring broadly into whether changed\n\nconditions in [the schools] provided evidence of an ELL program that complied with\n\nthe EEOA,” id. at 451, the Ninth Circuit performed an inquiry that was “too narrow,”\n\n“focus[ing] almost exclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding,” id. at 452.\n\nBut the narrow inquiry—focusing on whether a prior judgment has been satisfied—\n\n                                           36\n\faddresses only one of the bases for relief under Rule 60(b)(5) and fails to consider\n\nwhether relief is warranted because “applying [a judgment] prospectively is no longer\n\nequitable.” Id. at 454. For purposes of the equity basis for modification, the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s narrow inquiry also overlooked the possibility that specific items in an\n\ninitial decree may, with the passage of time and changing circumstances, no longer\n\nbe the only way, or even the best way, to attain the objects of the decree and assure\n\ncompliance with federal law. See id. at 447–48, 451–54.\n\n      To determine whether relief was proper under the equity basis for\n\nmodification, the Ninth Circuit “needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of\n\nthe original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law.” Id. at 454\n\n(citing Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282); see also id. at 468 (repeating that a proper Rule\n\n60(b)(5) inquiry should ask whether the school district “is now providing equal\n\neducational opportunities to ELL students”).\n\n      The Court explained that while the Ninth Circuit focused on ELL incremental\n\nfunding, “funding is simply a means [of complying with the EEOA], not the end\n\n(here, the EEOA).” Id. at 454–55. By requiring the state “to demonstrate ‘appropriate\n\naction’ [mandated by the EEOA] through a particular funding mechanism, the Court\n\nof Appeals improperly substituted its own educational and budgetary policy\n\njudgments for those of the state and local officials to whom such decisions are\n\nproperly entrusted.” Id. at 455. Stated otherwise, the Ninth Circuit should have\n\n“consider[ed] the broader question whether, as a result of important changes during\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\fthe intervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation under the EEOA by other\n\nmeans.” Id. at 439.\n\n      The Court then remanded for the district court to make “up-to-date” findings\n\nand to consider whether four changed circumstances advanced by the defendants\n\nwarranted releasing the state from the earlier judgment. See id. at 469–70.\n\n        d.   Applicability of Horne & Tension between Horne and Rufo\n\n      As opposed to the present case that features a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking a\n\nmodification of a consent decree, Horne involved a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking a\n\nmodification of a court-issued injunction, as well as additional orders crafted by the\n\ndistrict court. See id. at 441. Lower courts have reached different conclusions\n\nregarding the force of Horne in the context of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking\n\nmodification of a consent decree. See Burt v. Cty. of Contra Costa, 2014 WL 253010,\n\nat *18–19 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2014) (discussing opposing conclusions by district\n\ncourts that have analyzed extent of Horne’s applicability to consent decrees); see also\n\nEvans v. Fenty, 701 F. Supp. 2d 126, 165–67, 170–71 (D.D.C. 2010) (questioning\n\napplicability of Horne to modification of consent decree and relying primarily on\n\ninquiry established in Rufo and Frew when evaluating propriety of enforcement\n\nbeyond minimum requirements of federal law). The Sixth Circuit, however, did not\n\nexpress any hesitation regarding applying Horne to a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking\n\nmodification of a consent decree. See John B., 710 F.3d at 411–14. In fact, the Sixth\n\nCircuit, in John B., concluded that where a defendant subject to a consent decree in\n\ninstitutional reform litigation has implemented a durable remedy to cure the federal\n\n                                          38\n\fviolation underlying the decree, Horne’s admonition that continued enforcement of\n\nthe decree is “improper” controls and requires vacatur of the consent decree. Id. at\n\n411–13.\n\n      Three considerations compel us to join the Sixth Circuit’s apparent conclusion\n\nthat Horne fully applies to a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking modification of a consent\n\ndecree. First, while the parties may form the essential terms of a consent decree, as\n\nwe noted earlier when discussing our jurisdiction over this appeal, a district court’s\n\norder approving the consent decree is tantamount to a final judgment on the merits.\n\nSee supra 22 (citing Johnson, 393 F.3d 1096, 1101 (10th Cir. 2004)).\n\n      Second, when discussing the proper inquiries for evaluating a Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion in institutional reform litigation, Horne uses “consent decree” or “decree”\n\ninterchangeably with injunction and court order even though Horne involved\n\nrequested modifications to an injunction and several court orders but did not involve\n\na consent decree. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 448–50. From this, we glean that the Court\n\nconsiders a consent decree and an injunctive order equivalent for purposes of\n\nevaluating a Rule 60(b)(5) motion for modification. And had the Court intended to\n\nlimit Horne to institutional reform litigation involving only injunctions and court\n\ncrafted orders, it could have easily done so explicitly. The Court, however, did not so\n\nlimit its holding, and the plain language of Horne supports the conclusion that the\n\ndecision applies with equal force to all institutional reform cases, including those\n\ncases featuring consent decrees.\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\f       Third, the same federalism concerns at the heart of Horne are present in\n\ninstitutional reform cases featuring consent decrees. Admittedly, the acquiescence of\n\nstate or local governmental officials to the terms of a consent decree might diminish\n\nfederalism concerns at the inception of the decree. But where, as here, a consent\n\ndecree remains in effect for decades, enforcement of the decree necessarily interjects\n\na federal court into local affairs and binds local governmental officials who were not\n\nparties to the consent decree. The federal court, thereby, effectively limits the\n\ndemocratic process by restricting the array of resources available to the governmental\n\nofficials for the enactment of other policies.\n\n       Applying Horne to Rule 60(b)(5) motions for modifications to consent decrees\n\ndoes not come without complication. Notably, an apparent tension exists between\n\nHorne and Rufo with respect to the appropriate course of action where a party\n\nseeking modification has brought itself into compliance with federal law but has not\n\nsubstantially complied with the specific terms of the consent decree or court order.\n\nCompare Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (“If a durable remedy [addressing the federal law\n\nviolation] has been implemented, continued enforcement of the order is not only\n\nunnecessary, but improper.”), with Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391 (“A proposed modification\n\nshould not strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the constitutional\n\nfloor.”).\n\n       To the extent Rufo and Horne differ as to the appropriate course of action\n\nwhen a party seeks a Rule 60(b)(5) modification to an order in an institutional reform\n\ncase, two considerations cause us to follow the course outlined in Horne when the\n\n                                           40\n\fsignificant change advanced as the basis for Rule 60(b)(5) modification is the\n\ndefendant’s alleged ongoing compliance with federal law. First, Rufo involved a\n\nproposed modification to a plan that, if faithfully implemented over time, would\n\neventually cure the federal law violation. See id. at 376 (describing requested\n\nmodification at issue as allowing for some double bunking in new facility yet to be\n\ncompleted or opened). As such, unlike in Horne where the defendants alleged that\n\nthey had remedied the federal law violation, the defendants in Rufo had not yet\n\nremedied the issues with overcrowding and neglect in maintaining the jail that gave\n\nrise to the litigation. And, where the Rufo defendants had not remedied the issues\n\ngiving rise to the litigation, it naturally follows that the Rufo defendants, unlike the\n\nHorne defendants, were not in a position to establish the implementation of a durable\n\nremedy. Further, nothing in Rufo suggests that the proposed modification would\n\nequate with, or for that matter exceed, the constitutional floor. Thus, while Rufo is\n\nundoubtedly informative on many issues surrounding the Rule 60(b)(5) standard for\n\nmodifying a consent decree, its statement about not striving to modify a consent\n\ndecree to the constitutional floor is not germane to its decision.\n\n       Second, Horne represents the Court’s most recent proclamation regarding the\n\nstandard for obtaining a modification to an order in institutional reform litigation.\n\nAnd, as noted by scholars, Horne is the latest ruling in a trend of decisions that lower\n\nthe threshold for defendants to obtain a modification to, or the dissolution of, orders\n\nin long-lasting institutional reform cases. Jason Parkin, Aging Injunctions & the\n\nLegacy of Institutional Reform Litigation, 70 Vand. L. Rev. 167, 193–94 & n.136\n\n                                            41\n\f(2017) (citing Catherine Y. Kim, Changed Circumstances: The Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure and the Future of Institutional Reform Litigation After Horne v. Flores, 46\n\nU.C. Davis L. Rev. 1435, 1466 (2013), and Mark Kelley, Note, Saving 60(b)(5): The\n\nFuture of Institutional Reform Litigation, 125 Yale L.J. 272, 307 (2015)).\n\n      As we read Horne, if a party seeking modification to a consent decree\n\ndemonstrates a significant change in circumstances, the district court must take a\n\nflexible approach and consider whether the moving party has implemented a durable\n\nremedy to cure the federal law violation underlying the institutional reform litigation.\n\nSee John B., 710 F.3d at 412 (“In applying this flexible approach, we must answer\n\ntwo questions: first whether the state has achieved compliance with the federal-law\n\nprovisions whose violation the decree sought to remedy; and second, whether the\n\nState would continue that compliance in the absence of continued judicial\n\nsupervision.”); see also Petties ex rel. Martin v. District of Columbia, 662 F.3d 564,\n\n569, 571 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (applying Horne’s statement that district court “ought to\n\nhave ‘applied a flexible standard that seeks to return control to state and local\n\nofficials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied’” to context of\n\nrequested modification to preliminary injunction (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 450–\n\n51)). The district court, by way of its role in overseeing the institutional reform\n\nlitigation for many years, is in the best position to evaluate both whether a party has\n\ncomplied with federal law and, if so, whether the party is committed to ongoing\n\ncompliance with federal law in the absence of oversight by the federal court. See\n\nPetties, 662 F.3d at 571 (recognizing that district court’s management of litigation\n\n                                           42\n\f“for many years” places district court in position to assess likelihood of compliance\n\nwith federal law absent oversight). Likewise, the district court is also in the best\n\nposition to assess whether the litigation has taken on a life of its own and now\n\nadvances a purpose removed from remedying the initial violation(s) or whether\n\ncontinued oversight remains necessary to ensure compliance with federal law.\n\n      Finally, we note that when applying the flexible approach and evaluating\n\nwhether a moving party implemented a durable remedy, a district court must consider\n\nthe totality of the moving party’s efforts to demonstrate sustained compliance with\n\nfederal law. In this respect, there is not a single path, such as the adoption of new\n\nlegislation, by which a party can demonstrate the implementation of a durable\n\nremedy. See id., 662 F.3d at 569–71 (remanding for determination of whether\n\nadoption of new internal policies, coupled with improved record of compliance with\n\nfederal law, satisfied durable remedy requirement). Several of the desegregation\n\ncases, although arguably not directly on point, highlight the broad inquiry a district\n\ncourt must undertake when determining a party’s commitment to abiding by federal\n\nlaw. Specifically, factors that a district court may consider include the party’s\n\ncommitment to compliance, the duration of the party’s compliance with federal law,\n\nand whether or not the effects of the violation of federal law persist. See Freeman v.\n\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490 (1992) (holding that the district court may relinquish\n\ndesegregation control in incremental stages, and stating that: “one of the prerequisites\n\nto relinquishment of control in whole or in part is that a school district has\n\ndemonstrated its commitment to a course of action that gives full respect to the equal\n\n                                           43\n\fprotection guarantees of the Constitution”); id. at 491 (listing relevant factors in\n\ndetermining whether partial withdrawal of federal desegregation oversight is\n\nappropriate as including whether the school district has demonstrated “its good-faith\n\ncommitment to the whole of the court’s decree and to those provisions of the law and\n\nthe Constitution that were the predicate for the judicial intervention in the first\n\ninstance”); Bd. of Educ. of Oklahoma City Pub. Sch. v, Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249–50\n\n(1991) (stating that “[t]he district court should address itself to whether the Board\n\nhad complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and\n\nwhether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated to the extent\n\npracticable” while also considering the lengthy period of time during which the\n\nBoard complied with the federal court’s oversight).\n\n      e.     Summary\n\n      From the foregoing discussion of Rufo, Horne, and other institutional reform\n\nlitigation cases, several principles emerge that are critical to our analysis of whether\n\nDefendants are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5).\n\n      First, a motion for relief from a consent decree based on an assertion that\n\n“applying it prospectively is no longer equitable” demands a different focus than a\n\nmotion based on an assertion that “the judgment has been satisfied, released or\n\ndischarged.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5); Horne, 557 U.S. at 454. With respect to the\n\nlatter ground for relief, it is appropriate for a court to focus on whether the movant\n\nhas satisfied each obligation set forth in the consent decree. But where, as here, the\n\nmovant contends that changed circumstances have rendered further enforcement of\n\n                                            44\n\fthe consent decree no longer equitable, the inquiry is whether the movant has shown\n\n(a) that a significant change in factual circumstances or in law warrants revision of\n\nthe decree, and (b) that the requested modification is suitably tailored to the changed\n\ncircumstance. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383–84, 391. A movant may establish that changed\n\nfactual circumstances warrant modification when (i) the changed circumstances\n\n“make compliance with the decree substantially more onerous,” (ii) a “decree proves\n\nto be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,” or (iii) “enforcement of the\n\ndecree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest.” Id. at 384.\n\nIt is an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a motion for modification\n\nwhere the moving party meets this burden. Horne, 557 U.S. at 447.\n\n      Second, a flexible approach to evaluating the equities of such a motion is\n\ncrucial where, as in this case, institutional reform is sought. Horne, 557 U.S. at 450;\n\nRufo, 502 U.S. at 380–81. Consent decrees in reform cases often remain in effect for\n\nextended periods, thereby increasing the prospect that a significant change in factual\n\ncircumstances will occur. Horne, 557 U.S. at 447–48; Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380. Consent\n\ndecrees also tend to restrict state and local officials’ ability to implement new ideas\n\nto old problems. Horne, 557 U.S. at 449; Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381. And they raise\n\nsensitive federalism concerns that are heightened when a decree effectively dictates\n\nstate or local budget priorities. Horne, 557 U.S. at 448.\n\n      Third, when a party seeks termination or vacatur of a consent decree based on\n\nthe inequity of continued oversight, a court must determine not only whether changed\n\ncircumstances exist, but also whether the “objective” of the decree—that is, whether\n\n                                           45\n\fcompliance with federal law—has been attained. See id. at 450 (noting that “a critical\n\nquestion in [the] Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the District Court’s\n\n[initial] order—i.e., satisfaction of the EEOA’s ‘appropriate action’ standard—has\n\nbeen achieved” (emphasis added) (citing Frew, 540 U.S. at 442)); id. at 454\n\n(concluding that the Ninth Circuit “needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement\n\nof the original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law” (emphasis\n\nadded) (citing Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282)); id. at 468 (reiterating that the Ninth\n\nCircuit should have asked whether the school district was meeting the EEOA’s\n\n“appropriate action” requirement); see also Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282 (explaining that\n\na decree must be “tailored to cure the condition that offends” federal law and seek to\n\nrestore victims of unlawful conduct to the position they would have occupied absent\n\nthe unlawful conduct (internal quotation marks omitted)); John B., 710 F.3d at 411\n\n(stating that a court considering a Rule 60(b)(5) motion “must determine whether\n\n‘ongoing enforcement of the original order [is] supported by an ongoing violation of\n\nfederal law’” (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at\n\n454)); Washington, 573 F.3d at 710 (interpreting Horne and Rufo as requiring a court\n\nto “consider whether the purpose of the decree” has been achieved). So where the\n\nbasis of the Rule 60(b)(5) motion is that continued enforcement of the decree is no\n\nlonger equitable, instead of inquiring narrowly whether the specific obligations of a\n\nconsent decree have been attained, the court must broadly inquire whether the party\n\nobligated by the decree is at that time in compliance with federal law. Horne, 557\n\nU.S. at 451–52; see also id. at 439 (stating that the lower courts needed to ask the\n\n                                           46\n\fbroader question whether the state “was fulfilling its obligation under the EEOA by\n\nother means”). And once compliance with federal law has been attained, a court must\n\nreturn control over the program to the state and its officials, provided a durable\n\nremedy is in place. See id. at 452 (“‘When the objects of the decree have been\n\nattained’—namely, when EEOA compliance has been achieved—‘responsibility for\n\ndischarging the State’s obligations [must be] returned promptly to the State and its\n\nofficials.’” (alteration in original) (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 442)); see also Frew,\n\n540 U.S. at 442 (“The federal court must exercise its equitable powers to ensure that\n\nwhen the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the\n\nState’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.” (emphasis\n\nadded)); Washington, 573 F.3d at 709 (“The Constitution does not establish the\n\ndistrict courts as permanent administrative agencies.”).\n\n      Last, the existence of a durable remedy may warrant disengagement of judicial\n\noversight. The Horne Court’s single reference to a durable remedy states:\n\n      [A] critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the\n      objective of the District Court’s [initial] order—i.e., satisfaction of the\n      EEOA’s “appropriate action” standard—has been achieved. See [Frew,]\n      540 U.S. at 442. If a durable remedy has been implemented, continued\n      enforcement of the order is not only unnecessary, but improper. See\n      Milliken, [433 U.S.] at 282.\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 450. From the latter sentence, it is fair to conclude that if a\n\ndurable remedy is in place, then the movant has attained the more-general objects of\n\nthe decree—i.e., compliance with federal law. We interpret the Court’s reference to a\n\n“durable remedy” as recognition that fleeting federal compliance is insufficient to\n\n\n                                           47\n\fwarrant relief. Thus, a district court, in assessing whether further oversight is\n\nequitable, may and should consider the totality of defendants’ efforts to comply with\n\nfederal law and defendants’ commitment to remaining in compliance with federal\n\nlaw. Such is the approach adopted by two of our sister circuits subsequent to Horne.\n\nSee supra 41-43 (discussing application of Horne’s durable remedy language in John\n\nB., 710 F.3d 391 and Petties, 662 F.3d 564).\n\n      And like our sister circuits, we do not read the language in Horne too\n\nrestrictively with respect to what may constitute a durable remedy. The Court has\n\nadmonished against taking language from its opinions out of context and giving it\n\n“talismanic quality.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380. Recall that, in Rufo, the district court\n\ndenied modification of the consent decree because the state defendants had failed to\n\nmeet the “clear showing of grievous wrong” evoked by the Court in United States v.\n\nSwift & Co., 286 U.S. 106 (1932). Rufo, 502 U.S. at 377. The Court acknowledged\n\nthat the “grievous wrong” language used in Swift, if “[r]ead out of context,”\n\n“suggests a ‘hardening’ of the traditional flexible standard for modification of\n\nconsent decrees.” Id. at 379. It explained, however, that such a reading would be\n\ninconsistent with Rule 60(b)(5): “That Rule, in providing that, on such terms as are\n\njust, a party may be relieved from a final judgment or decree where it is no longer\n\nequitable that the judgment have prospective application, permits a less stringent,\n\nmore flexible standard.” Id. at 380. A similarly cautious reading of the “durable\n\nremedy” language in Horne is appropriate here.\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f      When a Rule 60(b)(5) movant has established both the absence of an ongoing\n\nviolation of federal law and a future commitment to remain in compliance with\n\nfederal law, federalism concerns should inform a court’s flexible determination as to\n\nhow a consent decree will be modified. Rule 60(b)(5) dictates as much. See Rufo, 502\n\nU.S. at 380. Accordingly, there is no one way for a movant to show that its federal\n\ncompliance is more than fleeting. For example, a movant may establish its\n\ncommitment to future compliance through the adoption of a durable remedy—such as\n\na statute designed to cure the specific federal violation. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 450.\n\nA movant may also establish its commitment to future compliance through a record\n\nof sustained good-faith efforts to remedy federal violations and, to the extent\n\npossible, eliminate the vestiges of the federal violation. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n490, 498; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248–49. Ultimately, the district court’s wealth of\n\nexperience overseeing the litigation should inform its assessment of whether the\n\nDefendants are now in compliance with federal law, and whether they are committed\n\nto remaining in compliance.6\n\n      In summation, if Defendants here can show they are no longer violating the\n\nclass members’ federal rights, and the district court has reason to believe Defendants’\n\ncompliance with federal law is durable, then “continued enforcement of the District\n\nCourt’s original order[s] is inequitable within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5), and\n\nrelief is warranted.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 470; see also John B., 710 F.3d at 413;\n\n      6\n        Here, the district court has been involved with this case for three decades. It\nhas personal knowledge of the efforts by the Defendants to meet their obligations and\nthe complexity involved in setting compliance measures.\n                                          49\n\fPetties, 662 F.3d at 570-71. To require more under those circumstances would raise\n\nserious federalism concerns. It also would conflict with the Supreme Court’s\n\nadmonition that a federal consent decree should do no more than remedy a condition\n\nthat violates federal law. Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282. Once the offending condition has\n\nbeen cured, the Court has instructed that responsibility over the state program must\n\nbe returned promptly to the state and its officials. Frew, 540 U.S. at 442; see also\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 450–51 (stating the flexible standard under Rule 60(b)(5) “seeks\n\nto return control to state and local officials as soon as a violation of federal law has\n\nbeen remedied”). And in weighing the equities, the district court should avoid\n\nimposing an inflexible standard that risks depriving future officials of their\n\nlegislative and executive powers. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 449. After all, such\n\ninflexibility is unnecessary to protect the federal interests at the heart of the\n\ninstitutional reform litigation. If the state again violates federal law, victims may file\n\na new lawsuit to bring the state back into compliance. Elected officials may also be\n\nheld accountable to the citizenry through the political process. For all of these\n\nreasons, we conclude that Defendants may satisfy the durability required by Horne in\n\na number of ways, including: by taking specific, long-term actions aimed at curing\n\nthe federal violations, by making good faith efforts to obtain compliance, or by\n\noperating in conformity with federal law for a reasonable period of time.\n\n3.     Application\n\n       Since this case’s inception, the district court has expended considerable effort\n\nand displayed exceptional skill resolving the numerous issues that have arisen.\n\n                                            50\n\fDespite this fine stewardship, two aspects of the ruling on Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion require us to vacate the June 2016 order and to remand for further\n\nproceedings in the district court.\n\n       First, the district court’s determination that there are no changed circumstances\n\nappears to be inconsistent with its factual findings. Defendants maintain that changed\n\nfactual circumstances warrant relief, including that (a) their obligations have\n\nincreased in number and complexity to the point the obligations have become\n\nsubstantially onerous, (b) they remedied the constitutional violations giving rise to\n\nthis litigation and are in compliance with federal law, and (c) increased costs to\n\nlitigate this case and to provide services to class members have inhibited the State’s\n\nability to fund other important programs such that continued enforcement of the\n\ndecree is contrary to the public interest.\n\n       Although the district court concluded that Defendants “have not presented\n\nsufficient changed circumstances . . . to warrant the requested relief,” Jackson III,\n\n2016 WL 9777237, at *17, the court seemingly endorsed Defendants’ argument that\n\ntheir “task ha[d] become incomprehensible, if not insurmountable,” and recognized\n\nthat their outstanding obligations “are onerous,” id. at *14.7 The court also\n\n\n       7\n         Defendants may have anticipated at the time they entered into the pertinent\ndecrees that the number and complexity of obligations would substantially increase.\nAfter all, their obligations did not become onerous as a result of changed factual\ncircumstances occurring after they entered into the decrees—it was the act of\nentering into the decrees itself that multiplied their obligations. On remand, if the\ndistrict court finds that Defendants anticipated that their obligations would\nsubstantially increase in number and complexity, Defendants would have to “satisfy a\nheavy burden to convince [the] court that [they] agreed to the decree[s] in good faith,\n                                             51\n\facknowledged that the “increasing fees and costs associated with this litigation are\n\ndetrimental to the State’s interest,” that “more than 25 years of orders and\n\nstipulations have restricted the State’s ability to make basic decisions concerning its\n\nbudget,” and that “it is doubtful that the outlay of over 5 million dollars of attorney’s\n\nfees and costs every year is directly assisting” class members. Id. at *16. Indeed, the\n\ndistrict court noted that Defendants have spent more than $50 million related to this\n\nlitigation in the last decade, id. at *12, and that, as of 2009, the average yearly costs\n\nto provide services to class members had risen from $67,290.00 to $135,535.000 per\n\nclass member, while the State’s $32,992.00 per capita income was the ninth lowest in\n\nthe nation, id. at *13.\n\n       Despite accepting these facts advanced by Defendants, the district court\n\nconcluded, without adequate explanation, that the facts did not amount to a\n\nsignificant change in circumstances. But the district court’s conclusion that the\n\nobligations on the Defendants are “onerous” suggests Defendants established a\n\nsignificant change in circumstances under Rufo’s first two prongs for showing a\n\nchange in facts warranting modification—that “changed factual conditions make\n\ncompliance with the decree substantially more onerous” and that “a decree proves to\n\nbe unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles.” See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384.\n\nSimilarly, the district court’s findings concerning the increased fees and costs, and\n\nhow they have restricted the State’s ability to make decisions about its budget,\n\n\nmade a reasonable effort to comply with the decree[s], and should be relieved of the\nundertaking under Rule 60(b).” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 385.\n                                            52\n\fsuggest that continued enforcement of the decrees is detrimental to the public\n\ninterest. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 447 (explaining that Rule 60(b)(5) “provides a means\n\nby which a party can ask a court to . . . vacate a judgment or order if a significant\n\nchange either in factual conditions or in law renders continued enforcement\n\ndetrimental to the public interest” (internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 448 (“A\n\nstructural reform decree eviscerates a State’s discretionary authority over its own\n\nprogram and budgets and forces state officials to reallocate state resources and\n\nfunds[.]” (quoting Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 131 (1995) (Thomas, J.,\n\nconcurring))); id. at 454 (recognizing that a decree is detrimental to the public\n\ninterest when it risks “improperly interfer[ing] with a State’s democratic process”);\n\nid. at 459 (concluding that the district court’s imposition of heavy fines on the state\n\n“unquestionably imposed important restrictions on the legislature’s ability to set\n\nbudget priorities”); Small v. Hunt, 98 F.3d 789, 796 (4th Cir. 1996) (stating in a Rule\n\n60(b)(5) case that the public “has an interest in how its tax dollars are spent”). We\n\nremand for further explanation of why these facts do not constitute a significant\n\nchange in circumstances.8\n\n\n      8\n         To be sure, the district court questioned the timing of the changes relative to\nthe Defendants’ pending, August 25, 2015, Rule 60(b)(5) motion. This explanation,\nhowever, may not justify rejecting the conclusion that a significant change in\ncircumstances occurred where (1) Defendants filed a Rule 60(b)(5) motion in 2011\nthat the district court terminated without ruling on the merits of the motion and (2)\nthe district court made no reference to the requirement in Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1) that\na Rule 60(b) motion be “made within a reasonable time.” Of course, on remand, the\ndistrict court is free to perform a Rule 60(c)(1) timeliness analysis and conclude that,\neven in light of the 2011 Rule 60(b)(5) motion, Defendants did not seek relief\n“within a reasonable time” of the change in circumstances upon which they rely.\n                                           53\n\f       Second, federalism concerns are heightened here because the decrees and the\n\ncourt’s continued oversight have “the effect of dictating state . . . budget priorities.”\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 448. Despite acknowledging the federalism concerns at play,\n\nincluding the lengthy duration of federal oversight and the budgetary constraints\n\nresulting from continued federal oversight, the district court did not apply the flexible\n\napproach called for by Horne. Under the flexible approach, the district court needed\n\nto inquire whether “the objects of the decree[s] have been attained.” Id. at 452\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court purported to engage in this analysis,\n\nstating that the objects—or “essential purposes”—of the pertinent decrees “are to\n\nprovide class members with adequate health care, a reasonably safe environment, and\n\nsupported employment opportunities.” Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *14. The\n\ncourt then noted that these “more specific” essential purposes are encompassed in the\n\nobligations provided in the pertinent decrees. Id. And because Defendants conceded\n\nthey have not substantially complied with many of those decree obligations, the court\n\ndetermined that Defendants “have not fulfilled the essential purposes of the pertinent\n\ndecrees.” Id.\n\n       Like the Ninth Circuit’s analysis in Horne, the district court’s analysis on this\n\npoint was too narrow, focusing almost entirely on whether defendants had fulfilled\n\nthe numerous, detailed obligations provided in the consent decrees. But because\n\nDefendants move on the ground that continued enforcement of the consent decrees is\n\nno longer equitable, the district court should have “ascertain[ed] whether ongoing\n\nenforcement of the [decrees] was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law,”\n\n                                            54\n\fsee Horne, 557 U.S. at 454—here, whether Defendants are violating class members’\n\nrights under the substantive due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nand under the Rehabilitation Act. The court explicitly declined to make this\n\ndetermination, stating it “is not in the position to assess, and, therefore, cannot\n\nconclude that Defendants are no longer violating constitutional or federal law.”\n\nJackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *16. In declining to make this finding, the district\n\ncourt failed to perform an inquiry that we, in accord with both the Sixth Circuit and\n\nthe D.C. Circuit, conclude that Horne requires. See Ohlander, 114 F.3d at 1537 (“A\n\nclear example of an abuse of discretion exists where the trial court fails to consider\n\nthe applicable legal standard[.]”).9\n\n      The district court appears to have focused on whether Defendants substantially\n\ncomplied with the decree obligations, as well as an overly narrow view of the objects\n\nof the consent decree. Substantial compliance with all the obligations in the pertinent\n\ndecrees would likely place New Mexico in compliance with federal law. But the\n\nobligations are merely a means of accomplishing that goal, not the end. See Horne,\n\n557 U.S. at 454–55. On remand, the court should consider the broader question of\n\nwhether the State is meeting the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the\n\nRehabilitation Act by means other than those stated in the consent decrees. See id. at\n\n439. To be sure, the court concluded that “Defendants have not shown that they have\n\nfulfilled their outstanding obligations, ‘by other means.’” Jackson III, 2016 WL\n\n      9\n       The burden of showing compliance with federal law is, of course, on the\nDefendants.\n\n                                            55\n\f9777237, at *17 (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 439). But the court seemingly focused\n\non whether Defendants have fulfilled their decree obligations by other means, instead\n\nof focusing on the broader question of whether Defendants have fulfilled their\n\nfederal-law obligations to class members by means other than those provided in the\n\ndecrees.10 Such an inquiry is critical not only to determining whether Defendants are\n\nin current compliance with federal law, but also to analyzing whether their\n\ncompliance is durable. In other words, an inquiry into whether Defendants are\n\ncurrently in compliance with federal law is a necessary predicate to any inquiry into\n\nwhether that compliance is more than merely fleeting. Unless the court properly\n\nfocuses its inquiry on compliance with federal law, it cannot analyze whether any\n\nremedy adopted by the state will be effective to maintain such compliance. In turn,\n\nwithout analyzing whether Defendants are in compliance with federal law and, if so,\n\nwhether they are likely to maintain compliance with federal law absent continued\n\noversight, the district court was not in a proper analytical position to determine\n\nwhether Defendants’ proposed modification of terminating the consent decrees was\n\nproperly tailored to any significant change in circumstances. Thus, after first deciding\n\n      10\n          The district court also justified its ruling based on its finding that the\nobligations set forth in the JSD, the Plan of Action, and Appendix A “all flowed from\n[its] original findings of violations in 1990.” Jackson III, 2016 WL 9777237, at *15.\nAccepting this finding as true, all it shows is those decrees do not exceed appropriate\nlimits of a federal-court decree. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (stating that “federal-\ncourt decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition\nthat does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation” (quoting\nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 282 (1977))). But even a decree that is within\nappropriate bounds may be vacated where changed circumstances make prospective\nenforcement of the decree no longer equitable and where the movant has attained\ncompliance with federal law.\n                                           56\n\fwhether New Mexico is now in compliance with federal law, the district court should\n\nassess whether that compliance is durable, or whether the proposed modification is\n\nnot properly tailored to any change in circumstances because equity weighs in favor\n\nof further federal oversight to assure the protection of the class members’ federal\n\nrights.\n\n          In sum, due to the public interests and federalism concerns, continued\n\nenforcement of the consent decrees is warranted only to the extent Defendants are in\n\ncurrent violation of federal law or have reached only fleeting compliance. We remand\n\nso the district court can make up-to-date findings and determine whether Defendants\n\nare currently violating class members’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act. On remand, the district court should conduct the necessary\n\nproceedings to develop a record that would allow it to make this determination. If the\n\ncourt then concludes Defendants are not violating class members’ rights under\n\nfederal law, the court should assess the durability of that compliance. In the event\n\nthat Defendants have implemented a durable remedy, the court should next address\n\nwhether vacatur of all pertinent orders and termination of this case is appropriate.\n\n                                    III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          We VACATE the district court’s June 2016 Order and REMAND so the court can\n\nmake appropriate findings and conclusions and then reassess the equities under Rule\n\n60(b) with the benefit of those findings and conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\f",

After a lengthy trial in 1990, the\n\ndistrict court ruled that Defendants—the two institutions and the individuals charged\n\nwith their operation—were violating class members’ federal constitutional and\n\nstatutory rights. The district court ordered the parties to develop a plan to cure the\n\n\n                                            2\n\fviolations, and the plan was implemented over the ensuing years through several\n\nconsent decrees and other court-approved agreements (collectively, consent decrees).\n\nAlthough the two institutions closed in the 1990s, the district court has continued to\n\nmonitor whether Defendants are in compliance with the obligations set forth in those\n\nconsent decrees (decree obligations). And in the twenty-five years since the court’s\n\ninitial ruling, the parties have agreed to, and the court has approved, numerous\n\nadditional decree obligations of varying specificity with which Defendants must\n\ncomply before the court will discontinue its oversight. As of the district court’s most\n\nrecent order, Defendants had yet to fulfill over 300 decree obligations.\n\n      In August 2015, Defendants moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n60(b)(5) to vacate all consent decrees and to terminate the court’s oversight, arguing\n\nthat changed factual circumstances warrant the requested relief. The district court\n\ndenied the motion in June 2016. Defendants appealed. We vacate the 2016 Order and\n\nremand for the district court to decide whether Defendants are currently violating\n\nclass members’ federal constitutional or statutory rights and to reassess the equity of\n\ncontinuing federal oversight with the benefit of that determination.\n\n                               I.     BACKGROUND\n\n      To provide context for this dispute, we begin with an overview of the\n\nprocedural history of this multi-decade litigation. We then examine the district\n\ncourt’s ruling on Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion under the governing legal\n\nstandard.\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f                                A.     Litigation History\n\n       In July 1987, twenty-one developmentally disabled individuals brought this\n\nclass action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. In their\n\ncomplaint, Plaintiffs challenged the conditions of institutionalization at Fort Stanton\n\nHospital and Training School (Fort Stanton) and Los Lunas Hospital and Training\n\nSchool (Los Lunas), both of which were state-supported institutions for the\n\ndevelopmentally disabled in New Mexico.

Plaintiffs sought to correct the\n\nfederal constitutional and statutory deficiencies of the conditions at Fort Stanton and\n\nLos Lunas. Id. They also requested relief permitting developmentally disabled\n\npersons residing at the institutions to live in integrated family-like settings within the\n\ncommunity. Id.\n\n       In June 1988, the district court allowed more than 125 parents and guardians\n\nof residents at Fort Stanton and Los Lunas to intervene. Id. Like Plaintiffs,\n\nIntervenors sought to bring the conditions at the two institutions into compliance\n\nwith federal constitutional and statutory law. Id. But Intervenors opposed Plaintiffs’\n\nefforts to require mandatory transfer of the institutions’ residents to community-\n\nbased facilities. Id.\n\n       In June 1989, the district court certified a class of “all persons who at that time\n\nresided at [Fort Stanton] or [Los Lunas], all persons who would become residents of\n\nthe institutions during the pendency of the action, and all persons who had been\n\ntransferred from these two institutions to other facilities funded by [D]efendants.” Id.\n\n                                            4\n\f1.    The 1990 Order\n\n      After a prolonged trial, the district court issued, on December 28, 1990, an\n\nextensive Memorandum Opinion and Order (1990 Order). Jackson v.

In the 1990 Order, the court “made detailed findings\n\nof fact regarding almost every aspect of the conditions” at the two institutions,\n\nJackson II, 964 F.2d at 986, and determined that the conditions were statutorily and\n\nconstitutionally deficient in eighteen areas, Jackson I, 757 F. Supp. at 1315–16.1 The\n\ncourt concluded that Defendants were discriminating against class members in\n\nviolation of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by failing to provide adequate\n\naccommodations for severely handicapped residents capable of residing in a\n\ncommunity setting, while simultaneously serving less severely handicapped\n\nindividuals in the community. See id. at 1297–99; see also 29 U.S.C. § 794. And the\n\ncourt ruled that Defendants were violating class members’ substantive due process\n\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Youngberg v. Romeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1982). See Jackson I, 757 F. Supp. at 1305–13. Specifically, the court ruled that\n\n      1\n         The eighteen areas of deficiencies are: (1) individual program plans; (2)\nmedical records; (3) discharge plans; (4) data collection; (5) qualified mental\nretardation professional services; (6) behavior management; (7) use of physical\nrestraints; (8) prevention of abuse of residents; (9) reduction of accidents and injuries\nto residents; (10) reports of abuse, accidents, and injuries; (11) staff supervision; (12)\npreservice training of staff; (13) in-service training of staff; (14) sufficiency of\nprofessional staff; (15) adaptive equipment; (16) functional and chronologically age\nappropriate programming; (17) coordination between residential areas and training\nprogram areas; and (18) inadequate space in training program areas.

Id. at 1306–07, 1312.2\n\n      The district court ordered the parties to work together in good faith “to\n\nformulate by agreement a plan to correct” the eighteen areas of deficiencies at the\n\ntwo institutions. Id. at 1315. The court required the parties to formulate a “detailed\n\nwritten policy to be adopted by and followed at each institution,” to designate\n\npersons responsible at each institution for implementing the correction plans, to\n\ndescribe the “strategies to be adopted by each institution” in order to ensure\n\nsuccessful implementation of the correction plans, and to develop a “detailed\n\ntimetable establishing deadlines by which specific components of the correction plan\n\n\n      2\n        The district court further concluded that Defendants violated class members’\nsubstantive due process rights by “considering the present availability of community\nservices when determining whether to recommend the residents for community\nplacement.” Jackson v. Fort Stanton Hosp. & Training Sch. (Jackson II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583724\"><a href=\"/opinion/583724/jackson-v-fort-stanton-hospital-and-training-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 986 (10th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, the district court permanently enjoined\nDefendants “from permitting [Teams] to take into account the availability or lack of\navailability of community services in reaching a recommendation as to whether a\nresident should be served in the community.” Id. On appeal, we reversed this portion\nof the 1990 Order, holding that the district court erred in ruling that due process\nrequired Defendants be enjoined from permitting Teams to consider the availability\nof community services when making treatment decisions. Id. at 992.\n\n                                            6\n\ffor each deficiency will be achieved.” Id. at 1316. The court also set September 10,\n\n1991, as the deadline for “complete correction of all deficiencies.” Id. And the court\n\nrequired the parties to describe the “[m]eans of assuring continued compliance with\n\nappropriate standards after correction of the deficiencies has been achieved.” Id.\n\n         The court further ordered Defendants to prepare, by March 1, 1991, “a written\n\nplan of transfer to an appropriate community setting for each resident whose [Team]\n\nhas recommended placement in a community setting.” Id. at 1317. The court urged\n\nPlaintiffs to confer in good faith with Defendants to resolve any concerns Plaintiffs\n\nmay have with the proposed plans and to amend the plans accordingly. Id. at 1316–\n\n17. The court also afforded Plaintiffs the opportunity to “file with the court and serve\n\non [D]efendants a statement of any remaining objections they may have to, and their\n\nproposals for amending, any particular plan.” Id.\n\n         Over the next several years, the district court entered various remedial orders\n\nand continued to oversee enforcement of those orders.3 See Jackson v. Los Lunas Ctr.\n\n(Jackson III), No. CIV 87-839-JAP/KBM, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (D.N.M. June 14,\n\n2016).\n\n\n\n\n         3\n         In late 1993, Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint by interlineation to\nassert a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Plaintiffs’ proposed\nclaim asserted that Defendants violated the ADA by excluding class members with\ndisabilities from certain public programs and places of public accommodation and\nservice and by segregating class members from their communities by congregating\nthem in Fort Stanton and Los Lunas. In early 1994, the court granted Plaintiffs’\nmotion.\n                                             7\n\f2.     The 1994 Stipulation Concerning Fort Stanton\n\n       In 1994, New Mexico elected to close Fort Stanton by 1995 and to transfer all\n\nof the residents at the institution to community-based services. In April 1994, the\n\nparties filed a joint motion under Rule 60(b) and Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\n\nJail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), to modify portions of the district court’s 1990 Order, and\n\nto terminate the 1990 Order’s requirements as to Fort Stanton upon closure of that\n\nfacility.\n\n       The district court found the parties’ joint motion “well-taken” and determined\n\nthat “the proposed modification is consistent with the rights of the classmembers.”\n\nJA Vol. 3 at 582. As a result, the court relieved Defendants from making further\n\nimprovements to Fort Stanton. In doing so, the court stated, “[i]n the event that all\n\nclassmembers have been transferred from Fort Stanton to appropriate settings by\n\nJuly 31, 1995, this Order and all portions of the [1990 Order] concerning corrections\n\nof deficiencies . . . at Fort Stanton will hereby be terminated.” Id. at 584.\n\n3.     The 1997 Joint Stipulation on Disengagement (JSD) and Plan of Action\n\n       In October 1997, the parties presented the court with the JSD, a Plan of\n\nAction, and a joint motion requesting the court’s approval of the JSD. According to\n\nthe parties’ stipulation, the JSD “does not seek a remedy for past violations of\n\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights.” JA Vol. 7 at 1403. It is instead\n\ndesigned to prevent future harm by ensuring that “Plaintiffs’ rights are not violated in\n\nthe community settings.” Id. at 1394. To that end, the JSD “defines the further\n\nactions and requirements” that Defendants had to complete, “and the services,\n\n                                            8\n\fsupports, and benefits” that Defendants had to provide to class members, in order for\n\nDefendants to comply with their obligations under the court’s existing orders. JA\n\nVol. 4 at 622.\n\n       The JSD acknowledges Defendants’ “substantial efforts to develop a non-\n\ndiscriminatory service system for persons with developmental disabilities and to\n\nprovide appropriate community living arrangements and supports to classmembers.”\n\nId. at 620. And it states Defendants had made “efforts to reasonably accommodate\n\nthe residents of Fort Stanton and Los Lunas in community settings.” Id. at 621. As a\n\nresult of those efforts, Fort Stanton closed in March 1995 when all its residents had\n\ntransitioned to community settings, and Los Lunas closed in July 1997 when its last\n\nresident transitioned to the community.\n\n       The JSD also includes a process for judicial disengagement of Defendants’\n\ndecree obligations. And it identifies the “Continued Improvement of Community\n\nServices” as an area subject to disengagement. The Continuous Improvement\n\nobligations address “a quality improvement approach that requires Defendants to\n\nachieve a certain score on an annual audit.” Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In the order denying Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion that is the subject of this appeal, the district court recognized that Defendants\n\nhave achieved disengagement from fifty-six of the seventy Continuous Improvement\n\nobligations. Id.\n\n       The parties identified additional obligations in the Plan of Action, which\n\nDefendant Department of Health developed “to [e]nhance the Community Service\n\n                                           9\n\fSystem” for persons with developmental disabilities. JA Vol. 4 at 629. The Plan of\n\nAction contains “a narrative, desired outcomes, and specific activities for thirteen\n\ncomponents of the community service system.”4 Id. Those thirteen components are\n\ncontained in the Plan of Action’s thirteen attached appendices. Two more appendices\n\nwere later added by consent of the parties.\n\n      After holding a fairness hearing, the district court issued, in December 1997,\n\nan order approving the JSD and the Plan of Action. The court noted the JSD “does\n\nnot call for immediate dismissal of this lawsuit,” but instead “contemplates continued\n\njudicial oversight that could extend well into the next [millennium].” Id. at 801. The\n\ncourt further observed that the JSD “states the parties’ intention to fulfill most of the\n\nactivities described in the Plan of Action by December 31, 1998, but makes an\n\nexception for certain requirements that may not be met until December 31, 2000.” Id.\n\n4.    The 2005 Stipulation to Resolve Motion for Noncompliance (Appendix A)\n\n      In May 2004, Plaintiffs moved for an order to show cause and for further\n\nremedial relief to require Defendants to comply with the court’s December 1997\n\norder approving the JSD and the Plan of Action. In June 2004, Plaintiffs moved for\n\nan Order to Reengage Effective Case Management, Desired Outcome A, Under the\n\nPlan of Action.\n\n\n\n      4\n        The thirteen components are (1) quality enhancement, (2) community\nincident management system, (3) training, (4) management information systems, (5)\nindividual service planning, (6) case management, (7) behavioral services, (8) crisis\nresponse, (9) sexuality, (10) supported employment, (11) assistive technology, (12)\nmedical services, and (13) regional offices.\n                                           10\n\f      In May 2005, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation on Agreed Actions to Comply\n\nwith Joint Stipulation of Disengagement and Plan of Action and to Resolve Pending\n\nMotions to Show Cause and to Re-engage (2005 Stipulation). Attached to the 2005\n\nStipulation is “Appendix A[:] Agreed Actions to Address Contempt Motions”\n\n(Appendix A). JA Vol. 10 at 1903. The 2005 Stipulation states that it “is intended to\n\nobligate Defendants to take certain actions outside the Plan of Action as more\n\nspecifically outlined in Appendix A.” Id. at 1898. “[T]he actions identified in\n\nAppendix A are intended to facilitate compliance with the JSD, to promote\n\ncompletion of . . . Audit Recommendations, to further address Case Management\n\neven though Plan of Action Desired Outcomes related to Case Management have\n\nbeen previously disengaged by an order of the Court and to address certain aspects of\n\nVocational Rehabilitation.” Id. at 1898–99. The 2005 Stipulation clarifies that it is\n\nnot intended to change or modify the terms of the JSD, which remain in effect. And it\n\nfurther states that Defendants “agree to implement all of the actions identified and\n\nlisted in Appendix A,” and that the parties agree some of the Appendix A actions\n\nsupplanted or modified activities listed in the Plan of Action. Id. at 1899.\n\n      Appendix A imposes 107 specific obligations on Defendants. Some of the\n\nobligations are identified as “complete,” while many obligations were scheduled to\n\nbe completed by May 2006 or in 2007. Although those deadlines were not met,\n\nDefendants represent that one third of the activities in Appendix A have been\n\ndisengaged.

The 2012 Order\n\n       In mid-July 2010, Plaintiffs filed another Motion for Further Remedial Relief\n\nto Remedy Noncompliance. After full briefing, the district court denied the motion\n\nwithout prejudice so Plaintiffs could refile after an evidentiary hearing scheduled for\n\nJune 2011.\n\n       On April 26, 2011—the day before the pretrial conference for the evidentiary\n\nhearing—Defendants filed a Rule 60(b)(5) motion to terminate all remaining orders\n\nand to conclude the court’s oversight. Defendants maintained that they have made\n\nmore than a reasonable effort to comply with the court’s orders, that they have\n\nsubstantially complied with all existing orders, and that changed factual conditions\n\nmake continuing compliance substantially more onerous. The court held the motion\n\nin abeyance and suspended briefing on it until the completion of the evidentiary\n\nhearing, which occurred from June 13 to June 17, 2011. Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. The court later terminated the pending Rule 60(b)(5) motion without\n\ndeciding its merits. Id. at *4 n.12.\n\n       In November 2011, after the evidentiary hearing, Plaintiffs filed a Renewed\n\nMotion for Further Remedial Relief to Remedy Noncompliance. Plaintiffs argued that\n\nDefendants had failed to comply with the JSD, the Plan of Action, Appendix A, the\n\nRehabilitation Act, and the ADA (collectively, decrees). Plaintiffs also asked the\n\ncourt to appoint a Jackson Compliance Administrator (Compliance Administrator) to\n\n                                          12\n\foversee and ensure Defendants’ compliance. In October 2012, the district court\n\nissued a 206-page, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (2012 Order). The court\n\npraised Defendants’ “innovations and progress,” but determined that Defendants\n\nwere still in substantial noncompliance with the decree obligations. JA Vol. 25 at\n\n5303. Indeed, the court identified instances of noncompliance in the areas of health,\n\nsafety, and supported employment.\n\n      Based on the evidence before it, however, the court stated it “is unable to\n\nconclude that Defendants have violated the Rehabilitation Act and ADA.” The court\n\nexplained:\n\n      To start with, the Court could not conclude that Defendants have\n      discriminated against severely disabled class members with respect to\n      the provision of health care services. In fact, the Court commends\n      Defendants for accommodating those severely disabled class members\n      who live in rural New Mexico by providing them meaningful access to\n      health care services . . . and for developing more and better health care\n      services directed to severely disabled persons. There is, however, a\n      question as to whether Defendants violated the Rehabilitation Act and\n      ADA by intentionally denying severely disabled class members\n      supported employment services equivalent to those received by less\n      severely disabled persons. Unfortunately, that question of disparate\n      treatment cannot be analyzed at this time, but must be further briefed.\n      On the other hand, the Court was unable to find a violation of the\n      Rehabilitation Act and ADA when severely disabled class members\n      choose to participate in segregated, congregate day services while less\n      severely disabled persons more often chose to engage in supported\n      employment.\n\nId. at 5304–05.\n\n      The court also noted that Defendants “are close to substantially complying\n\nwith [their] obligations,” and suggested that “the parties reconsider the descriptions\n\nof the more broadly stated obligations and restate them in language that makes the\n\n                                          13\n\fobligations achievable.” Id. at 5303–04. After all, “many of the obligations are\n\ndescribed in language that is more aspirational in nature than operational.” Id. at\n\n5304. Finally, the court granted Plaintiffs’ request to appoint a Compliance\n\nAdministrator, who could “prod Defendants into final substantial compliance.”5 Id. at\n\n5305.\n\n6.      The 2015 Revised Table IV\n\n        After the district court issued its 2012 Order, the parties were to develop a\n\nconsolidated remedial plan in the areas of health, safety, and supported employment\n\nto address the identified violations. See Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. The\n\nparties, counsel, the Compliance Administrator, and the court then worked together\n\nfor over two years before finalizing a consolidated plan. Id.\n\n        In June 2015, the parties jointly filed the 2015 Revised Table IV—which is a\n\nfinal list of objectives in the areas of health, safety, and supported employment—\n\nalong with evaluative components (or disengagement criteria) and projected\n\ncompletion dates for each objective. In November 2015, the parties jointly filed a\n\nStipulated Agreement on Disengagement Process for Revised Table IV. Under the\n\n\n        5\n         After the court issued its 2012 Order, Plaintiffs moved to modify the 2012\nOrder with respect to their claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA.\nPlaintiffs asked the court to delete its findings and conclusions “on all discrimination\nclaims regarding severity of disability and segregation,” to strike those portions of\ntheir November 2011 Renewed Motion for Remedial Relief to Remedy\nNoncompliance based on the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, and to vacate the\npertinent sections from its 2012 Order. JA Vol. 25 at 5308–09. The court denied the\nmotion to modify, but, on its own initiative, granted Plaintiffs leave to file a motion\nseeking relief on their disparate treatment claim. Plaintiffs never filed a motion\nseeking relief on that claim.\n                                            14\n\fagreed-upon disengagement process, Defendants would submit a request for\n\ndisengagement of a specific decree objective to the Compliance Administrator, who\n\nwould then make a written “determination” on whether the disengagement criteria\n\nhad been met. If the Compliance Administrator did not agree that the criteria had\n\nbeen met, then Defendants could withdraw their request for a determination or pursue\n\na disengagement motion with the court.\n\n      The court noted that, as of May 2016, the Compliance Administrator had\n\nissued approximately three determinations on Defendants’ requests, with roughly 197\n\ndecree obligations remaining for which the Compliance Administrator had not issued\n\npreliminary determinations. Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 n.20. The court\n\nalso stated Revised Table IV did not replace or modify existing decree obligations\n\nthat were not the subject of Plaintiffs’ Renewed Noncompliance Motion and the\n\ncourt’s 2012 Order. Id. at *8. Thus, Defendants must demonstrate substantial\n\ncompliance with the earlier outstanding decree obligations, in addition to those listed\n\nin Revised Table IV. Id. The court estimated that, between the JSD, the Plan of\n\nAction, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV, Defendants must still show substantial\n\ncompliance with approximately 307 decree obligations. Id. at *9.\n\n               B. District Court’s Denial of Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5) Motion\n\n      In August 2015, Defendants filed their current motion under Rule 60(b)(5),\n\narguing that factual circumstances have changed to the extent that the district court\n\nshould vacate all remaining orders and conclude its oversight entirely. Defendants\n\nidentified four changed factual circumstances they claim warrant vacatur of all\n\n                                          15\n\fpertinent decrees and termination of the case. First, Defendants argued that their\n\ndecree obligations have increased in number and complexity to the point they will\n\nnever be able to satisfy the “labyrinth of obligations” that are ever-changing, ever-\n\nincreasing, and not subject to objective measurement. Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11.\n\n       Second, Defendants argued that some of their obligations are now outdated:\n\n       1) the JSD provisions about community practice improvements at [Los\n       Lunas], which are no longer relevant as that institution closed in 1997;\n       2) the JSD formulate for disengagement of the Continuous Improvement\n       outcomes, which is “convoluted,” “confusing,” and “unworkable”;\n       3) the JSD Continuous Improvement obligations that “are no longer\n       programmatically sound and are no longer the desire” of [class\n       members],” and that are not relevant to the present-day needs of [class\n       members]; 4) the 1997 Plan of Action obligations that have been\n       “morphed into new requirements” under Revised Table IV and that are\n       “long detached from remedying the original constitutional issues”; and\n       5) Appendix A obligations that consist of vague and aspirational\n       language, making disengagement impossible.\n\nId. at *12 (citations omitted).\n\n       Third, while conceding they have not substantially complied with all their\n\ndecree obligations, Defendants maintained they have remedied all constitutional\n\nviolations. Id. They argued they have thus attained the “objects” of the consent\n\ndecrees, and they have corrected all eighteen areas of deficiencies the district court\n\nidentified in its 1990 Order. Id. at 12–13. And if more is required, they insisted, this\n\ncase will remain a never-ending process of continuing quality control. Id. at 12.\n\n       Fourth, Defendants argued that the increased litigation costs inhibit New\n\nMexico’s ability to fund other important programs. Id. at *12–13. For instance, New\n\n\n                                           16\n\fMexico has spent more than $50 million related to this litigation in the last eight\n\nyears. Id. at *12. And, as of 2009, the average yearly cost to provide services to class\n\nmembers had risen from $67,290.00 to $135,535.00 per class member, while New\n\nMexico’s $32,992.00 per capita income was the ninth lowest in the United States. Id.\n\nat *13.\n\n      Based on these four changed circumstances, Defendants contended that notions\n\nof federalism supported their request for relief. Indeed, they argued that federalism\n\nconcerns are heightened here because the consent decrees have the effect of dictating\n\nstate and local budget priorities and improperly depriving state officials of their\n\ndesignated legislative and executive powers. Id. at *13.\n\n      In an order issued in June 2016, the court ruled that Defendants had not met\n\ntheir burden to show the existence of a significant change in fact warranting vacatur\n\nof all pertinent orders and termination of the case. First, the court stated that “while\n\nDefendants’ obligations are onerous,” Defendants never identified when these\n\nasserted changed factual circumstances occurred; indeed, “[s]ome of the complained\n\nabout developments have been happening for years.” Id. at *14.\n\n      Next, the court concluded that Defendants have not shown that the objects of\n\nthe pertinent decrees have been attained. While the court recognized that the decrees\n\nwere designed to restore class members to the position they would have occupied\n\nabsent violations of federal law, the court stated that the “more specific ‘essential\n\npurposes’” of those decrees “are to provide class members with adequate health care,\n\na reasonably safe environment, and supported employment opportunities.” Id.\n\n                                           17\n\f(quoting 2012 Order at 33). And based on Defendants’ concessions that they have not\n\nsubstantially complied with all the decree obligations, the court concluded that\n\nDefendants “have not fulfilled the essential purposes of the pertinent decrees.” Id.\n\n      Further, the court found Defendants’ assertion that they long ago remedied all\n\nconstitutional violations to be “somewhat misleading.” Id. at *14–15. The court\n\nexplained that the decree obligations in the JSD, the Plan of Action, and Appendix A\n\n“all flowed from [its] original findings of [federal] violations in 1990.” Id. at *15.\n\nAnd it noted that Revised Table IV was developed in response to the 2012 findings of\n\napproximately 100 decree violations. Id. The court stated that it “correlated its\n\nspecific findings of violations in 2012 with enumerated requirements in the JSD, Plan\n\nof Action, and Appendix A.” Id. “Stated differently, the October 2012 violations\n\nevolved from compliance issues concerning obligations that first appeared in the\n\nJSD, Plan of Action, and Appendix A that Defendants had not yet satisfied.” Id.\n\n      The court also took issue with Defendants’ characterization of the 2012 Order\n\nas finding no ongoing violations of federal law. The court clarified that it had made\n\nno findings in its 2012 Order on continuing violations of federal law. Id. Although\n\nPlaintiffs had argued that Defendants violated the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA,\n\nthe court ruled then that “there was not sufficient evidence of discrimination under”\n\neither Act. Id. But the court explained that it was not asked, and thus made no\n\nfindings on, whether Defendants otherwise continued to violate class members’\n\nconstitutional rights. Id. With respect to the 2016 motion to terminate oversight, the\n\ndistrict court likewise did not resolve the question of current compliance with federal\n\n                                           18\n\flaw, stating it “is not in the position to assess, and, therefore, cannot conclude that\n\nDefendants are no longer violating constitutional or federal law.” Id. at *16. But\n\n“[b]ecause all of [the] outstanding obligations grew out of the Court’s 1990 Order\n\nand/or the related 2012 findings of violations,” the district court concluded that\n\n“Defendants have not convinced the Court that they have satisfied the essential\n\npurposes of the JSD, Plan of Action, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV.” Id. at 16.\n\n      The court then rejected Defendants’ claim that principles of federalism\n\ndictated the termination of oversight. The court acknowledged that the Supreme\n\nCourt, in Horne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145850\"><a href=\"/opinion/145850/horne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), stated that federalism concerns are\n\nheightened when a consent decree has the effect of dictating state budget allocations.\n\nId. And it conceded that “increasing fees and costs associated with this litigation are\n\ndetrimental to the State’s interest.” Id. But the court reasoned that “first and\n\nforemost,” the Horne Court asked if the State had fulfilled its obligations under\n\nfederal law and achieved the objectives of the pertinent order. Id. The district court\n\nanswered that question in the negative, stating: “Unlike Horne, Defendants have not\n\nshown that they have fulfilled their outstanding obligations, ‘by other means.’” Id. at\n\n*17 (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 439).\n\n      Ultimately, the court concluded that Defendants “have not come close to\n\nshowing that vacatur of all of the orders and decrees is suitably tailored to the\n\nproposed changed circumstances.” Id. Nor have Defendants “demonstrated that a\n\ndurable remedy is in place sufficient to justify vacatur of all of the Court’s orders.”\n\nId. at *18. In other words, Defendants had not shown “that it is unlikely that the\n\n                                            19\n\fprohibited conditions or actions will recur.” Id.

The court therefore denied the\n\nmotion.\n\n                                  II.    ANALYSIS\n\n      On appeal, Defendants assert that the district court abused its discretion when\n\nit denied their Rule 60(b)(5) motion. Defendants contend significant changes in\n\nfactual circumstances warrant termination of all consent decrees and of the court’s\n\noversight. Specifically, they claim that compliance with the decrees has become\n\nsubstantially more onerous, the decrees have become unworkable due to unforeseen\n\nobstacles, and continued enforcement of the decrees would be detrimental to the\n\npublic interest. They also argue that the district court misapplied Horne by requiring\n\nthem to show attainment of specific essential purposes identified by the district court\n\nrather than compliance with federal law.\n\n                             A.

Because the pertinent orders are consent decrees that are\n\nfinal orders under Rule 60(b), it necessarily follows that the district court’s June 2016\n\norder denying relief under Rule 60(b)(5) from those consent decrees is also final and\n\nappealable under § 1291. See Jeff D. v.

Relying on McClendon, they argue the district court’s June\n\n2016 order is not a final, appealable order because it signals that more litigation is on\n\nthe way. Plaintiffs believe future litigation will occur when they inevitably file\n\nanother motion for remedial relief to remedy Defendants’ noncompliance with the\n\n                                           22\n\fconsent decrees. In other words, the June 2016 Order is not final because the district\n\ncourt will continue to monitor Defendants’ compliance with its prior consent decrees\n\n(i.e., the JSD, the Plan of Action, Appendix A, and Revised Table IV).\n\n       But under McClendon, that the district court may have to continue to oversee\n\nDefendants’ compliance with the consent decrees is not enough to strip the June 2016\n\norder of its status as a final decision. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether the June\n\n2016 order will result in more litigation on the merits in the district court. See\n\nMcClendon, 630 F.3d at 1292–94. If the June 2016 order “ensures litigation on the\n\nmerits will continue in the district court,” then it is not final under § 1291. Id. at\n\n1293. But if it does not, and it is otherwise a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion\n\nchallenging a final decision of the district court, then it is a final decision under\n\n§ 1291. See id. at 1293–94; Jeff D., 365 F.3d at 850.\n\n       Under this formulation, the June 2016 order is a final, appealable decision.\n\nFirst, the June 2016 order does not signal that more litigation on the merits is on the\n\nway. In fact, the 1990 order, which followed a lengthy trial, resolved the merits of the\n\nlitigation, and the district court retained jurisdiction only to oversee implementation\n\nof the ensuing consent decrees. Second, as discussed above, the 2016 order denied a\n\nRule 60(b) motion challenging several final decisions of the district court.\n\n       To be sure, the June 2016 order does not result in the district court dissociating\n\nitself from the case. Much the opposite, it means the district court will, as it has since\n\nit issued the 1990 Order, continue to oversee Defendants’ compliance with the\n\npertinent consent decrees. But this fact alone does not deprive us of jurisdiction.\n\n                                            23\n\fAfter all, each decree was a final, appealable decision under § 1291, even though the\n\ndistrict court continued to oversee each decree’s implementation. See Johnson, 393\n\nF.3d at 1101; V.T.A., 597 F.2d at 224. If the district court’s continued oversight\n\nwould not have divested us of appellate jurisdiction then, it should not do so now.\n\n      In sum, the finality test asks whether the ruling challenged in the denied Rule\n\n60(b) motion was “a final decision of the district court.” Stubblefield, 74 F.3d at 993.\n\nHere, that test is met. The June 2016 order is a final, appealable order and, thus, we\n\nhave appellate jurisdiction under § 1291.\n\n                           B.

Consent Decrees Generally\n\n      A consent decree “entered in federal court must be directed to protecting\n\nfederal interests.” Frew v. Hawkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (2004). The consent decree\n\n“must spring from, and serve to resolve, a dispute within the court’s subject-matter\n\njurisdiction.” Id. (citing Firefighters v. Cleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111748\"><a href=\"/opinion/111748/firefighters-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (1986)).\n\n      Equity requires a federal court fashioning and implementing a consent decree\n\nto focus on three factors. See Milliken v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (1977). First, a\n\nfederal consent decree must “be remedial in nature” and thus “designed as nearly as\n\npossible to restore the victims of [illegal] conduct to the position they would have\n\noccupied in the absence of such conduct.” Id. at 280 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      Second, the nature and scope of the remedy provided by a federal consent\n\ndecree depends on the nature and scope of the federal-law violation. Id. at 280, 282.\n\nThis means a “federal-court decree[] must directly address and relate to the [federal-\n\nlaw] violation itself.” Id. at 282. And it must be “tailored to cure the condition that\n\noffends” federal law. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). But a decree exceeds\n\nappropriate limits if it is “aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate\n\n[federal law] or does not flow from such a violation.” Id.\n\n      Third, federal courts “must take into account the interests of state and local\n\nauthorities in managing their own affairs,” consistent with the demands of federal\n\n                                           26\n\flaw. Id. at 280–81. Indeed, principles of federalism require that federal courts give\n\n“significant weight to the views of government officials,” and that “state officials\n\nwith front-line responsibility for administering [a state program] be given latitude\n\nand substantial discretion.” Frew, 540 U.S. at 442 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Importantly, federal consent decrees are temporary solutions that may be kept\n\nin place only as long as necessary to cure an unlawful condition. See Missouri v.\n\nJenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88-89 (1995). The Supreme Court has cautioned that federal\n\ncourts should not continue their “oversight of state programs for long periods of time\n\n. . . absent an ongoing violation of federal law.” Frew, 540 U.S. at 441. Thus, a\n\n“federal court must exercise its equitable powers to ensure that when the objects of\n\nthe decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the State’s obligations is\n\nreturned promptly to the State and its officials.” Id. at 442. Keeping a consent decree\n\nin place any longer than necessary to assure compliance with federal law risks\n\nviolating principles of federalism and “improperly depriv[ing] future officials of their\n\ndesignated legislative and executive powers.” Id. at 441; see also John B v.

The district\n\ncourt ruled that conditions at the jail were constitutionally deficient; thus, the district\n\ncourt enjoined the state defendants from, among other things, housing two or more\n\ninmates in a single cell. Id. at 372–73. When conditions at the jail did not improve,\n\nthe district court ordered the state defendants to renovate another existing facility to\n\nserve as a substitute detention center. Id. at 373–74. The First Circuit affirmed and\n\nordered that the jail be closed unless the state defendants timely presented a plan to\n\ncreate a constitutionally adequate facility for the pretrial detainees. Id. at 374.\n\n       Days before the deadline to present a plan for a new facility, the state\n\ndefendants submitted a plan to create a substitute facility with only single-occupancy\n\ncells, and the district court entered a consent decree obligating the state defendants to\n\nconstruct a facility containing 309 single occupancy rooms. Id. at 374–75. When the\n\ninmate population outpaced population projections, the parties moved the district\n\ncourt to modify the decree to provide a facility with an increased number of cells. Id.\n\nat 375–76. The district court granted the modification on the condition that “single-\n\ncell occupancy is maintained” under the new plan for the facility. Id. at 376.\n\n       The state defendants again moved to modify the consent decree, this time to\n\nallow for double bunking of male detainees in roughly one-third of the cells in the\n\nnew jail.

The state defendants\n\nargued that the continued increase in the pretrial detainee population—a change in\n\nfact—coupled with a change in law regarding the constitutionality of double bunking\n\npretrial detainees, see Bell v. Wolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), supported the requested\n\nmodification. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 376. The district court denied the motion, in part,\n\nbecause the state defendants failed to make a “clear showing of [a] grievous wrong\n\nevoked by new and unforeseen conditions.” Id. at 377 (quoting United States v. Swift\n\n& Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119 (1932)). The district court explained that modification\n\nwould violate a primary purpose of the decree—to provide for a separate cell for each\n\ndetainee—although it never decided whether double celling would be\n\nunconstitutional. Id. at 377. The First Circuit affirmed. Id.\n\n      The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded so the lower courts could\n\napply the proper standard to modification requests under Rule 60(b)(5). See id. at\n\n393. The Court began by emphasizing the need for flexibility when considering a\n\nmotion for modification of a consent decree in institutional reform litigation. Id. at\n\n380–83. After all, consent decrees in such cases “often remain in place for extended\n\nperiods of time, [meaning] the likelihood of significant changes occurring during the\n\nlife of the decree is increased.” Id. at 380. The Court further explained that the\n\nexperience of the Courts of Appeals “demonstrated that a flexible approach is often\n\nessential to achieving the goals of reform litigation,” as the Courts of Appeals\n\nobserved that consent decrees frequently “reach beyond the parties involved directly\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\fin the suit and impact [] the public’s right to the sound and efficient operation of its\n\ninstitutions.” Id. at 381 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The Court then outlined what a movant must show when seeking modification\n\nof a consent decree under Rule 60(b)(5). The party seeking modification of a consent\n\ndecree bears the burden of showing that “a significant change either in factual\n\nconditions or in law” warrants revision of the decree. Id. at 384. Changed factual\n\ncircumstances may warrant modification of a consent decree when the changed\n\ncircumstances “make compliance with the decree substantially more onerous,” when\n\n“a decree proves to be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,” or when\n\n“enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public\n\ninterest.” Id. at 384. A party need not show that a change in fact was both unforeseen\n\nand unforeseeable. Id. at 385.\n\n      Conversely, a court should deny a party’s request for a modification under\n\nRule 60(b)(5) if the party merely establishes that “it is no longer convenient [for the\n\nmoving party] to live with the terms of a consent decree.” Id. at 383. Furthermore, a\n\nmodification should be denied “where a party relies upon events that actually were\n\nanticipated at the time it entered into a decree.” Id. at 385. The Court explained:\n\n      If it is clear that a party anticipated changing conditions that would\n      make performance of the decree more onerous but nevertheless agreed\n      to the decree, that party would have to satisfy a heavy burden to\n      convince a court that it agreed to the decree in good faith, made a\n      reasonable effort to comply with the decree, and should be relieved of\n      the undertaking under Rule 60(b).\n\nId.\n\n\n                                           30\n\f       If a party meets its burden of establishing a change in fact that warrants\n\nmodification of a consent decree, the district court should examine “whether the\n\nproposed modification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.” Id. at 391.\n\nThis analysis focuses on whether the proposed modification “is tailored to resolve the\n\nproblems created by the change in circumstances.” Id. In performing this analysis, a\n\ncourt must bear in mind that the public interest and principles of federalism require a\n\nfederal court to defer to state or local government officials and to consider a state or\n\nlocal government’s financial constraints. Id. at 392. But a modification “must not\n\ncreate or perpetuate a constitutional violation.” Id. at 391. Additionally, in accord\n\nwith the requirement that a modification be tailored to the change in circumstances,\n\nthe existence of a change in circumstances often will not justify a modification to the\n\nconsent decree that lowers the terms of the consent decree to “the constitutional\n\nfloor.” Id. In this sense, a court modifying a consent decree may “do no more” to the\n\nconsent decree than is warranted by the change in circumstances and “should not\n\n‘turn aside to inquire whether some of the provisions of the decree . . . could have\n\nbeen opposed with success if the defendants had offered opposition.’” Id. at 391-92\n\n(quoting United States v. Swift & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116-17 (1932)). Thus, even\n\nwhere a change in circumstances occurs, the plaintiff will retain those benefits\n\nsecured under the consent decree that are not impugned by the change in\n\ncircumstances. See id.\n\n      The Court then instructed the district court on remand to first consider whether\n\nthe purported change in factual circumstances—the upsurge in the pretrial detainee\n\n                                           31\n\fpopulation—was foreseen by the state defendants. Id. at 385. But the Court also\n\nadvised that the district court erred by concluding that modification was\n\ninappropriate simply because it would not provide for a separate cell for each\n\ndetainee. The Court explained:\n\n       Even if the decree is construed as an undertaking by [the state\n       defendants] to provide single cells for pretrial detainees, to relieve\n       [them] from that promise based on changed conditions does not\n       necessarily violate the basic purpose of the decree. That purpose was to\n       provide a remedy for what had been found, based on a variety of factors,\n       including double celling, to be unconstitutional conditions obtaining in\n       the [jail]. If modification of one term of a consent decree defeats the\n       purpose of the decree, obviously modification would be all but\n       impossible. That cannot be the rule. The District Court was thus in error\n       in holding that . . . modification of the single cell requirement was\n       necessarily forbidden.\n\nId. at 387.\n\n       c.     Horne v. Flores\n\n       In Horne v. Flores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145850\"><a href=\"/opinion/145850/horne-v-flores/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (2009), the Supreme Court was again\n\ntasked with determining whether the lower courts applied the correct standard in\n\ndenying a Rule 60(b)(5) motion. There, a class of English Language-Learner (ELL)\n\nstudents and their parents in Arizona sued the state for violating the Equal\n\nEducational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires a state “to take\n\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by\n\nits students in its instructional programs.” Id. at 438–39. After a trial, the district\n\ncourt concluded that “defendants were violating the EEOA because the amount of\n\nfunding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\ffunding) was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs\n\nof ELL instruction.” Id. at 441.\n\n       Over the next several years, the district court entered various additional orders\n\nand injunctions aimed at improving the state’s ELL incremental funding. Id. For\n\ninstance, the court ordered the state to “prepare a cost study to establish the proper\n\nappropriation to effectively implement ELL programs.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). And it later required the state to, within ninety days of the order’s issuance,\n\n“appropriately and constitutionally fund the state’s ELL programs taking into account\n\nthe [court’s] previous orders.” Id. After the state failed to comply with these orders,\n\nthe district court held the state in contempt and imposed a fine for every day until the\n\nstate came into compliance. Id. at 442.\n\n       After accruing over $20 million in fines, the state legislature passed HB 2064,\n\na bill that was designed “to implement a permanent funding solution to the problems\n\nidentified” by the district court. Id. The Governor allowed HB 2064 to become law\n\nwithout her signature, and the state presented it to the district court for approval. Id.\n\nat 443. Because the Governor did not approve of HB 2064’s funding provisions, two\n\nmembers of the state legislature intervened to support the bill. Id. Intervenors then\n\nmoved to “purge” the district court’s contempt order in light of HB 2064 and, in the\n\nalternative, for relief under Rule 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances. Id. The\n\ndistrict court denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion because HB 2064 “did not establish a\n\nfunding system that rationally relates funding available to the actual costs of all\n\nelements of ELL instruction.” Id. at 444 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\n                                            33\n\fNinth Circuit affirmed, stating that “relief would be appropriate only if petitioners\n\nhad shown either that there are no longer incremental costs associated with ELL\n\nprograms in Arizona or that Arizona had altered its funding model.” Id. at 445\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       The Supreme Court reversed. The Court first reiterated that a party may move\n\nto modify or vacate an order under Rule 60(b)(5) if “‘a significant change either in\n\nfactual conditions or in law’ renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the public\n\ninterest.’” Id. at 447 (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384). “[O]nce a party carries this\n\nburden, a court abuses its discretion when it refuses to modify an injunction or\n\nconsent decree in light of such changes.” Id. at 447–49 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       The Court then stressed that Rule 60(b)(5) serves an important function in\n\ninstitutional reform litigation for three reasons. Id. First, injunctions and consent\n\ndecrees in such cases often remain in place for many years, “and the passage of time\n\nfrequently brings about changed circumstances” (e.g., “changes in the nature of the\n\nunderlying problem” and “new policy insights”) “that warrant reexamination of the\n\noriginal judgment.” Id. at 448. Second, injunctions and decrees in reform cases tend\n\nto “raise sensitive federalism concerns” because such cases often “involve[] areas of\n\ncore state responsibility.” Id. And those federalism concerns “are heightened when\n\n. . . a federal court decree has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities.”\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                                             34\n\f      Recognizing that states have limited resources, the Court expressed sensitivity\n\ntoward the fact that “[w]hen a federal court orders that money be appropriated for\n\none program, the effect is often to take funds away from other important programs.”\n\nId. Third, seemingly endless injunctions and decrees in these types of cases\n\ncommonly “bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their\n\npredecessors and may thereby ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated\n\nlegislative and executive powers.’” Id. at 449 (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441).\n\nSuccessor officials may bring new insights and solutions to ongoing “problems of\n\nallocating revenues and resources,” but overbroad or outdated decrees may inhibit\n\ntheir ability to respond to those problems and fulfill their duties as democratically-\n\nelected officials. Id. In sum, a long-lasting and unmodified consent decree not only\n\nraises serious federalism concerns but it may also restrain the opportunities for the\n\nclass protected by the decree because an overbroad and unyielding decree limits\n\nfinancial resources available to governments for the implementation of new\n\ninnovations and policies that may serve the needs of the protected class better than\n\nthe requirements embodied in the decree.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, courts must take a flexible approach to motions\n\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) where the moving party seeks relief from a long-lasting decree.\n\nId. at 450. This flexible approach “seeks to return control to state and local officials\n\nas soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied.” Id. at 451. To that end,\n\ncourts must be wary “that ‘federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are\n\naimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate federal law or does not flow\n\n                                           35\n\ffrom such a violation.’” Id. at 450 (quoting Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282). “‘If a federal\n\nconsent decree is not limited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal\n\nlaw,’ it may ‘improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and\n\nexecutive powers.’” Id. (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 441).\n\n      Accordingly, “a critical question in [the] Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the\n\nobjective of the [challenged decree] has been achieved.” Id. (citing Frew, 540 U.S. at\n\n442). “If a durable remedy has been implemented, continued enforcement of the\n\norder is not only unnecessary, but improper.” Id. (citing Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282).\n\n      Applying these standards, the Court in Horne concluded that the Ninth Circuit\n\nerred in two ways. First, instead of applying a flexible approach, the Ninth Circuit\n\n“used a heightened standard that paid insufficient attention to federalism concerns.”\n\nId. at 451. Based on the federalism concerns, application of a flexible approach was\n\n“critical.” Id. at 452. The Court instructed that application of the flexible approach\n\nrequires that “‘[w]hen the objects of the decree have been attained’—namely, when\n\n[compliance with federal law] has been achieved—‘responsibility for discharging the\n\nState’s obligations must be returned to the State and its officials.’” Id. (quoting Frew,\n\n540 U.S. at 442).\n\n      Second, the Court held that instead of “inquiring broadly into whether changed\n\nconditions in [the schools] provided evidence of an ELL program that complied with\n\nthe EEOA,” id. at 451, the Ninth Circuit performed an inquiry that was “too narrow,”\n\n“focus[ing] almost exclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding,” id. at 452.\n\nBut the narrow inquiry—focusing on whether a prior judgment has been satisfied—\n\n                                           36\n\faddresses only one of the bases for relief under Rule 60(b)(5) and fails to consider\n\nwhether relief is warranted because “applying [a judgment] prospectively is no longer\n\nequitable.” Id. at 454. For purposes of the equity basis for modification, the Ninth\n\nCircuit’s narrow inquiry also overlooked the possibility that specific items in an\n\ninitial decree may, with the passage of time and changing circumstances, no longer\n\nbe the only way, or even the best way, to attain the objects of the decree and assure\n\ncompliance with federal law. See id. at 447–48, 451–54.\n\n      To determine whether relief was proper under the equity basis for\n\nmodification, the Ninth Circuit “needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement of\n\nthe original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law.” Id. at 454\n\n(citing Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282); see also id. at 468 (repeating that a proper Rule\n\n60(b)(5) inquiry should ask whether the school district “is now providing equal\n\neducational opportunities to ELL students”).\n\n      The Court explained that while the Ninth Circuit focused on ELL incremental\n\nfunding, “funding is simply a means [of complying with the EEOA], not the end\n\n(here, the EEOA).” Id. at 454–55. By requiring the state “to demonstrate ‘appropriate\n\naction’ [mandated by the EEOA] through a particular funding mechanism, the Court\n\nof Appeals improperly substituted its own educational and budgetary policy\n\njudgments for those of the state and local officials to whom such decisions are\n\nproperly entrusted.” Id. at 455. Stated otherwise, the Ninth Circuit should have\n\n“consider[ed] the broader question whether, as a result of important changes during\n\n\n\n                                           37\n\fthe intervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation under the EEOA by other\n\nmeans.” Id. at 439.\n\n      The Court then remanded for the district court to make “up-to-date” findings\n\nand to consider whether four changed circumstances advanced by the defendants\n\nwarranted releasing the state from the earlier judgment. See id. at 469–70.\n\n        d.   Applicability of Horne & Tension between Horne and Rufo\n\n      As opposed to the present case that features a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking a\n\nmodification of a consent decree, Horne involved a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking a\n\nmodification of a court-issued injunction, as well as additional orders crafted by the\n\ndistrict court. See id. at 441. Lower courts have reached different conclusions\n\nregarding the force of Horne in the context of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking\n\nmodification of a consent decree. See Burt v.

The Sixth Circuit, however, did not\n\nexpress any hesitation regarding applying Horne to a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking\n\nmodification of a consent decree. See John B., 710 F.3d at 411–14. In fact, the Sixth\n\nCircuit, in John B., concluded that where a defendant subject to a consent decree in\n\ninstitutional reform litigation has implemented a durable remedy to cure the federal\n\n                                          38\n\fviolation underlying the decree, Horne’s admonition that continued enforcement of\n\nthe decree is “improper” controls and requires vacatur of the consent decree. Id. at\n\n411–13.\n\n      Three considerations compel us to join the Sixth Circuit’s apparent conclusion\n\nthat Horne fully applies to a Rule 60(b)(5) motion seeking modification of a consent\n\ndecree. First, while the parties may form the essential terms of a consent decree, as\n\nwe noted earlier when discussing our jurisdiction over this appeal, a district court’s\n\norder approving the consent decree is tantamount to a final judgment on the merits.\n\nSee supra 22 (citing Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165382\"><a href=\"/opinion/165382/johnson-v-city-of-tulsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1101 (10th Cir. 2004)).\n\n      Second, when discussing the proper inquiries for evaluating a Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion in institutional reform litigation, Horne uses “consent decree” or “decree”\n\ninterchangeably with injunction and court order even though Horne involved\n\nrequested modifications to an injunction and several court orders but did not involve\n\na consent decree. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 448–50. From this, we glean that the Court\n\nconsiders a consent decree and an injunctive order equivalent for purposes of\n\nevaluating a Rule 60(b)(5) motion for modification. And had the Court intended to\n\nlimit Horne to institutional reform litigation involving only injunctions and court\n\ncrafted orders, it could have easily done so explicitly. The Court, however, did not so\n\nlimit its holding, and the plain language of Horne supports the conclusion that the\n\ndecision applies with equal force to all institutional reform cases, including those\n\ncases featuring consent decrees.\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\f       Third, the same federalism concerns at the heart of Horne are present in\n\ninstitutional reform cases featuring consent decrees. Admittedly, the acquiescence of\n\nstate or local governmental officials to the terms of a consent decree might diminish\n\nfederalism concerns at the inception of the decree. But where, as here, a consent\n\ndecree remains in effect for decades, enforcement of the decree necessarily interjects\n\na federal court into local affairs and binds local governmental officials who were not\n\nparties to the consent decree. The federal court, thereby, effectively limits the\n\ndemocratic process by restricting the array of resources available to the governmental\n\nofficials for the enactment of other policies.\n\n       Applying Horne to Rule 60(b)(5) motions for modifications to consent decrees\n\ndoes not come without complication. Notably, an apparent tension exists between\n\nHorne and Rufo with respect to the appropriate course of action where a party\n\nseeking modification has brought itself into compliance with federal law but has not\n\nsubstantially complied with the specific terms of the consent decree or court order.\n\nCompare Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (“If a durable remedy [addressing the federal law\n\nviolation] has been implemented, continued enforcement of the order is not only\n\nunnecessary, but improper.”), with Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391 (“A proposed modification\n\nshould not strive to rewrite a consent decree so that it conforms to the constitutional\n\nfloor.”).\n\n       To the extent Rufo and Horne differ as to the appropriate course of action\n\nwhen a party seeks a Rule 60(b)(5) modification to an order in an institutional reform\n\ncase, two considerations cause us to follow the course outlined in Horne when the\n\n                                           40\n\fsignificant change advanced as the basis for Rule 60(b)(5) modification is the\n\ndefendant’s alleged ongoing compliance with federal law. First, Rufo involved a\n\nproposed modification to a plan that, if faithfully implemented over time, would\n\neventually cure the federal law violation. See id. at 376 (describing requested\n\nmodification at issue as allowing for some double bunking in new facility yet to be\n\ncompleted or opened). As such, unlike in Horne where the defendants alleged that\n\nthey had remedied the federal law violation, the defendants in Rufo had not yet\n\nremedied the issues with overcrowding and neglect in maintaining the jail that gave\n\nrise to the litigation. And, where the Rufo defendants had not remedied the issues\n\ngiving rise to the litigation, it naturally follows that the Rufo defendants, unlike the\n\nHorne defendants, were not in a position to establish the implementation of a durable\n\nremedy. Further, nothing in Rufo suggests that the proposed modification would\n\nequate with, or for that matter exceed, the constitutional floor. Thus, while Rufo is\n\nundoubtedly informative on many issues surrounding the Rule 60(b)(5) standard for\n\nmodifying a consent decree, its statement about not striving to modify a consent\n\ndecree to the constitutional floor is not germane to its decision.\n\n       Second, Horne represents the Court’s most recent proclamation regarding the\n\nstandard for obtaining a modification to an order in institutional reform litigation.\n\nAnd, as noted by scholars, Horne is the latest ruling in a trend of decisions that lower\n\nthe threshold for defendants to obtain a modification to, or the dissolution of, orders\n\nin long-lasting institutional reform cases.

Cir. 2011) (applying Horne’s statement that district court “ought to\n\nhave ‘applied a flexible standard that seeks to return control to state and local\n\nofficials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied’” to context of\n\nrequested modification to preliminary injunction (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 450–\n\n51)). The district court, by way of its role in overseeing the institutional reform\n\nlitigation for many years, is in the best position to evaluate both whether a party has\n\ncomplied with federal law and, if so, whether the party is committed to ongoing\n\ncompliance with federal law in the absence of oversight by the federal court. See\n\nPetties, 662 F.3d at 571 (recognizing that district court’s management of litigation\n\n                                           42\n\f“for many years” places district court in position to assess likelihood of compliance\n\nwith federal law absent oversight). Likewise, the district court is also in the best\n\nposition to assess whether the litigation has taken on a life of its own and now\n\nadvances a purpose removed from remedying the initial violation(s) or whether\n\ncontinued oversight remains necessary to ensure compliance with federal law.\n\n      Finally, we note that when applying the flexible approach and evaluating\n\nwhether a moving party implemented a durable remedy, a district court must consider\n\nthe totality of the moving party’s efforts to demonstrate sustained compliance with\n\nfederal law. In this respect, there is not a single path, such as the adoption of new\n\nlegislation, by which a party can demonstrate the implementation of a durable\n\nremedy. See id., 662 F.3d at 569–71 (remanding for determination of whether\n\nadoption of new internal policies, coupled with improved record of compliance with\n\nfederal law, satisfied durable remedy requirement). Several of the desegregation\n\ncases, although arguably not directly on point, highlight the broad inquiry a district\n\ncourt must undertake when determining a party’s commitment to abiding by federal\n\nlaw. Specifically, factors that a district court may consider include the party’s\n\ncommitment to compliance, the duration of the party’s compliance with federal law,\n\nand whether or not the effects of the violation of federal law persist.

Summary\n\n      From the foregoing discussion of Rufo, Horne, and other institutional reform\n\nlitigation cases, several principles emerge that are critical to our analysis of whether\n\nDefendants are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5).\n\n      First, a motion for relief from a consent decree based on an assertion that\n\n“applying it prospectively is no longer equitable” demands a different focus than a\n\nmotion based on an assertion that “the judgment has been satisfied, released or\n\ndischarged.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5); Horne, 557 U.S. at 454. With respect to the\n\nlatter ground for relief, it is appropriate for a court to focus on whether the movant\n\nhas satisfied each obligation set forth in the consent decree. But where, as here, the\n\nmovant contends that changed circumstances have rendered further enforcement of\n\n                                            44\n\fthe consent decree no longer equitable, the inquiry is whether the movant has shown\n\n(a) that a significant change in factual circumstances or in law warrants revision of\n\nthe decree, and (b) that the requested modification is suitably tailored to the changed\n\ncircumstance. Rufo, 502 U.S. at 383–84, 391. A movant may establish that changed\n\nfactual circumstances warrant modification when (i) the changed circumstances\n\n“make compliance with the decree substantially more onerous,” (ii) a “decree proves\n\nto be unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles,” or (iii) “enforcement of the\n\ndecree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest.” Id. at 384.\n\nIt is an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a motion for modification\n\nwhere the moving party meets this burden. Horne, 557 U.S. at 447.\n\n      Second, a flexible approach to evaluating the equities of such a motion is\n\ncrucial where, as in this case, institutional reform is sought. Horne, 557 U.S. at 450;\n\nRufo, 502 U.S. at 380–81. Consent decrees in reform cases often remain in effect for\n\nextended periods, thereby increasing the prospect that a significant change in factual\n\ncircumstances will occur. Horne, 557 U.S. at 447–48; Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380. Consent\n\ndecrees also tend to restrict state and local officials’ ability to implement new ideas\n\nto old problems. Horne, 557 U.S. at 449; Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381. And they raise\n\nsensitive federalism concerns that are heightened when a decree effectively dictates\n\nstate or local budget priorities. Horne, 557 U.S. at 448.\n\n      Third, when a party seeks termination or vacatur of a consent decree based on\n\nthe inequity of continued oversight, a court must determine not only whether changed\n\ncircumstances exist, but also whether the “objective” of the decree—that is, whether\n\n                                           45\n\fcompliance with federal law—has been attained. See id. at 450 (noting that “a critical\n\nquestion in [the] Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the District Court’s\n\n[initial] order—i.e., satisfaction of the EEOA’s ‘appropriate action’ standard—has\n\nbeen achieved” (emphasis added) (citing Frew, 540 U.S. at 442)); id. at 454\n\n(concluding that the Ninth Circuit “needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement\n\nof the original order was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law” (emphasis\n\nadded) (citing Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282)); id. at 468 (reiterating that the Ninth\n\nCircuit should have asked whether the school district was meeting the EEOA’s\n\n“appropriate action” requirement); see also Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282 (explaining that\n\na decree must be “tailored to cure the condition that offends” federal law and seek to\n\nrestore victims of unlawful conduct to the position they would have occupied absent\n\nthe unlawful conduct (internal quotation marks omitted)); John B., 710 F.3d at 411\n\n(stating that a court considering a Rule 60(b)(5) motion “must determine whether\n\n‘ongoing enforcement of the original order [is] supported by an ongoing violation of\n\nfederal law’” (alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at\n\n454)); Washington, 573 F.3d at 710 (interpreting Horne and Rufo as requiring a court\n\nto “consider whether the purpose of the decree” has been achieved). So where the\n\nbasis of the Rule 60(b)(5) motion is that continued enforcement of the decree is no\n\nlonger equitable, instead of inquiring narrowly whether the specific obligations of a\n\nconsent decree have been attained, the court must broadly inquire whether the party\n\nobligated by the decree is at that time in compliance with federal law. Horne, 557\n\nU.S. at 451–52; see also id. at 439 (stating that the lower courts needed to ask the\n\n                                           46\n\fbroader question whether the state “was fulfilling its obligation under the EEOA by\n\nother means”). And once compliance with federal law has been attained, a court must\n\nreturn control over the program to the state and its officials, provided a durable\n\nremedy is in place. See id. at 452 (“‘When the objects of the decree have been\n\nattained’—namely, when EEOA compliance has been achieved—‘responsibility for\n\ndischarging the State’s obligations [must be] returned promptly to the State and its\n\nofficials.’” (alteration in original) (quoting Frew, 540 U.S. at 442)); see also Frew,\n\n540 U.S. at 442 (“The federal court must exercise its equitable powers to ensure that\n\nwhen the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the\n\nState’s obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.” (emphasis\n\nadded)); Washington, 573 F.3d at 709 (“The Constitution does not establish the\n\ndistrict courts as permanent administrative agencies.”).\n\n      Last, the existence of a durable remedy may warrant disengagement of judicial\n\noversight. The Horne Court’s single reference to a durable remedy states:\n\n      [A] critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the\n      objective of the District Court’s [initial] order—i.e., satisfaction of the\n      EEOA’s “appropriate action” standard—has been achieved. See [Frew,]\n      540 U.S. at 442. If a durable remedy has been implemented, continued\n      enforcement of the order is not only unnecessary, but improper. See\n      Milliken, [433 U.S.] at 282.\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 450. From the latter sentence, it is fair to conclude that if a\n\ndurable remedy is in place, then the movant has attained the more-general objects of\n\nthe decree—i.e., compliance with federal law. We interpret the Court’s reference to a\n\n“durable remedy” as recognition that fleeting federal compliance is insufficient to\n\n\n                                           47\n\fwarrant relief. Thus, a district court, in assessing whether further oversight is\n\nequitable, may and should consider the totality of defendants’ efforts to comply with\n\nfederal law and defendants’ commitment to remaining in compliance with federal\n\nlaw. Such is the approach adopted by two of our sister circuits subsequent to Horne.\n\nSee supra 41-43 (discussing application of Horne’s durable remedy language in John\n\nB., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and Petties, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618202\"><a href=\"/opinion/618202/petties-ex-rel-martin-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\n\n      And like our sister circuits, we do not read the language in Horne too\n\nrestrictively with respect to what may constitute a durable remedy. The Court has\n\nadmonished against taking language from its opinions out of context and giving it\n\n“talismanic quality.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 380. Recall that, in Rufo, the district court\n\ndenied modification of the consent decree because the state defendants had failed to\n\nmeet the “clear showing of grievous wrong” evoked by the Court in United States v.\n\nSwift & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101912\"><a href=\"/opinion/101912/united-states-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1932). Rufo, 502 U.S. at 377. The Court acknowledged\n\nthat the “grievous wrong” language used in Swift, if “[r]ead out of context,”\n\n“suggests a ‘hardening’ of the traditional flexible standard for modification of\n\nconsent decrees.” Id. at 379. It explained, however, that such a reading would be\n\ninconsistent with Rule 60(b)(5): “That Rule, in providing that, on such terms as are\n\njust, a party may be relieved from a final judgment or decree where it is no longer\n\nequitable that the judgment have prospective application, permits a less stringent,\n\nmore flexible standard.” Id. at 380. A similarly cautious reading of the “durable\n\nremedy” language in Horne is appropriate here.\n\n\n\n                                           48\n\f      When a Rule 60(b)(5) movant has established both the absence of an ongoing\n\nviolation of federal law and a future commitment to remain in compliance with\n\nfederal law, federalism concerns should inform a court’s flexible determination as to\n\nhow a consent decree will be modified. Rule 60(b)(5) dictates as much. See Rufo, 502\n\nU.S. at 380. Accordingly, there is no one way for a movant to show that its federal\n\ncompliance is more than fleeting. For example, a movant may establish its\n\ncommitment to future compliance through the adoption of a durable remedy—such as\n\na statute designed to cure the specific federal violation. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 450.\n\nA movant may also establish its commitment to future compliance through a record\n\nof sustained good-faith efforts to remedy federal violations and, to the extent\n\npossible, eliminate the vestiges of the federal violation. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at\n\n490, 498; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248–49. Ultimately, the district court’s wealth of\n\nexperience overseeing the litigation should inform its assessment of whether the\n\nDefendants are now in compliance with federal law, and whether they are committed\n\nto remaining in compliance.6\n\n      In summation, if Defendants here can show they are no longer violating the\n\nclass members’ federal rights, and the district court has reason to believe Defendants’\n\ncompliance with federal law is durable, then “continued enforcement of the District\n\nCourt’s original order[s] is inequitable within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5), and\n\nrelief is warranted.” Horne, 557 U.S. at 470; see also John B., 710 F.3d at 413;\n\n      6\n        Here, the district court has been involved with this case for three decades. It\nhas personal knowledge of the efforts by the Defendants to meet their obligations and\nthe complexity involved in setting compliance measures.\n                                          49\n\fPetties, 662 F.3d at 570-71. To require more under those circumstances would raise\n\nserious federalism concerns. It also would conflict with the Supreme Court’s\n\nadmonition that a federal consent decree should do no more than remedy a condition\n\nthat violates federal law. Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282. Once the offending condition has\n\nbeen cured, the Court has instructed that responsibility over the state program must\n\nbe returned promptly to the state and its officials. Frew, 540 U.S. at 442; see also\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 450–51 (stating the flexible standard under Rule 60(b)(5) “seeks\n\nto return control to state and local officials as soon as a violation of federal law has\n\nbeen remedied”). And in weighing the equities, the district court should avoid\n\nimposing an inflexible standard that risks depriving future officials of their\n\nlegislative and executive powers. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 449. After all, such\n\ninflexibility is unnecessary to protect the federal interests at the heart of the\n\ninstitutional reform litigation. If the state again violates federal law, victims may file\n\na new lawsuit to bring the state back into compliance. Elected officials may also be\n\nheld accountable to the citizenry through the political process. For all of these\n\nreasons, we conclude that Defendants may satisfy the durability required by Horne in\n\na number of ways, including: by taking specific, long-term actions aimed at curing\n\nthe federal violations, by making good faith efforts to obtain compliance, or by\n\noperating in conformity with federal law for a reasonable period of time.\n\n3.     Application\n\n       Since this case’s inception, the district court has expended considerable effort\n\nand displayed exceptional skill resolving the numerous issues that have arisen.\n\n                                            50\n\fDespite this fine stewardship, two aspects of the ruling on Defendants’ Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotion require us to vacate the June 2016 order and to remand for further\n\nproceedings in the district court.\n\n       First, the district court’s determination that there are no changed circumstances\n\nappears to be inconsistent with its factual findings. Defendants maintain that changed\n\nfactual circumstances warrant relief, including that (a) their obligations have\n\nincreased in number and complexity to the point the obligations have become\n\nsubstantially onerous, (b) they remedied the constitutional violations giving rise to\n\nthis litigation and are in compliance with federal law, and (c) increased costs to\n\nlitigate this case and to provide services to class members have inhibited the State’s\n\nability to fund other important programs such that continued enforcement of the\n\ndecree is contrary to the public interest.\n\n       Although the district court concluded that Defendants “have not presented\n\nsufficient changed circumstances . . . to warrant the requested relief,” Jackson III,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17, the court seemingly endorsed Defendants’ argument that\n\ntheir “task ha[d] become incomprehensible, if not insurmountable,” and recognized\n\nthat their outstanding obligations “are onerous,” id. at *14.7 The court also\n\n\n       7\n         Defendants may have anticipated at the time they entered into the pertinent\ndecrees that the number and complexity of obligations would substantially increase.\nAfter all, their obligations did not become onerous as a result of changed factual\ncircumstances occurring after they entered into the decrees—it was the act of\nentering into the decrees itself that multiplied their obligations. On remand, if the\ndistrict court finds that Defendants anticipated that their obligations would\nsubstantially increase in number and complexity, Defendants would have to “satisfy a\nheavy burden to convince [the] court that [they] agreed to the decree[s] in good faith,\n                                             51\n\facknowledged that the “increasing fees and costs associated with this litigation are\n\ndetrimental to the State’s interest,” that “more than 25 years of orders and\n\nstipulations have restricted the State’s ability to make basic decisions concerning its\n\nbudget,” and that “it is doubtful that the outlay of over 5 million dollars of attorney’s\n\nfees and costs every year is directly assisting” class members. Id. at *16. Indeed, the\n\ndistrict court noted that Defendants have spent more than $50 million related to this\n\nlitigation in the last decade, id. at *12, and that, as of 2009, the average yearly costs\n\nto provide services to class members had risen from $67,290.00 to $135,535.000 per\n\nclass member, while the State’s $32,992.00 per capita income was the ninth lowest in\n\nthe nation, id. at *13.\n\n       Despite accepting these facts advanced by Defendants, the district court\n\nconcluded, without adequate explanation, that the facts did not amount to a\n\nsignificant change in circumstances. But the district court’s conclusion that the\n\nobligations on the Defendants are “onerous” suggests Defendants established a\n\nsignificant change in circumstances under Rufo’s first two prongs for showing a\n\nchange in facts warranting modification—that “changed factual conditions make\n\ncompliance with the decree substantially more onerous” and that “a decree proves to\n\nbe unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles.” See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 384.\n\nSimilarly, the district court’s findings concerning the increased fees and costs, and\n\nhow they have restricted the State’s ability to make decisions about its budget,\n\n\nmade a reasonable effort to comply with the decree[s], and should be relieved of the\nundertaking under Rule 60(b).” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 385.\n                                            52\n\fsuggest that continued enforcement of the decrees is detrimental to the public\n\ninterest. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 447 (explaining that Rule 60(b)(5) “provides a means\n\nby which a party can ask a court to . . . vacate a judgment or order if a significant\n\nchange either in factual conditions or in law renders continued enforcement\n\ndetrimental to the public interest” (internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 448 (“A\n\nstructural reform decree eviscerates a State’s discretionary authority over its own\n\nprogram and budgets and forces state officials to reallocate state resources and\n\nfunds[.]” (quoting Missouri v.

We\n\nremand for further explanation of why these facts do not constitute a significant\n\nchange in circumstances.8\n\n\n      8\n         To be sure, the district court questioned the timing of the changes relative to\nthe Defendants’ pending, August 25, 2015, Rule 60(b)(5) motion. This explanation,\nhowever, may not justify rejecting the conclusion that a significant change in\ncircumstances occurred where (1) Defendants filed a Rule 60(b)(5) motion in 2011\nthat the district court terminated without ruling on the merits of the motion and (2)\nthe district court made no reference to the requirement in Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1) that\na Rule 60(b) motion be “made within a reasonable time.” Of course, on remand, the\ndistrict court is free to perform a Rule 60(c)(1) timeliness analysis and conclude that,\neven in light of the 2011 Rule 60(b)(5) motion, Defendants did not seek relief\n“within a reasonable time” of the change in circumstances upon which they rely.\n                                           53\n\f       Second, federalism concerns are heightened here because the decrees and the\n\ncourt’s continued oversight have “the effect of dictating state . . . budget priorities.”\n\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 448. Despite acknowledging the federalism concerns at play,\n\nincluding the lengthy duration of federal oversight and the budgetary constraints\n\nresulting from continued federal oversight, the district court did not apply the flexible\n\napproach called for by Horne. Under the flexible approach, the district court needed\n\nto inquire whether “the objects of the decree[s] have been attained.” Id. at 452\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court purported to engage in this analysis,\n\nstating that the objects—or “essential purposes”—of the pertinent decrees “are to\n\nprovide class members with adequate health care, a reasonably safe environment, and\n\nsupported employment opportunities.” Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *14. The\n\ncourt then noted that these “more specific” essential purposes are encompassed in the\n\nobligations provided in the pertinent decrees. Id. And because Defendants conceded\n\nthey have not substantially complied with many of those decree obligations, the court\n\ndetermined that Defendants “have not fulfilled the essential purposes of the pertinent\n\ndecrees.” Id.\n\n       Like the Ninth Circuit’s analysis in Horne, the district court’s analysis on this\n\npoint was too narrow, focusing almost entirely on whether defendants had fulfilled\n\nthe numerous, detailed obligations provided in the consent decrees. But because\n\nDefendants move on the ground that continued enforcement of the consent decrees is\n\nno longer equitable, the district court should have “ascertain[ed] whether ongoing\n\nenforcement of the [decrees] was supported by an ongoing violation of federal law,”\n\n                                            54\n\fsee Horne, 557 U.S. at 454—here, whether Defendants are violating class members’\n\nrights under the substantive due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nand under the Rehabilitation Act. The court explicitly declined to make this\n\ndetermination, stating it “is not in the position to assess, and, therefore, cannot\n\nconclude that Defendants are no longer violating constitutional or federal law.”\n\nJackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16. In declining to make this finding, the district\n\ncourt failed to perform an inquiry that we, in accord with both the Sixth Circuit and\n\nthe D.C. Circuit, conclude that Horne requires. See Ohlander, 114 F.3d at 1537 (“A\n\nclear example of an abuse of discretion exists where the trial court fails to consider\n\nthe applicable legal standard[.]”).9\n\n      The district court appears to have focused on whether Defendants substantially\n\ncomplied with the decree obligations, as well as an overly narrow view of the objects\n\nof the consent decree. Substantial compliance with all the obligations in the pertinent\n\ndecrees would likely place New Mexico in compliance with federal law. But the\n\nobligations are merely a means of accomplishing that goal, not the end. See Horne,\n\n557 U.S. at 454–55. On remand, the court should consider the broader question of\n\nwhether the State is meeting the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the\n\nRehabilitation Act by means other than those stated in the consent decrees. See id. at\n\n439. To be sure, the court concluded that “Defendants have not shown that they have\n\nfulfilled their outstanding obligations, ‘by other means.’” Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n      <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n       The burden of showing compliance with federal law is, of course, on the\nDefendants.\n\n                                            55\n\f9777237, at *17 (quoting Horne, 557 U.S. at 439). But the court seemingly focused\n\non whether Defendants have fulfilled their decree obligations by other means, instead\n\nof focusing on the broader question of whether Defendants have fulfilled their\n\nfederal-law obligations to class members by means other than those provided in the\n\ndecrees.10 Such an inquiry is critical not only to determining whether Defendants are\n\nin current compliance with federal law, but also to analyzing whether their\n\ncompliance is durable. In other words, an inquiry into whether Defendants are\n\ncurrently in compliance with federal law is a necessary predicate to any inquiry into\n\nwhether that compliance is more than merely fleeting. Unless the court properly\n\nfocuses its inquiry on compliance with federal law, it cannot analyze whether any\n\nremedy adopted by the state will be effective to maintain such compliance. In turn,\n\nwithout analyzing whether Defendants are in compliance with federal law and, if so,\n\nwhether they are likely to maintain compliance with federal law absent continued\n\noversight, the district court was not in a proper analytical position to determine\n\nwhether Defendants’ proposed modification of terminating the consent decrees was\n\nproperly tailored to any significant change in circumstances. Thus, after first deciding\n\n      10\n          The district court also justified its ruling based on its finding that the\nobligations set forth in the JSD, the Plan of Action, and Appendix A “all flowed from\n[its] original findings of violations in 1990.” Jackson III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9777237</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *15.\nAccepting this finding as true, all it shows is those decrees do not exceed appropriate\nlimits of a federal-court decree. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 450 (stating that “federal-\ncourt decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition\nthat does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation” (quoting\nMilliken v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 282 (1977))). But even a decree that is within\nappropriate bounds may be vacated where changed circumstances make prospective\nenforcement of the decree no longer equitable and where the movant has attained\ncompliance with federal law.\n                                           56\n\fwhether New Mexico is now in compliance with federal law, the district court should\n\nassess whether that compliance is durable, or whether the proposed modification is\n\nnot properly tailored to any change in circumstances because equity weighs in favor\n\nof further federal oversight to assure the protection of the class members’ federal\n\nrights.\n\n          In sum, due to the public interests and federalism concerns, continued\n\nenforcement of the consent decrees is warranted only to the extent Defendants are in\n\ncurrent violation of federal law or have reached only fleeting compliance. We remand\n\nso the district court can make up-to-date findings and determine whether Defendants\n\nare currently violating class members’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act. On remand, the district court should conduct the necessary\n\nproceedings to develop a record that would allow it to make this determination. If the\n\ncourt then concludes Defendants are not violating class members’ rights under\n\nfederal law, the court should assess the durability of that compliance. In the event\n\nthat Defendants have implemented a durable remedy, the court should next address\n\nwhether vacatur of all pertinent orders and termination of this case is appropriate.\n\n                                    III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          We VACATE the district court’s June 2016 Order and REMAND so the court can\n\nmake appropriate findings and conclusions and then reassess the equities under Rule\n\n60(b) with the benefit of those findings and conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\f</pre>",
