Gonyea, challenge the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment in favor of appellee, Mike Kerby. Specifically, appellants contend\n\nthat: (1) the evidence supporting Kerby’s breach-of-contract claim is legally insufficient;\n\nand (2) the attorney’s fees award is improper because Kerby failed to segregate between\n\nrecoverable and unrecoverable fees. We affirm.\n\f                                          I.      BACKGROUND\n\n        In 1994, Kerby contracted with appellants to purchase Lots 21 and 22 of the\n\nGreenfield Ridge development in Alvarado, Texas. This development consisted of\n\n57.575 acres, and Kerby’s lots together comprised 2.262 acres of the development.\n\nWilliam drafted two contracts for deed, signed them, and sent them to Kerby to be\n\nsigned and returned. The parties agreed that Kerby would pay $16,500 for the two lots.\n\nKerby agreed to make a $6,500 down payment and pay off the remaining $10,000\n\nbalance in 180 installments with a 10% interest rate, amounting to a monthly payment\n\nof $107.47.1 However, the crux of this dispute pertains to the language in the contracts\n\npertaining to the mineral estate.\n\n        A review of the two contracts for deed drafted by William shows that they are\n\ndifferent. One of the contracts for deed specifically stated: “NO MINERAL RIGHTS\n\nARE GRANTED ON THIS CONTRACT. ALL MINERAL RIGHTS OWNED BY THE\n\nSELLERS WILL BE CONVEYED TO THE PURCHASERS WHEN THIS NOTE HAS\n\nBEEN PAID IN FULL.” Kerby signed this contract and kept it for his records. The\n\nother contract for deed drafted by William, which Kerby signed and returned to\n\nWilliam, stated: “NO MINERAL RIGHTS ARE GRANTED ON THIS CONTRACT. NO\n\nMINERAL RIGHTS OWNED BY THE SELLERS WILL BE CONVEYED TO THE\n\nPURCHASERS WHEN THIS NOTE HAS BEEN PAID IN FULL.” The parties agree that\n\nthe existence of the two contracts for deed, which contain different language, render\n\n        1   Testimony at trial revealed that William’s original contracts for deed stated that Kerby must\nmake a $6,000 down payment; however, after reviewing the contracts, William later authorized changes\nto reflect that Kerby make a $6,500 down payment.\n\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                   Page 2\n\ftheir agreement ambiguous. Furthermore, both William and Kerby testified at trial and\n\ndisagreed about whether the mineral estate was discussed in the course of the contract\n\nnegotiations.\n\n        In January 2008, Kerby noticed oil and gas activity going on around his property.\n\nIn particular, Kerby testified that oil and gas companies were doing vibration tests and\n\nsome drilling near his property. Kerby subsequently called William and asked about\n\nownership of the mineral rights to the land. William stated that he owned the mineral\n\nrights and that they were not for sale.2\n\n        At this point, Kerby had not finished making the installment payments on the\n\nunderlying contracts for deed. On August 6, 2008, William sent Kerby a letter stating\n\nthat Kerby had completely finished making the installment payments on the underlying\n\ncontract and that William would send Kerby a warranty deed for the lots shortly. On\n\nAugust 13, 2008, William sent Kerby the warranty deed for the lots. In the deed,\n\nWilliam included the following exception to the warranty: “No oil, gas, and mineral\n\nrights are conveyed with this Warranty Deed. This Warranty Deed conveys surface and\n\nsurface rights only as mineral rights have been retained by the Grantor.” This deed was\n\nsubsequently recorded in the Official Public Records of Johnson County, Texas.\n\n\n\n        2 The testimony shows that appellants entered into an oil and gas lease covering the entire\ndevelopment on February 3, 2005. William noted that there were several wells on the development that\nwere producing in paying quantities. He later admitted to receiving $314,757.78 in royalties based on the\noil and gas production from the date of the lease to the date of trial—March 5, 2012.\n\n        In any event, Kerby testified that he thought he was purchasing the surface and mineral rights\nand that he would have offered less money for the lots if he had known he was only purchasing the\nsurface rights. William, on the other hand, stated that he was selling only the surface rights and that he\nwould have requested more money if the mineral rights were included with the sale of the surface rights.\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                    Page 3\n\f        Upon receiving the warranty deed, Kerby’s counsel sent William a demand\n\nletter, requesting that William convey the mineral rights pursuant to the contract for\n\ndeed that William drafted and Kerby kept. William refused to convey the mineral\n\nrights to the lots that Kerby purchased.\n\n        On September 22, 2008, Kerby filed his original petition, alleging breach of\n\ncontract and Texas Business and Commerce Code section 27.01 fraud-in-real-estate\n\ncauses of action. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §27.01(a) (West 2009). Appellants\n\nresponded by filing an original answer, asserting a general denial and affirmative\n\ndefenses of estoppel by contract and fraud, and a counterclaim requesting a declaration\n\nthat appellants own the mineral rights to the lots purchased by Kerby.\n\n        On March 5, 2012, the trial in this matter commenced. At the conclusion of the\n\nevidence, the jury found in favor of Kerby on his breach-of-contract claim.3                               In\n\nparticular, the jury concluded that the evidence established that appellants agreed to\n\nconvey the mineral rights to Lots 21 and 22 to Kerby and failed to comply with the\n\nagreement. The jury awarded Kerby $3,200 in damages and the following amounts in\n\nattorney’s fees:       (1) $30,000 for representation in the trial court; (2) $2,500 for\n\nrepresentation in the court of appeals; (3) $2,500 for representation at the petition for\n\nreview stage in the Supreme Court; (4) $2,500 for representation at the merits briefing\n\nstage in the Supreme Court; and (5) $5,000 for representation through oral argument\n\nand the completion of proceedings in the Supreme Court. Thereafter, the trial court\n\n\n\n        3  Prior to charging the jury, the trial court granted a directed verdict as to Kerby’s fraud-in-real-\nestate claim. Furthermore, appellants agreed to drop their fraud counterclaim.\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                        Page 4\n\fsigned a judgment mirroring the jury’s findings and awarding Kerby an additional\n\n$553.60 in prejudgment interest measured from September 22, 2008, at a rate of 5% per\n\nannum. This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.    THE CONTRACTS FOR DEED\n\n       In their first issue, appellants contend that the evidence supporting the jury\n\nverdict on Kerby’s breach-of-contract claim is legally insufficient.              Specifically,\n\nappellants argue that there is no evidence that the parties mutually assented to the\n\ntransfer of the mineral rights.\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       The test for legal sufficiency is “whether the evidence at trial would enable\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.” City of Keller v.\n\nWilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005).        In making this determination, we credit\n\nfavorable evidence if a reasonable factfinder could and disregard contrary evidence\n\nunless a reasonable factfinder could not. Id. So long as the evidence falls within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the\n\nfactfinder. Id. at 822. The trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses\n\nand the weight to give their testimony. See id. at 819. Although we consider the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the challenged findings, indulging every\n\nreasonable inference that supports them, we may not disregard evidence that allows\n\nonly one inference. Id. at 822.\n\n\n\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                          Page 5\n\fB.     Applicable Law\n\n       The elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid\n\ncontract between plaintiff and defendant; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or tender of\n\nperformance; (3) the defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) the plaintiff’s damage as\n\na result of the breach. Runge v. Raytheon E-Systems, Inc., 57 S.W.3d 562, 565 (Tex. App.—\n\nWaco 2001, no pet.). Settled law establishes that the requisites for a valid contract are:\n\n(1) an offer; (2) an acceptance in strict compliance with the terms of the offer; (3) a\n\nmeeting of the minds; (4) each party’s consent to the terms; and (5) execution and\n\ndelivery of the contract with the intent that it be mutual and binding. Choctaw Props.,\n\nL.L.C. v. Aledo Indep. Sch. Dist., 127 S.W.3d 235, 245 (Tex. App.—Waco 2003, no pet.)\n\n(citing New Caney Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Burnham AutoCountry, Inc., 30 S.W.3d 534, 537 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Texarkana 2000, pet. denied); Copeland v. Alsobrook, 3 S.W.3d 598, 604 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1999, pet. denied)). To determine whether there was a meeting of\n\nthe minds, a court reviews, in an objective fashion, what the parties actually said and\n\ndid without consideration of subjective intent. Id. (citing Burnham AutoCountry, Inc., 30\n\nS.W.3d at 538; Copeland, 3 S.W.3d at 604). “‘The court looks to the communications\n\nbetween the parties and to the acts and circumstances surrounding those\n\ncommunications.” Id. (quoting Copeland, 3 S.W.3d at 605).\n\n       In arguing that there was not a meeting of the minds regarding the mineral estate\n\nassociated with Lots 21 and 22, appellants rely heavily on extrinsic evidence. Moreover,\n\nat trial, the parties agreed that the contracts for deed were ambiguous. Accordingly,\n\nwhen construing a written agreement, we must ascertain and give effect to the parties’\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                     Page 6\n\fintentions as expressed in the agreement. Frost Nat’l Bank v. L&F Distribs., Ltd., 165\n\nS.W.3d 310, 311-12 (Tex. 2005) (per curiam); Carbona v. CH Med., Inc., 266 S.W.3d 675,\n\n680 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.). We discern intent from the agreement itself, and\n\nthe agreement must be enforced as written. Deep Nines, Inc. v. McAfee, Inc., 246 S.W.3d\n\n842, 846 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.). We consider the entire writing and attempt\n\nto harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract by analyzing the\n\nprovisions with reference to the whole agreement. Frost Nat’l Bank, 165 S.W.3d at 312.\n\nIn doing so, we will “‘avoid when possible and proper a construction which is\n\nunreasonable, inequitable, and oppressive.’” Id. (quoting Reilly v. Rangers Mgmt., Inc.,\n\n727 S.W.2d 527, 530 (Tex. 1987)). And, it is a rule of construction of deeds that they are\n\nto be most strongly construed against the grantor and in favor of the grantee; this rule\n\napplies to reservations and exceptions. See Commerce Trust Co. v. Lyon, 284 S.W.2d 920,\n\n921 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1955, no writ); see also Key Prod. Co. v. Quality\n\nOperating, Inc., No. 10-10-00379-CV, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4074, at *10 (Tex. App.—\n\nWaco Mar. 28, 2013, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n       When a written contract is so worded that it can be given a certain or definite\n\nlegal meaning or interpretation, it is not ambiguous, and the court construes it as a\n\nmatter of law. Am. Mftrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 157 (Tex. 2003). On\n\nthe other hand, a contract is ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or\n\nis reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.         Heritage Res., Inc. v.\n\nNationsBank, 939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex. 1996). This determination is made in light of the\n\ncircumstances present when the parties entered into the contract. Ganske v. Spence, 129\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                     Page 7\n\fS.W.3d 701, 707 (Tex. App.—Waco 2004, no pet.) (citing Grimes v. Andrews, 997 S.W.2d\n\n877, 881 (Tex. App.—Waco 1999, no pet.)). An ambiguity does not arise simply because\n\nthe parties advance conflicting interpretations of the contract.              Columbia Gas\n\nTransmission Corp. v. New Ulm Gas, Ltd., 940 S.W.2d 587, 589 (Tex. 1996).             For an\n\nambiguity to exist, both interpretations must be reasonable. Id.\n\n       Further, extrinsic evidence of intent is admissible only if the deed is ambiguous\n\non its face. See Friendswood Dev. Co. v. McDade & Co., 926 S.W.2d 280, 283 (Tex. 1996); see\n\nalso CenterPoint Energy Houston Elec., L.L.P. v. Old TJC Co., 177 S.W.3d 425, 431 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied) (“A court may consider the parties’\n\ninterpretations of the contract through extrinsic or parol evidence only after a contract is\n\nfirst determined to be ambiguous.”).          A mere disagreement about the proper\n\ninterpretation of a contract, however, does not make the contract ambiguous; the\n\ninstrument is ambiguous only if, after application of the rules of construction, the\n\ncontract is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning. Brown v. Havard, 593\n\nS.W.2d 939, 942 (Tex. 1980); Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Daniel, 150 Tex. 513, 243\n\nS.W.2d 154, 157 (1951).\n\n       Moreover, the Texas Supreme Court has also held that “all writings that pertain\n\nto the same transaction will be considered together, even if they were executed at\n\ndifferent times and do not expressly refer to one another.” DeWitt County Elec. Coop.,\n\nInc. v. Parks, 1 S.W.3d 96, 102 (Tex. 1999); see Miles v. Martin, 159 Tex. 336, 321 S.W.2d 62,\n\n65 (1959) (“It is well settled that separate instruments executed at the same time,\n\nbetween the same parties, and relating to the same subject matter may be considered\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                         Page 8\n\ftogether and construed as one contract.”); GPA Holding, Inc. v. Baylor Health Care Sys.,\n\n344 S.W.3d 467, 471 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied); see also McDowell v. Bier, No.\n\n2-09-231-CV, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 2546, at **9-10 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 8, 2010,\n\nno pet.) (mem. op.). The supreme court cautioned, however, “that this rule is simply a\n\ndevice for ascertaining and giving effect to the intention of the parties and cannot be\n\napplied arbitrarily.” Parks, 1 S.W.3d at 102 (citing Miles, 321 S.W.2d at 65).\n\nC.      Discussion\n\n        Because of the existence of the two differing contracts for deed, and because of\n\nthe conflicting testimony from Kerby and William regarding whether the mineral estate\n\nwas considered in the contract negotiations, appellants argue that the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to establish a meeting of the minds. In essence, appellants challenge only\n\none element of Kerby’s breach-of-contract claim—the existence of a valid contract\n\nbetween the parties.\n\n        The record reflects that William drafted, signed, and sent two contracts for deed\n\nto Kerby, one of which stated that the mineral rights would be conveyed to Kerby once\n\nthe contract was paid in full. Kerby signed the contracts and fully performed. Given\n\nthis evidence, we are not persuaded by appellants’ argument that the parties did not\n\nhave a meeting of the minds or, in other words, a valid contract.4 Further, we must\n\n\n\n        4 We do not believe that either contract for deed, when read alone, is ambiguous. See Am. Mftrs.\n\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154, 157 (Tex. 2003); see also Heritage Res., Inc. v. NationsBank, 939\nS.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex. 1996). The purported ambiguity resulted from trying to read both contracts for\ndeed together. However, the jury was posed with the task of essentially choosing which contract for\ndeed encapsulated the parties’ agreement. And the jury ultimately concluded that, based on the\nevidence, the contract for deed that William drafted and Kerby signed and kept memorialized the parties’\nagreement. Therefore, even if we were to read both contracts for deed together, we must construe the\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                      Page 9\n\femphasize the fact that William drafted both of the contracts for deeds, and Texas law\n\nprovides that contracts are to be construed against the drafter. See AT&T Corp. v.\n\nRylander, 2 S.W.3d 546, 559 (Tex. App—Austin 1999, pet. denied) (“As a general rule,\n\nwritings are construed strictly against the author and in a manner so as to reach a\n\nreasonable result that is consistent with the intent of the parties.”); Lyon, 284 S.W.2d at\n\n921; see also Key Prod. Co., 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4074, at *10.\n\n        In addition, we believe that the existence of the second contract for deed that\n\ndiffered from the one kept by Kerby and Kerby’s and William’s conflicting testimony\n\nabout the contract negotiations constituted parol evidence about the surrounding\n\ncircumstances of the contract negotiations and merely created fact issues, which are\n\nwithin the province of the jury to resolve.5 See Wilson, 168 S.W.3d at 819. Clearly, in\n\nconcluding that the parties agreed that Kerby would receive the mineral rights once the\n\ncontract was paid in full, the jury believed that the contract that William drafted and\n\nKerby kept, rather than the contract signed by Kerby and returned to William,\n\nencapsulated the parties’ agreement.              See id.     Ultimately, the jury’s conclusion is\n\nsupported by the contract for deed that was kept by Kerby.\n\n        Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict,\n\nwe cannot say that the jury was unreasonable in concluding that the parties agreed that\n\ncontracts against William and conclude that Kerby is entitled to the mineral rights to Lots 21 and 22. See\nAT&T Corp. v. Rylander, 2 S.W.3d 546, 559 (Tex. App—Austin 1999, pet. denied); Commerce Trust Co. v.\nLyon, 284 S.W.2d 920, 921 (Tex. Civ. App.—Fort Worth 1955, no writ); see also Key Prod. Co. v. Quality\nOperating, Inc., No. 10-10-00379-CV, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4074, at *10 (Tex. App.—Waco Mar. 28, 2013,\nno pet.) (mem. op.). The existence of the second contract for deed does not somehow invalidate the first.\n\n        5 At trial, William, a retired college professor who has participated in approximately seventy real-\nestate transactions, explained that the contract for deed tendered to Kerby contained a mistake\nattributable to William’s computer program.\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                     Page 10\n\fKerby would receive the mineral rights upon completion of the contract and that\n\nappellants’ failure to convey the mineral rights upon Kerby’s completion of the contract\n\namounted to a breach of contract.

ATTORNEY’S FEES\n\n         In their second issue, appellants complain about the attorney’s fees awarded to\n\nKerby.     In particular, appellant contend that the attorney’s fees award should be\n\nreversed because Kerby failed to segregate his fees. Kerby responds that he was not\n\nrequired to segregate his attorney’s fees because he alleged two causes of action—\n\nbreach of contract and fraud-in-real-estate—that are “inextricably intertwined.”\n\nA.       Error Preservation\n\n         A party seeking to recover attorney's fees is “required to segregate fees between\n\nclaims for which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006); accord NP Anderson Cotton Exch.,\n\nL.P. v. Potter, 230 S.W.3d 457, 466 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2007, no pet.). Conversely,\n\nthe opposing party must properly preserve for appellate review a contention that the\n\nfee claimant failed to segregate the fees sought. Green Int'l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384,\n\n389 (Tex. 1997); Cullins v. Foster, 171 S.W.3d 521, 535-36 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2005, pet. denied); Cont'l Dredging, Inc. v. De-Kaizered, Inc., 120 S.W.3d 380, 397\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                       Page 11\n\f(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2003, pet. denied). Generally, such an issue is preserved by\n\nobjection during testimony offered in support of attorney's fees or an objection to the\n\njury question on attorney's fees. See Cullins, 171 S.W.3d at 535-36; Cont’l Dredging, Inc.,\n\n120 S.W.3d at 397.\n\n       Here, appellants objected to testimony provided by Kerby’s trial counsel\n\nregarding attorney’s fees. Appellants argued that trial counsel’s attorney’s fees figure\n\nwas inaccurate given that the trial court directed a verdict on Kerby’s fraud-in-real-\n\nestate claim. Appellants also objected to the charge questions about attorney’s fees on\n\nthe basis of segregation. Given this, we conclude that appellant has preserved this issue\n\nfor review. See Cullins, 171 S.W.3d at 535-36; Cont’l Dredging, Inc., 120 S.W.3d at 397.\n\nB.     The “Inextricably Intertwined” Exception to the Segregation of Attorney’s Fees\n\n       “[T]he need to segregate fees is a question of law.” Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 312. The\n\ncourts of appeals have generally (though not always) applied a de novo standard of\n\nreview. Id. Nonetheless, “it may often be impossible to state as a matter of law the\n\nextent to which certain claims can or cannot be segregated; the issue is more a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact for the jury.” Id.\n\n       As noted above, Kerby argues that he did not have to segregate his attorney’s\n\nfees because his breach-of-contract and fraud-in-real-estate claims are “inextricably\n\nintertwined.” Texas courts have held that a party requesting attorney’s fees is required\n\nto exclude fees that are not earned in pursuing claims presented during trial of the case.\n\nSee Chilton Ins. Co. v. Pate & Pate Enters., Inc., 930 S.W.2d 877, 896 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio 1996, writ denied) (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10-11\n\nGonyea v.

App.—Corpus Christi Dec. 21, 2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.). However, an\n\nexception to the segregation requirement applies when the attorney’s fees incurred are\n\nrendered in connection with claims arising from the same transaction or occurrence and\n\nare so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially\n\nthe same facts. Ski River Dev., Inc. v. McCalla, 167 S.W.3d 121, 143 (Tex. App.—Waco\n\n2005, pet. denied) (citing Stewart Title Guar. Co., 822 S.W.2d at 11); see Chapa, 212 S.W.3d\n\nat 313-14 (noting that “a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\n\n[And] . . . it is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n\nunrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated”).\n\n        Here, Kerby’s claims involved: (1) contracts for deed pertaining to real estate, (2)\n\nin which appellants and Kerby were parties, (3) where appellants made representations\n\nto Kerby regarding the conveyance of mineral rights associated with Lots 21 and 22, (4)\n\nwhere appellants failed to convey the mineral rights purportedly covered by their\n\nagreement with Kerby, and (5) which resulted in injury to Kerby.                             Based on the\n\nforegoing, we conclude that both of Kerby’s claims arose from the same transaction or\n\noccurrence and involved “essentially the same facts.” See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313-14;\n\nStewart Title Guar. Co., 822 S.W.2d at 11; see also McCalla, 167 S.W.3d at 143.\n\nAccordingly, Kerby was not required to segregate his fees.6 See Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n\n\n        6Appellants also suggest that Kerby should have segregated his fees because the trial court\ngranted a directed verdict as to Kerby’s fraud-in-real-estate claim. See Int’l Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Finck, 496\nS.W.2d 544, 546-47 (Tex. 1973) (holding that attorney’s fees are recoverable only for authorized claims).\nWe do not find this argument to be persuasive given our conclusion that the facts involved in Kerby’s\ntwo causes of action are “inextricably intertwined” and because both causes of action permitted the\n\nGonyea v.

Gonyea, challenge the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment in favor of appellee, Mike Kerby. Specifically, appellants contend\n\nthat: (1) the evidence supporting Kerby’s breach-of-contract claim is legally insufficient;\n\nand (2) the attorney’s fees award is improper because Kerby failed to segregate between\n\nrecoverable and unrecoverable fees. We affirm.\n\f                                          I.      BACKGROUND\n\n        In 1994, Kerby contracted with appellants to purchase Lots 21 and 22 of the\n\nGreenfield Ridge development in Alvarado, Texas. This development consisted of\n\n57.575 acres, and Kerby’s lots together comprised 2.262 acres of the development.\n\nWilliam drafted two contracts for deed, signed them, and sent them to Kerby to be\n\nsigned and returned. The parties agreed that Kerby would pay $16,500 for the two lots.\n\nKerby agreed to make a $6,500 down payment and pay off the remaining $10,000\n\nbalance in 180 installments with a 10% interest rate, amounting to a monthly payment\n\nof $107.47.1 However, the crux of this dispute pertains to the language in the contracts\n\npertaining to the mineral estate.\n\n        A review of the two contracts for deed drafted by William shows that they are\n\ndifferent. One of the contracts for deed specifically stated: “NO MINERAL RIGHTS\n\nARE GRANTED ON THIS CONTRACT. ALL MINERAL RIGHTS OWNED BY THE\n\nSELLERS WILL BE CONVEYED TO THE PURCHASERS WHEN THIS NOTE HAS\n\nBEEN PAID IN FULL.” Kerby signed this contract and kept it for his records. The\n\nother contract for deed drafted by William, which Kerby signed and returned to\n\nWilliam, stated: “NO MINERAL RIGHTS ARE GRANTED ON THIS CONTRACT. NO\n\nMINERAL RIGHTS OWNED BY THE SELLERS WILL BE CONVEYED TO THE\n\nPURCHASERS WHEN THIS NOTE HAS BEEN PAID IN FULL.” The parties agree that\n\nthe existence of the two contracts for deed, which contain different language, render\n\n        1   Testimony at trial revealed that William’s original contracts for deed stated that Kerby must\nmake a $6,000 down payment; however, after reviewing the contracts, William later authorized changes\nto reflect that Kerby make a $6,500 down payment.\n\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                   Page 2\n\ftheir agreement ambiguous. Furthermore, both William and Kerby testified at trial and\n\ndisagreed about whether the mineral estate was discussed in the course of the contract\n\nnegotiations.\n\n        In January 2008, Kerby noticed oil and gas activity going on around his property.\n\nIn particular, Kerby testified that oil and gas companies were doing vibration tests and\n\nsome drilling near his property. Kerby subsequently called William and asked about\n\nownership of the mineral rights to the land. William stated that he owned the mineral\n\nrights and that they were not for sale.2\n\n        At this point, Kerby had not finished making the installment payments on the\n\nunderlying contracts for deed. On August 6, 2008, William sent Kerby a letter stating\n\nthat Kerby had completely finished making the installment payments on the underlying\n\ncontract and that William would send Kerby a warranty deed for the lots shortly. On\n\nAugust 13, 2008, William sent Kerby the warranty deed for the lots. In the deed,\n\nWilliam included the following exception to the warranty: “No oil, gas, and mineral\n\nrights are conveyed with this Warranty Deed. This Warranty Deed conveys surface and\n\nsurface rights only as mineral rights have been retained by the Grantor.” This deed was\n\nsubsequently recorded in the Official Public Records of Johnson County, Texas.\n\n\n\n        2 The testimony shows that appellants entered into an oil and gas lease covering the entire\ndevelopment on February 3, 2005. William noted that there were several wells on the development that\nwere producing in paying quantities. He later admitted to receiving $314,757.78 in royalties based on the\noil and gas production from the date of the lease to the date of trial—March 5, 2012.\n\n        In any event, Kerby testified that he thought he was purchasing the surface and mineral rights\nand that he would have offered less money for the lots if he had known he was only purchasing the\nsurface rights. William, on the other hand, stated that he was selling only the surface rights and that he\nwould have requested more money if the mineral rights were included with the sale of the surface rights.\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                    Page 3\n\f        Upon receiving the warranty deed, Kerby’s counsel sent William a demand\n\nletter, requesting that William convey the mineral rights pursuant to the contract for\n\ndeed that William drafted and Kerby kept. William refused to convey the mineral\n\nrights to the lots that Kerby purchased.\n\n        On September 22, 2008, Kerby filed his original petition, alleging breach of\n\ncontract and Texas Business and Commerce Code section 27.01 fraud-in-real-estate\n\ncauses of action. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §27.01(a) (West 2009). Appellants\n\nresponded by filing an original answer, asserting a general denial and affirmative\n\ndefenses of estoppel by contract and fraud, and a counterclaim requesting a declaration\n\nthat appellants own the mineral rights to the lots purchased by Kerby.\n\n        On March 5, 2012, the trial in this matter commenced. At the conclusion of the\n\nevidence, the jury found in favor of Kerby on his breach-of-contract claim.3                               In\n\nparticular, the jury concluded that the evidence established that appellants agreed to\n\nconvey the mineral rights to Lots 21 and 22 to Kerby and failed to comply with the\n\nagreement. The jury awarded Kerby $3,200 in damages and the following amounts in\n\nattorney’s fees:       (1) $30,000 for representation in the trial court; (2) $2,500 for\n\nrepresentation in the court of appeals; (3) $2,500 for representation at the petition for\n\nreview stage in the Supreme Court; (4) $2,500 for representation at the merits briefing\n\nstage in the Supreme Court; and (5) $5,000 for representation through oral argument\n\nand the completion of proceedings in the Supreme Court. Thereafter, the trial court\n\n\n\n        3  Prior to charging the jury, the trial court granted a directed verdict as to Kerby’s fraud-in-real-\nestate claim. Furthermore, appellants agreed to drop their fraud counterclaim.\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                        Page 4\n\fsigned a judgment mirroring the jury’s findings and awarding Kerby an additional\n\n$553.60 in prejudgment interest measured from September 22, 2008, at a rate of 5% per\n\nannum. This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.    THE CONTRACTS FOR DEED\n\n       In their first issue, appellants contend that the evidence supporting the jury\n\nverdict on Kerby’s breach-of-contract claim is legally insufficient.              Specifically,\n\nappellants argue that there is no evidence that the parties mutually assented to the\n\ntransfer of the mineral rights.\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       The test for legal sufficiency is “whether the evidence at trial would enable\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.” City of Keller v.\n\nWilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (Tex. 2005).        In making this determination, we credit\n\nfavorable evidence if a reasonable factfinder could and disregard contrary evidence\n\nunless a reasonable factfinder could not. Id. So long as the evidence falls within the\n\nzone of reasonable disagreement, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the\n\nfactfinder. Id. at 822. The trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses\n\nand the weight to give their testimony. See id. at 819.

Applicable Law\n\n       The elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) the existence of a valid\n\ncontract between plaintiff and defendant; (2) the plaintiff’s performance or tender of\n\nperformance; (3) the defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) the plaintiff’s damage as\n\na result of the breach.

Discussion\n\n        Because of the existence of the two differing contracts for deed, and because of\n\nthe conflicting testimony from Kerby and William regarding whether the mineral estate\n\nwas considered in the contract negotiations, appellants argue that the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to establish a meeting of the minds. In essence, appellants challenge only\n\none element of Kerby’s breach-of-contract claim—the existence of a valid contract\n\nbetween the parties.\n\n        The record reflects that William drafted, signed, and sent two contracts for deed\n\nto Kerby, one of which stated that the mineral rights would be conveyed to Kerby once\n\nthe contract was paid in full. Kerby signed the contracts and fully performed. Given\n\nthis evidence, we are not persuaded by appellants’ argument that the parties did not\n\nhave a meeting of the minds or, in other words, a valid contract.4 Further, we must\n\n\n\n        4 We do not believe that either contract for deed, when read alone, is ambiguous.

The purported ambiguity resulted from trying to read both contracts for\ndeed together. However, the jury was posed with the task of essentially choosing which contract for\ndeed encapsulated the parties’ agreement. And the jury ultimately concluded that, based on the\nevidence, the contract for deed that William drafted and Kerby signed and kept memorialized the parties’\nagreement. Therefore, even if we were to read both contracts for deed together, we must construe the\n\nGonyea v. Kerby                                                                                      Page 9\n\femphasize the fact that William drafted both of the contracts for deeds, and Texas law\n\nprovides that contracts are to be construed against the drafter.

Co., 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 4074, at *10.\n\n        In addition, we believe that the existence of the second contract for deed that\n\ndiffered from the one kept by Kerby and Kerby’s and William’s conflicting testimony\n\nabout the contract negotiations constituted parol evidence about the surrounding\n\ncircumstances of the contract negotiations and merely created fact issues, which are\n\nwithin the province of the jury to resolve.5 See Wilson, 168 S.W.3d at 819. Clearly, in\n\nconcluding that the parties agreed that Kerby would receive the mineral rights once the\n\ncontract was paid in full, the jury believed that the contract that William drafted and\n\nKerby kept, rather than the contract signed by Kerby and returned to William,\n\nencapsulated the parties’ agreement.              See id.     Ultimately, the jury’s conclusion is\n\nsupported by the contract for deed that was kept by Kerby.\n\n        Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict,\n\nwe cannot say that the jury was unreasonable in concluding that the parties agreed that\n\ncontracts against William and conclude that Kerby is entitled to the mineral rights to Lots 21 and 22.

Appellants argued that trial counsel’s attorney’s fees figure\n\nwas inaccurate given that the trial court directed a verdict on Kerby’s fraud-in-real-\n\nestate claim. Appellants also objected to the charge questions about attorney’s fees on\n\nthe basis of segregation. Given this, we conclude that appellant has preserved this issue\n\nfor review.

The\n\ncourts of appeals have generally (though not always) applied a de novo standard of\n\nreview. Id. Nonetheless, “it may often be impossible to state as a matter of law the\n\nextent to which certain claims can or cannot be segregated; the issue is more a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact for the jury.” Id.\n\n       As noted above, Kerby argues that he did not have to segregate his attorney’s\n\nfees because his breach-of-contract and fraud-in-real-estate claims are “inextricably\n\nintertwined.” Texas courts have held that a party requesting attorney’s fees is required\n\nto exclude fees that are not earned in pursuing claims presented during trial of the case.\n\nSee Chilton Ins.
