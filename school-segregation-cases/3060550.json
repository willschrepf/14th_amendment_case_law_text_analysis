Helms raises eight issues regarding the trial\ncourt’s refusal to file additional findings of fact, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the awards\nof property and attorney’s fees. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n       In 2006, Swansen purchased a new “park model” mobile home and moved it onto a lot in\nSpring Lake Mobile Home Park, which is owned by Helms. Swansen moved to Kansas when\nshe married in January 2008, leaving her mobile home in Helms’s park. Swansen and Helms had\nan oral agreement that Helms would try to sell the mobile home. A disagreement as to the terms\nof that agreement and ownership of the mobile home led to litigation. Trial was before the court,\nwhich rendered judgment that the home belongs to Swansen.\n\n\n                  ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n       In her first issue, Helms contends the trial court erred in failing to file additional findings\nof fact and conclusions of law when she requested them. She asserts that the court’s initial\nfindings do not include findings on what the terms of the contract were, what term was breached,\n\for what consideration was given by each party. Citing Rule of Civil Procedure 298, Helms\nargues that, because no findings or conclusions can be deemed or presumed by the court’s failure\nto make additional findings or conclusions, the failure to find the missing essential elements of\nthe claim for breach of contract results in a take nothing judgment.\nApplicable Law\n         If timely requested, the trial court “shall file any additional or amended findings and\nconclusions that are appropriate.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 298. Additional findings are not required if\nthe original findings and conclusions properly and succinctly relate the ultimate findings of fact\nand law necessary to apprise the party of adequate information for the preparation of the party’s\nappeal. Pakdimounivong v. City of Arlington, 219 S.W.3d 401, 412 (Tex. App.−Fort Worth\n2006, pet. denied). An ultimate fact is one that would have a direct effect on the judgment. Id.\nThe controlling issue is whether the circumstances of the particular case require the party to\nguess at the reasons for the trial court’s decision. In re Marriage of C.A.S. & D.P.S., 405\nS.W.3d 373, 382 (Tex. App.−Dallas 2013, no pet.). If the refusal to file additional findings does\nnot prevent a party from adequately presenting an argument on appeal, there is no reversible\nerror.    Flanary v. Mills, 150 S.W.3d 785, 792 (Tex. App.−Austin 2004, pet. denied).\nFurthermore, if the requested findings will not result in a different judgment, they need not be\nmade. Id.\nAnalysis\n         At Helms’s request, the trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The\npertinent findings are as follows:\n\n\n                          3. While the park model home was still located at such park space at a\n                time less than four years before the commencement of the instant lawsuit when\n                the parties entered into a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of\n                mutual promises under which Defendant agreed to find a buyer for the park\n                model home.\n                          5. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that to facilitate the sale of the\n                park model home pursuant to their agreement, Plaintiff should sign the title to\n                the said park model home in blank, and leave such signed title in the possession\n                and care of the Defendant, which Plaintiff did with the understanding that the\n                defendant would complete the application for title by adding the name of the\n                buyer at the time when a buyer was located and payment therefor was received\n                so as to transfer such title to such buyer.\n                          6. In May 2010, after the conclusion of litigation in a justice court in\n                Smith County, Texas which had resulted in a judgment unfavorable to\n                Defendant, without the knowledge or consent of the Plaintiff, and without\n\n\n\n\n                                                        2\n\f               payment of any consideration, the Defendant breached the oral contract to hold\n               such title until a buyer could be found.\n                         7. In May 2010 the Defendant, unilaterally and without the payment of\n               any consideration for the sale of such park model home, wrongfully affixed her\n               own name to the application for title as Buyer and then remitted the title to the\n               said park model home to the State of Texas further breaching such oral contract\n               and resulting in the issuance of a new certificate of title by the state of Texas\n               reflecting Defendant as owner.\n                         8. That Plaintiff gave defendant the proper notices and demands\n               necessary under the statute to invoke the provisions of Tex Civ Prac and Rem\n               Code Ann Sec. 38.001 et seq. regarding the recovery of reasonable attorney’s\n               fees in cases based upon the breach of an oral contract.\n\n\n\n\n       The pertinent conclusions of law are as follows:\n\n\n                         1. The court finds that as a result of the existence of the oral contract\n               between the parties and the subsequent breach of the contract by the Defendant,\n               the Plaintiff sustained damages, and is therefore entitled to judgment relief . . . .\n                         3. That Plaintiff is entitled under the law to judgment for the recovery\n               of reasonable attorney’s fees necessarily incurred on her behalf in this action as\n               a result of Defendant’s breach of the oral contract . . . .\n\n\n       Thereafter, Helms filed a request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law on\nthe following issues:\n\n\n                        1.   The consideration given by each party to the contract.\n                        2.   The material terms of the contract between the parties.\n                        3.   Which material term was breached, and by what specific act.\n                        4.   The date the claim for breach of contract was presented to the\n                             Defendant under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.002.\n\n\n       Helms’s requested findings and conclusions 1 and 2 are subsumed by the trial court’s\noriginal finding of fact 3 and conclusion of law 1. Further, her requested finding and conclusion\n3 is addressed in the trial court’s original findings. Finding of fact number 6 specifically states\nthat Helms breached the oral contract to hold the title until a buyer could be found. Finding of\nfact number 7 states that Helms further breached the agreement by affixing her name to the\napplication for title as buyer. Further, Helms’s requested additional finding and conclusion 4 is\nsubsumed under original finding of fact 8 and conclusion of law 3. Moreover, under these\ncircumstances, Helms was not required to guess at the reasons for the trial court’s decision. See\nIn re Marriage of C.A.S. & D.P.S., 405 S.W.3d at 382. Finally, none of the requested additional\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n\ffindings or conclusions would have resulted in a different judgment and therefore need not have\nbeen made. See Flanary, 150 S.W.3d at 792. We overrule Helms’s first issue.\n\n\n                                     SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n       In her second issue, Helms asserts that there is no evidence of consideration to support\nthe oral contract. Specifically, she argues that while she agreed to find a buyer for Swansen, the\nagreement required no obligation on Swansen’s part. In her third issue, Helms contends the\ncontract is insufficiently definite to be enforceable. She asserts that the contract is so vague as to\nbe meaningless and “there is absolutely no guidance as to what the obligations of the plaintiff\nwould be.” In her fourth issue, Helms contends there is no evidence that she breached the\ncontract. She asserts it is difficult to determine what the contractual obligations of the parties\nwere, but argues that putting her name on the title was not a breach of the parties’ agreement.\nShe further argues that the terms of a contract are determined at the time of the original\nformation and their original agreement did not include “anything about the title.” Therefore, she\nargues, an additional requirement that Helms not affix her name to the title would require\nadditional consideration.\nStandard of Review\n       In an appeal of a judgment rendered after a bench trial, the trial court’s findings of fact\nhave the same weight as a jury’s verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency of the\nevidence used to support them just as we would review a jury’s findings. In re Doe, 19 S.W.3d\n249, 253 (Tex. 2000). When challenged, a trial court’s findings of fact are not conclusive, if as\nin the present case, there is a complete reporter’s record. In re K.R.P., 80 S.W.3d 669, 673 (Tex.\nApp.−Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). A party who challenges the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence to support an issue upon which it did not have the burden of proof at trial must\ndemonstrate on appeal that there is no evidence to support the adverse finding. G.D. Holdings,\nInc. v. H.D.H. Land & Timber, L.P., 407 S.W.3d 856, 860 (Tex. App.−Tyler 2013, no pet.).\nWhen reviewing a no evidence issue, we determine whether the evidence at trial would enable\nreasonable and fair minded people to reach the verdict under review. City of Keller v. Wilson,\n168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005). In making this determination, we must credit favorable\nevidence if a reasonable finder of fact could and disregard contrary evidence unless a reasonable\nfinder of fact could not. Id. If there is any evidence of probative force to support the finding,\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fi.e., more than a scintilla, we will overrule the issue. City of Houston v. Hildebrandt, 265\nS.W.3d 22, 27 (Tex. App.−Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).\n       We are mindful that the trier of fact is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses\nand weight to be given their testimony. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819. When there is\nconflicting evidence, it is the province of the trier of fact to resolve such conflicts. Id. at 820. In\nevery circumstance in which a reasonable trier of fact could resolve conflicting evidence either\nway, the reviewing court must presume it did so in favor of the prevailing party, and disregard\nthe conflicting evidence in its sufficiency review. Id. at 821.\nApplicable Law\n       The elements of a breach of contract claim include (1) the existence of a valid contract,\n(2) performance or tendered performance, (3) breach of the contract, and (4) damage as a result\nof the breach. See Critchfield v. Smith, 151 S.W.3d 225, 233 (Tex. App.−Tyler 2004, pet.\ndenied). The plaintiff is required to prove the following elements underlying the formation of a\nvalid and binding contract: (1) an offer, (2) acceptance in strict compliance with the terms of the\noffer, (3) a meeting of the minds, (4) each party’s consent to the terms, and (5) execution and\ndelivery of the contract with the intent that it be mutual and binding. Id.\n       Consideration is also a fundamental element of every valid contract. Id. Consideration\nmay consist of some right, interest, profit, or benefit that accrues to one party, or, alternatively,\nof some forbearance, loss, or responsibility that is undertaken or incurred by the other party. In\nre C & H News Co., 133 S.W.3d 642, 647 (Tex. App.−Corpus Christi 2003, orig. proceeding).\nApplication of the consideration requirement depends in part on the nature of the contract. A\nbilateral contract is one in which there are mutual promises between two parties to the contract,\neach being both a promisor and a promisee. Hutchings v. Slemons, 174 S.W.2d 487, 489 (Tex.\n1943). Thus, valid consideration for a bilateral contract involves mutuality of obligation. In re\nPalm Harbor Homes, Inc., 129 S.W.3d 636, 643 (Tex. App.−Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, orig.\nproceeding).\n       In determining the existence of an oral contract, the court looks to the communications\nbetween the parties and to the acts and circumstances surrounding those communications.\nCritchfield, 151 S.W.3d at 233. Questions of contract formation must be resolved on objective\nstandards, looking to the meaning reasonably conveyed by the parties’ actions and words, rather\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fthan their uncommunicated subjective intentions. Harrison v. Williams Dental Grp., P.C., 140\nS.W.3d 912, 916 (Tex. App.−Dallas 2004, no pet.).\n       Whether an agreement fails for indefiniteness is a question of law to be determined by the\ncourt. Fiduciary Fin. Servs. of the Sw., Inc. v. Corilant Fin., L.P., 376 S.W.3d 253, 256 (Tex.\nApp.−Dallas 2012, pet. denied). A contract is legally binding when its terms are sufficiently\ndefinite to enable a court to understand the parties’ legal obligations. Fort Worth Indep. Sch.\nDist. v. City of Fort Worth, 22 S.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000). Contract terms are reasonably\ncertain when they provide a basis for determining the existence of a breach and for giving an\nappropriate remedy. Corilant Fin., L.P., 376 S.W.3d at 256. If the essential terms are so\nuncertain that there is no basis for deciding whether the agreement has been kept or broken, there\nis no contract. Id.\nAnalysis\n       Swansen testified that she and Helms had an oral agreement that she would leave the\nhome in Helms’s park and Helms would try to sell the mobile home for Swansen. Swansen\nnever agreed for Helms to take the mobile home for any purpose other than to resell it. Swansen\nwanted $50,000.00 for the home, but Helms was authorized to gradually, over time, lower the\nasking price. Swansen testified that “[i]t was understood that when [Helms] is going to sell it,\nshe is going to get her lot rent back, however much it was.” Swansen explained that she did not\nwant to risk losing the title in the mail so she signed the title in Helms’s presence, leaving the\nnew owner’s name blank, and left it with Helms before she moved to Kansas. Helms was to add\nthe new owner’s name to the title when she found a buyer. Swansen testified that she did not\ngive the title to Helms to convey the home to Helms. At the time Swansen moved out, she paid\n$250.00 per month in lot rent. According to Swansen, it was understood that she did not have to\npay lot rent after she moved out. Further, Helms did not owe Swansen any money until she sold\nthe home. Swansen testified that Helms was to take lot rent out of the buyer’s payments.\n       Helms testified that when Swansen moved out in January 2008, she agreed to try to sell\nthe home for Swansen. According to Helms, Swansen could not afford to move the home.\nAlthough conclusively disproved by other evidence, Helms said that Swansen owed her\n$1,800.00 in back rent when she moved out. Helms testified that, as part of the agreement,\nHelms would receive any lot rent still owed when the home sold. Accordingly, she did not\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fexpect Swansen to pay back rent until the home sold. However, Helms said she was not able to\nsell the home.\n       Contrary to Swansen’s testimony, Helms testified that Swansen did not give her the title\nat the time they made the agreement that Helms would try to sell the home. Helms testified that\nSwansen called her in May 2008, after Swansen had moved to Kansas, told her she was filing for\nbankruptcy, and said she could not repay the debt she owed Helms. Helms stated that Swansen\nwanted to sign the home over to Helms at that time because she was going to lose it anyway.\nHelms told Swansen she “would take the home for the debt,” which Helms believed was at least\n$2,700.00 at the time. According to Helms, Swansen then mailed her the title so she could put\nher own name on the title as payment for the back rent. Helms testified that she accepted the title\nin satisfaction of the amount she believed Swansen owed at the time. After she accepted the\ntitle, making her owner of the mobile home, Helms made a deal with Robert Garcia for him to\npurchase the mobile home for $25,000.00. He “agreed to owner-finance the home” with Helms.\nHe moved into the home in September 2009, making monthly payments to Helms. Helms sent\nSwansen two $200.00 checks, but she denied sending them as payments for the mobile home.\nHelms testified that she sent those checks because Swansen said she was going through a hard\ntime and did not have any groceries. Garcia moved out, and stopped paying, in 2010. Helms\ntestified that she did not try to find another buyer after he moved out. That was not a breach of\nthe agreement, she reasoned, because Swansen had already signed the home over to Helms by\nthen. On May 25, 2010, Helms submitted an application for title to the State of Texas to have\ntitle to the mobile home put in her name “to protect [her]self.”\n       The testimony illustrates that the terms of the agreement are sufficiently definite for the\ntrial court to understand the parties’ legal obligations and, therefore, there is an enforceable\ncontract. See Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist., 22 S.W.3d at 846. Both parties testified that they\nhad an agreement for Helms to try to find a buyer for Swansen’s mobile home. In exchange,\nHelms received the benefit of having a renter for the lot where the mobile home is located.\nFurther, they both testified that Helms would receive any back rent owed when the home sold.\nThe record evidence supports the trial court’s determination that there was an exchange of\nmutual promises, satisfying the consideration requirement. See Hutchings, 174 S.W.2d at 489.\n       The parties presented different versions of events regarding the title. We presume the\ntrial court resolved the conflict in favor of Swansen, and we disregard Helms’s conflicting\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\ftestimony. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 821. Thus, putting title in her name constituted a\nbreach of the contract by Helms, resulting in Swansen’s loss of the home. See Critchfield, 151\nS.W.3d at 233.      There is more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the trial court’s\ndetermination that there is an enforceable contract, including consideration for the contract, and\nthat Helms breached the contract. See City of Houston, 265 S.W.3d at 27. We overrule Helms’s\nsecond, third, and fourth issues.\n\n\n                                           AWARD OF PROPERTY\n       In her fifth issue, Helms asserts that the trial court erred by awarding the mobile home to\nSwansen. She argues that an award of damages would be appropriate, not an award of a specific\npiece of property. Among other arguments, Helms contends that rescission is not appropriate\nbecause Swansen did not prove that she offered to put Helms back in the position she was in\nbefore the contract was entered by repaying her for money paid for taxes and insurance on the\nmobile home.\n       Rescission is an equitable remedy that operates to extinguish a contract that is legally\nvalid, but must be set aside because of fraud, mistake, or some other reason to avoid unjust\nenrichment. Neese v. Lyon, 479 S.W.3d 368, 389 (Tex. App.−Dallas 2015, no pet.). It may be\navailable if the other party to the contract has breached the contract in a material part. Boyter v.\nMCR Constr. Co., 673 S.W.2d 938, 941 (Tex. App.−Dallas 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.). To be\nentitled to the equitable remedy of rescission, a party must show either (1) that she and the other\nparty are in the status quo, i.e., that she is not retaining benefits received under the instrument\nwithout restoration to the other party, or (2) that there are special equitable considerations that\nobviate the need for the parties to be in the status quo. Id.\n       In her petition, Swansen asked the court to enjoin Helms from selling the mobile home,\nwhich would effectively rescind the agreement, and for reformation of the title to reflect that\nSwansen is the owner. In Helms’s counterclaim, she asked the court to declare that Swansen\ndoes not have any ownership interest in the home. The trial court ordered the title to be reformed\nand reissued to Swansen. Accordingly, the trial court determined that Swansen was entitled to\npossession of the home and effectively rescinded the parties’ contract.\n       Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Swansen retained ownership of the home until it\nsold. There was an attempted sale, but it fell through. Therefore, Swansen remained the owner.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fAlthough Helms presented evidence that she paid for taxes, maintenance, repair, and insurance,\nthere is no evidence that she did so pursuant to an agreement with Swansen. Further, Helms’s\nact of applying to put title in her name was a material breach of the parties’ agreement.\nAccordingly, there was no requirement that Swansen put Helms back in the position she was in\nbefore they entered into their contract. See id. The trial court did not err in ordering the title to\nthe mobile home to be reformed and reissued to Swansen and that Swansen may take possession\nof the home. We overrule Helms’s fifth issue.\n\n\n                                            ATTORNEY’S FEES\n       In her sixth issue, Helms contends there is no evidence to support the award of attorney’s\nfees. She argues that Swansen elected to use the lodestar method to prove up attorney’s fees but\nher evidence lacks the specificity that method requires. She complains that Swansen did not\nprovide evidence showing specifics such as how much time her attorney worked on the case,\nwhat he spent his time on, the skill required, or the novelty or difficulty involved in the case.\nTherefore, the argument continues, the court cannot analyze whether the tasks performed were\nnecessary and the time spent on them reasonable. In her seventh issue, Helms asserts that\nSwansen failed to segregate requested attorney’s fees by cause of action.\nApplicable Law\n       Chapter 38 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code allows recovery of reasonable\nattorney’s fees in breach of contract cases. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001 (West\n2015). A “reasonable” attorney’s fee is one that is not excessive or extreme, but rather moderate\nor fair. Sullivan v. Abraham, No. 14-0987, 2016 WL 1513674, at *4 (Tex. April 15, 2016). We\nreview the decision by a district court to either grant or deny attorney’s fees under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard, and we review the amount awarded as attorney’s fees under a legal\nsufficiency standard. EMC Mortg. Corp. v. Davis, 167 S.W.3d 406, 418 (Tex. App.−Austin\n2005, pet. denied). In conducting our legal sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the finding under review and indulge every reasonable inference that\nwould support it. City of Keller, 168 S.W.2d at 822. If more than a scintilla of evidence\nsupports the challenged finding, the legal sufficiency challenge fails. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nCanchola, 121 S.W.3d 735, 739 (Tex. 2003) (per curiam).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f       The lodestar method for proving attorney’s fees involves evidence relating the hours\nworked for each attorney multiplied by their hourly rates for a total fee. Long v. Griffin, 442\nS.W.3d 253, 255 (Tex. 2014) (per curiam). The supreme court has held that where a party elects\nto use the lodestar method, the party must offer evidence of the time expended on particular\ntasks. Id. That party must provide evidence that is sufficiently specific to allow the factfinder to\ndetermine the amount of time spent on a particular task and to decide whether that length of time\nwas reasonable. El Apple I Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 763 (Tex. 2012).\nAnalysis\n       Swansen testified that she paid Robert Hindman, her attorney, $1,500.00 cash for him to\nreview her case and determine whether he wanted to take the case. He agreed to take the case,\nbut Swansen had no more money and could not pay on an hourly basis. Therefore, she and\nHindman entered into a written contingency fee contract. She agreed that Hindman would get\nforty percent of the value of the mobile home.\n       Hindman testified regarding his fees. He has been licensed to practice law since 1976.\nHe is familiar with the customary and normal fees charged for cases of this nature, and he\ntestified that the going rate is $250.00 an hour. He took the case on a percentage basis and is to\nreceive forty percent of the market value of the home in addition to the separate fee he charged\nfor reviewing the case before determining that he wanted to take the case “because of its\ncomplexity.” He explained that he kept a record of the amount of time expended on this case\nand testified that the time spent was necessary and reasonable. At $250.00 an hour, attorney’s\nfees totaled $12,938.85.     Adding court costs of $504.82, the total amount charged was\n$13,443.67. He specifically testified that “the amount of time based upon the hourly billing rate\nwould have been equivalent to the amount of funds if this trailer is worth $33,000.” He\nexplained that his percentage is based solely on what the home actually sells for. He further\ntestified that if this case is appealed, “having had some experience just recently with the retention\nof an attorney to go before an appellate court at the Court of Appeals level and the Texas\nSupreme Court, that the going rate for each of that, a reasonable fee is $10,000 per level. . . .”\nHe reiterated that “all of this was necessary and reasonable as to the amount of time and what the\ncharges, therefore, would have been . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       The trial court awarded Swansen $11,443.67 in attorney’s fees for “preparation and trial\nof the case,” $10,000.00 if appealed to the court of appeals, and another $10,000.00 if appealed\nto the supreme court.\n       Based on our reading of recent supreme court cases, we interpret Hindman’s reference to\nhis hourly rate as an election to use the lodestar method. Long, 442 S.W.3d at 255 (“The\naffidavit supporting the Griffins’ request for attorney’s fees used the lodestar method by relating\nthe hours worked for each of the two attorneys multiplied by their hourly rates for a total fee.”);\nCity of Laredo v. Montano, 414 S.W.3d 731, 736 (Tex. 2013) (per curiam) (held that property\nowner chose to prove up attorney’s fees using the lodestar method by testifying that he arrived at\nhis fee by multiplying the number of hours worked by his hourly rate); see also Felix v.\nProsperity Bank, No. 01-14-00997-CV, 2015 WL 9242048, at *3-4 (Tex.

(although attorney testified as to his hourly rate and number of hours worked, court\ncharacterized case as “ordinary non-lodestar, hourly-fee breach of contract case” not requiring\nhourly time records); Metroplex Mailing Servs., LLC v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 410\nS.W.3d 889, 900 (Tex. App.−Dallas 2013, no pet.) (drawing distinction between cases governed\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fby lodestar approach and “non-lodestar awards of fees such as those made in breach of contract\ncases”).1\n        Accordingly, Swansen was required to introduce sufficient evidence to allow the trial\ncourt to apply the lodestar method. Counsel noted that this is a complex case, stated his hourly\nrate, which he characterized as necessary and reasonable, and asked for a total, which he\npresumably arrived at by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours worked. This\ntestimony regarding attorney’s fees is generalized. Counsel did not provide testimonial evidence\nof the time expended on specific tasks. Further, although he kept a record of the time spent on\nthe case, he presented no documentation in support of his request for fees. Without any evidence\nof time spent on specific tasks, the trial court had insufficient information to meaningfully\nreview the fee request. Long, 442 S.W.3d at 255. Thus, the trial court was not provided legally\nsufficient evidence to calculate a reasonable fee. Id. at 254-55.\n        Additionally, counsel testified to a contingency fee arrangement. His contract with\nSwansen provided that he would be paid an amount equivalent to forty percent of the actual sales\nprice of the home. While his fee was contingent upon Swansen’s being awarded the home, his\nfee was not contingent upon a damages award. Accordingly, even if supporting evidence is not\nrequired for the contingency fee method of proof, that method cannot support the award here\nbecause his contract was not based on a percentage of damages and the final judgment awarded\nno damages.2 See Long, 442 S.W.3d at 256. Accordingly, because the contingency method\ncannot support the trial court’s fee award, and no legally sufficient evidence supports the award\nunder the lodestar method, we remand to the trial court to redetermine attorney’s fees. See id.\nWe sustain Helms’s sixth issue.\n         In Helms’s seventh issue, she contends that Swansen failed to segregate recoverable fees\nfrom those incurred on claims for which fees are not recoverable. We do not reach the merits of\nthis argument because Helms did not lodge a trial court objection on this ground and it is\ntherefore waived. See Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. 1997). We overrule\nHelms’s seventh issue.\n        1\n           We note that the El Apple and Long decisions have left some unanswered questions regarding when a\nparty can be said to have elected to use the lodestar method and whether their approach to proving attorney’s fees\nabrogates the statutory language of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 38. See Mark E. Steiner, Will\nEl Apple Today Keep Attorney’s Fees Away?, 19 J. OF CONSUMER & COM. LAW 114 (Winter 2016).\n        2\n           We do not address the significance of the fact that the judgment awarded no damages because we are\nprohibited from addressing unassigned error. See Pat Baker Co. v. Wilson, 971 S.W.2d 447, 450 (Tex. 1998).\n\n\n                                                       12\n\f                                                 PRESENTMENT\n         In her eighth issue, Helms contends that Swansen failed to segregate requested attorney’s\nfees by time. She argues that Swansen is not entitled to fees incurred before the date of\npresentment and the record does not reflect the date of presentment.\n         Section 38.002 requires parties to present their claim to the opposing party, and that the\nopposing party refuse to pay, before a party is entitled to attorney’s fees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM. CODE ANN. § 38.002 (West 2015). The purpose of presentment is to allow the opposing\nparty to pay a claim within thirty days after she has notice of the claim before becoming liable\nfor attorney’s fees. Jones v. Kelley, 614 S.W.2d 95, 100 (Tex. 1981).\n         Here, Hindman testified that, in compliance with the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\nCode, he sent a letter, “during the pendency of this” suit, giving Helms thirty days to respond,\n“laying the groundwork for attorney’s fees.” Although the date of presentment is not reflected in\nthe record, presentment occurred prior to the date of the hearing. The judgment was signed\nalmost two months after the hearing. Accordingly, presentment occurred more than thirty days\nbefore the trial court rendered judgment ordering that Helms is liable for attorney’s fees. The\nstatute speaks to the plaintiff’s entitlement to attorney’s fees and the defendant’s opportunity to\navoid an obligation to pay attorney’s fees. The statute does not limit the award to fees incurred\nafter the date of presentment. We overrule Helms’s eighth issue.\n\n\n                                                   DISPOSITION\n         We affirm that portion of the trial court’s judgment concerning title to and possession of\nthe mobile home. Because Swansen did not present legally sufficient evidence to support the\naward of attorney’s fees, we reverse that portion of the trial court’s judgment awarding\nattorney’s fees to Swansen, and we remand the cause to the trial court to redetermine attorney’s\nfees.\n\n                                                                 BRIAN HOYLE\n                                                                    Justice\n\nOpinion delivered April 29, 2016.\nPanel consisted of Worthen, C.J., Hoyle, J., and Neeley, J.\n\n\n\n                                                   (PUBLISH)\n\n\n\n                                                         13\n\f                                  COURT OF APPEALS\n\n     TWELFTH COURT OF APPEALS DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n                                          JUDGMENT\n\n                                            APRIL 29, 2016\n\n\n                                        NO. 12-14-00280-CV\n\n\n                                  TONDA HARRIS HELMS,\n                                        Appellant\n                                           V.\n                                 MARY FRANCES SWANSEN,\n                                        Appellee\n\n\n                             Appeal from the County Court at Law #2\n                          of Smith County, Texas (Tr.Ct.No. 62,602-A)\n\n                      THIS CAUSE came to be heard on the appellate record and briefs filed\nherein, and the same being considered, it is the opinion of this court that there was error in the\njudgment of the trial court below.

Helms raises eight issues regarding the trial\ncourt’s refusal to file additional findings of fact, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the awards\nof property and attorney’s fees. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n       In 2006, Swansen purchased a new “park model” mobile home and moved it onto a lot in\nSpring Lake Mobile Home Park, which is owned by Helms. Swansen moved to Kansas when\nshe married in January 2008, leaving her mobile home in Helms’s park. Swansen and Helms had\nan oral agreement that Helms would try to sell the mobile home. A disagreement as to the terms\nof that agreement and ownership of the mobile home led to litigation. Trial was before the court,\nwhich rendered judgment that the home belongs to Swansen.\n\n\n                  ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n       In her first issue, Helms contends the trial court erred in failing to file additional findings\nof fact and conclusions of law when she requested them. She asserts that the court’s initial\nfindings do not include findings on what the terms of the contract were, what term was breached,\n\for what consideration was given by each party. Citing Rule of Civil Procedure 298, Helms\nargues that, because no findings or conclusions can be deemed or presumed by the court’s failure\nto make additional findings or conclusions, the failure to find the missing essential elements of\nthe claim for breach of contract results in a take nothing judgment.\nApplicable Law\n         If timely requested, the trial court “shall file any additional or amended findings and\nconclusions that are appropriate.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 298. Additional findings are not required if\nthe original findings and conclusions properly and succinctly relate the ultimate findings of fact\nand law necessary to apprise the party of adequate information for the preparation of the party’s\nappeal.

City of Arlington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1424020\"><a href=\"/opinion/1424020/pakdimounivong-v-city-of-arlington/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412 (Tex. App.−Fort Worth\n2006, pet. denied). An ultimate fact is one that would have a direct effect on the judgment.

App.−Austin 2004, pet. denied).\nFurthermore, if the requested findings will not result in a different judgment, they need not be\nmade. Id.\nAnalysis\n         At Helms’s request, the trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The\npertinent findings are as follows:\n\n\n                          3. While the park model home was still located at such park space at a\n                time less than four years before the commencement of the instant lawsuit when\n                the parties entered into a valid oral contractual agreement via the exchange of\n                mutual promises under which Defendant agreed to find a buyer for the park\n                model home.\n                          5. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that to facilitate the sale of the\n                park model home pursuant to their agreement, Plaintiff should sign the title to\n                the said park model home in blank, and leave such signed title in the possession\n                and care of the Defendant, which Plaintiff did with the understanding that the\n                defendant would complete the application for title by adding the name of the\n                buyer at the time when a buyer was located and payment therefor was received\n                so as to transfer such title to such buyer.\n                          6. In May 2010, after the conclusion of litigation in a justice court in\n                Smith County, Texas which had resulted in a judgment unfavorable to\n                Defendant, without the knowledge or consent of the Plaintiff, and without\n\n\n\n\n                                                        2\n\f               payment of any consideration, the Defendant breached the oral contract to hold\n               such title until a buyer could be found.\n                         7. In May 2010 the Defendant, unilaterally and without the payment of\n               any consideration for the sale of such park model home, wrongfully affixed her\n               own name to the application for title as Buyer and then remitted the title to the\n               said park model home to the State of Texas further breaching such oral contract\n               and resulting in the issuance of a new certificate of title by the state of Texas\n               reflecting Defendant as owner.\n                         8. That Plaintiff gave defendant the proper notices and demands\n               necessary under the statute to invoke the provisions of Tex Civ Prac and Rem\n               Code Ann Sec. 38.001 et seq. regarding the recovery of reasonable attorney’s\n               fees in cases based upon the breach of an oral contract.\n\n\n\n\n       The pertinent conclusions of law are as follows:\n\n\n                         1. The court finds that as a result of the existence of the oral contract\n               between the parties and the subsequent breach of the contract by the Defendant,\n               the Plaintiff sustained damages, and is therefore entitled to judgment relief . . . .\n                         3. That Plaintiff is entitled under the law to judgment for the recovery\n               of reasonable attorney’s fees necessarily incurred on her behalf in this action as\n               a result of Defendant’s breach of the oral contract . . . .\n\n\n       Thereafter, Helms filed a request for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law on\nthe following issues:\n\n\n                        1.   The consideration given by each party to the contract.\n                        2.   The material terms of the contract between the parties.\n                        3.   Which material term was breached, and by what specific act.\n                        4.   The date the claim for breach of contract was presented to the\n                             Defendant under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 38.002.\n\n\n       Helms’s requested findings and conclusions 1 and 2 are subsumed by the trial court’s\noriginal finding of fact 3 and conclusion of law 1. Further, her requested finding and conclusion\n3 is addressed in the trial court’s original findings. Finding of fact number 6 specifically states\nthat Helms breached the oral contract to hold the title until a buyer could be found. Finding of\nfact number 7 states that Helms further breached the agreement by affixing her name to the\napplication for title as buyer. Further, Helms’s requested additional finding and conclusion 4 is\nsubsumed under original finding of fact 8 and conclusion of law 3. Moreover, under these\ncircumstances, Helms was not required to guess at the reasons for the trial court’s decision. See\nIn re Marriage of C.A.S. & D.P.S., 405 S.W.3d at 382. Finally, none of the requested additional\n\n\n\n                                                        3\n\ffindings or conclusions would have resulted in a different judgment and therefore need not have\nbeen made. See Flanary, 150 S.W.3d at 792. We overrule Helms’s first issue.\n\n\n                                     SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n       In her second issue, Helms asserts that there is no evidence of consideration to support\nthe oral contract. Specifically, she argues that while she agreed to find a buyer for Swansen, the\nagreement required no obligation on Swansen’s part. In her third issue, Helms contends the\ncontract is insufficiently definite to be enforceable. She asserts that the contract is so vague as to\nbe meaningless and “there is absolutely no guidance as to what the obligations of the plaintiff\nwould be.” In her fourth issue, Helms contends there is no evidence that she breached the\ncontract. She asserts it is difficult to determine what the contractual obligations of the parties\nwere, but argues that putting her name on the title was not a breach of the parties’ agreement.\nShe further argues that the terms of a contract are determined at the time of the original\nformation and their original agreement did not include “anything about the title.” Therefore, she\nargues, an additional requirement that Helms not affix her name to the title would require\nadditional consideration.\nStandard of Review\n       In an appeal of a judgment rendered after a bench trial, the trial court’s findings of fact\nhave the same weight as a jury’s verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency of the\nevidence used to support them just as we would review a jury’s findings.

Id.\nAnalysis\n       Swansen testified that she and Helms had an oral agreement that she would leave the\nhome in Helms’s park and Helms would try to sell the mobile home for Swansen. Swansen\nnever agreed for Helms to take the mobile home for any purpose other than to resell it. Swansen\nwanted $50,000.00 for the home, but Helms was authorized to gradually, over time, lower the\nasking price. Swansen testified that “[i]t was understood that when [Helms] is going to sell it,\nshe is going to get her lot rent back, however much it was.” Swansen explained that she did not\nwant to risk losing the title in the mail so she signed the title in Helms’s presence, leaving the\nnew owner’s name blank, and left it with Helms before she moved to Kansas. Helms was to add\nthe new owner’s name to the title when she found a buyer. Swansen testified that she did not\ngive the title to Helms to convey the home to Helms. At the time Swansen moved out, she paid\n$250.00 per month in lot rent. According to Swansen, it was understood that she did not have to\npay lot rent after she moved out. Further, Helms did not owe Swansen any money until she sold\nthe home. Swansen testified that Helms was to take lot rent out of the buyer’s payments.\n       Helms testified that when Swansen moved out in January 2008, she agreed to try to sell\nthe home for Swansen. According to Helms, Swansen could not afford to move the home.\nAlthough conclusively disproved by other evidence, Helms said that Swansen owed her\n$1,800.00 in back rent when she moved out. Helms testified that, as part of the agreement,\nHelms would receive any lot rent still owed when the home sold. Accordingly, she did not\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fexpect Swansen to pay back rent until the home sold. However, Helms said she was not able to\nsell the home.\n       Contrary to Swansen’s testimony, Helms testified that Swansen did not give her the title\nat the time they made the agreement that Helms would try to sell the home. Helms testified that\nSwansen called her in May 2008, after Swansen had moved to Kansas, told her she was filing for\nbankruptcy, and said she could not repay the debt she owed Helms. Helms stated that Swansen\nwanted to sign the home over to Helms at that time because she was going to lose it anyway.\nHelms told Swansen she “would take the home for the debt,” which Helms believed was at least\n$2,700.00 at the time. According to Helms, Swansen then mailed her the title so she could put\nher own name on the title as payment for the back rent. Helms testified that she accepted the title\nin satisfaction of the amount she believed Swansen owed at the time. After she accepted the\ntitle, making her owner of the mobile home, Helms made a deal with Robert Garcia for him to\npurchase the mobile home for $25,000.00. He “agreed to owner-finance the home” with Helms.\nHe moved into the home in September 2009, making monthly payments to Helms. Helms sent\nSwansen two $200.00 checks, but she denied sending them as payments for the mobile home.\nHelms testified that she sent those checks because Swansen said she was going through a hard\ntime and did not have any groceries. Garcia moved out, and stopped paying, in 2010. Helms\ntestified that she did not try to find another buyer after he moved out. That was not a breach of\nthe agreement, she reasoned, because Swansen had already signed the home over to Helms by\nthen. On May 25, 2010, Helms submitted an application for title to the State of Texas to have\ntitle to the mobile home put in her name “to protect [her]self.”\n       The testimony illustrates that the terms of the agreement are sufficiently definite for the\ntrial court to understand the parties’ legal obligations and, therefore, there is an enforceable\ncontract. See Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist., 22 S.W.3d at 846. Both parties testified that they\nhad an agreement for Helms to try to find a buyer for Swansen’s mobile home. In exchange,\nHelms received the benefit of having a renter for the lot where the mobile home is located.\nFurther, they both testified that Helms would receive any back rent owed when the home sold.\nThe record evidence supports the trial court’s determination that there was an exchange of\nmutual promises, satisfying the consideration requirement. See Hutchings, 174 S.W.2d at 489.\n       The parties presented different versions of events regarding the title. We presume the\ntrial court resolved the conflict in favor of Swansen, and we disregard Helms’s conflicting\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\ftestimony. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 821. Thus, putting title in her name constituted a\nbreach of the contract by Helms, resulting in Swansen’s loss of the home. See Critchfield, 151\nS.W.3d at 233.      There is more than a scintilla of evidence supporting the trial court’s\ndetermination that there is an enforceable contract, including consideration for the contract, and\nthat Helms breached the contract. See City of Houston, 265 S.W.3d at 27. We overrule Helms’s\nsecond, third, and fourth issues.\n\n\n                                           AWARD OF PROPERTY\n       In her fifth issue, Helms asserts that the trial court erred by awarding the mobile home to\nSwansen. She argues that an award of damages would be appropriate, not an award of a specific\npiece of property. Among other arguments, Helms contends that rescission is not appropriate\nbecause Swansen did not prove that she offered to put Helms back in the position she was in\nbefore the contract was entered by repaying her for money paid for taxes and insurance on the\nmobile home.\n       Rescission is an equitable remedy that operates to extinguish a contract that is legally\nvalid, but must be set aside because of fraud, mistake, or some other reason to avoid unjust\nenrichment. Neese v. Lyon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (Tex.

App.−Dallas 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.). To be\nentitled to the equitable remedy of rescission, a party must show either (1) that she and the other\nparty are in the status quo, i.e., that she is not retaining benefits received under the instrument\nwithout restoration to the other party, or (2) that there are special equitable considerations that\nobviate the need for the parties to be in the status quo. Id.\n       In her petition, Swansen asked the court to enjoin Helms from selling the mobile home,\nwhich would effectively rescind the agreement, and for reformation of the title to reflect that\nSwansen is the owner. In Helms’s counterclaim, she asked the court to declare that Swansen\ndoes not have any ownership interest in the home. The trial court ordered the title to be reformed\nand reissued to Swansen. Accordingly, the trial court determined that Swansen was entitled to\npossession of the home and effectively rescinded the parties’ contract.\n       Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Swansen retained ownership of the home until it\nsold. There was an attempted sale, but it fell through. Therefore, Swansen remained the owner.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fAlthough Helms presented evidence that she paid for taxes, maintenance, repair, and insurance,\nthere is no evidence that she did so pursuant to an agreement with Swansen. Further, Helms’s\nact of applying to put title in her name was a material breach of the parties’ agreement.\nAccordingly, there was no requirement that Swansen put Helms back in the position she was in\nbefore they entered into their contract. See id. The trial court did not err in ordering the title to\nthe mobile home to be reformed and reissued to Swansen and that Swansen may take possession\nof the home. We overrule Helms’s fifth issue.\n\n\n                                            ATTORNEY’S FEES\n       In her sixth issue, Helms contends there is no evidence to support the award of attorney’s\nfees. She argues that Swansen elected to use the lodestar method to prove up attorney’s fees but\nher evidence lacks the specificity that method requires. She complains that Swansen did not\nprovide evidence showing specifics such as how much time her attorney worked on the case,\nwhat he spent his time on, the skill required, or the novelty or difficulty involved in the case.\nTherefore, the argument continues, the court cannot analyze whether the tasks performed were\nnecessary and the time spent on them reasonable. In her seventh issue, Helms asserts that\nSwansen failed to segregate requested attorney’s fees by cause of action.\nApplicable Law\n       Chapter 38 of the Civil Practices and Remedies Code allows recovery of reasonable\nattorney’s fees in breach of contract cases.

He agreed to take the case,\nbut Swansen had no more money and could not pay on an hourly basis. Therefore, she and\nHindman entered into a written contingency fee contract. She agreed that Hindman would get\nforty percent of the value of the mobile home.\n       Hindman testified regarding his fees. He has been licensed to practice law since 1976.\nHe is familiar with the customary and normal fees charged for cases of this nature, and he\ntestified that the going rate is $250.00 an hour. He took the case on a percentage basis and is to\nreceive forty percent of the market value of the home in addition to the separate fee he charged\nfor reviewing the case before determining that he wanted to take the case “because of its\ncomplexity.” He explained that he kept a record of the amount of time expended on this case\nand testified that the time spent was necessary and reasonable. At $250.00 an hour, attorney’s\nfees totaled $12,938.85.     Adding court costs of $504.82, the total amount charged was\n$13,443.67. He specifically testified that “the amount of time based upon the hourly billing rate\nwould have been equivalent to the amount of funds if this trailer is worth $33,000.” He\nexplained that his percentage is based solely on what the home actually sells for. He further\ntestified that if this case is appealed, “having had some experience just recently with the retention\nof an attorney to go before an appellate court at the Court of Appeals level and the Texas\nSupreme Court, that the going rate for each of that, a reasonable fee is $10,000 per level. . . .”\nHe reiterated that “all of this was necessary and reasonable as to the amount of time and what the\ncharges, therefore, would have been . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f       The trial court awarded Swansen $11,443.67 in attorney’s fees for “preparation and trial\nof the case,” $10,000.00 if appealed to the court of appeals, and another $10,000.00 if appealed\nto the supreme court.\n       Based on our reading of recent supreme court cases, we interpret Hindman’s reference to\nhis hourly rate as an election to use the lodestar method.

Counsel noted that this is a complex case, stated his hourly\nrate, which he characterized as necessary and reasonable, and asked for a total, which he\npresumably arrived at by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours worked. This\ntestimony regarding attorney’s fees is generalized. Counsel did not provide testimonial evidence\nof the time expended on specific tasks. Further, although he kept a record of the time spent on\nthe case, he presented no documentation in support of his request for fees. Without any evidence\nof time spent on specific tasks, the trial court had insufficient information to meaningfully\nreview the fee request. Long, 442 S.W.3d at 255. Thus, the trial court was not provided legally\nsufficient evidence to calculate a reasonable fee. Id. at 254-55.\n        Additionally, counsel testified to a contingency fee arrangement. His contract with\nSwansen provided that he would be paid an amount equivalent to forty percent of the actual sales\nprice of the home. While his fee was contingent upon Swansen’s being awarded the home, his\nfee was not contingent upon a damages award. Accordingly, even if supporting evidence is not\nrequired for the contingency fee method of proof, that method cannot support the award here\nbecause his contract was not based on a percentage of damages and the final judgment awarded\nno damages.2 See Long, 442 S.W.3d at 256. Accordingly, because the contingency method\ncannot support the trial court’s fee award, and no legally sufficient evidence supports the award\nunder the lodestar method, we remand to the trial court to redetermine attorney’s fees. See id.\nWe sustain Helms’s sixth issue.\n         In Helms’s seventh issue, she contends that Swansen failed to segregate recoverable fees\nfrom those incurred on claims for which fees are not recoverable. We do not reach the merits of\nthis argument because Helms did not lodge a trial court objection on this ground and it is\ntherefore waived. See Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382247/green-intern-inc-v-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (Tex. 1997). We overrule\nHelms’s seventh issue.\n        1\n           We note that the El Apple and Long decisions have left some unanswered questions regarding when a\nparty can be said to have elected to use the lodestar method and whether their approach to proving attorney’s fees\nabrogates the statutory language of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code Chapter 38.

She argues that Swansen is not entitled to fees incurred before the date of\npresentment and the record does not reflect the date of presentment.\n         Section 38.002 requires parties to present their claim to the opposing party, and that the\nopposing party refuse to pay, before a party is entitled to attorney’s fees. TEX. CIV. PRAC. &\nREM. CODE ANN. § 38.002 (West 2015).

The judgment was signed\nalmost two months after the hearing. Accordingly, presentment occurred more than thirty days\nbefore the trial court rendered judgment ordering that Helms is liable for attorney’s fees. The\nstatute speaks to the plaintiff’s entitlement to attorney’s fees and the defendant’s opportunity to\navoid an obligation to pay attorney’s fees. The statute does not limit the award to fees incurred\nafter the date of presentment.
