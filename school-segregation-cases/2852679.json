Petitioner Bajram\nBegzatowski seeks review of an adverse\ndecision of the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (the \"BIA\" or \"Board\") denying\nhis requests for asylum and withholding\nof deportation./1 For the reasons set\nforth in the following opinion, we grant\nthe petition for review, reverse the\njudgment of the BIA and remand for\nfurther consideration.\n\nI\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.   Facts\n\n  Mr. Begzatowski is an ethnic Albanian\nfrom Kicevo, in the Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia (\"Macedonia\"). He\nattended school in Kicevo until the\neighth grade. At that time, all of the\nAlbanian schools were closed. Mr.\nBegzatowski then moved to Switzerland and\nlived with an uncle. He returned to\nYugoslavia in November 1990, and shortly\nthereafter was inducted into the\nYugoslavian army.\n  Mr. Begzatowski painted a grim picture\nof his military experiences. Albanians\nwere segregated from other soldiers;\ntheir barracks were small and\novercrowded. They were not given regular\naccess to bathing facilities and went\n\fwithout showers for over a month. During\nbasic training, Albanian soldiers had to\nrise earlier than the Serbians in their\nunit, they were not issued bullets nor\nwere they given training on a firing\nrange.\n\n  According to Mr. Begzatowski’s\ntestimony, Albanian soldiers suffered\nfrom more than just inadequate facilities\nand training. Serbian officers would wake\nthe Albanian soldiers in the middle of\nthe night and threaten them with harm if\nthey did not follow orders. These were\nnot idle threats; the officers physically\nassaulted the Albanian soldiers, but left\nthe Serbian soldiers alone. The\nYugoslavian army did not issue bullets to\nthe Albanian soldiers for use in battle;\nSerbian soldiers, however, were provided\nwith ammunition. Albanians also were\ndeprived of shovels to use to dig\nthemselves in and get out of harm’s way.\nFinally, the Albanians were forced to\nprecede the Serbian soldiers into battle.\nTo ensure that Albanian soldiers\ncooperated, Serbian soldiers followed at\na distance of two to three meters with\ntheir guns drawn.\n\n  After enduring this treatment for\nseveral months, Mr. Begzatowski\ndeserted,/2 went into hiding and later\nfled the country. Mr. Begzatowski\neventually entered the United States by\nway of Mexico. Shortly after he arrived,\nhe filed an administrative application\nfor asylum.\n\nB.   Administrative Proceedings\n\n1.\n\n  On March 10, 1994, an Order to Show\nCause was issued and charged Mr.\nBegzatowski with deportability. At\nhisdeportation hearing, Mr. Begzatowski\nconceded deportability, but requested\nthat the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") grant\nhim asylum or withholding of deportation.\nAfter a hearing, the IJ found Mr.\nBegzatowski’s testimony credible in\nalmost all respects./3 He also noted\nthat the discrimination described by Mr.\nBegzatowski had been documented by\nreputable organizations. However, the IJ\ndetermined that the degree of\n\"discrimination\" Mr. Begzatowski endured\ndid \"not rise to the level necessary to\nbe considered persecution.\" R.48.\n\f2.\n\n  More than five years after the IJ issued\nhis decision, a split panel of the BIA\naffirmed. The majority found Mr.\nBegzatowski’s testimony \"credible in its\nentirety.\" R.3. It specifically noted\nthat Mr. Begzatowski \"routinely suffered\nphysical mistreatment and was put in\nharm’s way on account of his ethnic and\nreligious background.\" Id. However,\nrelying on this court’s decision in\nMeghani v. INS, 236 F.3d 843 (7th Cir.\n2001), the BIA stated that \"’unpleasant\nand even dangerous conditions do not\nnecessarily rise to the level of persecution.’\"\nR.3 (quoting Meghani, 236 F.3d at 847\n(internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)). Therefore, like the IJ, it\ndetermined that \"without more, we cannot\nconclude that the treatment suffered by\nthe respondent rises to the level of\npersecution.\" R.3./4\n\n  The dissenting member of the BIA stated\nthat he believed that Mr. Begzatowski’s\ntestimony established past persecution on\nthe basis of his ethnic background. He\nfurther stated that there was not\nsufficient evidence in the record to\ndetermine if the presumptive fear of\nfuture persecution had been rebutted. For\nthat reason, he stated, he would remand\nthe matter to the IJ for additional\nfindings.\n\n  Mr. Begzatowski timely appealed the\nadverse decision of the BIA.\n\nII\n\nANALYSIS\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n  We review the BIA’s asylum determination\nunder the substantial evidence test. See\nPetrovic v. INS, 198 F.3d 1034, 1037 (7th\nCir. 2000). We shall disturb the BIA’s\nfindings \"only if the record lacks\nsubstantial evidence to support its\nfactual conclusions.\" Malek v. INS, 198\nF.3d 1016, 1021 (7th Cir. 2000). However,\nwe review the BIA’s legal analysis de\nnovo. See Marquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374,\n378 (7th Cir. 1997).\n\nB.   Past Persecution\n\f  Mr. Begzatowski contests the BIA’s\nfinding that his experiences in the\nformer Yugoslavia, and specifically in\nthe Yugoslavian army, did not rise to the\nlevel of persecution. Specifically, he\npoints to the fact that he was sent into\nbattle without bullets and suffered other\nabuses while in military service. We\nevaluate Mr. Begzatowski’s claim below.\n\n  To prove that he is a \"refugee\" within\nthe meaning of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1101(a)(42), and therefore entitled to\nasylum, Mr. Begzatowski \"must come\nforward with evidence either of a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution or of\npast persecution. If an alien establishes\npast persecution, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that he also has a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution and\ntherefor should be granted asylum.\"\nAmbati v. Reno, 233 F.3d 1054, 1059-60\n(7th Cir. 2000). \"Although there is no\nstatutory definition of persecution, we\nhave described it as punishment or the\ninfliction of harm for political,\nreligious, or other reasons that this\ncountry does not recognize as\nlegitimate.\" Roman v. INS, 233 F.3d 1027,\n1034 (7th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\n\"Persecution encompasses more than\nthreats to life or freedom; non-life\nthreatening violence and physical abuse\nalso fall within this category.\" Tamas-\nMercea v. Reno, 222 F.3d 417, 424 (7th\nCir. 2000). However, to sustain an asylum\napplication, the conduct \"must rise above\nmere harassment.\" Roman, 233 F.3d at\n1034. Types of actions that might cross\nthe line from harassment to persecution\ninclude: \"detention, arrest,\ninterrogation, prosecution, imprisonment,\nillegal searches, confiscation of\nproperty, surveillance, beatings, or\ntorture.\" Mitev v. INS, 67 F.3d 1325,\n1330 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n  As stated above, in assessing an asylum\napplication, we owe deference to the\nfactual findings of the BIA. In the\npresent action, the BIA credited Mr.\nBegzatowski’s testimony concerning the\nharms that he suffered in the Yugoslavian\nmilitary./5 Specifically, the BIA\naccepted that Mr. Begzatowski was\ndeprived of bathing facilities, denied\nadequate military training, experienced\nphysical abuse by the Serbian officers\n\fand was sent to the front lines of battle\nwithout either bullets or a shovel.\nFurthermore, the BIA did not question\nthat Mr. Begzatowski’s mistreatment was a\nresult of his Albanian ethnicity.\nConsequently, the only issue before us is\nwhether the events described by Mr.\nBegzatowski constitute persecution for\npurposes of the INA.\n\n  This court has defined persecution as\n\"punishment or the infliction of harm for\npolitical, religious, or other reasons\nthat this country does not recognize as\nlegitimate.\" Roman, 233 F.3d at 1034\n(internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). We believe that the\nmistreatment endured by Mr. Begzatowski\nclearly falls within this category. Mr.\nBegzatowski described a series of actions\nby the Yugoslavian army meant to\nhumiliate and eliminate Albanian\nsoldiers. Albanian soldiers were not\ntreated like their Serbian counterparts;\nthey were segregated, physically abused,\ndeprived of bathing facilities and denied\ntraining. Far more importantly, they were\nforced into battle without ammunition and\nwere deprived of other implements, such\nas shovels, that were important to their\nsurvival. We believe that these actions\ncannot be seen as anything but\n\"punishment\" or \"infliction of harm.\"\nFurthermore, these are not merely petty\nabuses that we would expect the BIA to\nexcuse or ignore. The Albanian soldiers’\nonly purpose, it appears, was to provide\na human shield for Serbian soldiers.\nThese actions rise above the level of\n\"mere harassment\" and constitute\npersecution.\n\n  The BIA does offer some explanation why\nit believed that Mr. Begzatowski’s\nexperiences did not constitute\npersecution. First, it states that\nMeghani v. INS, 236 F.3d 843, 847 (7th\nCir. 2001), stands for the proposition\nthat even dangerous conditions do not\nnecessarily rise to the level of\npersecution. However, Meghani did not\naddress the situation presented here--a\nsegment of the population being forced\ninto life-threatening situations on the\nbasis of their ethnicity. Put in context,\nthe quote from Meghani on which the INS\nrelies addresses a very different\nsituation; in that case, we stated:\n\n\"[C]onditions of political upheaval which\n\faffect the populace as a whole or in\nlarge part are generally insufficient to\nestablish eligibility for asylum.\"\nIndeed, we have \"recognized the hard\ntruth that unpleasant and even dangerous\nconditions do not necessarily rise to the\nlevel of persecution.\"\n\nId. (quoting Mitev, 67 F.3d at 1330-31).\nIn other words, if war, famine, political\nviolence or other dangerous conditions\naffect an entire nation, those conditions\ncannot establish an individual claim for\nasylum. In the present case, however, the\nundisputed evidence established that the\nYugoslavian government singled out an\nethnic group for abuse.\n\n  In addition, the BIA seemed to focus on\nMr. Begzatowski’s lack of permanent\ninjury as a basis for denying his asylum\napplication. Mr. Begzatowski, it stated,\n\"did not suggest that he suffered any\nharm as a result of the treatment or the\nsituations that he was subjected to.\"\nR.3. However, we previously have rejected\nattempts by the BIA to impose on asylum\napplicants the additional burden of\nestablishing permanent or serious\ninjuries as a result of their\npersecution. See Asani v. INS, 154 F.3d\n719, 722-23 (7th Cir. 1998)./6 We see\nno reason to revisit the standard.\n\n\nC.   Presumption of Future Persecution\n\n  Because Mr. Begzatowski has established\npast persecution on the basis of his\nethnicity, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that he also has a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution\nnecessary for a grant of asylum. See\nAmbati, 233 F.3d at 1060. The burden then\n\"shifts to the immigration authorities to\nprove [he] has no well-founded fear of\nfurther persecution.\" Galina v. INS, 213\nF.3d 955, 957 (7th Cir. 2000).\nSpecifically, \"the presumption may be\novercome by evidence indicating that the\nalien no longer is in danger of being\npersecuted again due to changed\nconditions in the home country.\" Asani,\n154 F.3d at 722 (citing 8 C.F.R. sec.\n201.13(b)(1)(I)).\n\n  The BIA need not wait for the INS to\nproffer evidence of changed country\nconditions. We previously have recognized\nthe authority of the BIA to take\n\f\"official notice of uncontroverted facts\nconcerning political conditions in asylum\nseekers’ home countries.\" Kaczmarczyk v.\nINS, 933 F.2d 588, 593 (7th Cir. 1991).\nHowever, in doing so, the BIA must treat\nsources of current information,\nespecially State Department country\nreports, \"with a healthy\nskepticism,rather than, as is its\ntendency, as Holy Writ.\" Galina, 213 F.3d\nat 959.\n\n  The INS argues that the BIA engaged in\nthis analysis and determined, based on\nthe current State Department country\nreport, that the situation in Macedonia\nhad improved to such a point as to remove\nany fear that Mr. Begzatowski might be\npersecuted upon his return. We do not\nbelieve that this is a fair reading of\nthe BIA’s opinion.\n\n  The BIA did not find that Mr.\nBegzatowski had established past\npersecution. Therefore, it did not shift\nthe burden to the INS to come forward\nwith evidence of changed country\nconditions, nor did it consider sua\nsponte whether those conditions had\nchanged sufficiently to diffuse Mr.\nBegzatowski’s well-founded fear of future\npersecution. Having found no past\npersecution, the BIA focused only on Mr.\nBegzatowski’s actions since his departure\nfrom Macedonia to determine whether he\nhad a well-founded fear of future\npersecution. It stated:\n\nThe respondent claims to have a well-\nfounded fear of persecution because of\nhis participation in an Albanian\nnationalist group in the United States\nand because his participation in that\ngroup is known to the Macedonian\ngovernment. In order to determine whether\nthat basis for the respondent’s fear does\nin fact provide an objective basis to\nfear persecution in Macedonia, we have\nexamined the documentation of record, as\nwell as the 1999 Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices . . . . Based upon the\ninformation contained in that report\nwhich reflects changed country\ncircumstances since the respondent’s\ndeparture from his country of origin, we\ncannot conclude that he has a well-\nfounded fear of persecution in Macedonia.\n\nR.4 (emphasis added). The BIA addressed\nonly the issue of whether Mr. Begzatowski\n\flikely would be persecuted for\nparticipating in pro-Albanian rallies in\nthe United States. This issue has little,\nif any, bearing on whether the current\nState Department country report provides\nsufficient detailed information to rebut\nthe presumption of future persecution\narising from Mr. Begzatowski’s\nexperiences in the Yugoslavian army.\nBecause the BIA did not consider whether\nthe country conditions in Macedonia rebut\nthe presumption that Mr. Begzatowski will\nsuffer future persecution in that\ncountry, we remand the case to the BIA\nfor consideration of this issue.\n\nConclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the petition\nfor review is granted, and the judgment\nof the BIA is reversed and remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nPETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED;\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 The application in this case was filed prior to\nApril 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility\nAct of 1996, Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, and\ntherefore, as did the Board, we employ the termi-\nnology of the former statute.\n\n/2 Friends of Mr. Begzatowski also deserted; howev-\ner, they were found, jailed and returned to the\narmy.\n\n/3 The IJ stated: \"With respect to the respondent’s\ncredibility, while the respondent has testified\nto a battle in which he was sent to fight without\nany bullets, that experience does not raise any\nquestions in my mind. However, the respondent did\nindicate that he was sent to the battle front\nwhile Serbian soldiers were a few meters behind\nhim and the respondent was engaged in this battle\nfor a period of approximately two to three months\nwithout any bullets and to his knowledge, no\nSerbian soldiers were killed while Albanians\nwere. I can credit the possibility that for\ndiscriminatory and persecution purposes soldiers\ncould be denied bullets, but the fact that the\nrespondent was sent to the battle front for two\nto three months without any bullets and without\nbeing killed or shot raises credibility questions\nin my mind. Other than this issue, I essentially\nwould credit the testimony of the respondent.\"\nR.47.\n\f/4 The BIA also determined that Mr. Begzatowski did\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecu-\ntion based on his participation in pro-Albanian\nrallies while in the United States. Mr. Begzatow-\nski does not take issue with this portion of the\nBIA’s decision.\n\n/5 In its brief, the INS argues that Mr. Begzatowski\nis constrained by the credibility determinations\nof the IJ because those determinations were not\nidentified as a basis for his appeal to the BIA.\nWe disagree. We believe that Mr. Begzatowski’s\nnotice of appeal more than adequately apprised\nthe Board of his lack of faith in the factual\nfindings of the IJ. His notice states: \"The\nImmigration Judge arbitrarily, capriciously and\nincorrectly concluded that the Respondent hadn’t\nestablished prejudice at the hands of the perti-\nnent government authority sufficient to establish\nhis ’eligibility’ for the relief being sought, in\nlight of the evidence and testimony offered of\nRecord clearly establishing the same.\" R.35. The\nBIA is not bound by the credibility determina-\ntions of the IJ; it may review the record and\nmake its own assessments. See Hazime v. INS, 17\nF.3d 136, 140 (6th Cir. 1993) (stating that \"’the\nBoard is not required to defer to an immigration\njudge’s findings of fact or conclusions of law in\na deportation/waiver case, and may if it chooses\nto do so, review the record de novo’\" (internal\ncitations omitted)); Charlesworth v. United\nStates INS, 966 F.2d 1323, 1325 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(\"The Board is not required to defer to the\nimmigration judge’s findings and conclusions.\").\nMoreover, absent the BIA adopting the findings of\nthe IJ--which clearly did not occur here--we\nreview the determinations, including the credi-\nbility determinations, of the BIA, not the IJ.\nSee Gonzalez v. INS, 77 F.3d 1015, 1023 (7th Cir.\n1996).\n\n/6 In Asani v. INS, 154 F.3d 719 (7th Cir. 1998), we\nstated:\n\n[T]he BIA apparently believed that Asani was not\nsubject to past persecution because he had not\n\"suffered any physical or psychological harm\"\nfrom his mistreatment by the Yugoslavian authori-\nties and because he did not receive \"serious\ninjuries\" when he was beaten by the police.\nHowever, this is not the standard recognized by\nthis Court. While the Immigration Act does not\nprovide a definition for the term \"persecution,\"\nwe have defined it as \"’punishment’ or ’the\ninfliction of harm’ which is administered on\naccount of . . . race, religion, nationality,\ngroup membership, or political opinion . . . .\"\n\nId. at 723 (internal citations omitted). Because\n\fthe BIA applied an incorrect and more stringent\nstandard to Asani’s application, we remanded the\ncase to the BIA.\n\f",

Past Persecution\n\f  Mr. Begzatowski contests the BIA’s\nfinding that his experiences in the\nformer Yugoslavia, and specifically in\nthe Yugoslavian army, did not rise to the\nlevel of persecution. Specifically, he\npoints to the fact that he was sent into\nbattle without bullets and suffered other\nabuses while in military service. We\nevaluate Mr. Begzatowski’s claim below.\n\n  To prove that he is a \"refugee\" within\nthe meaning of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. sec.\n1101(a)(42), and therefore entitled to\nasylum, Mr. Begzatowski \"must come\nforward with evidence either of a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution or of\npast persecution. If an alien establishes\npast persecution, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that he also has a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution and\ntherefor should be granted asylum.\"\nAmbati v.

However, to sustain an asylum\napplication, the conduct \"must rise above\nmere harassment.\" Roman, 233 F.3d at\n1034. Types of actions that might cross\nthe line from harassment to persecution\ninclude: \"detention, arrest,\ninterrogation, prosecution, imprisonment,\nillegal searches, confiscation of\nproperty, surveillance, beatings, or\ntorture.\" Mitev v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706011\"><a href=\"/opinion/706011/nikola-mitev-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1330 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n  As stated above, in assessing an asylum\napplication, we owe deference to the\nfactual findings of the BIA. In the\npresent action, the BIA credited Mr.\nBegzatowski’s testimony concerning the\nharms that he suffered in the Yugoslavian\nmilitary./5 Specifically, the BIA\naccepted that Mr. Begzatowski was\ndeprived of bathing facilities, denied\nadequate military training, experienced\nphysical abuse by the Serbian officers\n\fand was sent to the front lines of battle\nwithout either bullets or a shovel.\nFurthermore, the BIA did not question\nthat Mr. Begzatowski’s mistreatment was a\nresult of his Albanian ethnicity.\nConsequently, the only issue before us is\nwhether the events described by Mr.\nBegzatowski constitute persecution for\npurposes of the INA.\n\n  This court has defined persecution as\n\"punishment or the infliction of harm for\npolitical, religious, or other reasons\nthat this country does not recognize as\nlegitimate.\" Roman, 233 F.3d at 1034\n(internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). We believe that the\nmistreatment endured by Mr. Begzatowski\nclearly falls within this category. Mr.\nBegzatowski described a series of actions\nby the Yugoslavian army meant to\nhumiliate and eliminate Albanian\nsoldiers. Albanian soldiers were not\ntreated like their Serbian counterparts;\nthey were segregated, physically abused,\ndeprived of bathing facilities and denied\ntraining. Far more importantly, they were\nforced into battle without ammunition and\nwere deprived of other implements, such\nas shovels, that were important to their\nsurvival. We believe that these actions\ncannot be seen as anything but\n\"punishment\" or \"infliction of harm.\"\nFurthermore, these are not merely petty\nabuses that we would expect the BIA to\nexcuse or ignore. The Albanian soldiers’\nonly purpose, it appears, was to provide\na human shield for Serbian soldiers.\nThese actions rise above the level of\n\"mere harassment\" and constitute\npersecution.\n\n  The BIA does offer some explanation why\nit believed that Mr. Begzatowski’s\nexperiences did not constitute\npersecution. First, it states that\nMeghani v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771633\"><a href=\"/opinion/771633/amin-meghani-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service-and-janet-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 (7th\nCir. 2001), stands for the proposition\nthat even dangerous conditions do not\nnecessarily rise to the level of\npersecution. However, Meghani did not\naddress the situation presented here--a\nsegment of the population being forced\ninto life-threatening situations on the\nbasis of their ethnicity. Put in context,\nthe quote from Meghani on which the INS\nrelies addresses a very different\nsituation; in that case, we stated:\n\n\"[C]onditions of political upheaval which\n\faffect the populace as a whole or in\nlarge part are generally insufficient to\nestablish eligibility for asylum.\"\nIndeed, we have \"recognized the hard\ntruth that unpleasant and even dangerous\nconditions do not necessarily rise to the\nlevel of persecution.\"\n\nId. (quoting Mitev, 67 F.3d at 1330-31).\nIn other words, if war, famine, political\nviolence or other dangerous conditions\naffect an entire nation, those conditions\ncannot establish an individual claim for\nasylum. In the present case, however, the\nundisputed evidence established that the\nYugoslavian government singled out an\nethnic group for abuse.\n\n  In addition, the BIA seemed to focus on\nMr. Begzatowski’s lack of permanent\ninjury as a basis for denying his asylum\napplication. Mr. Begzatowski, it stated,\n\"did not suggest that he suffered any\nharm as a result of the treatment or the\nsituations that he was subjected to.\"\nR.3. However, we previously have rejected\nattempts by the BIA to impose on asylum\napplicants the additional burden of\nestablishing permanent or serious\ninjuries as a result of their\npersecution. See Asani v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757642\"><a href=\"/opinion/757642/sefadin-asani-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722-23 (7th Cir. 1998)./6 We see\nno reason to revisit the standard.\n\n\nC.   Presumption of Future Persecution\n\n  Because Mr. Begzatowski has established\npast persecution on the basis of his\nethnicity, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that he also has a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution\nnecessary for a grant of asylum. See\nAmbati, 233 F.3d at 1060. The burden then\n\"shifts to the immigration authorities to\nprove [he] has no well-founded fear of\nfurther persecution.\" Galina v.

We previously have recognized\nthe authority of the BIA to take\n\f\"official notice of uncontroverted facts\nconcerning political conditions in asylum\nseekers’ home countries.\" Kaczmarczyk v.\nINS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561327\"><a href=\"/opinion/561327/mariusz-kaczmarczyk-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (7th Cir. 1991).\nHowever, in doing so, the BIA must treat\nsources of current information,\nespecially State Department country\nreports, \"with a healthy\nskepticism,rather than, as is its\ntendency, as Holy Writ.\" Galina, 213 F.3d\nat 959.\n\n  The INS argues that the BIA engaged in\nthis analysis and determined, based on\nthe current State Department country\nreport, that the situation in Macedonia\nhad improved to such a point as to remove\nany fear that Mr. Begzatowski might be\npersecuted upon his return. We do not\nbelieve that this is a fair reading of\nthe BIA’s opinion.\n\n  The BIA did not find that Mr.\nBegzatowski had established past\npersecution. Therefore, it did not shift\nthe burden to the INS to come forward\nwith evidence of changed country\nconditions, nor did it consider sua\nsponte whether those conditions had\nchanged sufficiently to diffuse Mr.\nBegzatowski’s well-founded fear of future\npersecution. Having found no past\npersecution, the BIA focused only on Mr.\nBegzatowski’s actions since his departure\nfrom Macedonia to determine whether he\nhad a well-founded fear of future\npersecution. It stated:\n\nThe respondent claims to have a well-\nfounded fear of persecution because of\nhis participation in an Albanian\nnationalist group in the United States\nand because his participation in that\ngroup is known to the Macedonian\ngovernment. In order to determine whether\nthat basis for the respondent’s fear does\nin fact provide an objective basis to\nfear persecution in Macedonia, we have\nexamined the documentation of record, as\nwell as the 1999 Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices . . . . Based upon the\ninformation contained in that report\nwhich reflects changed country\ncircumstances since the respondent’s\ndeparture from his country of origin, we\ncannot conclude that he has a well-\nfounded fear of persecution in Macedonia.\n\nR.4 (emphasis added). The BIA addressed\nonly the issue of whether Mr. Begzatowski\n\flikely would be persecuted for\nparticipating in pro-Albanian rallies in\nthe United States. This issue has little,\nif any, bearing on whether the current\nState Department country report provides\nsufficient detailed information to rebut\nthe presumption of future persecution\narising from Mr. Begzatowski’s\nexperiences in the Yugoslavian army.\nBecause the BIA did not consider whether\nthe country conditions in Macedonia rebut\nthe presumption that Mr. Begzatowski will\nsuffer future persecution in that\ncountry, we remand the case to the BIA\nfor consideration of this issue.\n\nConclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, the petition\nfor review is granted, and the judgment\nof the BIA is reversed and remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nPETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED;\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 The application in this case was filed prior to\nApril 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility\nAct of 1996, Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, and\ntherefore, as did the Board, we employ the termi-\nnology of the former statute.\n\n/2 Friends of Mr. Begzatowski also deserted; howev-\ner, they were found, jailed and returned to the\narmy.\n\n/3 The IJ stated: \"With respect to the respondent’s\ncredibility, while the respondent has testified\nto a battle in which he was sent to fight without\nany bullets, that experience does not raise any\nquestions in my mind. However, the respondent did\nindicate that he was sent to the battle front\nwhile Serbian soldiers were a few meters behind\nhim and the respondent was engaged in this battle\nfor a period of approximately two to three months\nwithout any bullets and to his knowledge, no\nSerbian soldiers were killed while Albanians\nwere. I can credit the possibility that for\ndiscriminatory and persecution purposes soldiers\ncould be denied bullets, but the fact that the\nrespondent was sent to the battle front for two\nto three months without any bullets and without\nbeing killed or shot raises credibility questions\nin my mind. Other than this issue, I essentially\nwould credit the testimony of the respondent.\"\nR.47.\n\f/4 The BIA also determined that Mr. Begzatowski did\nnot have a well-founded fear of future persecu-\ntion based on his participation in pro-Albanian\nrallies while in the United States. Mr. Begzatow-\nski does not take issue with this portion of the\nBIA’s decision.\n\n/5 In its brief, the INS argues that Mr. Begzatowski\nis constrained by the credibility determinations\nof the IJ because those determinations were not\nidentified as a basis for his appeal to the BIA.\nWe disagree. We believe that Mr. Begzatowski’s\nnotice of appeal more than adequately apprised\nthe Board of his lack of faith in the factual\nfindings of the IJ. His notice states: \"The\nImmigration Judge arbitrarily, capriciously and\nincorrectly concluded that the Respondent hadn’t\nestablished prejudice at the hands of the perti-\nnent government authority sufficient to establish\nhis ’eligibility’ for the relief being sought, in\nlight of the evidence and testimony offered of\nRecord clearly establishing the same.\" R.35.
