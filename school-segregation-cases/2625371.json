In the\n\ndistrict court, ETC Marketing moved for summary judgment, arguing that its\n\fnatural gas was in interstate commerce and therefore exempt from ad valorem\n\ntaxation. Appellee Harris County Appraisal District (HCAD) also moved for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that the natural gas was not in interstate commerce,\n\nbut even if it were, it was nevertheless subject to ad valorem taxation.\n\n      The court denied ETC Marketing’s motion for summary judgment and\n\ngranted the appraisal district’s competing motion. ETC Marketing appealed the\n\nrulings. In our opinion dated October 2, 2014, we held that the stored gas was\n\nsubject to ad valorem taxation, and we affirmed the trial court’s judgment. ETC\n\nMarketing filed a motion for rehearing. We grant the motion for rehearing,\n\nwithdraw our prior opinion and vacate our prior judgment, and issue this opinion\n\nand judgment in their stead. Our disposition remains the same.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      ETC Marketing and its affiliate, Houston Pipeline Company, conduct\n\nbusiness and maintain offices in multiple locations throughout Texas. Both entities\n\nhave offices and employees in Houston and Dallas.\n\n      Houston Pipeline operates an intrastate natural gas pipeline. Its system is\n\nlocated entirely within Texas, although it connects to interstate pipelines. It owns\n\nand stores natural gas in the Bammel reservoir, a depleted oil reservoir in Harris\n\nCounty. As such, both Houston Pipeline and its contractual partners who store gas\n\nat Bammel rely upon and benefit from local emergency and law enforcement\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fservices provided by Harris County. Houston Pipeline pays ad valorem taxes to the\n\ncounty based on the appraised value of the land, the equipment used to operate the\n\nBammel reservoir, and the “cushion gas,” which is natural gas stored for the\n\npurpose of maintaining pressure in the reservoir and which is not sold or intended\n\nfor sale.\n\n       Natural gas is often traded across state lines, and title to the gas transfers to\n\nwhomever the seller “causes [the gas] to be delivered” and at the point where it is\n\ndelivered. Because natural gas is fungible, the point of sale does not necessarily\n\ncorrespond to a physical location associated with any particular seller’s natural gas.\n\nPut another way, the natural gas that a marketer offers for sale is not identifiable as\n\nany particular molecules of gas that will be delivered to the purchaser. Instead, the\n\nmarketer offers gas for sale, and the purchaser receives a corresponding amount of\n\ngas at the location where it is accepted.\n\n       Gas owned by various marketers is physically commingled in the pipeline\n\nsystem. For example, within the Bammel reservoir, gas destined for sale in Texas\n\nis physically commingled with gas destined for sale in interstate commerce.\n\nDistinct volumes of gas are segregated by paper allocation, which is used for\n\nverifying compliance with contracts and pipeline requirements, reporting to the\n\nTexas Railroad Commission, and payment of tariffs. The pipeline system controls\n\nthe physical movement of natural gas, and storage facilities such as the Bammel\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\freservoir are necessary for the efficient movement of the gas and for the regulation\n\nof pipeline capacities so that sufficient quantities can be supplied to users during\n\npeak demand periods.\n\n      ETC Marketing is a natural-gas marketer, which buys, sells, and markets\n\nnatural gas. It buys natural gas from multiple sellers, principally at the “Katy Hub,”\n\nwhich is a central delivery and distribution point for natural gas into and out of\n\nTexas. Because of the nature of the operation of the Katy Hub, ETC Marketing is\n\nunable to determine whether the natural gas it purchases there originated in Texas.\n\n      When ETC Marketing purchases natural gas, it is “immediately entrusted” to\n\nits affiliate Houston Pipeline for storage, and ultimately for transportation to\n\npurchasers through the pipeline system. ETC Marketing’s storage agreement with\n\nHouston Pipeline allows it to buy gas and “time the market” by holding it for\n\ndelivery at a later time. 1 Accordingly, ETC Marketing has stored gas in the\n\nBammel reservoir for several months at a time, buying it during warmer months\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Although Houston Pipeline operates an intrastate pipeline, it is authorized to\n      provide such storage and transportation services to ETC Marketing, which\n      sells some of its gas in the interstate market, without becoming subject to\n      federal regulation as a natural gas company. See 15 U.S.C. § 717; 15 U.S.C.\n      § 3371 (Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, § 311). However, due to the nature\n      of this authorization, Houston Pipeline gives precedence to transportation of\n      intrastate-bound gas and may refuse to deliver interstate gas if necessary for\n      the operation of the pipeline.\n\n\n                                          4\n\fand selling it to northern markets in the winter months. The length of time the gas\n\nis stored depends on the volume, time of year, and demand for the gas.\n\n      ETC Marketing takes the position that all of its gas stored in the Bammel\n\nreservoir is in interstate commerce, because its business plan is to sell all of the gas\n\nto out-of-state customers. Daniel Hyvl, senior counsel to both ETC Marketing and\n\nHouston Pipeline, testified that ETC Marketing was created for the purpose of\n\nbuying and selling gas in the interstate market, as contrasted with the intrastate\n\nbusiness of Houston Pipeline. He explained that all of ETC Marketing’s gas “is\n\nbeing sold in interstate commerce, because that’s the business they’re in, to market\n\nthe gas . . . and not in competition with the pipeline who’s selling in intrastate\n\nmarketing.” However, while ETC Marketing generally has a profit-maximizing\n\nmotivation to sell its gas only in interstate commerce, there is no legal requirement\n\nthat it do so. Rather, Hyvl explained that ETC Marketing is “free to sell” its gas\n\nwherever it could “get the best price.” He also said: “[T]here is nothing that says\n\nthat the gas has to go to a particular location . . . . ETC Marketing has the right to\n\nsell” its gas stored at Bammel “anywhere it wants to sell it.”\n\n      HCAD appraised the value of approximately 33 billion cubic feet of natural\n\ngas owned by ETC Marketing and stored in the Bammel reservoir for the calendar\n\nyear 2010, and it assessed ad valorem taxes on the value of that gas. ETC\n\nMarketing has admitted that it owns the natural gas that was stored in the Bammel\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\freservoir and was the subject of HCAD’s appraisal. 2 Yet ETC Marketing protested\n\nthe tax to the Harris County Appraisal Review Board (ARB), challenging it, in\n\npart, on the legal basis that the gas was entirely exempt from taxation because it\n\nwas in interstate commerce. The ARB upheld the inclusion of the natural gas on\n\nthe appraisal rolls, and ETC Marketing appealed to the district court. The appeal\n\nwas premised entirely on the legal argument that the gas was exempt from taxation\n\nbecause it was in interstate commerce. CR 3–8 (original petition); CR 23–32 (ETC\n\nMarketing’s motion for summary judgment).\n\n      In the district court, the parties filed competing motions for summary\n\njudgment. As summary-judgment evidence, ETC Marketing attached to its motion\n\nseveral affidavits, explaining the facts relating to the storage and transportation of\n\nthe natural gas at issue and establishing the amount of ad valorem property tax paid\n\nby Houston Pipeline for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. HCAD took positions\n\nopposite from ETC Marketing: that the gas was not in interstate commerce, but\n\neven if it were, it would nevertheless be subject to taxation under the standard of\n\nComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 1076 (1977). After\n\nconsidering the arguments made by the parties, the trial court denied ETC\n\n\n2\n      In its original petition, ETC Marketing alleged that it “owns Property within\n      the Defendant’s jurisdictional boundaries for the tax year.” “Property” is a\n      defined term in the original petition: it means “the property and/or properties\n      listed in Exhibit ‘A’.” Exhibit A to the original petition identifies the\n      “Property” as “Bammel Working Gas-32,267,485.”\n\n                                          6\n\fMarketing’s motion for summary judgment, and it rendered a final judgment in\n\nfavor of HCAD. ETC Marketing appealed.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n      On appeal, ETC Marketing contends that the trial court erred by denying its\n\nmotion for summary judgment and by granting HCAD’s motion for summary\n\njudgment. To prevail on appeal, ETC Marketing must demonstrate both that its\n\nnatural gas was in interstate commerce, and that the trial court erred in its\n\ndetermination that the gas was subject to ad valorem taxation. We conclude that\n\neven if ETC Marketing’s stored gas was in interstate commerce, it has presented\n\nno compelling legal argument that the gas was immune from local taxation.\n\nAccordingly, we will address that issue directly, and we need not separately\n\nresolve whether the gas was actually in interstate commerce (including a subsidiary\n\nevidentiary issue relevant to that issue 3). See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n\n3\n      One of the exhibits submitted by ETC Marketing in support of its motion for\n      summary judgment was an affidavit and report from its designated expert\n      witness, Richard Smead. Among other things, the Smead report opined that\n      all of the gas “handled by ETC Marketing that traveled to the Bammel Field\n      was destined for interconnections with interstate pipelines to be carried to\n      out-of-state markets,” and therefore was “in interstate commerce.” The\n      district court sustained HCAD’s objection to Smead’s report on the grounds\n      that his opinions were “unsupported, conclusory, [and] subjective,” and that\n      his “legal conclusions that the gas is in interstate commerce are ipse dixit,”\n      and are not competent summary-judgment evidence under Rule 702 of the\n      Texas Rules of Evidence and Rules 192.3 and 194.2(f) of the Texas Rules of\n      Civil Procedure. Because our analysis assumes, without deciding, that the\n      gas at issue was in interstate commerce as asserted by Smead, we need not\n\n                                           7\n\f      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d\n\n844, 848 (Tex. 2009). When both sides move for summary judgment, and the trial\n\ncourt grants one motion and denies the other, reviewing courts consider both sides’\n\nsummary-judgment evidence, determine all questions presented, and render the\n\njudgment the trial court should have rendered. Gilbert Tex. Constr., L.P. v.\n\nUnderwriters at Lloyd’s London, 327 S.W.3d 118, 124 (Tex. 2010). Each party\n\nmoving for traditional summary judgment bears the burden of showing that no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott,\n\n128 S.W.3d 211, 215–16 (Tex. 2003). When a plaintiff moves for summary\n\njudgment on its own claim, it must conclusively prove all essential elements of its\n\ncause of action. See Rhone–Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 223 (Tex.\n\n1999); City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.\n\n1979). A defendant moving for summary judgment must conclusively negate at\n\nleast one essential element of each of the plaintiff’s causes of action or\n\nconclusively establish each element of an affirmative defense. Sci. Spectrum, Inc.\n\nv. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex. 1997).\n\n\n\n      resolve the issue of whether the trial court erred by sustaining HCAD’s\n      objection to the report. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n                                         8\n\f      The Texas Constitution provides that “all . . . tangible personal property in\n\nthis State, unless exempt as required or permitted by this Constitution . . . shall be\n\ntaxed in proportion to its value, which shall be ascertained as may be provided by\n\nlaw.” TEX. CONST. art. VIII, § 1(b). Under the Tax Code, unless exempt by law,\n\ntangible personal property is taxable if it is located in the taxing unit “for longer\n\nthan a temporary period.”4 But “[p]roperty exempt from ad valorem taxation by\n\nfederal law is exempt from taxation.” TEX. TAX CODE ANN. § 11.12 (West 2008).\n\n      The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to regulate interstate\n\ncommerce, see U.S. CONST. art. I, 8, cl. 3, and it has been interpreted by the United\n\nStates Supreme Court to include a “dormant” Commerce Clause, an implicit\n\nprohibition on a state’s imposition of discriminatory burdens on interstate\n\ncommerce. 5 The Dormant Commerce Clause does not relieve those engaged in\n\ninterstate commerce from their “just share of the state tax burden even though it\n\n\n\n\n4\n      TEX. TAX CODE ANN. § 11.01 (West 2008); see also id. § 21.02. With\n      respect to the date of the valuation, which is not an issue in dispute in this\n      appeal, the “owner of an inventory” “may elect to have the inventory\n      appraised at its market value as of September 1 of the year preceding the tax\n      year to which the appraisal applies.” Id. § 23.12; see Enron Corp. v. Spring\n      Indep. Sch. Dist., 922 S.W.2d 931, 933 (Tex. 1996). ETC Marketing elected\n      a September 2009 valuation for the purposes of the 2010 tax year.\n5\n      Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. Michigan Public Svc. Comm’n, 545 U.S. 429,\n      433, 125 S. Ct. 2419, 2422–23 (2005); see also In re Nestle USA, Inc., 387\n      S.W.3d 610, 624–25 (Tex. 2012).\n\n                                          9\n\fincreases the cost of doing business.” 6 “The ‘just share of state tax burden’\n\nincludes sharing in the cost of providing ‘police and fire protection, the benefit of a\n\ntrained work force and the advantages of a civilized society.’” 7 The burden is on\n\nthe taxpayer to prove that a tax is invalid under the Dormant Commerce Clause,\n\nbut to do so the taxpayer need only prove that the tax fails one prong of the\n\nComplete Auto test. 8 Under the Complete Auto standard, a state tax on interstate\n\ncommerce ordinarily “will not survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if the taxpayer\n\ndemonstrates that the tax (1) applies to an activity lacking a substantial nexus to\n\nthe taxing State; (2) is not fairly apportioned; (3) discriminates against interstate\n\ncommerce; or (4) is not fairly related to the services provided by the State.” 9\n\n      As noted above, for the purposes of our analysis of this appeal, we assume\n\nwithout deciding that the natural gas at issue is in the stream of interstate\n\n\n6\n      Western Live Stock v.

We also assume, as admitted by ETC Marketing, that it owns an\n\namount of gas stored in Harris County, at the Bammel reservoir, equivalent to the\n\namount of gas appraised by HCAD. 10 The sole argument advanced by ETC\n\nMarketing to evade the application of ad valorem taxation is the operation of the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause, as measured by the four prongs of the Complete Auto\n\ntest. See Appellant’s Br. at 3246.\n\n     I.      Substantial nexus to the taxing state\n\n          The first prong of the Complete Auto test considers whether the tax applies\n\nto an activity that has a substantial nexus with the taxing state. Complete Auto, 430\n\nU.S. at 279, 97 S. Ct. at 1079. ETC Marketing had offices and employees in Harris\n\nCounty and elsewhere in the state of Texas. The natural gas at issue was purchased\n\nin Texas at the Katy Hub, and it was transported by Houston Pipeline, which also\n\n\n10\n          Some of ETC Marketing’s arguments are premised upon the physical nature\n          of the gas and the pipeline system, effectively suggesting that its gas is not\n          actually contained within the Bammel reservoir, but that instead it at all\n          times flows freely throughout the interstate pipeline system. Our legal\n          analysis accepts ETC Marketing’s admission that it owns the gas located at\n          Bammel, just as both parties assumed this fact for the purposes of the\n          appraisal, and just as ETC Marketing itself assumes for accounting and\n          regulatory purposes. The Tax Code permits a taxpayer protest on the basis\n          that property should not be included on the appraisal records. See, e.g., TEX.\n          TAX CODE ANN. § 41.41(a)(3). But the challenge raised by the appeals to the\n          district court and to this court cannot fairly be considered a challenge to the\n          factual determination that ETC Marketing owned and stored gas at Bammel;\n          instead the appeals assert a legal challenge to HCAD’s assessment of a tax\n          on that gas based upon ETC Marketing’s legal contention that the gas is in\n          interstate commerce and therefore exempt from local taxation.\n\n                                             11\n\fhas offices and employees in the state of Texas. Houston Pipeline’s entire system\n\nis located within Texas, including the Bammel reservoir. The natural gas in\n\nquestion was owned by ETC Marketing and stored for up to several months at a\n\ntime in the Bammel reservoir, pursuant to a storage agreement with Houston\n\nPipeline.\n\n      These factors establish that ETC Marketing had a substantial physical\n\npresence in Harris County, and they therefore distinguish this case from one it\n\nrelies upon in this appeal, Peoples Gas, Light, & Coke Co. v. Harrison Cent.\n\nAppraisal Dist., 270 S.W.3d 208 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2008, pet. denied). In\n\nPeoples Gas, the court of appeals held that a tax assessment on stored natural gas\n\nwas invalid under Complete Auto because a substantial nexus with Texas was\n\nlacking. Id. at 219. But unlike this case, Peoples Gas had no physical facilities,\n\nemployees, representatives, or customers in Texas. Id. at 218. Its only connection\n\nto Texas was through the “structure and location” of the separately owned pipeline,\n\nwhich made the decision about where to store the gas and paid its own ad valorem\n\ntaxes on the facility and equipment used for storage of natural gas in Texas. Id. at\n\n218–19. In contrast, ETC Marketing had a physical presence in Harris County\n\nincluding employees, offices, and—most significantly—natural gas that it had\n\nspecifically contracted to store with Houston Pipeline. Unlike the pipeline at issue\n\n\n\n\n                                        12\n\fin Peoples Gas,11 Houston Pipeline’s facilities are located entirely within Texas,\n\nincluding the Bammel reservoir in Harris County. There was no evidence that the\n\ngas was already bound for another state when it was committed to Houston\n\nPipeline. 12 Moreover, unlike the scenario in Peoples Gas, in which the court\n\nemphasized that the owner of the gas made no decision to store gas in Texas to\n\nserve its own business purpose,13 here there was evidence that ETC Marketing\n\ncontracted to store the gas in Houston Pipeline’s facilities, located entirely within\n\nTexas, for its own business purposes of timing the market and selling the gas at\n\nhigher prices out of state during cold months.14 And although ETC Marketing\n\n\n11\n      Peoples Gas, Light, & Coke Co. v.

App.—Texarkana 2008, pet. denied) (pipeline at\n      issue had “many” associated “storage facilities” that were “operated ‘in the\n      aggregate,’” such that the pipeline’s storage and transportation of gas did not\n      “use any particular storage field exclusively”).\n12\n      In contrast, in Peoples Gas the appellant had purchased natural gas and paid\n      for its “contractual storage in the Iowa-Illinois zone,” “transportation to the\n      Iowa–Illinois zone,” and the contractual right to physical delivery in\n      Chicago, Illinois. Id. at 213–14.\n13\n      Id. at 216 (“Since Peoples has no control over where that natural gas is\n      stored and how much is stored at any given location, we cannot say that\n      Peoples made the decision to store gas at North Lansing in order to serve its\n      business purpose.”).\n14\n      Our dissenting colleague contends that by observing the differences between\n      this case and Peoples Gas, we have “implicitly” concluded that the gas at\n      issue was not in interstate commerce. Not so. Still, we observe the\n      distinction between the cases because it is ETC Marketing’s express\n      contention that its gas is in interstate commerce even while it is being stored\n\n                                         13\n\fasserts that Houston Pipeline had the contractual right to control where the gas was\n\nstored, the record contains no evidence that Houston Pipeline had storage capacity\n\nfor the appraised volume of gas at any location other than at the Bammel reservoir.\n\n      The prolonged physical presence of ETC Marketing’s gas, deliberately\n\nstored in Texas, also distinguishes this case from the circumstances presented in\n\nMidland Central Appraisal District v. BP America Production Co., 282 S.W.3d\n\n215 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2009, pet. denied), in which ad valorem tax was\n\nimproperly assessed on oil passing in interstate commerce through an interstate\n\npipeline, but temporarily held in a tank farm located in Texas. Unlike ETC\n\nMarketing’s natural gas deliberately stored at Bammel to facilitate timing the\n\nnatural gas market, the oil at issue in the Midland case was not held in the tank\n\nfarm for storage purposes or for any business purpose of the owner other than its\n\ntransmission through the pipeline. See 282 S.W.3d at 221–23.\n\n      ETC Marketing argues that the United States Supreme Court has held that\n\nphysical presence does not satisfy the substantial nexus test in ad valorem cases.\n\nWe disagree. ETC Marketing relies on Quill Corp. v. North Dakota By & Through\n\nHeitkamp, 504 U.S. 298, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992), which reaffirmed that physical\n\n      at Bammel pending its later decision of where and when to sell the gas. See\n      Appellant’s Br. at 27. The circumstances that inform a decision about\n      whether goods are “in transit” also may inform a court’s decision about\n      whether the first and fourth nexus requirements of Complete Auto are met.\n      See Diamond Shamrock Ref. & Mktg. Co. v. Nueces Cnty. Appraisal Dist.,\n      876 S.W.2d 298, 302 (1994).\n\n                                        14\n\fpresence satisfies the first prong of the Complete Auto test in sales-and-use tax\n\ncases. See id. at 317–18, 112 S. Ct. at 1916. Texas cases have come to the same\n\nconclusion in other contexts and expressly rejected ETC Marketing’s argument.\n\nSee, e.g., Rylander v. 3 Beall Bros. 3, Inc., 2 S.W.3d 562, 570 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n1999, pet. denied) (franchise tax case, citing Quill Corp., 504 U.S. at 312–14, 112\n\nS. Ct. 1904).15\n\n      The Commerce Clause requirement of a substantial nexus with the taxing\n\nstate is satisfied for purposes of an ad valorem tax by the taxpayer’s physical\n\npresence in the state in the form of physical storage of tangible personal property.\n\nBecause ETC Marketing was physically present in the state, and the activity being\n\n\n\n\n15\n      Moreover, this issue was presented to the Supreme Court of Texas in\n      Virginia Indonesia Co. v. Harris County Appraisal Dist., 910 S.W.2d 905\n      (Tex. 1995), a case that challenged HCAD’s assessment of ad valorem taxes\n      on goods stored in Harris County while in transit intended for foreign export.\n      The Court’s majority resolved that appeal by concluding that the tax violated\n      the federal constitution’s Import-Export Clause, U.S. CONST. art. 1, § 10,\n      cl. 2, expressly declining to address whether the tax also offended the\n      Commerce Clause. See VICO, 910 S.W.2d at 915. But in his dissenting\n      opinion, then-Justice Nathan Hecht did reach the issue, joined by then-\n      Justice Priscilla Owen. And Justice Hecht observed in that case: “The goods\n      clearly have a nexus to this state. They are present for relatively prolonged\n      periods during which they receive local services such as police and fire\n      protection.” Id. at 925 (Hecht, J., dissenting); see also Peoples Gas, 270\n      S.W.3d at 218 (“The Commerce Clause requirement of a substantial nexus\n      with the taxing state is satisfied by the taxpayer’s physical presence in the\n      state.”).\n\n                                        15\n\ftaxed—ownership and storage of natural gas—occurred in Harris County, 16 there is\n\na substantial nexus between the activity being taxed and the state of Texas.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the tax in this case applies to an activity that has a\n\nsubstantial nexus with the taxing state. See Complete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279, 97 S.\n\nCt. at 1079.\n\n     II.      Fair apportionment\n\n           The second prong of the Complete Auto test is whether the tax is fairly\n\napportioned. Id. “The central purpose behind the apportionment requirement is to\n\nensure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction.”\n\nGoldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252, 260–61, 109 S. Ct. 582, 588 (1989). To\n\ndetermine “whether a tax is fairly apportioned” we examine “whether it is\n\ninternally and externally consistent.” Id. at 261, 109 S. Ct. at 589.\n\n\n\n\n16\n           Notably, in similar circumstances the supreme courts of both Oklahoma and\n           Kansas have recently found the required substantial nexus to exist based\n           solely on the physical presence of the gas and without regard to any of the\n           owner’s other activities within the state. See In re Assessment of Pers. Prop.\n           Taxes Against Missouri Gas Energy, Div. of S. Union Co., for Tax Years\n           1998, 1999, & 2000, 234 P.3d 938, 959 n.84 (Okla. 2008) (expressly\n           declining to follow Peoples Gas), cert. denied sub nom.

Valuation of State for\n           Tax Year 2009 Pursuant to K.S.A. 74-2438, 313 P.3d 789, 799 (Kan. 2013)\n           (also declining to follow Peoples Gas: “There is axiomatically a substantial\n           nexus between Kansas and the gas stored in this state.”), cert. denied, 135 S.\n           Ct. 51 (2014).\n\n                                             16\n\f      a.     Internal consistency. A tax is internally consistent when it is\n\n“structured so that if every State were to impose an identical tax, no multiple\n\ntaxation would result.” Id. We consider the text of the challenged statute and\n\ndetermine whether multiple taxation would ensue if other States had identical\n\nstatutes. Id. Here, the relevant provisions of the Texas Tax Code impose taxes on\n\n“tangible personal property” that is located in the taxing unit on the date of\n\nvaluation “for longer than a temporary period.” TEX. TAX CODE ANN. §§ 11.01,\n\n21.02. It has been conceded for purposes of this appeal that ETC Marketing owned\n\nthe gas at issue and that it was located in Harris County at the time its value was\n\nassessed. There is no argument that ETC Marketing contracted to store its gas in\n\nany other state. There is no argument that any other taxing jurisdiction has\n\nattempted to impose an ad valorem tax on the gas at issue for a period of time that\n\noverlaps the assessment at issue. Because the record does not suggest that ETC\n\nMarketing attempted to store its gas in two different states at the same time, its\n\nvalue could not be taxed by another jurisdiction at the same time, and thus we\n\nconclude on this record that the tax is internally consistent. See Goldberg, 488 U.S.\n\nat 261, 109 S. Ct. at 589.\n\n      b.     External consistency. “The external consistency test asks whether the\n\nState has taxed only that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which\n\nreasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed.” Id. at 262,\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f109 S. Ct. at 589. “We thus examine the in-state business activity which triggers\n\nthe taxable event and the practical or economic effect of the tax on that interstate\n\nactivity.” Id. HCAD argues that the tax is externally consistent because it has a\n\nright to impose the ad valorem tax and because the gas is stored for months rather\n\nthan simply being present on the date of assessment or valuation. ETC Marketing\n\nargues that the tax is externally inconsistent because it is not possible to determine,\n\nat any given time, the actual, physical location of its natural gas. It says in its brief:\n\n“Given the ethereal nature of gas, it is impossible to determine what portion of the\n\ngas to which ETC has a right, if any, is actually located under Harris County.”\n\nLikewise, it contends that it is not possible to determine whether or how much of\n\nits natural gas originated in Texas. But as we have already explained, we must\n\nreject this reasoning because ETC Marketing has acknowledged its ownership of\n\nthe 33 billion cubic feet of natural gas stored in the Bammel reservoir as to which\n\nHCAD assessed taxes. In light of this record, ETC Marketing’s argument that the\n\ntax was externally inconsistent because it was not possible to determine the\n\nlocation of particular molecules of its gas must fail. The tax reflects the in-state\n\ncomponent of the storage of the entire volume of gas and is externally consistent.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the tax in this case was fairly apportioned. See\n\nComplete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279, 97 S. Ct. at 1079.\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f   III.   Discrimination against interstate commerce\n\n      The third prong of the Complete Auto test is whether the tax discriminates\n\nagainst interstate commerce. Id. A tax is nondiscriminatory under Complete Auto\n\nwhen it “places no greater burden upon interstate commerce than the state places\n\nupon competing intrastate commerce of like character.” Id. at 282, 97 S. Ct. at\n\n1081. Based on its argument that the tax is not fairly apportioned, ETC Marketing\n\nconcludes that the tax discriminates “in practical effect.” We have explained why\n\nits arguments as to fair apportionment are not meritorious. HCAD taxed only that\n\nquantity of gas stored in Harris County on the date of taxation and as to which\n\nETC Marketing acknowledged its ownership. Nothing in the record indicates that\n\nthese taxes were selectively imposed on interstate commerce or that the rates of\n\ntaxation were different or more onerous for property in interstate commerce.\n\nNothing in the record indicates any lack of uniformity or unfairness in the process\n\nof assessing ad valorem taxes on ETC Marketing’s gas which we assume to be in\n\ninterstate commerce as compared with like property purely in intrastate commerce.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the ad valorem taxes here were nondiscriminatory.\n\nSee Nueces Cnty Appraisal Dist. v. Diamond Shamrock Refining & Marketing Co.,\n\n853 S.W.2d 212, 217–18 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1993) (“Clearly, this\n\nnondiscriminatory tax passes this test because the taxing state only taxed that\n\nproperty which was present within its boundaries and received governmental\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\fservices regardless of its origin or its destination.”), aff’d, 876 S.W.2d 298 (Tex.\n\n1994); see also Vinmar, Inc. v. Harris Cnty. Appraisal Dist., 947 S.W.2d 554, 559\n\n(Tex. 1997) (Hecht, J., dissenting) (“The tax in this case is nondiscriminatory; that\n\nis, it does not single out property awaiting export. It is imposed on all personal\n\nproperty in Harris County on January 1 each year.”). Cf. Michelin Tire Corp. v.\n\nWages, 423 U.S. 276, 287, 96 S. Ct. 535, 542 (1976) (noting that\n\n“nondiscriminatory ad valorem” and other types of taxes share “the characteristic\n\nthat they cannot be selectively imposed and increased so as substantially to impair\n\nor prohibit importation”); Dep’t of Revenue of State of Wash. v.

Ct. 1388, 1398 (1978) (“The\n\nCommerce Clause balance tips against the tax only when it unfairly burdens\n\ncommerce by exacting more than a just share from the interstate activity.”)\n\n      The tax at issue in this case is an ad valorem tax of general application, and\n\nwe hold that it was not discriminatory. See Complete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279, 97 S.\n\nCt. at 1079.\n\n   IV.   Fair relation to State-provided services\n\n      The fourth and final prong of the Complete Auto test is whether the tax is\n\nfairly related to the services provided by the state. Id. “The fair relation prong of\n\nComplete Auto requires no detailed accounting of the services provided to the\n\ntaxpayer on account of the activity being taxed, nor, indeed, is a State limited to\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\foffsetting the public costs created by the taxed activity.” Okla. Tax Comm’n v.\n\nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 199–200, 115 S. Ct. 1331, 1345–46 (1995); see\n\nalso In re Nestle USA, Inc., 387 S.W.3d 610, 625 (Tex. 2012). “[P]olice and fire\n\nprotection, along with the usual and usually forgotten advantages conferred by the\n\nState’s maintenance of a civilized society, are justifications enough for the\n\nimposition of a tax.” Jefferson Lines, 514 U.S. at 199–200, 115 S. Ct. at 1345–46.\n\n      ETC Marketing argues that the “fairly related” prong is not satisfied because\n\nthe gas was entrusted to Houston Pipeline, which pays taxes on the Bammel\n\nreservoir and the equipment related to it. It further argues that Houston Pipeline\n\nhas complete and exclusive control over the activity being taxed, which is the\n\nstorage of the gas in the reservoir. However, the summary-judgment evidence\n\nshowed that ETC Marketing retained control over the disposition of the gas for its\n\nown business purposes.\n\n      ETC Marketing has the burden of proof on this Complete Auto issue. See\n\nBarclays Bank, 512 U.S. at 314, 114 S. Ct. at 2278. It owns the gas while it is\n\nstored at Bammel, and it enjoys the benefit of public services which facilitate gas\n\nstorage, which in turn allows it to accomplish its business objective of buying\n\nnatural gas and holding it for sale at some later point in time. Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that the summary-judgment evidence shows that the tax in this case is\n\nfairly related to the services provided by the state.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Michael Massengale\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Higley, and Massengale.\n\nJustice Keyes, dissenting.\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\f",

In the\n\ndistrict court, ETC Marketing moved for summary judgment, arguing that its\n\fnatural gas was in interstate commerce and therefore exempt from ad valorem\n\ntaxation. Appellee Harris County Appraisal District (HCAD) also moved for\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that the natural gas was not in interstate commerce,\n\nbut even if it were, it was nevertheless subject to ad valorem taxation.\n\n      The court denied ETC Marketing’s motion for summary judgment and\n\ngranted the appraisal district’s competing motion. ETC Marketing appealed the\n\nrulings. In our opinion dated October 2, 2014, we held that the stored gas was\n\nsubject to ad valorem taxation, and we affirmed the trial court’s judgment. ETC\n\nMarketing filed a motion for rehearing. We grant the motion for rehearing,\n\nwithdraw our prior opinion and vacate our prior judgment, and issue this opinion\n\nand judgment in their stead. Our disposition remains the same.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      ETC Marketing and its affiliate, Houston Pipeline Company, conduct\n\nbusiness and maintain offices in multiple locations throughout Texas. Both entities\n\nhave offices and employees in Houston and Dallas.\n\n      Houston Pipeline operates an intrastate natural gas pipeline. Its system is\n\nlocated entirely within Texas, although it connects to interstate pipelines. It owns\n\nand stores natural gas in the Bammel reservoir, a depleted oil reservoir in Harris\n\nCounty. As such, both Houston Pipeline and its contractual partners who store gas\n\nat Bammel rely upon and benefit from local emergency and law enforcement\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fservices provided by Harris County. Houston Pipeline pays ad valorem taxes to the\n\ncounty based on the appraised value of the land, the equipment used to operate the\n\nBammel reservoir, and the “cushion gas,” which is natural gas stored for the\n\npurpose of maintaining pressure in the reservoir and which is not sold or intended\n\nfor sale.\n\n       Natural gas is often traded across state lines, and title to the gas transfers to\n\nwhomever the seller “causes [the gas] to be delivered” and at the point where it is\n\ndelivered. Because natural gas is fungible, the point of sale does not necessarily\n\ncorrespond to a physical location associated with any particular seller’s natural gas.\n\nPut another way, the natural gas that a marketer offers for sale is not identifiable as\n\nany particular molecules of gas that will be delivered to the purchaser. Instead, the\n\nmarketer offers gas for sale, and the purchaser receives a corresponding amount of\n\ngas at the location where it is accepted.\n\n       Gas owned by various marketers is physically commingled in the pipeline\n\nsystem. For example, within the Bammel reservoir, gas destined for sale in Texas\n\nis physically commingled with gas destined for sale in interstate commerce.\n\nDistinct volumes of gas are segregated by paper allocation, which is used for\n\nverifying compliance with contracts and pipeline requirements, reporting to the\n\nTexas Railroad Commission, and payment of tariffs. The pipeline system controls\n\nthe physical movement of natural gas, and storage facilities such as the Bammel\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\freservoir are necessary for the efficient movement of the gas and for the regulation\n\nof pipeline capacities so that sufficient quantities can be supplied to users during\n\npeak demand periods.\n\n      ETC Marketing is a natural-gas marketer, which buys, sells, and markets\n\nnatural gas. It buys natural gas from multiple sellers, principally at the “Katy Hub,”\n\nwhich is a central delivery and distribution point for natural gas into and out of\n\nTexas. Because of the nature of the operation of the Katy Hub, ETC Marketing is\n\nunable to determine whether the natural gas it purchases there originated in Texas.\n\n      When ETC Marketing purchases natural gas, it is “immediately entrusted” to\n\nits affiliate Houston Pipeline for storage, and ultimately for transportation to\n\npurchasers through the pipeline system. ETC Marketing’s storage agreement with\n\nHouston Pipeline allows it to buy gas and “time the market” by holding it for\n\ndelivery at a later time. 1 Accordingly, ETC Marketing has stored gas in the\n\nBammel reservoir for several months at a time, buying it during warmer months\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Although Houston Pipeline operates an intrastate pipeline, it is authorized to\n      provide such storage and transportation services to ETC Marketing, which\n      sells some of its gas in the interstate market, without becoming subject to\n      federal regulation as a natural gas company. See 15 U.S.C. § 717; 15 U.S.C.\n      § 3371 (Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, § 311). However, due to the nature\n      of this authorization, Houston Pipeline gives precedence to transportation of\n      intrastate-bound gas and may refuse to deliver interstate gas if necessary for\n      the operation of the pipeline.\n\n\n                                          4\n\fand selling it to northern markets in the winter months. The length of time the gas\n\nis stored depends on the volume, time of year, and demand for the gas.\n\n      ETC Marketing takes the position that all of its gas stored in the Bammel\n\nreservoir is in interstate commerce, because its business plan is to sell all of the gas\n\nto out-of-state customers. Daniel Hyvl, senior counsel to both ETC Marketing and\n\nHouston Pipeline, testified that ETC Marketing was created for the purpose of\n\nbuying and selling gas in the interstate market, as contrasted with the intrastate\n\nbusiness of Houston Pipeline. He explained that all of ETC Marketing’s gas “is\n\nbeing sold in interstate commerce, because that’s the business they’re in, to market\n\nthe gas . . . and not in competition with the pipeline who’s selling in intrastate\n\nmarketing.” However, while ETC Marketing generally has a profit-maximizing\n\nmotivation to sell its gas only in interstate commerce, there is no legal requirement\n\nthat it do so. Rather, Hyvl explained that ETC Marketing is “free to sell” its gas\n\nwherever it could “get the best price.” He also said: “[T]here is nothing that says\n\nthat the gas has to go to a particular location . . . . ETC Marketing has the right to\n\nsell” its gas stored at Bammel “anywhere it wants to sell it.”\n\n      HCAD appraised the value of approximately 33 billion cubic feet of natural\n\ngas owned by ETC Marketing and stored in the Bammel reservoir for the calendar\n\nyear 2010, and it assessed ad valorem taxes on the value of that gas. ETC\n\nMarketing has admitted that it owns the natural gas that was stored in the Bammel\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\freservoir and was the subject of HCAD’s appraisal. 2 Yet ETC Marketing protested\n\nthe tax to the Harris County Appraisal Review Board (ARB), challenging it, in\n\npart, on the legal basis that the gas was entirely exempt from taxation because it\n\nwas in interstate commerce. The ARB upheld the inclusion of the natural gas on\n\nthe appraisal rolls, and ETC Marketing appealed to the district court. The appeal\n\nwas premised entirely on the legal argument that the gas was exempt from taxation\n\nbecause it was in interstate commerce. CR 3–8 (original petition); CR 23–32 (ETC\n\nMarketing’s motion for summary judgment).\n\n      In the district court, the parties filed competing motions for summary\n\njudgment. As summary-judgment evidence, ETC Marketing attached to its motion\n\nseveral affidavits, explaining the facts relating to the storage and transportation of\n\nthe natural gas at issue and establishing the amount of ad valorem property tax paid\n\nby Houston Pipeline for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. HCAD took positions\n\nopposite from ETC Marketing: that the gas was not in interstate commerce, but\n\neven if it were, it would nevertheless be subject to taxation under the standard of\n\nComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v.

To prevail on appeal, ETC Marketing must demonstrate both that its\n\nnatural gas was in interstate commerce, and that the trial court erred in its\n\ndetermination that the gas was subject to ad valorem taxation. We conclude that\n\neven if ETC Marketing’s stored gas was in interstate commerce, it has presented\n\nno compelling legal argument that the gas was immune from local taxation.\n\nAccordingly, we will address that issue directly, and we need not separately\n\nresolve whether the gas was actually in interstate commerce (including a subsidiary\n\nevidentiary issue relevant to that issue 3). See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n\n3\n      One of the exhibits submitted by ETC Marketing in support of its motion for\n      summary judgment was an affidavit and report from its designated expert\n      witness, Richard Smead. Among other things, the Smead report opined that\n      all of the gas “handled by ETC Marketing that traveled to the Bammel Field\n      was destined for interconnections with interstate pipelines to be carried to\n      out-of-state markets,” and therefore was “in interstate commerce.” The\n      district court sustained HCAD’s objection to Smead’s report on the grounds\n      that his opinions were “unsupported, conclusory, [and] subjective,” and that\n      his “legal conclusions that the gas is in interstate commerce are ipse dixit,”\n      and are not competent summary-judgment evidence under Rule 702 of the\n      Texas Rules of Evidence and Rules 192.3 and 194.2(f) of the Texas Rules of\n      Civil Procedure. Because our analysis assumes, without deciding, that the\n      gas at issue was in interstate commerce as asserted by Smead, we need not\n\n                                           7\n\f      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment.

Our legal\n          analysis accepts ETC Marketing’s admission that it owns the gas located at\n          Bammel, just as both parties assumed this fact for the purposes of the\n          appraisal, and just as ETC Marketing itself assumes for accounting and\n          regulatory purposes.

Internal consistency. A tax is internally consistent when it is\n\n“structured so that if every State were to impose an identical tax, no multiple\n\ntaxation would result.” Id. We consider the text of the challenged statute and\n\ndetermine whether multiple taxation would ensue if other States had identical\n\nstatutes. Id. Here, the relevant provisions of the Texas Tax Code impose taxes on\n\n“tangible personal property” that is located in the taxing unit on the date of\n\nvaluation “for longer than a temporary period.” TEX. TAX CODE ANN. §§ 11.01,\n\n21.02. It has been conceded for purposes of this appeal that ETC Marketing owned\n\nthe gas at issue and that it was located in Harris County at the time its value was\n\nassessed. There is no argument that ETC Marketing contracted to store its gas in\n\nany other state. There is no argument that any other taxing jurisdiction has\n\nattempted to impose an ad valorem tax on the gas at issue for a period of time that\n\noverlaps the assessment at issue. Because the record does not suggest that ETC\n\nMarketing attempted to store its gas in two different states at the same time, its\n\nvalue could not be taxed by another jurisdiction at the same time, and thus we\n\nconclude on this record that the tax is internally consistent. See Goldberg, 488 U.S.\n\nat 261, 109 S. Ct. at 589.\n\n      b.     External consistency. “The external consistency test asks whether the\n\nState has taxed only that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which\n\nreasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed.” Id. at 262,\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f109 S. Ct. at 589. “We thus examine the in-state business activity which triggers\n\nthe taxable event and the practical or economic effect of the tax on that interstate\n\nactivity.” Id. HCAD argues that the tax is externally consistent because it has a\n\nright to impose the ad valorem tax and because the gas is stored for months rather\n\nthan simply being present on the date of assessment or valuation. ETC Marketing\n\nargues that the tax is externally inconsistent because it is not possible to determine,\n\nat any given time, the actual, physical location of its natural gas. It says in its brief:\n\n“Given the ethereal nature of gas, it is impossible to determine what portion of the\n\ngas to which ETC has a right, if any, is actually located under Harris County.”\n\nLikewise, it contends that it is not possible to determine whether or how much of\n\nits natural gas originated in Texas. But as we have already explained, we must\n\nreject this reasoning because ETC Marketing has acknowledged its ownership of\n\nthe 33 billion cubic feet of natural gas stored in the Bammel reservoir as to which\n\nHCAD assessed taxes. In light of this record, ETC Marketing’s argument that the\n\ntax was externally inconsistent because it was not possible to determine the\n\nlocation of particular molecules of its gas must fail. The tax reflects the in-state\n\ncomponent of the storage of the entire volume of gas and is externally consistent.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the tax in this case was fairly apportioned. See\n\nComplete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279, 97 S. Ct. at 1079.\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f   III.   Discrimination against interstate commerce\n\n      The third prong of the Complete Auto test is whether the tax discriminates\n\nagainst interstate commerce. Id. A tax is nondiscriminatory under Complete Auto\n\nwhen it “places no greater burden upon interstate commerce than the state places\n\nupon competing intrastate commerce of like character.” Id. at 282, 97 S. Ct. at\n\n1081. Based on its argument that the tax is not fairly apportioned, ETC Marketing\n\nconcludes that the tax discriminates “in practical effect.” We have explained why\n\nits arguments as to fair apportionment are not meritorious. HCAD taxed only that\n\nquantity of gas stored in Harris County on the date of taxation and as to which\n\nETC Marketing acknowledged its ownership. Nothing in the record indicates that\n\nthese taxes were selectively imposed on interstate commerce or that the rates of\n\ntaxation were different or more onerous for property in interstate commerce.\n\nNothing in the record indicates any lack of uniformity or unfairness in the process\n\nof assessing ad valorem taxes on ETC Marketing’s gas which we assume to be in\n\ninterstate commerce as compared with like property purely in intrastate commerce.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the ad valorem taxes here were nondiscriminatory.\n\nSee Nueces Cnty Appraisal Dist. v.

It further argues that Houston Pipeline\n\nhas complete and exclusive control over the activity being taxed, which is the\n\nstorage of the gas in the reservoir. However, the summary-judgment evidence\n\nshowed that ETC Marketing retained control over the disposition of the gas for its\n\nown business purposes.\n\n      ETC Marketing has the burden of proof on this Complete Auto issue. See\n\nBarclays Bank, 512 U.S. at 314, 114 S. Ct. at 2278.
