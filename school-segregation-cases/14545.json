Code, § 288.5, subd. (a)),1 lewd acts upon a child (counts 2 and 4 through 6;\n§ 288, subd. (a)), sexual penetration by a foreign object (count 7; § 289, subd. (a)(1)), and\nforcible lewd acts upon a child (counts 8 through 12; § 288, subd. (b)(1)). As to all\ncounts, it was further alleged that appellant committed the offense against more than one\nvictim (§ 667.61, subds. (b) & (e)). Appellant pled not guilty and denied the special\nallegation.\n       Trial was by jury. Appellant was found guilty on all counts. Probation was\ndenied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of 119 years to life in state prison,\ncalculated as follows: 12 years for count 1; two years for count 2; seven consecutive 15-\nto-life terms for counts six through 12; and two concurrent 15-to-life terms for counts 4\nand 5. Appellant was awarded 492 days of presentence custody credits, consisting of 428\nactual days and 64 days of conduct credit.\n       Appellant timely appealed. On appeal, he argues: (1) The trial court abused its\ndiscretion under Evidence Code section 352 by allowing the introduction of evidence of\nappellant‘s prior domestic abuse against the mother of one of the victims. (2) The trial\ncourt committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury with the lesser included\noffenses of nonforcible lewd acts upon a minor (§ 288, subd. (b)) in counts 8 through 12.\n(3) Insufficient evidence supports appellant‘s conviction for committing sexual\npenetration by a foreign object by means of force or fear (count 7; § 289, subd. (a)(1)).\n(4) The trial court erred in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on the lesser included\noffenses of attempted sexual penetration by a foreign object and assault with intent to\ncommit penetration of the opening of another person by foreign object in count 7.\n(5) The admission of Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) evidence\nviolated appellant‘s rights to due process and a fair trial. (6) The prosecutor committed\nmisconduct during closing argument by improperly shifting the burden of proof to\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                               2\n\fappellant to prove his innocence. (7) Appellant was improperly sentenced under the one-\nstrike law under the multiple victim circumstance because the jury was not instructed on\nthis circumstance and it was not found true by the jury.\n       We affirm.\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGOUND\nI. Prosecution Evidence\n       A. The Sexual Abuse\n       Denise J. (Denise) was born in 1986. When she was four years old, appellant\nbegan to date her mother, Myrna D. (Myrna). Appellant started living with Myrna and\nDenise when Denise was five years old, and the two developed a ―father and daughter\nrelationship.‖ In 1995, when Denise was in the fourth grade, appellant ―started to look at\n[her] differently. He also started to go into [her] bedroom at night.‖ At the time, Denise\nshared a bedroom with her three-year-old half-sister, Melissa D. (Melissa).\n       The first night that appellant entered Denise‘s room, Denise woke up ―[f]eeling\nsomething lightly touching [her] body.‖ Appellant began to move his hand up and down\nDenise‘s body ―from [her] chest down to [her] private area,‖ increasing pressure as he did\nso. When appellant noticed that Denise was awake, he ran out of the room. Appellant\nreturned to Denise‘s room several nights later and ―[t]he same thing occurred again.‖\nThis ―caressing‖ occurred two to three times a week, in the same manner, for two years.\nAppellant would not allow Denise to lock her bedroom door at night, and Denise would\n―try to stay awake as much as [she] could.‖ If Melissa woke up while appellant was in\nthe room, appellant would yell at her, pull her hair, and tell her to go back to sleep.\n       In 1997, at the age of 11, Denise began to go through puberty and her ―breasts had\ngotten bigger.‖ Appellant began ―paying more attention to [Denise] than usual.‖ He\nwould put his arm around her and attempted to hug her more often. He told Denise that if\nshe ―said something,‖ he ―didn‘t care if [Myrna] got hurt.‖ Denise took this threat\nseriously.\n       One night in 1997, after appellant threatened Denise, Denise woke up to screams\nand yells. Denise witnessed appellant, who appeared drunk, throw a chair at Myrna and\n\n                                              3\n\fbeat her, drawing blood and leaving her with ―bruising on her face‖ and a broken nose.\nThe police were called and appellant was arrested and gone from the home for ―two to\nthree months.‖\n       In the Spring of 1998, appellant returned to the family home. Appellant, Denise,\nMelissa, and Myrna moved to a new house in Monterey Park. Denise continued to share\na bedroom with Melissa and appellant continued to go into their bedroom at night and\ntouch Denise. After getting evicted, appellant, Denise, Melissa, and Myrna moved again.\nAppellant‘s pattern of touching Denise in her room at night did not change.\n       Appellant began taking Denise on ―errands‖ with him during the day, once or\ntwice a week. When appellant would take her on these errands, he would drive the two\nof them around. The first time, appellant drove Denise to a CVS store parking lot, where\nhe ―leaned over and . . . tried to kiss [her].‖ Appellant tried to ―put his hand into\n[Denise‘s] shirt‖ as she pushed him away and attempted to fight back. On another\noccasion, appellant again attempted to kiss and touch Denise while stopped in a parking\nlot; Denise struggled with appellant and he stopped.\n       Once, after returning home from yet another errand, appellant became very\naggressive with Denise in the parking lot at their apartment complex. As she began to\nexit his vehicle, appellant ―pulled [her] down and then [appellant] got on top of [her].‖\nHe tried to kiss her and ―was shoving his hand under [her] shirt.‖ Appellant tried to get\nhis hand under Denise‘s bra as she yelled and screamed. Denise struggled with appellant\nand was able to get away and run inside her apartment.\n       Normally, appellant only took Denise out on errands. But, on one occasion,\nMelissa was also in the vehicle. He took the two children to a doughnut shop and parked\nin the parking lot. As soon as the engine turned off, appellant took off his seatbelt and\njumped over towards Denise and tried to kiss her, touching her as he did so. He also\nattempted to shove his hand under Denise‘s shirt. As Denise tried to push appellant\naway, Melissa yelled for appellant to stop. Appellant stopped and when they returned to\nthe apartment, Melissa told Myrna that appellant had been ―wrestling‖ with Denise in the\ncar. Myrna asked Denise if it was true, and Denise started crying and left the room.\n\n                                              4\n\fThen, appellant and Myrna argued; appellant got on his knees and said it was not true.\nAfter this incident, appellant stopped taking Denise on errands for a while, but still\ncontinued going into her room.\n       Toward the end of Denise‘s year in eighth grade, appellant started giving Denise\nmoney once or twice a month. On one occasion, after Myrna saw appellant give Denise\n$20, Myrna was upset because he had not been giving her anything; she took the money\naway from Denise and gave it back to appellant. When Denise left the room, appellant\nslapped Myrna and told her that what he gave to Denise was none of her business.\n       In 2000, Denise began high school. Sometime around the beginning of the school\nyear, Denise invited her high school friend, Jennifer B. (Jennifer) to spend the night.\nMelissa slept with Denise on the pull out couch bed and Jennifer slept on the twin bed.\n       Jennifer was awakened by ―a sharp pain . . . in [her] vagina.‖ Jennifer ―realized\nlater it was [appellant‘s] finger‖ that had caused the pain. When she tried to get up,\nappellant put his hand over her mouth and ―forcefully put [her] back down on the bed.‖\nAs Jennifer struggled, appellant attempted to pull down her shorts. He held a pillow over\nJennifer‘s face as he tried ―to wiggle his body in between [her] legs.‖ Appellant flipped\nJennifer onto her stomach and began to ―rub [her] butt.‖ Jennifer was finally able to push\nappellant off of her, waking Denise. Denise saw appellant standing in front of Jennifer\nand yelled, ―‗What the fuck [is] going on?‘‖ Melissa heard Jennifer screaming, ―‗He\ntouched me. He touched me.‘‖ After Jennifer yelled at appellant to get away, appellant\nran out of the room. Jennifer found her own menstrual blood on her neck, arm, and legs.\n       Denise grabbed Melissa and Jennifer, took them quickly into her aunt‘s bedroom,\nand went to her mother‘s room. Denise told Myrna that appellant was in her room where\nJennifer was sleeping. When Myrna asked Jennifer what had happened, she said that\nappellant had gone into the room, sat at the end of the bed, and asked where Denise was.\n       Appellant, who appeared drunk, barged through Myrna‘s door. After Denise left\nthe room, Myrna asked appellant why he was on the end of the bed looking for Denise.\nAppellant did not respond.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       Melissa then spoke with appellant in Myrna‘s room. Appellant pulled her close to\nhim, cried, and repeatedly said that he was sorry. When she asked what he was sorry for,\nappellant said that he thought it was her in the bed. Melissa responded, ―‗If you thought\nit was me, then you were going to touch me.‘‖ Appellant continued to cry, but did not\nrespond to this statement.\n       Jennifer and Denise then went into the living room and heard Myrna yelling at\nappellant in Spanish. Jennifer told Denise that appellant had tried to touch her, but\nprovided no other details. Denise and Jennifer then went outside and Denise told Jennifer\nthat appellant had touched her as well. When asked why she had not told anyone, Denise\nsaid that she was afraid that she would be separated from her mother and sister. Jennifer\ntold Denise that when she was ready to speak up, Jennifer would also speak up.\n       A short time after this incident, Denise and Myrna were called to a meeting with\nthe school counselor. The counselor said that she had received a phone call that Denise\nwas being abused at home. Myrna was shocked and asked Denise if it was true. Denise\ndenied the allegations. Jennifer was also called into the counselor‘s office, was asked\nabout the alleged touching incident, and denied that it had occurred.\n       In 2001, appellant was kicked out of the family house. Shortly thereafter, Denise\ntold Myrna what appellant had been doing to her. When Myrna asked why Denise had\nnever told her, Denise replied because appellant kept beating Myrna and had threatened\nher that he would beat Myrna more.\n       Myrna then called appellant‘s sister, Alma M. (Alma), and told her what appellant\nhad done. She told Alma that appellant was going to jail, and then she hung up the phone\nand called the police.\n       In the meantime, appellant was at the house playing with Melissa. Alma showed\nup, said something about the police, and screamed at appellant to get into the car;\nappellant ran into the car and left. Appellant fled to Texas.\n       B. Appellant Returns to California\n       Ten years later, in 2011, Los Angeles County Sheriff Detective Mark Shaughnessy\nlearned that appellant was receiving government financial aid and that the checks were\n\n                                             6\n\fgoing to Alma‘s address. Along with other officers, he went to that address, found\nappellant, and took him into custody.\n       C. CSAAS Evidence\n       Dr. Mitchell Eisen testified about CSAAS. CSAAS helps explain why some\nchildren react the way that they do after incidents of sexual abuse. CSAAS also explains\ndelayed reporting in cases of child abuse.\nII. Defense Evidence\n       Appellant testified on his own behalf. Denise is his stepdaughter. He had\n―problems‖ with her and she would not listen to him when he attempted to discipline her.\nShe called him ―retarded.‖ At night, appellant would occasionally enter the bedroom that\nDenise shared with Melissa and appellant‘s son. Once inside the bedroom, appellant\n―watched them. [He would] put the blanket on them. Sometimes Denise would be a little\nbit disheveled on the bed. [Appellant] would straighten it out and put the blanket on her.‖\nHe never molested Denise and never touched her on her breasts or over her vagina. After\nappellant moved to Monterey Park, he stopped checking on the girls at night.\n       Myrna asked appellant to discipline Denise when she would miss school or when\nshe stayed out late with her boyfriend. He took Denise along on errands, but never\nattempted to kiss or touch her. He remembered when Jennifer spent the night. That\nnight, he entered Denise‘s bedroom, ―tucked [Melissa] in, then [he] walked around the\nroom. [Appellant] fell. Then the light went on and [appellant] was puzzled.‖ When he\nfell, his hand landed on Jennifer‘s thigh. He left the room and asked Myrna who was in\nthe bedroom with Denise and Melissa, but Myrna did not tell him.\n       Appellant‘s brother-in-law testified that he never noticed anything unusual about\nthe way appellant and Denise interacted.\n       Riverside County Deputy Sheriff Patrick Larson testified that he was a deputy\nsheriff for Los Angeles County in 2001. He interviewed Denise on July 31, 2001. She\ntold him that appellant ―started molesting her around the age of nine with the last incident\noccurring when she was age 13, September of 1999.‖\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       In 2001, appellant moved to Texas because he had a warrant out for his arrest in\nCalifornia. He lived in Texas for five years.\n                                      DISCUSSION\nI. Admission of Evidence of Prior Domestic Violence\n       Appellant contends that his conviction must be reversed because the admission of\nevidence of his prior domestic violence against Myrna was erroneous. Specifically, he\nargues that the prior act was ―irrelevant to the charged offenses against Denise, was\nprejudicial, and requires reversal of appellant‘s convictions.‖\n       A. Relevant Proceedings Below\n       Prior to trial, there was a lengthy discussion about the admissibility of evidence\nconcerning domestic violence and physical abuse against Myrna while Denise was in\nseventh grade. The prosecutor argued that the evidence was admissible to establish\nforcible lewd acts on a child by the use of force, duress, menace, or fear. Appellant‘s\ntrial counsel argued that the evidence was irrelevant to what he did to Denise or Jennifer\nand should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352 as unduly prejudicial. The trial\ncourt found the evidence ―relevant to [Denise‘s] state of mind regarding the force or fear\nelements in the charges‖ and admitted the evidence.\n       The following evidence was admitted: Denise testified that she never told anyone\nabout appellant‘s actions because she was ―scared to say something‖ after she had\nwitnessed her mother ―being abused.‖ This particular incident occurred while she was in\nthe seventh grade: She remembered waking up to appellant and Myrna ―yelling and\nscreaming.‖ Appellant threw a chair at Myrna and then ―started beating her.‖ Myrna\nwas left bloody, bruised, and with a broken nose. Ultimately, appellant was arrested and\nwas absent from the home for a few months.\n       Denise further testified that at around the time of the assault on her mother,\nappellant threatened Denise with more violence if she told anyone about the sexual abuse.\nDenise stated that, based on appellant‘s threats and the past violent attack on her mother,\nshe was scared and ―didn‘t know how far [appellant] could take his violence towards\n[Denise and Myrna].‖\n\n                                                8\n\f       Myrna also testified about appellant‘s assault, corroborating Denise‘s earlier\ntestimony. Denise also told her mother that she never told anyone about appellant‘s\nsexual abuse because she did not want appellant to beat her mother again.\n       B. Relevant Law\n       Among other things, appellant was charged with violating section 288, subdivision\n(b)(1), which provides, in pertinent part: ―Any person who commits an act described in\nsubdivision (a) by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and\nunlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person, is guilty of a felony and shall be\npunished.‖ ―[D]uress involves psychological coercion. [Citation.] Duress can arise from\nvarious circumstances, including the relationship between the defendant and the victim\nand their relative ages and sizes.‖ (People v. Senior (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 765, 775.)\n―‗Where the defendant is a family member and the victim is young, . . . the position of\ndominance and authority of the defendant and his continuous exploitation of the victim‘\nis relevant to the existence of duress.‖ (Ibid.) And when sex acts are committed on a\nchild by a parental authority figure ―against a background of . . . violence, . . . the\ncircumstances [may] suggest[] an implied threat of harm‖ if the victim fails to submit.\n(People v. Wilkerson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1580.)\n       ―Under Evidence Code section 352, the trial court enjoys broad discretion in\nassessing whether the probative value of particular evidence is outweighed by concerns\nof undue prejudice, confusion or consumption of time.‖ (People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8\nCal.4th 1060, 1124.) A trial court‘s exercise of its discretion will not be disturbed\n―‗except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or\npatently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.‘‖ (Ibid.)\n       ―The prejudice which exclusion of evidence under Evidence Code section 352 is\ndesigned to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a defense that naturally flows from\nrelevant, highly probative evidence.‖ (People v. Karis (1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 638.)\n―[A]ll evidence which tends to prove guilt is prejudicial or damaging to the defendant‘s\ncase. The stronger the evidence, the more it is ‗prejudicial.‘ The ‗prejudice‘ referred to\nin Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an\n\n                                               9\n\femotional bias against defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the\nissues. In applying [Evidence Code] section 352, ‗prejudicial‘ is not synonymous with\n‗damaging.‘‖ (People v. Yu (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 358, 377.)\n       C. Analysis\n       Here, the evidence of appellant‘s prior violent act against Myrna, which was\nwitnessed by Denise and used as a constant reminder of what would happen if she\nreported appellant‘s abuse, was admissible to prove the force, fear, or duress element of\nthe charged crimes. (People v. Wilkerson, supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1580.) This\nevidence established that Denise feared appellant and submitted to his acts without\nalerting another person because she was afraid that he would hurt her or her mother.\n       This evidence was not overly inflammatory as it pertained exactly to an element of\nthe crimes charged. And, there was no probability of confusing the jury; a jury could\neasily segregate the charged crimes of sexual abuse from the evidence of prior domestic\nviolence. Furthermore, the prior act of domestic violence occurred at the same time\nappellant was sexually abusing Denise. Last, the introduction of this evidence was brief\nand did not waste time. (People v. Harris (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 727, 737.) Appellant\nwas painted faithfully for the jury. (Ibid.) It follows that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in admitting this evidence.\n       D. No Prejudice\n       Even if the trial court had erred in admitting this evidence, any error was harmless.\nIt is not reasonably probable that an outcome more favorable to appellant would have\noccurred had the evidence been excluded. (People v. Falsetta (1999) 21 Cal.4th 903,\n924–925.)\n       The main contested issue in this case was the credibility of the victims and\nwitnesses involved in the current offenses, and they gave clear, detailed, and credible\ntestimony regarding appellant‘s actions. Denise was unwavering in her testimony\nregarding the ongoing and unwanted physical advances by appellant, especially while\n―run[ning] errands.‖ Bolstering her testimony was the testimony from Melissa, who\nconfirmed appellant‘s forceful interaction with Denise in appellant‘s car.\n\n                                              10\n\f       Moreover, the testimony regarding the prior act was very brief and the jury was\ngiven a limiting instruction. Contrary to appellant‘s suggestion that the limiting\ninstruction was ineffective, we presume that the jury followed this limiting instruction.\n(People v. Waidla (2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 725.)\n       In urging us to reverse, appellant focuses on the prosecutor‘s remarks during\nclosing argument and claims that this evidence persuaded the jury that appellant\ncommitted the charged offenses. We cannot agree. As set forth above, the evidence of\nappellant‘s continuous sexual abuse was overwhelming. The only reasonable conclusion\nis that the jury based its convictions upon the evidence of appellant‘s sexual abuse of\nDenise and Jennifer, not upon the minimal evidence of the prior domestic violence of\nMyrna.\n       Because appellant would have been convicted even without the evidence of the\nprior domestic violence, any alleged error in admitting this evidence was harmless.\n(People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836.)\nII. Declined Instruction on Lesser Offense of Nonforcible Lewd Acts Upon a Minor\n(Counts 8 through 12)\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct on nonforcible\nlewd acts upon a minor as a lesser included offense of forcible lewd acts upon a minor.\n       A. Proceedings Below\n       During the jury instruction conference, the trial court decided to instruct the jury\nwith the lesser included offense of battery (§ 242) as to all counts, but refused to instruct\nthe jury with nonforcible lewd acts (§ 288, subd. (a)), as lesser included offenses to\nforcible lewd acts (§ 288, subd. (b)) in counts 8 through 12. In so ruling, the trial court\nreasoned that there was insufficient evidence to support this instruction.\n       B. Relevant Law\n       ―‗―‗It is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial\ncourt must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the\nevidence. [Citation.] The general principles of law governing the case are those\nprinciples closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are\n\n                                              11\n\fnecessary for the jury‘s understanding of the case.‘ That obligation has been held to\ninclude giving instructions on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a\nquestion as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present [citation],\nbut not when there is no evidence that the offense was less than that charged.‘\n[Citations.]‖ [Citations.]‘‖ (People v. Pitts (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 883, superseded\nby statute on other grounds as stated in People v. Levesque (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 530,\n536–537.)\n       ―Instructions on lesser included offenses need only be given ‗if the accused\nproffers evidence sufficient to ―deserve consideration by the jury, i.e., ‗evidence from\nwhich a jury composed of reasonable men could have concluded‘‖ that the particular\nfacts underlying the instruction did exist. [Citations.]‘‖ (People v. Pitts, supra, 223\nCal.App.3d at p. 883.) ―The trial court is not obligated to instruct sua sponte on\nnecessarily included offenses unless the evidence would justify a conviction of such\noffenses.‖ (People v. Wickersham (1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 325, disapproved on other\ngrounds in People v. Barton (1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201.)\n       C. No Evidence Supported Instruction on Lesser Included Offense\n       Here, the evidence did not support an instruction on the lesser included offense of\nnonforcible lewd acts upon a child (as opposed to forcible lewd acts upon a child).\nPeople v. Pitts, supra, 223 Cal.App.3d 606 is instructive. In that case, the trial court and\ntrial counsel considered whether there was a sua sponte duty, under the evidence\npresented, to instruct on section 288, subdivision (a), as a lesser included offense of\nsection 288, subdivision (b). (People v. Pitts, supra, at p. 883.) Because defense counsel\nhad not requested such an instruction and the defense‘s theory did not involve the\ncommission of a violation under subdivision (a) as opposed to subdivision (b) of section\n288, the trial court found no sua sponte duty to give the instruction. (People v. Pitts,\nsupra, at pp. 883–884.) The Court of Appeal affirmed, finding that the failure to give an\ninstruction under subdivision (a) was not error. (Id. at p. 884.) In so finding, the Court of\nAppeal recognized that the defendants had denied any part in the molestations—either\nthey were misidentified or the victims were lying. (Ibid.) In other words, ―[i]f the\n\n                                             12\n\fPeople‘s evidence were believed, [the defendants] were guilty as charged. If the\ndefendants‘ evidence were believed, they were not guilty of anything.‖ (Ibid.) Thus,\nunder no view of the evidence was any of the defendants guilty of nonforcible\nmolestation pursuant to section 288, subdivision (a). (Ibid.)\n       The same analysis applies here. If the People‘s evidence were believed, then\nappellant was guilty as charged; if appellant‘s evidence were believed, then he was not\nguilty of anything. Thus, there was no sua sponte duty to instruct on the lesser included\noffense of nonforcible lewd acts upon a child.\n       Appellant claims that Denise‘s testimony, particularly when considered in light of\nappellant‘s denial of wrongdoing and Melissa‘s testimony that she did not see any\nmolestation, could have supported the lesser included offense. But, Melissa‘s testimony\nconfirms that Denise had to fight appellant off, thereby establishing force.\n       Appellant‘s reliance upon People v. Hecker (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1238,\ndisapproved in part by People v. Soto (2011) 51 Cal.4th 229, 248, footnote 12, is\nmisplaced. In that case, a sexual abuse victim testified that she was not in fear of the\ndefendant and that he had never used physical force. (Id. at p. 1250.) Further, there was\nno evidence that he had threatened the victim. (Ibid.) In contrast, as set forth above,\nthere was ample evidence of physical contact between appellant and Denise while in his\ncar and that she would ―fight back.‖ And, Denise testified that she was afraid of\nappellant and that appellant had threatened her.\n       D. Any Assumed Error was Harmless\n       As set forth above, there was strong evidence of appellant‘s sexual abuse of\nDenise. Thus, even if the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser\nincluded offense of nonforcible lewd acts, it is not reasonably probable that he would\nhave received a more favorable result. It follows that any alleged error was harmless.\n(People v. Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fIII. Sufficient Evidence on Count 7\n       Appellant contends that his conviction for sexual penetration by a foreign object in\ncount 7 was not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, he claims that ―there\nwas insufficient evidence to establish the requisite element of penetration.‖\n       A. Relevant Law\n       On appeal, a reviewing court must review the entire record in a light favorable to\nthe judgment below and determine whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion\nof the trier of fact that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving each element of the\ncrime. (People v. Kelly (1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 528.) ―Substantial‖ evidence is evidence\nof ―preponderable legal significance reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.\nTo be ‗substantial,‘ the evidence must reasonably inspire confidence.‖ (People v. Morris\n(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 19, disapproved on other grounds in In re Sassounian (1995) 9\nCal.4th 535, 543, fn. 5 & 545, fn. 6.) Only by a clear showing that ―‗―on no hypothesis\nwhatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the verdict‖‘‖ will a\nconviction be reversed. (People v. Martinez (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1329.) A\nreviewing court‘s function is not to resolve credibility issues or evidentiary conflicts.\n(People v. Zamudio (2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 357.) ―If the circumstances reasonably justify\nthe jury‘s finding as to each element of the offense, the judgment may not be overturned\nwhen the circumstances might also reasonably support a contrary finding.‖ (People v.\nLewis (2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 643–644.)\n       B. Analysis\n       Here, appellant was charged with forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object\n(§ 289, subd. (a)(1)), requiring the jury to find that he committed the act of ―sexual\npenetration‖ against Jennifer. As defined in section 289, subdivision (k)(1), ―sexual\npenetration‖ is ―the act of causing the penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal\nopening of any person . . . for the purpose of sexual arousal.‖ Any ―‗foreign object,‘\n. . . include[s] any part of the body . . . .‖ (§ 289, subd. (k)(2).)\n       Jennifer described appellant‘s criminal conduct in detail at trial. She was\nawakened to a ―sharp pain in . . . [her] vagina.‖ When asked what had caused the pain,\n\n                                                14\n\fJennifer said that it was appellant‘s finger. She also testified that appellant placed his\nhand over her mouth and, after struggling free from appellant, she found her own blood\non her neck, arm, and legs. The origin of the blood was Jennifer‘s vagina. Based upon\nthis evidence, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that appellant‘s finger had\npenetrated Jennifer‘s vagina. (§ 289, subd. (k)(1); People v. Harrison (1989) 48 Cal.3d\n321, 328.)\nIV. Declined Instruction on Lesser Offense of Attempted Sexual Penetration by a\nForeign Object\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on\nattempted sexual penetration as a lesser offense to sexual penetration.\n       For the same reasons set forth above, the trial court did not err. There was no\nevidence to support appellant‘s theory that he merely attempted to sexually penetrate\nJennifer; rather, appellant‘s theory at trial was a complete denial of any wrongdoing.\n(People v. Friend (2009) 47 Cal.4th 1, 52 [either the defendant committed the greater\noffense or none at all].) Because there was no evidence to show that appellant made a\ndirect, but ineffectual, act toward the completion of the charged offense, but was\ninterrupted or unable to complete the act, he was not entitled to an instruction on the\nlesser offense. (People v. Rundle (2008) 43 Cal.4th 76, 143, disapproved on other\ngrounds in People v. Doolin (2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 417–418.)\n       It follows that even if the trial court erred by declining to give this instruction, that\nerror was harmless. Again, there was ample evidence to support the greater offense. In\nlight of that evidence, it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a\nmore favorable result to appellant.\nV. Expert Testimony on CSAAS\n       Appellant contends that the admission of expert testimony on CSAAS was\nimproper and prejudicial because it served to ―add weight to Denise and Jennifer‘s\ntestimony by having an expert testify [that their] behavior conformed to the behavior of\nsexually abused minors.‖ Further, appellant complains that the CSAAS evidence\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f―enhanced [the victims‘] credibility and provided the jury with a way to credit their\naccusations of sexual abuse and to discredit appellant‘s denial.‖\n       A. Proceedings Below\n       During trial, before Dr. Eisen was called to testify, the trial court discussed his\nproposed testimony with counsel outside the presence of the jury. The prosecutor\nindicated that Dr. Eisen would testify about CSAAS, particularly why there are delays\nbefore people disclose abuse. The prosecutor also wanted Dr. Eisen to offer a historical\nperspective on CSAAS. Defense counsel was concerned about being able to cross-\nexamine the expert about the ―limitations and shortcomings of this syndrome.‖ The trial\ncourt responded that the defense would be permitted to ―cross-examine on any issue that\nthey feel is important.‖ Then the trial court stated: ―So with that, as long as there are no\ndiscussions or opinions about this particular witness and an opinion as to whether or not\nthis particular victim was assaulted or an opinion as to whether this particular victim is\ntelling the truth, I think that the testimony is admissible. [¶] And there are numerous\ncases that talk about it, and I think we already talked about [People v. Patino (1994) 26\nCal.App.4th 1737,] which [discusses] limitations of it. With that in mind, I am going to\nallow it.‖\n       B. Forfeiture\n       As set forth above, appellant‘s trial counsel raised concerns about the ability to\ncross-examine Dr. Eisen on CSAAS. But, he never objected to the admissibility of the\nevidence on the basis that it was improper or wrongly corroborated Denise and Jennifer‘s\ntestimony. Accordingly, appellant has forfeited that claim on appeal. (People v. Geier\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 555, 609; Evid. Code, § 353, subd. (a).) Our analysis could stop here.\n       C. CSAAS Testimony was Properly Admitted\n       For the sake of completeness, we turn to the merits of this issue. A trial court‘s\nadmission of expert testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. (People v.\nGonzalez (2006) 38 Cal.4th 932, 944.) ―[A] trial court does not abuse its discretion\nunless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with\nit.‖ (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 377.)\n\n                                             16\n\f        ―[I]t has long been held that in a judicial proceeding presenting the question of\nwhether a child has been sexually molested, CSAAS is admissible evidence for the\nlimited purpose of disabusing the fact finder of common misconceptions it might have\nabout how child victims react to sexual abuse.‖ (In re S.C. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 396,\n418.) Carefully tailored CSAAS evidence is admissible to explain the emotional\nantecedents of abused children‘s seemingly self-impeaching behavior. (People v.\nMcAlpin (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1289, 1300–1301.) ―The evidence is admissible solely for the\npurpose of showing that the victim‘s reactions as demonstrated by the evidence are not\ninconsistent with having been molested.‖ (People v. Bowker (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 385,\n394.)\n        Here, the CSAAS evidence was offered for the exact reason it exists—Dr. Eisen\nexplained that Denise‘s behavior conformed to the behavior of sexually abused minors.\nIn other words, her delayed disclosure was consistent with CSAAS. (People v. Patino,\nsupra, 26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1742.) And, the jury was instructed on the use of Dr. Eisen‘s\ntestimony regarding CSAAS: It was told that Dr. Eisen‘s testimony about CSAAS was\n―not evidence that [appellant] committed any of the crimes charged against him.‖ And,\nthe jury was instructed that it could use Dr. Eisen‘s testimony to ―decid[e] whether or not\n[Denise‘s] conduct was not inconsistent with the conduct of someone who has been\nmolested, and in evaluating the believability of [her] testimony.‖\n        Contrary to appellant‘s suggestion that Dr. Eisen testified regarding Denise‘s\ncredibility, he expressly stated that he did not interview Denise, that he could not\ncomment on whether her memory was ―likely right or wrong‖, and that his testimony had\nnothing to do with the facts or allegations against appellant. Because this was the proper\nway to testify regarding CSAAS evidence, the trial court did not err in admitting it.\n        D. No Prejudice\n        Even if the trial court erred in admitting Dr. Eisen‘s CSAAS testimony, appellant\nwas not prejudiced by the alleged error. At the risk of sounding redundant, the evidence\nagainst appellant was overwhelming. And, Dr. Eisen made clear that the CSAAS\nevidence was not intended to show that appellant abused Denise. Further, the trial court\n\n                                             17\n\finstructed the jury as to the testimony‘s limited admissibility. When all of the\ncircumstances are considered, it is not reasonably probable that appellant would have\nreceived a more favorable verdict had Dr. Eisen‘s testimony been excluded. (People v.\nHousley (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 947, 959.)\nVI. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n       Appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he referred to\nappellant‘s flight in closing argument. Specifically, he claims that the prosecutor shifted\nthe burden of proof when he stated that flight was ―something that an innocent person\nwouldn‘t do.‖\n       A. Applicable Law\n       Regardless of subjective intent, a prosecutor commits misconduct if he uses\n―‗―‗―deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the\njury.‖‘‖‘‖ (People v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 819.) When attacking a prosecutor‘s\nremarks to a jury, a defendant must show a ―‗reasonable likelihood the jury understood or\napplied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous manner.‘‖ (People v.\nGurule (2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 657.)\n       The appellate court must ―‗―not lightly infer‖ that the jury drew the most\ndamaging rather than the least damaging meaning from the prosecutor‘s statements.‘‖\n(People v. Gurule, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 657.) A prosecutor violates federal due process\nonly if his comments are ―‗―so egregious that [they] infect[] the trial with such unfairness\nas to make the conviction a denial of due process.‖‘‖ (People v. Ayala (2000) 23 Cal.4th\n225, 283–284.)\n       B. Analysis\n       In the trial, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct by commenting on\nappellant‘s flight in his closing argument. There is no dispute that appellant was a\nfugitive for 10 years after he fled California upon learning that charges had been made\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fagainst him. Moreover, the jury was rightly instructed with CALCRIM No. 372,2 which\ncreates a permissible inference, rather than a mandatory presumption, and thus does not\nimpermissibly shift the burden of proof. (See People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 710\n[a flight instruction does not create an unconstitutional permissive inference or lessen the\nprosecutor‘s burden of proof].) The same can be said of the prosecutor‘s comments; he\nhad every right to refer to appellant‘s flight in closing argument and he properly invited\nthe jury to consider it as conduct that could have shown appellant‘s awareness of guilt.\n       C. Any Alleged Error was Harmless\n       Even if the prosecutor did err, that one isolated incident did not infect the entire\ntrial with unfairness; appellant has not shown prejudice in light of the record as a whole.\n(People v. Sanders (1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 527.) The jury was instructed with CALCRIM\nNo. 372, which guided the jurors on how to consider the evidence of flight. The trial\ncourt also instructed the jury that ―if you believe that the attorneys‘ comments on the law\nconflict with [the court‘s] instructions, [then the jury] must follow [the court‘s]\ninstructions.‖ The trial court‘s instructions, not the prosecutor‘s argument, are\ndeterminative, for we presume that ―jurors treat the court‘s instructions as a statement of\nthe law by a judge, and the prosecutor‘s comments as words spoken by an advocate in an\nattempt to persuade.‖ (People v. Clair (1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663, fn. 8.) Given the\ninstructions here, there is no reasonable likelihood that the prosecutor‘s statements would\nhave misled the jury or that a different result would have occurred. (Id. at p. 663.)\nVII. Sentencing\n       Appellant contends that he was improperly sentenced under the One Strike law\n(§ 667.61, subds. (b) & (e)) due to a ―failure to comply with the express pleading\nrequirement of section 667.61,‖ because the jury was not instructed on this circumstance,\nand because the circumstance ―was not found true by the jury.‖ In so urging, appellant\n\n\n2      The jury was instructed: ―If the defendant fled after he was accused of committing\nthe crime, that conduct may show that he was aware of his guilt. If you conclude that the\ndefendant fled, it is up to you to decide the meaning and importance of that conduct.\nHowever, evidence that the defendant fled cannot prove guilt by itself.‖\n\n                                             19\n\frelies heavily upon People v. Mancebo (2002) 27 Cal.4th 735 (Mancebo). But Mancebo\nhas nothing to do with the issues in this case. The Mancebo court considered the express\npleading requirement of section 667.61 and held that the defendant‘s due process right\nhad been violated because the special allegation (§ 667.61, subd. (e)(5)) had never been\nexpressly alleged in the information. (Mancebo, supra, at p. 743.) In contrast, here, the\nspecial allegation was pled in the amended information.\n       To the extent appellant suggests that reversal is required because the jury did not\nmake a special finding as to the multiple victim allegation, we are not convinced. Section\n667.61, subdivision (i), only requires the trier of fact to determine that the crime was\ncommitted against multiple victims; the statute does not specifically compel an additional\nspecial finding. (People v. Jones (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 693, 710–711.) When the jury\nreturned a guilty verdict on counts relating to both Jennifer (count 7) and Denise (counts\n1, 2, 4-6, and 8-12), it necessarily determined that there was more than one victim. This\nfactual issue was necessarily resolved adversely to appellant. (Id. at pp. 711–712.)\n       It follows that even if the trial court erred in neglecting to give the jury a special\nverdict form for the multiple victim circumstance, that error was harmless. (Mancebo,\nsupra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 728; People v. Jones, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at p. 711; People v.\nMarshall (1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 850.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f                                  DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS.\n\n\n\n\n                                         _____________________, J.\n                                           ASHMANN-GERST\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n_____________________, P.

Code, § 288.5, subd. (a)),1 lewd acts upon a child (counts 2 and 4 through 6;\n§ 288, subd. (a)), sexual penetration by a foreign object (count 7; § 289, subd. (a)(1)), and\nforcible lewd acts upon a child (counts 8 through 12; § 288, subd. (b)(1)). As to all\ncounts, it was further alleged that appellant committed the offense against more than one\nvictim (§ 667.61, subds. (b) & (e)). Appellant pled not guilty and denied the special\nallegation.\n       Trial was by jury. Appellant was found guilty on all counts. Probation was\ndenied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of 119 years to life in state prison,\ncalculated as follows: 12 years for count 1; two years for count 2; seven consecutive 15-\nto-life terms for counts six through 12; and two concurrent 15-to-life terms for counts 4\nand 5. Appellant was awarded 492 days of presentence custody credits, consisting of 428\nactual days and 64 days of conduct credit.\n       Appellant timely appealed. On appeal, he argues: (1) The trial court abused its\ndiscretion under Evidence Code section 352 by allowing the introduction of evidence of\nappellant‘s prior domestic abuse against the mother of one of the victims. (2) The trial\ncourt committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury with the lesser included\noffenses of nonforcible lewd acts upon a minor (§ 288, subd. (b)) in counts 8 through 12.\n(3) Insufficient evidence supports appellant‘s conviction for committing sexual\npenetration by a foreign object by means of force or fear (count 7; § 289, subd. (a)(1)).\n(4) The trial court erred in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on the lesser included\noffenses of attempted sexual penetration by a foreign object and assault with intent to\ncommit penetration of the opening of another person by foreign object in count 7.\n(5) The admission of Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) evidence\nviolated appellant‘s rights to due process and a fair trial. (6) The prosecutor committed\nmisconduct during closing argument by improperly shifting the burden of proof to\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                               2\n\fappellant to prove his innocence. (7) Appellant was improperly sentenced under the one-\nstrike law under the multiple victim circumstance because the jury was not instructed on\nthis circumstance and it was not found true by the jury.\n       We affirm.\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGOUND\nI. Prosecution Evidence\n       A. The Sexual Abuse\n       Denise J. (Denise) was born in 1986. When she was four years old, appellant\nbegan to date her mother, Myrna D. (Myrna). Appellant started living with Myrna and\nDenise when Denise was five years old, and the two developed a ―father and daughter\nrelationship.‖ In 1995, when Denise was in the fourth grade, appellant ―started to look at\n[her] differently. He also started to go into [her] bedroom at night.‖ At the time, Denise\nshared a bedroom with her three-year-old half-sister, Melissa D. (Melissa).\n       The first night that appellant entered Denise‘s room, Denise woke up ―[f]eeling\nsomething lightly touching [her] body.‖ Appellant began to move his hand up and down\nDenise‘s body ―from [her] chest down to [her] private area,‖ increasing pressure as he did\nso. When appellant noticed that Denise was awake, he ran out of the room. Appellant\nreturned to Denise‘s room several nights later and ―[t]he same thing occurred again.‖\nThis ―caressing‖ occurred two to three times a week, in the same manner, for two years.\nAppellant would not allow Denise to lock her bedroom door at night, and Denise would\n―try to stay awake as much as [she] could.‖ If Melissa woke up while appellant was in\nthe room, appellant would yell at her, pull her hair, and tell her to go back to sleep.\n       In 1997, at the age of 11, Denise began to go through puberty and her ―breasts had\ngotten bigger.‖ Appellant began ―paying more attention to [Denise] than usual.‖ He\nwould put his arm around her and attempted to hug her more often. He told Denise that if\nshe ―said something,‖ he ―didn‘t care if [Myrna] got hurt.‖ Denise took this threat\nseriously.\n       One night in 1997, after appellant threatened Denise, Denise woke up to screams\nand yells. Denise witnessed appellant, who appeared drunk, throw a chair at Myrna and\n\n                                              3\n\fbeat her, drawing blood and leaving her with ―bruising on her face‖ and a broken nose.\nThe police were called and appellant was arrested and gone from the home for ―two to\nthree months.‖\n       In the Spring of 1998, appellant returned to the family home. Appellant, Denise,\nMelissa, and Myrna moved to a new house in Monterey Park. Denise continued to share\na bedroom with Melissa and appellant continued to go into their bedroom at night and\ntouch Denise. After getting evicted, appellant, Denise, Melissa, and Myrna moved again.\nAppellant‘s pattern of touching Denise in her room at night did not change.\n       Appellant began taking Denise on ―errands‖ with him during the day, once or\ntwice a week. When appellant would take her on these errands, he would drive the two\nof them around. The first time, appellant drove Denise to a CVS store parking lot, where\nhe ―leaned over and . . . tried to kiss [her].‖ Appellant tried to ―put his hand into\n[Denise‘s] shirt‖ as she pushed him away and attempted to fight back. On another\noccasion, appellant again attempted to kiss and touch Denise while stopped in a parking\nlot; Denise struggled with appellant and he stopped.\n       Once, after returning home from yet another errand, appellant became very\naggressive with Denise in the parking lot at their apartment complex. As she began to\nexit his vehicle, appellant ―pulled [her] down and then [appellant] got on top of [her].‖\nHe tried to kiss her and ―was shoving his hand under [her] shirt.‖ Appellant tried to get\nhis hand under Denise‘s bra as she yelled and screamed. Denise struggled with appellant\nand was able to get away and run inside her apartment.\n       Normally, appellant only took Denise out on errands. But, on one occasion,\nMelissa was also in the vehicle. He took the two children to a doughnut shop and parked\nin the parking lot. As soon as the engine turned off, appellant took off his seatbelt and\njumped over towards Denise and tried to kiss her, touching her as he did so. He also\nattempted to shove his hand under Denise‘s shirt. As Denise tried to push appellant\naway, Melissa yelled for appellant to stop. Appellant stopped and when they returned to\nthe apartment, Melissa told Myrna that appellant had been ―wrestling‖ with Denise in the\ncar. Myrna asked Denise if it was true, and Denise started crying and left the room.\n\n                                              4\n\fThen, appellant and Myrna argued; appellant got on his knees and said it was not true.\nAfter this incident, appellant stopped taking Denise on errands for a while, but still\ncontinued going into her room.\n       Toward the end of Denise‘s year in eighth grade, appellant started giving Denise\nmoney once or twice a month. On one occasion, after Myrna saw appellant give Denise\n$20, Myrna was upset because he had not been giving her anything; she took the money\naway from Denise and gave it back to appellant. When Denise left the room, appellant\nslapped Myrna and told her that what he gave to Denise was none of her business.\n       In 2000, Denise began high school. Sometime around the beginning of the school\nyear, Denise invited her high school friend, Jennifer B. (Jennifer) to spend the night.\nMelissa slept with Denise on the pull out couch bed and Jennifer slept on the twin bed.\n       Jennifer was awakened by ―a sharp pain . . . in [her] vagina.‖ Jennifer ―realized\nlater it was [appellant‘s] finger‖ that had caused the pain. When she tried to get up,\nappellant put his hand over her mouth and ―forcefully put [her] back down on the bed.‖\nAs Jennifer struggled, appellant attempted to pull down her shorts. He held a pillow over\nJennifer‘s face as he tried ―to wiggle his body in between [her] legs.‖ Appellant flipped\nJennifer onto her stomach and began to ―rub [her] butt.‖ Jennifer was finally able to push\nappellant off of her, waking Denise. Denise saw appellant standing in front of Jennifer\nand yelled, ―‗What the fuck [is] going on?‘‖ Melissa heard Jennifer screaming, ―‗He\ntouched me. He touched me.‘‖ After Jennifer yelled at appellant to get away, appellant\nran out of the room. Jennifer found her own menstrual blood on her neck, arm, and legs.\n       Denise grabbed Melissa and Jennifer, took them quickly into her aunt‘s bedroom,\nand went to her mother‘s room. Denise told Myrna that appellant was in her room where\nJennifer was sleeping. When Myrna asked Jennifer what had happened, she said that\nappellant had gone into the room, sat at the end of the bed, and asked where Denise was.\n       Appellant, who appeared drunk, barged through Myrna‘s door. After Denise left\nthe room, Myrna asked appellant why he was on the end of the bed looking for Denise.\nAppellant did not respond.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       Melissa then spoke with appellant in Myrna‘s room. Appellant pulled her close to\nhim, cried, and repeatedly said that he was sorry. When she asked what he was sorry for,\nappellant said that he thought it was her in the bed. Melissa responded, ―‗If you thought\nit was me, then you were going to touch me.‘‖ Appellant continued to cry, but did not\nrespond to this statement.\n       Jennifer and Denise then went into the living room and heard Myrna yelling at\nappellant in Spanish. Jennifer told Denise that appellant had tried to touch her, but\nprovided no other details. Denise and Jennifer then went outside and Denise told Jennifer\nthat appellant had touched her as well. When asked why she had not told anyone, Denise\nsaid that she was afraid that she would be separated from her mother and sister. Jennifer\ntold Denise that when she was ready to speak up, Jennifer would also speak up.\n       A short time after this incident, Denise and Myrna were called to a meeting with\nthe school counselor. The counselor said that she had received a phone call that Denise\nwas being abused at home. Myrna was shocked and asked Denise if it was true. Denise\ndenied the allegations. Jennifer was also called into the counselor‘s office, was asked\nabout the alleged touching incident, and denied that it had occurred.\n       In 2001, appellant was kicked out of the family house. Shortly thereafter, Denise\ntold Myrna what appellant had been doing to her. When Myrna asked why Denise had\nnever told her, Denise replied because appellant kept beating Myrna and had threatened\nher that he would beat Myrna more.\n       Myrna then called appellant‘s sister, Alma M. (Alma), and told her what appellant\nhad done. She told Alma that appellant was going to jail, and then she hung up the phone\nand called the police.\n       In the meantime, appellant was at the house playing with Melissa. Alma showed\nup, said something about the police, and screamed at appellant to get into the car;\nappellant ran into the car and left. Appellant fled to Texas.\n       B. Appellant Returns to California\n       Ten years later, in 2011, Los Angeles County Sheriff Detective Mark Shaughnessy\nlearned that appellant was receiving government financial aid and that the checks were\n\n                                             6\n\fgoing to Alma‘s address. Along with other officers, he went to that address, found\nappellant, and took him into custody.\n       C. CSAAS Evidence\n       Dr. Mitchell Eisen testified about CSAAS. CSAAS helps explain why some\nchildren react the way that they do after incidents of sexual abuse. CSAAS also explains\ndelayed reporting in cases of child abuse.\nII. Defense Evidence\n       Appellant testified on his own behalf. Denise is his stepdaughter. He had\n―problems‖ with her and she would not listen to him when he attempted to discipline her.\nShe called him ―retarded.‖ At night, appellant would occasionally enter the bedroom that\nDenise shared with Melissa and appellant‘s son. Once inside the bedroom, appellant\n―watched them. [He would] put the blanket on them. Sometimes Denise would be a little\nbit disheveled on the bed. [Appellant] would straighten it out and put the blanket on her.‖\nHe never molested Denise and never touched her on her breasts or over her vagina. After\nappellant moved to Monterey Park, he stopped checking on the girls at night.\n       Myrna asked appellant to discipline Denise when she would miss school or when\nshe stayed out late with her boyfriend. He took Denise along on errands, but never\nattempted to kiss or touch her. He remembered when Jennifer spent the night. That\nnight, he entered Denise‘s bedroom, ―tucked [Melissa] in, then [he] walked around the\nroom. [Appellant] fell. Then the light went on and [appellant] was puzzled.‖ When he\nfell, his hand landed on Jennifer‘s thigh. He left the room and asked Myrna who was in\nthe bedroom with Denise and Melissa, but Myrna did not tell him.\n       Appellant‘s brother-in-law testified that he never noticed anything unusual about\nthe way appellant and Denise interacted.\n       Riverside County Deputy Sheriff Patrick Larson testified that he was a deputy\nsheriff for Los Angeles County in 2001. He interviewed Denise on July 31, 2001. She\ntold him that appellant ―started molesting her around the age of nine with the last incident\noccurring when she was age 13, September of 1999.‖\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       In 2001, appellant moved to Texas because he had a warrant out for his arrest in\nCalifornia. He lived in Texas for five years.\n                                      DISCUSSION\nI. Admission of Evidence of Prior Domestic Violence\n       Appellant contends that his conviction must be reversed because the admission of\nevidence of his prior domestic violence against Myrna was erroneous. Specifically, he\nargues that the prior act was ―irrelevant to the charged offenses against Denise, was\nprejudicial, and requires reversal of appellant‘s convictions.‖\n       A. Relevant Proceedings Below\n       Prior to trial, there was a lengthy discussion about the admissibility of evidence\nconcerning domestic violence and physical abuse against Myrna while Denise was in\nseventh grade. The prosecutor argued that the evidence was admissible to establish\nforcible lewd acts on a child by the use of force, duress, menace, or fear. Appellant‘s\ntrial counsel argued that the evidence was irrelevant to what he did to Denise or Jennifer\nand should be excluded under Evidence Code section 352 as unduly prejudicial. The trial\ncourt found the evidence ―relevant to [Denise‘s] state of mind regarding the force or fear\nelements in the charges‖ and admitted the evidence.\n       The following evidence was admitted: Denise testified that she never told anyone\nabout appellant‘s actions because she was ―scared to say something‖ after she had\nwitnessed her mother ―being abused.‖ This particular incident occurred while she was in\nthe seventh grade: She remembered waking up to appellant and Myrna ―yelling and\nscreaming.‖ Appellant threw a chair at Myrna and then ―started beating her.‖ Myrna\nwas left bloody, bruised, and with a broken nose. Ultimately, appellant was arrested and\nwas absent from the home for a few months.\n       Denise further testified that at around the time of the assault on her mother,\nappellant threatened Denise with more violence if she told anyone about the sexual abuse.\nDenise stated that, based on appellant‘s threats and the past violent attack on her mother,\nshe was scared and ―didn‘t know how far [appellant] could take his violence towards\n[Denise and Myrna].‖\n\n                                                8\n\f       Myrna also testified about appellant‘s assault, corroborating Denise‘s earlier\ntestimony. Denise also told her mother that she never told anyone about appellant‘s\nsexual abuse because she did not want appellant to beat her mother again.\n       B. Relevant Law\n       Among other things, appellant was charged with violating section 288, subdivision\n(b)(1), which provides, in pertinent part: ―Any person who commits an act described in\nsubdivision (a) by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and\nunlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person, is guilty of a felony and shall be\npunished.‖ ―[D]uress involves psychological coercion. [Citation.] Duress can arise from\nvarious circumstances, including the relationship between the defendant and the victim\nand their relative ages and sizes.‖ (People v. Senior (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775.)\n―‗Where the defendant is a family member and the victim is young, . . . the position of\ndominance and authority of the defendant and his continuous exploitation of the victim‘\nis relevant to the existence of duress.‖ (Ibid.) And when sex acts are committed on a\nchild by a parental authority figure ―against a background of . . . violence, . . . the\ncircumstances [may] suggest[] an implied threat of harm‖ if the victim fails to submit.\n(People v. Wilkerson (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296952\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296952/people-v-wilkerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1580.)\n       ―Under Evidence Code section 352, the trial court enjoys broad discretion in\nassessing whether the probative value of particular evidence is outweighed by concerns\nof undue prejudice, confusion or consumption of time.‖ (People v. Rodrigues (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613958\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613958/people-v-rodrigues/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124.) A trial court‘s exercise of its discretion will not be disturbed\n―‗except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or\npatently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.‘‖ (Ibid.)\n       ―The prejudice which exclusion of evidence under Evidence Code section 352 is\ndesigned to avoid is not the prejudice or damage to a defense that naturally flows from\nrelevant, highly probative evidence.‖ (People v. Karis (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405704\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405704/people-v-karis/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638.)\n―[A]ll evidence which tends to prove guilt is prejudicial or damaging to the defendant‘s\ncase. The stronger the evidence, the more it is ‗prejudicial.‘ The ‗prejudice‘ referred to\nin Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an\n\n                                               9\n\femotional bias against defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the\nissues. In applying [Evidence Code] section 352, ‗prejudicial‘ is not synonymous with\n‗damaging.‘‖ (People v. Yu (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2115444\"><a href=\"/opinion/2115444/people-v-yu/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377.)\n       C. Analysis\n       Here, the evidence of appellant‘s prior violent act against Myrna, which was\nwitnessed by Denise and used as a constant reminder of what would happen if she\nreported appellant‘s abuse, was admissible to prove the force, fear, or duress element of\nthe charged crimes. (People v. Wilkerson, supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1580.) This\nevidence established that Denise feared appellant and submitted to his acts without\nalerting another person because she was afraid that he would hurt her or her mother.\n       This evidence was not overly inflammatory as it pertained exactly to an element of\nthe crimes charged. And, there was no probability of confusing the jury; a jury could\neasily segregate the charged crimes of sexual abuse from the evidence of prior domestic\nviolence. Furthermore, the prior act of domestic violence occurred at the same time\nappellant was sexually abusing Denise. Last, the introduction of this evidence was brief\nand did not waste time. (People v. Harris (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737.) Appellant\nwas painted faithfully for the jury. (Ibid.) It follows that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in admitting this evidence.\n       D. No Prejudice\n       Even if the trial court had erred in admitting this evidence, any error was harmless.\nIt is not reasonably probable that an outcome more favorable to appellant would have\noccurred had the evidence been excluded. (People v. Falsetta (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1200056\"><a href=\"/opinion/1200056/people-v-falsetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n924–925.)\n       The main contested issue in this case was the credibility of the victims and\nwitnesses involved in the current offenses, and they gave clear, detailed, and credible\ntestimony regarding appellant‘s actions. Denise was unwavering in her testimony\nregarding the ongoing and unwanted physical advances by appellant, especially while\n―run[ning] errands.‖ Bolstering her testimony was the testimony from Melissa, who\nconfirmed appellant‘s forceful interaction with Denise in appellant‘s car.\n\n                                              10\n\f       Moreover, the testimony regarding the prior act was very brief and the jury was\ngiven a limiting instruction. Contrary to appellant‘s suggestion that the limiting\ninstruction was ineffective, we presume that the jury followed this limiting instruction.\n(People v. Waidla (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316339\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316339/people-v-waidla/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725.)\n       In urging us to reverse, appellant focuses on the prosecutor‘s remarks during\nclosing argument and claims that this evidence persuaded the jury that appellant\ncommitted the charged offenses. We cannot agree. As set forth above, the evidence of\nappellant‘s continuous sexual abuse was overwhelming. The only reasonable conclusion\nis that the jury based its convictions upon the evidence of appellant‘s sexual abuse of\nDenise and Jennifer, not upon the minimal evidence of the prior domestic violence of\nMyrna.\n       Because appellant would have been convicted even without the evidence of the\nprior domestic violence, any alleged error in admitting this evidence was harmless.\n(People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836.)\nII. Declined Instruction on Lesser Offense of Nonforcible Lewd Acts Upon a Minor\n(Counts 8 through 12)\n       Appellant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct on nonforcible\nlewd acts upon a minor as a lesser included offense of forcible lewd acts upon a minor.\n       A. Proceedings Below\n       During the jury instruction conference, the trial court decided to instruct the jury\nwith the lesser included offense of battery (§ 242) as to all counts, but refused to instruct\nthe jury with nonforcible lewd acts (§ 288, subd. (a)), as lesser included offenses to\nforcible lewd acts (§ 288, subd. (b)) in counts 8 through 12. In so ruling, the trial court\nreasoned that there was insufficient evidence to support this instruction.\n       B. Relevant Law\n       ―‗―‗It is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial\ncourt must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the\nevidence. [Citation.] The general principles of law governing the case are those\nprinciples closely and openly connected with the facts before the court, and which are\n\n                                              11\n\fnecessary for the jury‘s understanding of the case.‘ That obligation has been held to\ninclude giving instructions on lesser included offenses when the evidence raises a\nquestion as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present [citation],\nbut not when there is no evidence that the offense was less than that charged.‘\n[Citations.]‖ [Citations.]‘‖ (People v. Pitts (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citations.]‘‖ (People v. Pitts, supra, 223\nCal.App.3d at p. 883.) ―The trial court is not obligated to instruct sua sponte on\nnecessarily included offenses unless the evidence would justify a conviction of such\noffenses.‖ (People v.

No Evidence Supported Instruction on Lesser Included Offense\n       Here, the evidence did not support an instruction on the lesser included offense of\nnonforcible lewd acts upon a child (as opposed to forcible lewd acts upon a child).\nPeople v. Pitts, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is instructive. In that case, the trial court and\ntrial counsel considered whether there was a sua sponte duty, under the evidence\npresented, to instruct on section 288, subdivision (a), as a lesser included offense of\nsection 288, subdivision (b). (People v. Pitts, supra, at p. 883.) Because defense counsel\nhad not requested such an instruction and the defense‘s theory did not involve the\ncommission of a violation under subdivision (a) as opposed to subdivision (b) of section\n288, the trial court found no sua sponte duty to give the instruction. (People v. Pitts,\nsupra, at pp. 883–884.) The Court of Appeal affirmed, finding that the failure to give an\ninstruction under subdivision (a) was not error. (Id. at p. 884.) In so finding, the Court of\nAppeal recognized that the defendants had denied any part in the molestations—either\nthey were misidentified or the victims were lying. (Ibid.) In other words, ―[i]f the\n\n                                             12\n\fPeople‘s evidence were believed, [the defendants] were guilty as charged. If the\ndefendants‘ evidence were believed, they were not guilty of anything.‖ (Ibid.) Thus,\nunder no view of the evidence was any of the defendants guilty of nonforcible\nmolestation pursuant to section 288, subdivision (a). (Ibid.)\n       The same analysis applies here. If the People‘s evidence were believed, then\nappellant was guilty as charged; if appellant‘s evidence were believed, then he was not\nguilty of anything. Thus, there was no sua sponte duty to instruct on the lesser included\noffense of nonforcible lewd acts upon a child.\n       Appellant claims that Denise‘s testimony, particularly when considered in light of\nappellant‘s denial of wrongdoing and Melissa‘s testimony that she did not see any\nmolestation, could have supported the lesser included offense. But, Melissa‘s testimony\nconfirms that Denise had to fight appellant off, thereby establishing force.\n       Appellant‘s reliance upon People v. Hecker (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\ndisapproved in part by People v.

In that case, a sexual abuse victim testified that she was not in fear of the\ndefendant and that he had never used physical force. (Id. at p. 1250.) Further, there was\nno evidence that he had threatened the victim. (Ibid.) In contrast, as set forth above,\nthere was ample evidence of physical contact between appellant and Denise while in his\ncar and that she would ―fight back.‖ And, Denise testified that she was afraid of\nappellant and that appellant had threatened her.\n       D. Any Assumed Error was Harmless\n       As set forth above, there was strong evidence of appellant‘s sexual abuse of\nDenise. Thus, even if the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser\nincluded offense of nonforcible lewd acts, it is not reasonably probable that he would\nhave received a more favorable result. It follows that any alleged error was harmless.\n(People v. Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fIII. Sufficient Evidence on Count 7\n       Appellant contends that his conviction for sexual penetration by a foreign object in\ncount 7 was not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, he claims that ―there\nwas insufficient evidence to establish the requisite element of penetration.‖\n       A. Relevant Law\n       On appeal, a reviewing court must review the entire record in a light favorable to\nthe judgment below and determine whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion\nof the trier of fact that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving each element of the\ncrime. (People v. Kelly (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119859\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119859/people-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528.) ―Substantial‖ evidence is evidence\nof ―preponderable legal significance reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.\nTo be ‗substantial,‘ the evidence must reasonably inspire confidence.‖ (People v.

Only by a clear showing that ―‗―on no hypothesis\nwhatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the verdict‖‘‖ will a\nconviction be reversed. (People v. Martinez (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244870\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244870/people-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Analysis\n       Here, appellant was charged with forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object\n(§ 289, subd. (a)(1)), requiring the jury to find that he committed the act of ―sexual\npenetration‖ against Jennifer. As defined in section 289, subdivision (k)(1), ―sexual\npenetration‖ is ―the act of causing the penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal\nopening of any person . . . for the purpose of sexual arousal.‖ Any ―‗foreign object,‘\n. . . include[s] any part of the body . . . .‖ (§ 289, subd. (k)(2).)\n       Jennifer described appellant‘s criminal conduct in detail at trial. She was\nawakened to a ―sharp pain in . . . [her] vagina.‖ When asked what had caused the pain,\n\n                                                14\n\fJennifer said that it was appellant‘s finger. She also testified that appellant placed his\nhand over her mouth and, after struggling free from appellant, she found her own blood\non her neck, arm, and legs. The origin of the blood was Jennifer‘s vagina. Based upon\nthis evidence, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that appellant‘s finger had\npenetrated Jennifer‘s vagina. (§ 289, subd. (k)(1); People v. Harrison (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1175468\"><a href=\"/opinion/1175468/people-v-harrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328.)\nIV. Declined Instruction on Lesser Offense of Attempted Sexual Penetration by a\nForeign Object\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on\nattempted sexual penetration as a lesser offense to sexual penetration.\n       For the same reasons set forth above, the trial court did not err. There was no\nevidence to support appellant‘s theory that he merely attempted to sexually penetrate\nJennifer; rather, appellant‘s theory at trial was a complete denial of any wrongdoing.\n(People v. Friend (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 [either the defendant committed the greater\noffense or none at all].) Because there was no evidence to show that appellant made a\ndirect, but ineffectual, act toward the completion of the charged offense, but was\ninterrupted or unable to complete the act, he was not entitled to an instruction on the\nlesser offense. (People v. Rundle (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143, disapproved on other\ngrounds in People v. Doolin (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417–418.)\n       It follows that even if the trial court erred by declining to give this instruction, that\nerror was harmless. Again, there was ample evidence to support the greater offense. In\nlight of that evidence, it is not reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a\nmore favorable result to appellant.\nV. Expert Testimony on CSAAS\n       Appellant contends that the admission of expert testimony on CSAAS was\nimproper and prejudicial because it served to ―add weight to Denise and Jennifer‘s\ntestimony by having an expert testify [that their] behavior conformed to the behavior of\nsexually abused minors.‖ Further, appellant complains that the CSAAS evidence\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f―enhanced [the victims‘] credibility and provided the jury with a way to credit their\naccusations of sexual abuse and to discredit appellant‘s denial.‖\n       A. Proceedings Below\n       During trial, before Dr. Eisen was called to testify, the trial court discussed his\nproposed testimony with counsel outside the presence of the jury. The prosecutor\nindicated that Dr. Eisen would testify about CSAAS, particularly why there are delays\nbefore people disclose abuse. The prosecutor also wanted Dr. Eisen to offer a historical\nperspective on CSAAS. Defense counsel was concerned about being able to cross-\nexamine the expert about the ―limitations and shortcomings of this syndrome.‖ The trial\ncourt responded that the defense would be permitted to ―cross-examine on any issue that\nthey feel is important.‖ Then the trial court stated: ―So with that, as long as there are no\ndiscussions or opinions about this particular witness and an opinion as to whether or not\nthis particular victim was assaulted or an opinion as to whether this particular victim is\ntelling the truth, I think that the testimony is admissible. [¶] And there are numerous\ncases that talk about it, and I think we already talked about [People v. Patino (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2243657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2243657/people-v-patino/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,] which [discusses] limitations of it. With that in mind, I am going to\nallow it.‖\n       B. Forfeiture\n       As set forth above, appellant‘s trial counsel raised concerns about the ability to\ncross-examine Dr. Eisen on CSAAS. But, he never objected to the admissibility of the\nevidence on the basis that it was improper or wrongly corroborated Denise and Jennifer‘s\ntestimony. Accordingly, appellant has forfeited that claim on appeal. (People v. Geier\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599781\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599781/people-v-geier/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 609; Evid. Code, § 353, subd. (a).) Our analysis could stop here.\n       C. CSAAS Testimony was Properly Admitted\n       For the sake of completeness, we turn to the merits of this issue. A trial court‘s\nadmission of expert testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. (People v.\nGonzalez (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639585\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639585/people-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 944.) ―[A] trial court does not abuse its discretion\nunless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with\nit.‖ (People v. Carmony (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521321\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521321/people-v-carmony/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377.)\n\n                                             16\n\f        ―[I]t has long been held that in a judicial proceeding presenting the question of\nwhether a child has been sexually molested, CSAAS is admissible evidence for the\nlimited purpose of disabusing the fact finder of common misconceptions it might have\nabout how child victims react to sexual abuse.‖ (In re S.C. (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n418.) Carefully tailored CSAAS evidence is admissible to explain the emotional\nantecedents of abused children‘s seemingly self-impeaching behavior. (People v.\nMcAlpin (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386826\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386826/people-v-mcalpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1300–1301.) ―The evidence is admissible solely for the\npurpose of showing that the victim‘s reactions as demonstrated by the evidence are not\ninconsistent with having been molested.‖ (People v. Bowker (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2133578\"><a href=\"/opinion/2133578/people-v-bowker/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n394.)\n        Here, the CSAAS evidence was offered for the exact reason it exists—Dr. Eisen\nexplained that Denise‘s behavior conformed to the behavior of sexually abused minors.\nIn other words, her delayed disclosure was consistent with CSAAS. (People v. Patino,\nsupra, 26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1742.) And, the jury was instructed on the use of Dr. Eisen‘s\ntestimony regarding CSAAS: It was told that Dr. Eisen‘s testimony about CSAAS was\n―not evidence that [appellant] committed any of the crimes charged against him.‖ And,\nthe jury was instructed that it could use Dr. Eisen‘s testimony to ―decid[e] whether or not\n[Denise‘s] conduct was not inconsistent with the conduct of someone who has been\nmolested, and in evaluating the believability of [her] testimony.‖\n        Contrary to appellant‘s suggestion that Dr. Eisen testified regarding Denise‘s\ncredibility, he expressly stated that he did not interview Denise, that he could not\ncomment on whether her memory was ―likely right or wrong‖, and that his testimony had\nnothing to do with the facts or allegations against appellant. Because this was the proper\nway to testify regarding CSAAS evidence, the trial court did not err in admitting it.\n        D. No Prejudice\n        Even if the trial court erred in admitting Dr. Eisen‘s CSAAS testimony, appellant\nwas not prejudiced by the alleged error. At the risk of sounding redundant, the evidence\nagainst appellant was overwhelming. And, Dr. Eisen made clear that the CSAAS\nevidence was not intended to show that appellant abused Denise. Further, the trial court\n\n                                             17\n\finstructed the jury as to the testimony‘s limited admissibility. When all of the\ncircumstances are considered, it is not reasonably probable that appellant would have\nreceived a more favorable verdict had Dr. Eisen‘s testimony been excluded. (People v.\nHousley (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2297236\"><a href=\"/opinion/2297236/people-v-housley/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 959.)\nVI. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n       Appellant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he referred to\nappellant‘s flight in closing argument. Specifically, he claims that the prosecutor shifted\nthe burden of proof when he stated that flight was ―something that an innocent person\nwouldn‘t do.‖\n       A. Applicable Law\n       Regardless of subjective intent, a prosecutor commits misconduct if he uses\n―‗―‗―deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the\njury.‖‘‖‘‖ (People v. Hill (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819.) When attacking a prosecutor‘s\nremarks to a jury, a defendant must show a ―‗reasonable likelihood the jury understood or\napplied the complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous manner.‘‖ (People v.\nGurule (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2638434\"><a href=\"/opinion/2638434/people-v-gurule/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657.)\n       The appellate court must ―‗―not lightly infer‖ that the jury drew the most\ndamaging rather than the least damaging meaning from the prosecutor‘s statements.‘‖\n(People v. Gurule, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 657.) A prosecutor violates federal due process\nonly if his comments are ―‗―so egregious that [they] infect[] the trial with such unfairness\nas to make the conviction a denial of due process.‖‘‖ (People v. Ayala (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2551468\"><a href=\"/opinion/2551468/people-v-ayala/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283–284.)\n       B. Analysis\n       In the trial, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct by commenting on\nappellant‘s flight in his closing argument. There is no dispute that appellant was a\nfugitive for 10 years after he fled California upon learning that charges had been made\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fagainst him. Moreover, the jury was rightly instructed with CALCRIM No. 372,2 which\ncreates a permissible inference, rather than a mandatory presumption, and thus does not\nimpermissibly shift the burden of proof. (See People v. Avila (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2537905\"><a href=\"/opinion/2537905/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710\n[a flight instruction does not create an unconstitutional permissive inference or lessen the\nprosecutor‘s burden of proof].) The same can be said of the prosecutor‘s comments; he\nhad every right to refer to appellant‘s flight in closing argument and he properly invited\nthe jury to consider it as conduct that could have shown appellant‘s awareness of guilt.\n       C. Any Alleged Error was Harmless\n       Even if the prosecutor did err, that one isolated incident did not infect the entire\ntrial with unfairness; appellant has not shown prejudice in light of the record as a whole.\n(People v. Sanders (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1374985\"><a href=\"/opinion/1374985/people-v-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527.) The jury was instructed with CALCRIM\nNo. 372, which guided the jurors on how to consider the evidence of flight. The trial\ncourt also instructed the jury that ―if you believe that the attorneys‘ comments on the law\nconflict with [the court‘s] instructions, [then the jury] must follow [the court‘s]\ninstructions.‖ The trial court‘s instructions, not the prosecutor‘s argument, are\ndeterminative, for we presume that ―jurors treat the court‘s instructions as a statement of\nthe law by a judge, and the prosecutor‘s comments as words spoken by an advocate in an\nattempt to persuade.‖ (People v. Clair (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171441\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171441/people-v-clair/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 663, fn. 8.) Given the\ninstructions here, there is no reasonable likelihood that the prosecutor‘s statements would\nhave misled the jury or that a different result would have occurred. (Id. at p. 663.)\nVII. Sentencing\n       Appellant contends that he was improperly sentenced under the One Strike law\n(§ 667.61, subds. (b) & (e)) due to a ―failure to comply with the express pleading\nrequirement of section 667.61,‖ because the jury was not instructed on this circumstance,\nand because the circumstance ―was not found true by the jury.‖ In so urging, appellant\n\n\n2      The jury was instructed: ―If the defendant fled after he was accused of committing\nthe crime, that conduct may show that he was aware of his guilt. If you conclude that the\ndefendant fled, it is up to you to decide the meaning and importance of that conduct.\nHowever, evidence that the defendant fled cannot prove guilt by itself.‖\n\n                                             19\n\frelies heavily upon People v. Mancebo (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600795/people-v-mancebo/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mancebo). But Mancebo\nhas nothing to do with the issues in this case. The Mancebo court considered the express\npleading requirement of section 667.61 and held that the defendant‘s due process right\nhad been violated because the special allegation (§ 667.61, subd. (e)(5)) had never been\nexpressly alleged in the information. (Mancebo, supra, at p. 743.) In contrast, here, the\nspecial allegation was pled in the amended information.\n       To the extent appellant suggests that reversal is required because the jury did not\nmake a special finding as to the multiple victim allegation, we are not convinced. Section\n667.61, subdivision (i), only requires the trier of fact to determine that the crime was\ncommitted against multiple victims; the statute does not specifically compel an additional\nspecial finding. (People v. Jones (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2272636\"><a href=\"/opinion/2272636/people-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710–711.) When the jury\nreturned a guilty verdict on counts relating to both Jennifer (count 7) and Denise (counts\n1, 2, 4-6, and 8-12), it necessarily determined that there was more than one victim. This\nfactual issue was necessarily resolved adversely to appellant. (Id. at pp. 711–712.)\n       It follows that even if the trial court erred in neglecting to give the jury a special\nverdict form for the multiple victim circumstance, that error was harmless. (Mancebo,\nsupra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 728; People v. Jones, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at p. 711; People v.\nMarshall (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1275251\"><a href=\"/opinion/1275251/people-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f                                  DISPOSITION\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS.\n\n\n\n\n                                         _____________________, J.\n                                           ASHMANN-GERST\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n_____________________, P.
