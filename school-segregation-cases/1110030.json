The statute ―protects the rights of\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fdisabled children by mandating that public educational\ninstitutions identify and effectively educate those children, or\npay for their education elsewhere if they require specialized\nservices that the public institution cannot provide.‖ D.K. v.\nAbington Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 233, 244 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting\nP.P. v. W. Chester Area Sch. Dist., 585 F.3d 727, 735 (3d Cir.\n2009)). Appellant Muhammad Munir sent his son, O.M., to a\nprivate residential facility and a private boarding school\nfollowing multiple suicide attempts, and sought reimbursement\nfor the cost of those placements from the Pottsville Area School\nDistrict (Pottsville or School District). For the reasons that\nfollow, we will affirm the District Court‘s order denying that\nrequest.\n\n                                I\n\n        To comply with the IDEA, school districts must identify\nand evaluate all children who they have reason to believe are\ndisabled under the statute. D.K., 696 F.3d at 244. Once a\nschool district has identified a child as eligible for IDEA\nservices, it must create and implement an Individualized\nEducation Plan (IEP) based on the student‘s needs and areas of\ndisability. P.P., 585 F.3d at 729–30. School districts are not,\nhowever, required to ―maximize the potential‖ of each\nhandicapped student. T.R. v. Kingwood Twp. Bd. of Educ., 205\nF.3d 572, 577 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick\nHudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 197 n.21\n(1982)). Instead, to satisfy the IDEA, the district must offer an\nIEP that is ―reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\nmeaningful educational benefits in light of the student‘s\nintellectual potential.‖ P.P., 585 F.3d at 729–30 (quoting Shore\nReg’l High Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. P.S., 381 F.3d 194, 198 (3d Cir.\n2004)); see also Mary T. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 575 F.3d 235,\n\n\n\n                               3\n\f240 (3d Cir. 2009) (explaining that once the school district has\ndesigned and administered an IEP that is reasonably calculated\nto enable the receipt of meaningful educational benefits, it has\nsatisfied its obligation to provide the child with a FAPE).\n\n        If parents believe that the school district is not providing\na FAPE for their child, they may unilaterally remove him from\nthe school, enroll him in a different school, and seek tuition\nreimbursement for the cost of the alternative placement. Id. at\n242 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C) and Sch. Comm. of\nBurlington v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 374 (1985)).\nParents who change their child‘s placement without the consent\nof state or local officials, however, ―do so at their own financial\nrisk.‖ Burlington, 471 U.S. at 373–74. A court may grant the\nfamily tuition reimbursement only if it finds that the school\ndistrict failed to provide a FAPE and that the alternative private\nplacement was appropriate. See Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four\nv. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 15–16 (1993); Mary T., 575 F.3d at 242.\nCourts also have broad discretion to consider equitable factors\nwhen awarding tuition reimbursement. Florence Cnty. Sch.\nDist., 510 U.S. at 15–16.\n\n                                 II\n\n                                 A\n\n       O.M. is a 21-year-old former Pottsville student who was\ndiagnosed as suffering from emotional disturbance. He first\nrequired in-patient hospital treatment for making threats of\nsuicide and suicidal gestures in 2005, when he was enrolled in\nmiddle school. At that time, the School District conducted a\npsycho-educational evaluation to determine whether O.M.\nsuffered from a learning disability and would be eligible for\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fIDEA services. It determined that O.M. was not eligible for\nlearning disability services based on his cognitive and\nachievement test scores. It determined that he was not eligible\nfor emotional disturbance services based on behavioral ratings\ncompleted by teachers and a psychiatric report.\n\n       O.M. returned to Pottsville in the fall of 2005 and\nperformed well academically for three years. He had no\nproblem with attendance, expressed no concerns about school,\nand received grades in the A to C range in regular college\npreparatory courses.1 During the 2005-2006 school year, O.M.\nperiodically saw the school psychologist, who observed nothing\nsuggesting that an additional evaluation for IDEA services was\nnecessary.\n\n       In April 2008, O.M. took an overdose of prescription\nmedication and was hospitalized. Although his parents notified\nthe School District about the incident, they did not provide it\nwith details or medical records. O.M. also was hospitalized\ntwice in the summer of 2008 for making suicidal threats and\ngestures and attempting suicide. The first hospitalization\noccurred after an incident with his high school football coach\nduring a summer practice session; the second occurred during a\nfamily trip to the university that O.M.‘s sibling attended.\n\n       Following the very difficult summer O.M. experienced,\nin August 2008, O.M.‘s parents notified the School District that\nthey were going to enroll him in the private boarding school that\nhis brother had attended. The School District assisted in this\n\n       1\n         In the 2007-2008 school year, for example, O.M.\nreceived two A‘s, three B‘s, and two C‘s.\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\feffort by writing letters of recommendation for O.M. and\nsupplying teacher evaluation forms. O.M.‘s guidance counselor,\nwho submitted a very positive letter of recommendation, noted\nthat O.M. was ranked 62 out of a class of 278. O.M. was\naccepted, but after his first day the boarding school notified his\nparents that he felt depressed and had thoughts of harming\nhimself, and it required his parents to take him home.\n\n        After his withdrawal from boarding school, O.M.\nreenrolled at Pottsville Area High School. His behavior and\nperformance at school were, for the most part, unremarkable.\nHe initially decided to take honors math classes, but began\nstruggling academically and dropped them. When he returned to\nregular college preparatory courses, his grades improved. On at\nleast two occasions after O.M. returned, he became upset and\nspoke to the guidance counselor, and his parents were required\nto pick him up from school. Otherwise, O.M. generally attended\nand participated in his classes, and he was observed spending his\nlunch and free periods socializing with students who were\nconsidered popular.\n\n       O.M.‘s mental health problems continued, however. In\nearly September 2008, he again expressed suicidal ideation and\nhad to be hospitalized. His parents notified the School District\nand requested an IEP for their son. In response, the School\nDistrict requested and received permission from O.M.‘s parents\nto conduct an evaluation to determine whether he was a\nprotected handicapped student under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct, and, if so, what services he needed.2 O.M. was hospitalized\n\n\n       2\n         The Rehabilitation Act ―prohibits discrimination in\nfederally-funded programs, including public schools, on the\n\n\n\n                                6\n\fagain in November 2008. In mid-November, the School District\ncreated a Rehabilitation Act § 504 plan for O.M., which O.M.‘s\nparents approved.3 The School District did not, however, create\nan IEP.\n\n       In January 2009, O.M. again threatened suicide and was\nhospitalized for treatment. When he was released, his parents\nenrolled him at Wediko Children‘s Services, a therapeutic\nresidential treatment center in New Hampshire, for the rest of\nthe school year. While there, O.M. received daily individual and\ngroup therapy, during which he received training in social skills,\nemotional regulation, stress management, and conflict\nresolution. Wediko also offered a full school day with a\ncurriculum that met New Hampshire‘s educational standards,\nwhich O.M. began attending about two to three weeks after his\nenrollment. The classes were small and graded on a pass-fail\nbasis, and the school day included three debriefing periods to\nassess how well O.M. was maintaining control of his thoughts,\nmood, and anxiety.\n\n\n\nbasis of disability.‖ Ridley Sch. Dist. v. M.R., 680 F.3d 260, 265\nn.1 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794).\n       3\n        O.M.‘s § 504 plan provided for the following services\nand accommodations: positive reinforcement from teachers;\npreferential seating; directions repeated verbally; extra time to\ncomplete time-sensitive tasks when needed; and permission to\ntake tests in a quiet setting when needed. The plan also\nprovided that O.M. would ask for help from teachers and use\navailable tutoring services and guidance services when\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\f        Wediko conducted an evaluation of O.M. in February\n2009. The evaluation consisted of standardized cognitive and\nacademic achievement tests and measures designed to test\nsocial-emotional functioning. Wediko notified the School\nDistrict of the results and recommended that the District\nconsider an IEP for O.M. The District reviewed Wediko‘s\nanalysis, which indicated that O.M. was in the average range of\nintellectual functioning, with average to above average scores in\nmath, reading, and writing, and accepted Wediko‘s diagnosis of\nemotional disturbance.4\n\n       In May 2009, the School District offered an IEP for\nO.M., which included annual goals and provided for emotional\nsupport services. In September 2009, the School District added\na cognitive-behavioral curriculum for students experiencing\nanxiety and depression. It also increased social work services\nand added psychological services. Although these proposals\nincorporated most of Wediko‘s recommendations, O.M.‘s\nparents rejected the IEP because it did not provide O.M. with\nsmall classes or the same types of counseling services that he\nwas receiving at Wediko. O.M. completed the school year at\nWediko.\n\n       Before the start of the 2009-2010 school year, O.M.‘s\nparents decided that his risk level had decreased to the point\nwhere he could function in a less intensive environment.\nAccordingly, O.M.‘s parents decided to send him to The Phelps\nSchool, a residential school located in Malvern, Pennsylvania,\nand licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\n       4\n       The School District rejected Wediko‘s conclusion that\nO.M. had a non-verbal learning disability.\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\fPhelps was closer to home and offered small classes and a\nsupportive environment.\n\n                                B\n\n       O.M.‘s parents filed a due process complaint in August\n2009 with the Office of Dispute Resolution, and a hearing was\nconducted by a Pennsylvania Special Hearing Officer. O.M.‘s\nparents alleged that the School District had failed to conduct a\ntimely evaluation of O.M. and provide specialized educational\nservices, in violation of the IDEA.              They sought:\n(1) compensatory education for the time period between the fall\nof 2007 and December 2008; and (2) reimbursement for the cost\nof O.M.‘s placements at Wediko and Phelps.\n\n        The Hearing Officer issued a written administrative\ndecision and order denying relief on January 23, 2010. She\nconcluded that the School District had no obligation to evaluate\nO.M. or provide him with specialized educational services\nbetween 2005 and spring of 2008 because, although the record\nsuggested that O.M. was emotionally disturbed, there was no\nevidence that O.M.‘s condition was affecting his ability to learn\nat that time. The Hearing Officer remarked that whether the\nSchool District had an obligation to evaluate O.M. and provide\nhim with specialized services in the fall of 2008, after it learned\nof his September and November suicide attempts, was a closer\nquestion. Nevertheless, she determined that even if the School\nDistrict had committed a procedural violation of the IDEA, that\nviolation had no substantive effect, as O.M. was placed at\nWediko before the School District would have had time to\ncomplete an evaluation, develop an IEP, and begin to provide\nservices. Because the School District‘s delay did not actually\ndeprive O.M. of an educational benefit, O.M. was not entitled to\n\n\n\n                                9\n\fan award of compensatory education for that period.\n\n        The Hearing Officer then considered whether O.M.‘s\nparents were entitled to compensation for the costs of private\nplacement at Wediko or Phelps. Relying on Mary T. v. School\nDistrict of Philadelphia, 575 F.3d 235 (3d Cir. 2009), she\ndetermined that they were not entitled to reimbursement for the\ncosts of attending Wediko because the primary purpose of that\nplacement was the provision of mental health treatment rather\nthan provision of special education. She explained that O.M.\nwas placed at Wediko because of ―a medical/mental health crisis\nthat required immediate treatment.‖ App. 59. This finding was\nsupported by the testimony of O.M.‘s father and witnesses from\nWediko, who ―emphasized that Student needed to attend\nWediko in order to keep him safe from the effects of his\ndepression, which led to suicide threats and gestures when he\nwas living at home.‖ App. 60. She also noted that the services\nO.M. received while at Wediko were based on a treatment plan\ndesigned by a clinical psychologist and were not focused\nprimarily on education.\n\n       Finally, the Hearing Officer determined that O.M.‘s\nparents were not entitled to compensation for the costs of\nattending Phelps because, at the time that O.M. went there, the\nDistrict had proposed an IEP that met all of O.M.‘s educational\nneeds. Although O.M.‘s parents opined that O.M. could benefit\nfrom smaller class sizes and counseling services such as those\nprovided by the private schools, the Hearing Officer explained\nthat, under the IDEA, O.M. ―is entitled to an appropriate\nprogram, not an ideal program.‖ App. 60.\n\n       On April 21, 2010, Munir appealed the Hearing Officer‘s\ndecision by filing a complaint in the United States District Court\n\n\n\n                               10\n\ffor the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The District Court\nadopted the factual findings of the Hearing Officer, applied the\nsame legal analysis, and granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe School District.5 Munir filed this timely appeal, challenging\nonly the District Court‘s denial of his request for tuition\nreimbursement.\n\n                                III\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction in this matter under\n28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(A). We have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       In deciding cases brought under the IDEA, district courts\napply a modified version of de novo review. L.E. v. Ramsey Bd.\nof Educ., 435 F.3d 384, 389 (3d Cir. 2006). Although the\nDistrict Court must make its own findings by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, it is also required to afford due weight to the\nfactual findings of the hearing officer. Id. ―The ‗due weight‘\nstandard requires the court to consider the factual findings from\nthe administrative proceedings prima facie correct and, if the\ncourt fails to adopt those findings, it must explain its reasons for\ndeparting from them.‖ Mary T., 575 F.3d at 241 (quoting Shore,\n\n       5\n         During the District Court proceedings, both Munir and\nthe School District supplemented the administrative record with\ntheir own reports as to whether the IEPs offered by the School\nDistrict were adequate. The District Court found that these\nreports ―amounted to little more than a quasi-judicial type\nreview of the administrative findings,‖ and provided no ―basis to\nabrogate the findings of fact listed by ALJ Carroll in her\nDecision.‖ App. 27.\n\n\n\n\n                                11\n\f381 F.3d at 199) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). We exercise plenary review over the District Court‘s\nlegal conclusions and review its factual findings for clear error.\nL.E., 435 F.3d at 389.\n\n                               IV\n\n        On appeal, Munir argues that he is entitled to\nreimbursement for the costs of O.M.‘s tuition at Wediko and\nPhelps. To be entitled to reimbursement, Munir must show that\nthe School District failed to provide O.M. with a FAPE and that\nthe alternative private placement was appropriate. See Florence\nCnty. Sch. Dist., 510 U.S. at 15–16; Mary T., 575 F.3d at 242.\nFor placement at a residential program to be ―appropriate,‖ the\nprogram must itself be proper under the IDEA—that is, it must\n―provide[] significant learning and confer[] meaningful benefit.‖\n Mary T., 575 F.3d at 242 (quoting Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v.\nDeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 276 (3d Cir. 2007)). The court must\nalso find that the residential program is the sort of program that\nthe public school should have taken financial responsibility for\nin the first place. See, e.g., id. at 243–44 (considering whether\nthe school district should have initially been financially\nresponsible for the placement in determining whether a\nplacement was ―appropriate‖ for purposes of reimbursement);\nsee also Butler v. Evans, 225 F.3d 887, 894 (7th Cir. 2000)\n(same).6\n\n\n       6\n         We have previously recognized that ―parents of a\ndisabled student need not seek out the perfect private placement\nin order to satisfy IDEA.‖ Mary T., 575 F.3d at 242 (quoting\nRidgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., 172 F.3d 238, 249 n.8 (3d Cir.\n1999)). A private placement may, for example, be ―appropriate‖\n\n\n\n                               12\n\f        The District Court determined that Munir was not entitled\nto reimbursement for the costs of O.M.‘s attendance at Wediko\nbecause he could not meet the second prong of the test. That is,\nO.M.‘s placement at Wediko was not an ―appropriate‖\nplacement because he was placed at Wediko to treat his mental\nhealth needs, and any educational benefit that he received was\nincidental. The Court further determined that Munir was not\nentitled to reimbursement for the costs of attending Phelps\nbecause the first prong of the test had not been met—when O.M.\nwas enrolled at Phelps, the School District had offered him an\nIEP that would meet his educational needs. Because we\nperceive no error in the Hearing Officer‘s comprehensive\ndecision or in the District Court‘s thorough review of the case,\nwe will affirm.\n\n                                 A\n\n       O.M.‘s parents enrolled him at Wediko in January 2009,\nafter he received in-patient treatment following a suicide\nattempt, and O.M. stayed at Wediko through July 2009. Munir\nseeks reimbursement for the costs of this placement, which\namounted to $68,752.61.\n\neven if the private school fails ―to provide an IEP or meet state\neducational standards.‖ Id. at 242 (citing Florence, 510 U.S. at\n14–15). But if a school district would not have been required to\nprovide the child with residential treatment before the child was\nwithdrawn from public school, it does not become financially\nresponsible for that placement when parents make the unilateral\ndecision to enroll their child at a residential facility. This is true\neven when the school district may have failed in some other\nrespect to provide the child with a FAPE.\n\n\n\n\n                                 13\n\f       Munir argues that the School District violated the\nprocedures set out by the IDEA when it failed to offer O.M. an\nIEP until May 2009,7 and that the IEP the School District\noffered then was inadequate. He argues that, as a result of the\nSchool District‘s violations, O.M. was denied a FAPE during\nthe 2008-2009 school year. He further claims that full-time\nresidential treatment was a ―necessary ingredient to learning,‖ so\nO.M.‘s placement at Wediko from January 2009 to July 2009\nwas ―appropriate.‖ Munir Br. at 52.\n\n        School districts are responsible for the costs of a\ndisabled child‘s placement in a residential program when that\nplacement is ―necessary to provide special education and related\nservices.‖ 34 C.F.R. § 300.104. Residential placement may be\nnecessary when the disabled child needs a highly structured\nenvironment in order to obtain any kind of educational benefit.\nFor example, in Kruelle v. New Castle County School District,\n642 F.2d 687 (3d Cir. 1981), we explained that the appropriate\neducational goals for a child with severe mental disabilities and\ncerebral palsy included the development of ―basic self-help and\n\n       7\n         Munir contends that the School District should have\nidentified O.M. as disabled ―as early as 2005, and no later than\nSeptember of 2008‖ because of his hospitalizations. Munir Br.\nat 34. But Munir did not present any evidence that O.M.‘s\ncondition adversely affected his educational progress during that\ntime. Indeed, as the Hearing Officer noted, Munir testified that\nO.M. had no problem with attendance and did not express any\nconcern about attending school during that period. Munir also\nargues that that the School District had an obligation to evaluate\nO.M. and develop an IEP at some point after September 2008,\nwhen he requested an evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\fsocial skills such as toilet training.‖ Id. at 693 (quoting Battle v.\nCommonwealth of Pa., 629 F.2d 269, 275 (3d Cir. 1980)).\nHowever, the child suffered from emotional problems that\nprevented him from achieving those goals; when he experienced\nstress, he would induce choking and vomiting, which\n―interfere[d] fundamentally with his ability to learn.‖ Id. at 694.\n The student needed consistency of programming and\nenvironment to meet his educational goals because of his\nemotional problems, and we thus found that the school district\nwas responsible for the costs of the residential program. Id. at\n694, 696.8\n\n\n       8 Similarly, in Independent School District No. 284 v.\nA.C., 258 F.3d 769 (8th Cir. 2001), the Eighth Circuit found that\nresidential treatment was warranted because it was necessary to\ndirectly address the child‘s educational problems. There, the\nchild suffered from emotional and behavioral disorders that\nmanifested themselves in ―classroom disruption, profanity,\ninsubordination, and truancy.‖ Id. at 771. Evaluations of the\nstudent suggested that these disorders were interfering with her\nacademic progress and that she needed a highly structured\nprogram in order to benefit from educational instruction. See id.\nat 772. Because the child‘s emotional and behavioral disorders\n―need[ed] to be addressed in order for [her] to learn,‖ and\nbecause evaluations suggested that a residential program would\nbe the only effective way of treating those problems, the Eighth\nCircuit concluded that residential placement was appropriate.\nId. at 777; see also Mrs. B. v. Milford Bd. of Educ., 103 F.3d\n1114, 1121 (2d Cir. 1997) (residential placement appropriate in\nlight of student‘s ―stalled academic performance‖ and the\ndetermination that the student‘s ―debilitating emotional\nproblems could only be properly addressed in a highly structured\n\n\n\n                                 15\n\f        School districts are not, however, financially responsible\nfor the placement of students who need twenty-four-hour\nsupervision for medical, social, or emotional reasons, and\nreceive only an incidental educational benefit from that\nplacement. See Mary T., 575 F.3d at 245–46; Kruelle, 642 F.2d\nat 693 (―Analysis must focus . . . on whether full-time placement\nmay be considered necessary for educational purposes, or\nwhether the residential placement is a response to medical,\nsocial or emotional problems that are segregable from the\nlearning process.‖). In determining whether schools should be\nheld financially responsible for the costs of residential\nplacement, courts must consider whether the service is necessary\nto ensure that the child receives some educational benefit, and\nthey must assess the strength of the link between that service\nand the child‘s educational needs. Mary T., 575 F.3d at 244\n(citing Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 694).\n\n        Applying this analysis in Mary T., we determined that\nthere was an insufficient link between the child‘s placement in a\nlong-term psychiatric facility and her educational needs. There,\nthe child suffered from psychotic events, severe anger problems,\nsubstance abuse, and self-harming behavior. 575 F.3d at 239.\nShe had previously been placed in a residential educational\nfacility and a psychiatric hospital, but neither of those facilities\nwas able to provide appropriate care. Id. Although the long-\nterm psychiatric facility at which she was subsequently placed\nwas an accredited rehabilitation facility, it did not have any\n\nresidential setting‖); Taylor v. Honig, 910 F.2d 627, 632–33 (9th\nCir. 1990) (student placed in special educational school to treat\nsevere emotional disturbance that was interfering with his ability\nto learn).\n\n\n\n\n                                16\n\feducational accreditation, nor did it have an on-site school,\nspecial education teachers, or school affiliation; the child spent\nmost of her time there in intensive individual and group therapy.\n Id. Although we recognized that the child may have received\nsome educational benefit from her therapy sessions, those\nsessions were ―predominately designed to make her aware of her\nmedical condition and how to respond to it‖; they were ―neither\nintended nor designed to be responsive to the child‘s distinct\n‗learning needs.‘‖ Id. at 245. Therefore, the parents were not\neligible for reimbursement.\n\n        Other courts of appeals have reached similar results when\nthe services were directed primarily at the child‘s medical or\nemotional needs, rather than the child‘s educational needs. In\nClovis Unified School District v. California Office of\nAdministrative Hearings, 903 F.2d 635 (9th Cir. 1990), for\nexample, a student suffering from serious emotional problems\nwas also placed in an acute care psychiatric hospital providing\nfew educational services, and her parents sought reimbursement\nfor that placement. Id. at 639. In assessing the link between the\nchild‘s educational needs and the placement, the Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that the services provided by the hospital were not\nprimarily provided to allow the student to benefit from her\neducation, but instead were excludable medical expenses. Id. at\n645; see also Butler, 225 F.3d at 894–95 (finding that parents\nwere not entitled to reimbursement for hospitalization because\n―education was not the purpose of her hospitalization,‖ and\nexplaining that ―[u]nlike in-school nursing in Cedar Rapids,\nNiki‘s inpatient medical care was necessary in itself and was not\na special accommodation made necessary only to allow her to\nattend school or receive education‖).\n\n       Unlike the students in Mary T. and Clovis, O.M. was\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fplaced at a facility that did offer an educational component.\nWediko‘s residential treatment program included a full school\nday, with a curriculum that met New Hampshire‘s educational\nstandards. O.M. began attending those classes about two to\nthree weeks after his admission. In addition to academic\nclasses, the school day included three debriefing periods for\nassessing how well O.M. was maintaining control of thoughts,\nmood, and anxiety. The District Court recognized that O.M.\n―undoubtedly benefitted‖ from this educational program.\n\n        The relevant question, however, is whether O.M. had to\nattend a residential facility because of his educational needs—\nbecause, for example, he would have been incapable of learning\nin a less structured environment—or rather, if he required\nresidential placement to treat medical or mental health needs\nsegregable from his educational needs. Mary T., 575 F.3d at\n243–44 (private placement must be ―necessary for educational\npurposes,‖ as opposed to ―a response to medical, social or\nemotional problems that are segregable from the learning\nprocess‖ (quoting Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693) (emphasis added));\ncf. 34 C.F.R. § 300.104 (schools must bear the costs of\nplacement in a residential program when such placement ―is\nnecessary to provide special education and related services to a\nchild with a disability‖). The fact that a particular residential\nfacility does not even offer educational programs may be strong\nevidence that the child was placed there to meet his medical or\nemotional needs. See Mary T., 575 F.3d at 245–46 (explaining\nthat the facility‘s lack of educational accreditation and on-site\neducators ―further demonstrated‖ that the child‘s placement was\nnot educational). Conversely, the fact that classes are offered\nmay provide evidence that the purpose of the placement is, in\nfact, educational. But O.M.‘s participation in some educational\nprograms at Wediko does not conclusively establish that the\n\n\n\n                               18\n\fpurpose of his placement there was educational. Other factors—\nsuch as evaluations of the student‘s actual educational needs,9 or\nevidence of a psychiatric crisis prompting the placement10—\nshould also be considered.\n\n       Here, O.M. was enrolled at Wediko to meet his mental\nhealth needs, and any educational benefit he received from the\nWediko placement was incidental. The placement at Wediko\nwas prompted by a medical emergency. His parents ―feared for\nhis personal safety,‖ and they enrolled him at Wediko ―in order\nto prevent him from harming himself.‖ Munir v. Pottsville Area\nSch. Dist., 2012 WL 2194543, at *15 (M.D. Pa. June 14, 2012).\n Thus, although O.M. did attend specialized classes while at\nWediko, services there were more medical than educational. Id.\n Indeed, O.M. was an above-average student at Pottsville, who\n\n       9\n         See, e.g., Clovis, 903 F.2d at 645 (remarking that the\nstudent‘s program at the hospital ―was implemented not by the\n[IEP] designed by the school system, but was instead determined\nby a medical team, supervised by a licensed physician‖).\n       10\n          See, e.g., Butler, 225 F.3d at 893 (noting, in finding\nthat the school district was not financially responsible for the\nstudent‘s placement, that the student‘s ―hospitalization was\nprompted by a psychiatric crisis‖); Taylor, 910 F.2d at 633\n(explaining, in finding that placement at a special educational\nschool was appropriate, that ―[t]he placement was not ordered in\nresponse to any medical crisis; on the contrary, the IEP\ndeveloped on May 9, 1988 stated that Todd was ‗medically\nstable‘ and that a state hospital was inappropriate for him‖);\nClovis, 903 F.2d at 645 (child‘s hospitalization was in response\nto a medical crisis).\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\fhad no serious problem with attendance and socialized well with\nother students. Because O.M.‘s parents have not shown that\nthey placed O.M. at Wediko in order to meet his specialized\neducational needs, the District Court correctly determined that\nthey are not entitled to reimbursement.11\n\n                               B\n\n       Munir also challenges the District Court‘s determination\nthat he was not entitled to reimbursement for the cost of tuition\nat Phelps during the 2009-2010 school year, which amounted to\n$42,100. O.M. was placed at Phelps after his parents rejected\nthe IEP proposed by the School District in May 2009. O.M.‘s\nparents also rejected a second IEP in September 2009 because it\ndid not provide certain services that they believed would be\nbeneficial—in particular, smaller class sizes and the type of\ncounseling services that had been available at Wediko.\n\n       As noted previously, parents are only entitled to tuition\nreimbursement when the school district has failed to offer a\nFAPE. School districts are required to offer an IEP that is\n―reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive meaningful\neducational benefits in light of the student‘s intellectual\npotential.‖ P.P., 585 F.3d at 729−30 (quoting Shore Reg’l High\nSch., 381 F.3d at 198). They are not, however, required to\n―maximize the potential‖ of each handicapped student. T.R.,\n205 F.3d at 577 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 197 n.21).\n\n       11\n         Because we find that the District Court did not err in\nholding that Wediko was not an ―appropriate placement,‖ we\nneed not address Munir‘s claims relating to alleged procedural\nviolations committed by the school district.\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f        The District Court did not err in determining that the IEP\noffered by the School District in May and September 2009\nsatisfied the School District‘s obligations under the IDEA. In\ndesigning O.M.‘s IEPs, the School District took into account\nWediko‘s evaluation of O.M. and ―incorporated virtually all of\nthe Wediko recommendations.‖ Munir, 2012 WL 2194543, at\n*9. The District Court recognized that smaller classes and more\nemotional support might ―contribute to [O.M.‘s] ability to learn\nmore easily,‖ id. at *16, but it determined that neither was\nnecessary to ensure that O.M. received meaningful educational\nbenefits. Munir has not shown that this conclusion was clearly\nerroneous.\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\f",

He first\nrequired in-patient hospital treatment for making threats of\nsuicide and suicidal gestures in 2005, when he was enrolled in\nmiddle school. At that time, the School District conducted a\npsycho-educational evaluation to determine whether O.M.\nsuffered from a learning disability and would be eligible for\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fIDEA services. It determined that O.M. was not eligible for\nlearning disability services based on his cognitive and\nachievement test scores. It determined that he was not eligible\nfor emotional disturbance services based on behavioral ratings\ncompleted by teachers and a psychiatric report.\n\n       O.M. returned to Pottsville in the fall of 2005 and\nperformed well academically for three years. He had no\nproblem with attendance, expressed no concerns about school,\nand received grades in the A to C range in regular college\npreparatory courses.1 During the 2005-2006 school year, O.M.\nperiodically saw the school psychologist, who observed nothing\nsuggesting that an additional evaluation for IDEA services was\nnecessary.\n\n       In April 2008, O.M. took an overdose of prescription\nmedication and was hospitalized. Although his parents notified\nthe School District about the incident, they did not provide it\nwith details or medical records. O.M. also was hospitalized\ntwice in the summer of 2008 for making suicidal threats and\ngestures and attempting suicide. The first hospitalization\noccurred after an incident with his high school football coach\nduring a summer practice session; the second occurred during a\nfamily trip to the university that O.M.‘s sibling attended.\n\n       Following the very difficult summer O.M. experienced,\nin August 2008, O.M.‘s parents notified the School District that\nthey were going to enroll him in the private boarding school that\nhis brother had attended. The School District assisted in this\n\n       1\n         In the 2007-2008 school year, for example, O.M.\nreceived two A‘s, three B‘s, and two C‘s.\n\n\n\n\n                               5\n\feffort by writing letters of recommendation for O.M. and\nsupplying teacher evaluation forms. O.M.‘s guidance counselor,\nwho submitted a very positive letter of recommendation, noted\nthat O.M. was ranked 62 out of a class of 278. O.M. was\naccepted, but after his first day the boarding school notified his\nparents that he felt depressed and had thoughts of harming\nhimself, and it required his parents to take him home.\n\n        After his withdrawal from boarding school, O.M.\nreenrolled at Pottsville Area High School. His behavior and\nperformance at school were, for the most part, unremarkable.\nHe initially decided to take honors math classes, but began\nstruggling academically and dropped them. When he returned to\nregular college preparatory courses, his grades improved. On at\nleast two occasions after O.M. returned, he became upset and\nspoke to the guidance counselor, and his parents were required\nto pick him up from school. Otherwise, O.M. generally attended\nand participated in his classes, and he was observed spending his\nlunch and free periods socializing with students who were\nconsidered popular.\n\n       O.M.‘s mental health problems continued, however. In\nearly September 2008, he again expressed suicidal ideation and\nhad to be hospitalized. His parents notified the School District\nand requested an IEP for their son. In response, the School\nDistrict requested and received permission from O.M.‘s parents\nto conduct an evaluation to determine whether he was a\nprotected handicapped student under § 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct, and, if so, what services he needed.2 O.M. was hospitalized\n\n\n       2\n         The Rehabilitation Act ―prohibits discrimination in\nfederally-funded programs, including public schools, on the\n\n\n\n                                6\n\fagain in November 2008. In mid-November, the School District\ncreated a Rehabilitation Act § 504 plan for O.M., which O.M.‘s\nparents approved.3 The School District did not, however, create\nan IEP.\n\n       In January 2009, O.M. again threatened suicide and was\nhospitalized for treatment. When he was released, his parents\nenrolled him at Wediko Children‘s Services, a therapeutic\nresidential treatment center in New Hampshire, for the rest of\nthe school year. While there, O.M. received daily individual and\ngroup therapy, during which he received training in social skills,\nemotional regulation, stress management, and conflict\nresolution. Wediko also offered a full school day with a\ncurriculum that met New Hampshire‘s educational standards,\nwhich O.M. began attending about two to three weeks after his\nenrollment. The classes were small and graded on a pass-fail\nbasis, and the school day included three debriefing periods to\nassess how well O.M. was maintaining control of his thoughts,\nmood, and anxiety.\n\n\n\nbasis of disability.‖ Ridley Sch.

The plan also\nprovided that O.M. would ask for help from teachers and use\navailable tutoring services and guidance services when\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\f        Wediko conducted an evaluation of O.M. in February\n2009. The evaluation consisted of standardized cognitive and\nacademic achievement tests and measures designed to test\nsocial-emotional functioning. Wediko notified the School\nDistrict of the results and recommended that the District\nconsider an IEP for O.M. The District reviewed Wediko‘s\nanalysis, which indicated that O.M. was in the average range of\nintellectual functioning, with average to above average scores in\nmath, reading, and writing, and accepted Wediko‘s diagnosis of\nemotional disturbance.4\n\n       In May 2009, the School District offered an IEP for\nO.M., which included annual goals and provided for emotional\nsupport services. In September 2009, the School District added\na cognitive-behavioral curriculum for students experiencing\nanxiety and depression. It also increased social work services\nand added psychological services. Although these proposals\nincorporated most of Wediko‘s recommendations, O.M.‘s\nparents rejected the IEP because it did not provide O.M. with\nsmall classes or the same types of counseling services that he\nwas receiving at Wediko. O.M. completed the school year at\nWediko.\n\n       Before the start of the 2009-2010 school year, O.M.‘s\nparents decided that his risk level had decreased to the point\nwhere he could function in a less intensive environment.\nAccordingly, O.M.‘s parents decided to send him to The Phelps\nSchool, a residential school located in Malvern, Pennsylvania,\nand licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\n       4\n       The School District rejected Wediko‘s conclusion that\nO.M. had a non-verbal learning disability.\n\n\n\n\n                               8\n\fPhelps was closer to home and offered small classes and a\nsupportive environment.\n\n                                B\n\n       O.M.‘s parents filed a due process complaint in August\n2009 with the Office of Dispute Resolution, and a hearing was\nconducted by a Pennsylvania Special Hearing Officer. O.M.‘s\nparents alleged that the School District had failed to conduct a\ntimely evaluation of O.M. and provide specialized educational\nservices, in violation of the IDEA.              They sought:\n(1) compensatory education for the time period between the fall\nof 2007 and December 2008; and (2) reimbursement for the cost\nof O.M.‘s placements at Wediko and Phelps.\n\n        The Hearing Officer issued a written administrative\ndecision and order denying relief on January 23, 2010. She\nconcluded that the School District had no obligation to evaluate\nO.M. or provide him with specialized educational services\nbetween 2005 and spring of 2008 because, although the record\nsuggested that O.M. was emotionally disturbed, there was no\nevidence that O.M.‘s condition was affecting his ability to learn\nat that time. The Hearing Officer remarked that whether the\nSchool District had an obligation to evaluate O.M. and provide\nhim with specialized services in the fall of 2008, after it learned\nof his September and November suicide attempts, was a closer\nquestion. Nevertheless, she determined that even if the School\nDistrict had committed a procedural violation of the IDEA, that\nviolation had no substantive effect, as O.M. was placed at\nWediko before the School District would have had time to\ncomplete an evaluation, develop an IEP, and begin to provide\nservices. Because the School District‘s delay did not actually\ndeprive O.M. of an educational benefit, O.M. was not entitled to\n\n\n\n                                9\n\fan award of compensatory education for that period.\n\n        The Hearing Officer then considered whether O.M.‘s\nparents were entitled to compensation for the costs of private\nplacement at Wediko or Phelps.

She explained that O.M.\nwas placed at Wediko because of ―a medical/mental health crisis\nthat required immediate treatment.‖ App. 59. This finding was\nsupported by the testimony of O.M.‘s father and witnesses from\nWediko, who ―emphasized that Student needed to attend\nWediko in order to keep him safe from the effects of his\ndepression, which led to suicide threats and gestures when he\nwas living at home.‖ App. 60. She also noted that the services\nO.M. received while at Wediko were based on a treatment plan\ndesigned by a clinical psychologist and were not focused\nprimarily on education.\n\n       Finally, the Hearing Officer determined that O.M.‘s\nparents were not entitled to compensation for the costs of\nattending Phelps because, at the time that O.M. went there, the\nDistrict had proposed an IEP that met all of O.M.‘s educational\nneeds. Although O.M.‘s parents opined that O.M. could benefit\nfrom smaller class sizes and counseling services such as those\nprovided by the private schools, the Hearing Officer explained\nthat, under the IDEA, O.M. ―is entitled to an appropriate\nprogram, not an ideal program.‖ App. 60.\n\n       On April 21, 2010, Munir appealed the Hearing Officer‘s\ndecision by filing a complaint in the United States District Court\n\n\n\n                               10\n\ffor the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

That is,\nO.M.‘s placement at Wediko was not an ―appropriate‖\nplacement because he was placed at Wediko to treat his mental\nhealth needs, and any educational benefit that he received was\nincidental. The Court further determined that Munir was not\nentitled to reimbursement for the costs of attending Phelps\nbecause the first prong of the test had not been met—when O.M.\nwas enrolled at Phelps, the School District had offered him an\nIEP that would meet his educational needs. Because we\nperceive no error in the Hearing Officer‘s comprehensive\ndecision or in the District Court‘s thorough review of the case,\nwe will affirm.\n\n                                 A\n\n       O.M.‘s parents enrolled him at Wediko in January 2009,\nafter he received in-patient treatment following a suicide\nattempt, and O.M. stayed at Wediko through July 2009.

But if a school district would not have been required to\nprovide the child with residential treatment before the child was\nwithdrawn from public school, it does not become financially\nresponsible for that placement when parents make the unilateral\ndecision to enroll their child at a residential facility. This is true\neven when the school district may have failed in some other\nrespect to provide the child with a FAPE.\n\n\n\n\n                                 13\n\f       Munir argues that the School District violated the\nprocedures set out by the IDEA when it failed to offer O.M. an\nIEP until May 2009,7 and that the IEP the School District\noffered then was inadequate. He argues that, as a result of the\nSchool District‘s violations, O.M. was denied a FAPE during\nthe 2008-2009 school year. He further claims that full-time\nresidential treatment was a ―necessary ingredient to learning,‖ so\nO.M.‘s placement at Wediko from January 2009 to July 2009\nwas ―appropriate.‖ Munir Br. at 52.\n\n        School districts are responsible for the costs of a\ndisabled child‘s placement in a residential program when that\nplacement is ―necessary to provide special education and related\nservices.‖ 34 C.F.R. § 300.104. Residential placement may be\nnecessary when the disabled child needs a highly structured\nenvironment in order to obtain any kind of educational benefit.\nFor example, in Kruelle v.

Because the child‘s emotional and behavioral disorders\n―need[ed] to be addressed in order for [her] to learn,‖ and\nbecause evaluations suggested that a residential program would\nbe the only effective way of treating those problems, the Eighth\nCircuit concluded that residential placement was appropriate.\nId. at 777; see also Mrs. B. v.

In assessing the link between the\nchild‘s educational needs and the placement, the Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that the services provided by the hospital were not\nprimarily provided to allow the student to benefit from her\neducation, but instead were excludable medical expenses. Id. at\n645; see also Butler, 225 F.3d at 894–95 (finding that parents\nwere not entitled to reimbursement for hospitalization because\n―education was not the purpose of her hospitalization,‖ and\nexplaining that ―[u]nlike in-school nursing in Cedar Rapids,\nNiki‘s inpatient medical care was necessary in itself and was not\na special accommodation made necessary only to allow her to\nattend school or receive education‖).\n\n       Unlike the students in Mary T. and Clovis, O.M. was\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fplaced at a facility that did offer an educational component.\nWediko‘s residential treatment program included a full school\nday, with a curriculum that met New Hampshire‘s educational\nstandards. O.M. began attending those classes about two to\nthree weeks after his admission. In addition to academic\nclasses, the school day included three debriefing periods for\nassessing how well O.M. was maintaining control of thoughts,\nmood, and anxiety. The District Court recognized that O.M.\n―undoubtedly benefitted‖ from this educational program.\n\n        The relevant question, however, is whether O.M. had to\nattend a residential facility because of his educational needs—\nbecause, for example, he would have been incapable of learning\nin a less structured environment—or rather, if he required\nresidential placement to treat medical or mental health needs\nsegregable from his educational needs. Mary T., 575 F.3d at\n243–44 (private placement must be ―necessary for educational\npurposes,‖ as opposed to ―a response to medical, social or\nemotional problems that are segregable from the learning\nprocess‖ (quoting Kruelle, 642 F.2d at 693) (emphasis added));\ncf. 34 C.F.R. § 300.104 (schools must bear the costs of\nplacement in a residential program when such placement ―is\nnecessary to provide special education and related services to a\nchild with a disability‖). The fact that a particular residential\nfacility does not even offer educational programs may be strong\nevidence that the child was placed there to meet his medical or\nemotional needs. See Mary T., 575 F.3d at 245–46 (explaining\nthat the facility‘s lack of educational accreditation and on-site\neducators ―further demonstrated‖ that the child‘s placement was\nnot educational). Conversely, the fact that classes are offered\nmay provide evidence that the purpose of the placement is, in\nfact, educational. But O.M.‘s participation in some educational\nprograms at Wediko does not conclusively establish that the\n\n\n\n                               18\n\fpurpose of his placement there was educational. Other factors—\nsuch as evaluations of the student‘s actual educational needs,9 or\nevidence of a psychiatric crisis prompting the placement10—\nshould also be considered.\n\n       Here, O.M. was enrolled at Wediko to meet his mental\nhealth needs, and any educational benefit he received from the\nWediko placement was incidental. The placement at Wediko\nwas prompted by a medical emergency. His parents ―feared for\nhis personal safety,‖ and they enrolled him at Wediko ―in order\nto prevent him from harming himself.‖ Munir v.

Id.\n Indeed, O.M. was an above-average student at Pottsville, who\n\n       9\n         See, e.g., Clovis, 903 F.2d at 645 (remarking that the\nstudent‘s program at the hospital ―was implemented not by the\n[IEP] designed by the school system, but was instead determined\nby a medical team, supervised by a licensed physician‖).\n       10\n          See, e.g., Butler, 225 F.3d at 893 (noting, in finding\nthat the school district was not financially responsible for the\nstudent‘s placement, that the student‘s ―hospitalization was\nprompted by a psychiatric crisis‖); Taylor, 910 F.2d at 633\n(explaining, in finding that placement at a special educational\nschool was appropriate, that ―[t]he placement was not ordered in\nresponse to any medical crisis; on the contrary, the IEP\ndeveloped on May 9, 1988 stated that Todd was ‗medically\nstable‘ and that a state hospital was inappropriate for him‖);\nClovis, 903 F.2d at 645 (child‘s hospitalization was in response\nto a medical crisis).\n\n\n\n\n                               19\n\fhad no serious problem with attendance and socialized well with\nother students. Because O.M.‘s parents have not shown that\nthey placed O.M. at Wediko in order to meet his specialized\neducational needs, the District Court correctly determined that\nthey are not entitled to reimbursement.11\n\n                               B\n\n       Munir also challenges the District Court‘s determination\nthat he was not entitled to reimbursement for the cost of tuition\nat Phelps during the 2009-2010 school year, which amounted to\n$42,100. O.M. was placed at Phelps after his parents rejected\nthe IEP proposed by the School District in May 2009. O.M.‘s\nparents also rejected a second IEP in September 2009 because it\ndid not provide certain services that they believed would be\nbeneficial—in particular, smaller class sizes and the type of\ncounseling services that had been available at Wediko.\n\n       As noted previously, parents are only entitled to tuition\nreimbursement when the school district has failed to offer a\nFAPE. School districts are required to offer an IEP that is\n―reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive meaningful\neducational benefits in light of the student‘s intellectual\npotential.‖ P.P., 585 F.3d at 729−30 (quoting Shore Reg’l High\nSch., 381 F.3d at 198). They are not, however, required to\n―maximize the potential‖ of each handicapped student. T.R.,\n205 F.3d at 577 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 197 n.21).\n\n       11\n         Because we find that the District Court did not err in\nholding that Wediko was not an ―appropriate placement,‖ we\nneed not address Munir‘s claims relating to alleged procedural\nviolations committed by the school district.\n\n\n\n\n                               20\n\f        The District Court did not err in determining that the IEP\noffered by the School District in May and September 2009\nsatisfied the School District‘s obligations under the IDEA. In\ndesigning O.M.‘s IEPs, the School District took into account\nWediko‘s evaluation of O.M. and ―incorporated virtually all of\nthe Wediko recommendations.‖ Munir, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2194543</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*9. The District Court recognized that smaller classes and more\nemotional support might ―contribute to [O.M.‘s] ability to learn\nmore easily,‖ id. at *16, but it determined that neither was\nnecessary to ensure that O.M. received meaningful educational\nbenefits. Munir has not shown that this conclusion was clearly\nerroneous.\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.\n\n\n\n\n                               21\n\f</pre>",
