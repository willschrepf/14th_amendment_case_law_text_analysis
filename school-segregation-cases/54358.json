We\ninvited public comment on the petition and, on September 30,\n2013, heard oral presentations on behalf of petitioner and the\nBar Association.\n   We deny the petition to create a purely voluntary bar, but\nwe determine that the rules creating and establishing the Bar\nAssociation should be amended in the light of developments in\ncompelled-speech jurisprudence from the U.S. Supreme Court\nsince integration of the Bar Association in 1937. In the sections\nthat follow, we (1) recognize the continuing constitutional\nlegitimacy of mandatory or unified state bar associations, (2)\nrecall the constitutional basis for and reasons justifying inte-\ngration of the bar in 1937, (3) summarize the experience in\nother jurisdictions, (4) examine the evolution of compelled-\nspeech jurisprudence, and (5) focus on the relevance of “ger-\nmaneness.” Finally, we adopt the administrative changes we\ndeem necessary to serve the important purposes of an inte-\ngrated bar while both (1) ensuring that the Bar Association\nremains clearly within the permitted scope of constitutional\njurisprudence and (2) avoiding the protracted litigation experi-\nenced elsewhere.\n\n                 MANDATORY STATE BAR\n                       ASSOCIATIONS\n   [1] Petitioner does not challenge the constitutionality of\nmandatory state bar associations. Analogizing state bar associa-\ntions to “union-shop” arrangements, the U.S. Supreme Court\nestablished long ago that a state may constitutionally require a\nlawyer to be a member of a mandatory or unified bar to which\ncompulsory dues are paid.1\n   [2,3] The core of petitioner’s grievance in this matter\narises out of the 1990 holding of the Supreme Court in\n\n\n 1\t\n      Lathrop v.

State Bar of California,2 where it took up the ques-\ntion of “permissible expenditures” of mandatory bar dues.\nRelying on Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,3 a govern-\nmental employee union case, the Court delineated the First\nAmendment boundaries of a bar association’s expenditures of\ncompulsory dues.\n         Abood held that a union could not expend a dissent-\n      ing individual’s dues for ideological activities not “ger-\n      mane” to the purpose for which compelled association\n      was justified: collective bargaining. Here the compelled\n      association and integrated bar are justified by the State’s\n      interest in regulating the legal profession and improving\n      the quality of legal services. The State Bar may therefore\n      constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals\n      out of the mandatory dues of all members. It may not,\n      however, in such manner fund activities of an ideological\n      nature which fall outside of those areas of activity. The\n      difficult question, of course, is to define the latter class\n      of activities.4\n   Thus, the Court held, “the guiding standard must be whether\nthe challenged expenditures are necessarily or reasonably\nincurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or\n‘improving the quality of the legal service available to the\npeople of the State.’”5\n   It is that “difficult question” of the use of mandatory bar\ndues for “germane” versus “nongermane” activities which,\nas in some other states, forms the basis for the challenge to\nNebraska’s mandatory bar which is before us today.\n\n\n\n\n 2\t\n      Keller v.

We reasoned that in the\nabsence of an express grant of power to any of the branches,\nthe power must be exercised by the branch to which it natu-\nrally belonged. In concluding that this court had the inherent\npower to promulgate rules providing for an integrated bar,\nwe explained that we had the exclusive power to regulate the\nconduct and qualifications of attorneys as officers of the court,\nthat the proper administration of justice was the main business\nof a court, and that “[t]he practice of law is so intimately con-\nnected and bound up with the exercise of judicial power in the\nadministration of justice that the right to define and regulate its\npractice naturally and logically belongs to the judicial depart-\nment of our state government.”8 Because the bench and bar\nwere so intimately related, we concluded that the problems of\none were the problems of the other.\n   In our 1937 opinion, this court set forth the initial rules\ncreating, controlling, and regulating the Bar Association.\nWe formed the Bar Association “[f]or the advancement of\nthe administration of justice according to law, and for the\n\n\n 6\t\n      See In re Integration of Nebraska State Bar Ass’n, 133 Neb. 283, 275\n      N.W. 265 (1937).\n 7\t\n      Id.\n 8\t\n      Id. at 289, 275 N.W. at 268.\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1022\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nadvancement of the honor and dignity of the legal profession,\nand encouragement of cordial intercourse among the members\nthereof, for the improvement of the service rendered the public\nby the Bench and Bar . . . .”9 At that time, those persons who\nwere residents of Nebraska licensed to practice law in the state\nconstituted the membership of the Bar Association. All mem-\nbers were compelled to pay dues.\n   In that same opinion, we also observed that our inherent\npower to integrate the bar included the authority to rescind the\nrules providing for integration. We stated, “In the event of a\nfailure of the plan to function as hoped, it can be corrected or\nabandoned by the amendment or revocation of the rule by the\ncourt in the exercise of its sound judicial discretion.”10 This\npetition presents the first attempt before this court to eliminate\nthe mandatory bar in Nebraska.\n           ACTIONS ELSEWHERE TO ELIMINATE\n                     MANDATORY BAR\n   Other jurisdictions have been confronted with actions to\nabolish the mandatory bar. Thirty-two states and the District\nof Columbia require attorneys to become members of a bar\nand to pay dues as a condition of practicing law in that juris-\ndiction.11 Aside from the temporary suspension of mandatory\nbar membership by the Wisconsin Supreme Court from 1988\nto 1992, discussed in more detail below, no state association\nhas converted from mandatory to voluntary status.12 We note\nthat the mandatory status of the Puerto Rico Bar Association\nwas eliminated in 2009 by an act of the legislature,13 and the\n\n 9\t\n      Id. at 291, 275 N.W. at 269.

Upon the first motion seeking inte-\ngration, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin postponed the matter\nto a time after the lawyers in military service returned home\nfrom World War II.16 When the matter of integration next came\nbefore the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, the court concluded\nthat a voluntary bar was preferable and that the bar should not\nbe integrated.17 But upon the third motion for integration, the\nSupreme Court of Wisconsin determined that the bar should\nbe integrated when proper rules and procedures had been\nadopted by further order of the court.18 Thus, the Wisconsin bar\nbecame an integrated bar on January 1, 1957, under rules and\nbylaws promulgated by the court.19 The U.S. Supreme Court\nlater upheld a constitutional challenge to integration of the\nbar’s membership.20\n   The Supreme Court of Wisconsin had further opportunities\nto consider whether the bar should remain integrated. In 197721\nand again in 1980,22 the court approved continuation of the\nintegrated bar.\n\n14\t\n      P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 4, § 774 (2013).\n15\t\n      See P.R. S.B.

Supreme Court of Wisconsin,23 a federal district\ncourt found that the mandatory membership requirement vio-\nlated the litigant’s First Amendment rights of free speech\nand free association and was not justified by a compelling\nstate interest. As a result, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\nsuspended enforcement of its mandatory bar membership\nrules.24 On appeal, the Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding\nthat Lathrop v. Donohue25—which upheld the constitutional-\nity of integration—was binding precedent.26 The Supreme\nCourt of Wisconsin reinstated the integrated bar effective July\n1, 1992.27\n   The bar in Wisconsin remains mandatory amid unrest. A\nmember satisfaction survey conducted for the bar in 2008\nrevealed that a majority of the respondents—57 percent—\nwould vote for a voluntary association if given the opportunity\nto do so.28 In July 2011, two attorneys filed a petition renew-\ning their request that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin abolish\nthe integrated bar.29 The court, with three justices dissenting,\ndenied the petition without a public hearing.30\n                 State Bar of New Mexico\n   In 2003, two petitioners sought to modify a New Mexico\nSupreme Court rule31 to change the bar from a mandatory bar\nto a voluntary bar.

The board also identified\npolicies supporting a voluntary bar, including the freedom of\nassociation and a voluntary bar’s freedom and independence\nfrom the court.

As discussed below, the U.S. Supreme Court\nhas determined that some mandatory associations, such as\nsome unions and state bar associations, do not violate the\nFirst Amendment, because the forced speech serves legitimate\npurposes for the benefit of its entire membership. The critical\ninquiry in forced speech cases is whether the speech or activity\nbeing “forced” on the dissenting member is “germane” to the\n“group’s constitutionally permissible purposes.”40 In Lathrop,41\na Wisconsin attorney argued that his compelled membership\nin the state bar violated his rights under the 14th Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution because the bar engaged in political\nactivities which he opposed. The U.S. Supreme Court reasoned\nthat the bulk of the bar’s activities served the function of ele-\nvating the educational and ethical standards of the bar in order\nto improve the quality of legal services available to the citizens\nof the state.

Detroit Board of Education,43 every local gov-\nernmental employee represented by a union, even though not a\nunion member, was required to pay to the union, as a condition\nof employment, a service fee equal in amount to union dues.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court considered whether that arrangement\nviolated the constitutional rights of employees who object to\npublic-sector unions or to various union activities financed by\nthe compulsory service fees. The Court reasoned:\n         We do not hold that a union cannot constitutionally\n      spend funds for the expression of political views, on\n      behalf of political candidates, or toward the advance-\n      ment of other ideological causes not germane to its\n      duties as ­  collective-bargaining representative. Rather,\n      the Constitution requires only that such expenditures be\n      financed from charges, dues, or assessments paid by\n      employees who do not object to advancing those ideas\n      and who are not coerced into doing so against their will\n      by the threat of loss of governmental employment.44\nThus, the Court held that the agency-shop clause was valid\ninsofar as the service fees were used to finance expenditures\n\n42\t\n      Id., 367 U.S. at 843.\n43\t\n      Abood v.

Hudson,45 employees who did not belong\nto a union challenged the procedure used to determine the\nproportionate share that they were required to contribute to\nsupport the union as a collective bargaining agent, alleg-\ning that it violated their 1st and 14th Amendment rights and\npermitted the use of their proportionate shares for impermis-\nsible purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court held that “the con-\nstitutional requirements for the Union’s collection of agency\nfees include an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee,\na reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of\nthe fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow\nfor the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges\nare pending.”46\n   As noted at the outset of our opinion, it is the seminal and\noft-cited case of Keller v. State Bar of California47 which is\nthe foundation of this petition and, indeed, most claims chal-\nlenging mandatory state bar associations. In Keller, members\nof the State Bar of California sued the bar, alleging that it\nviolated their rights under the First Amendment by using their\nmembership dues to finance certain ideological or political\nactivities to which they were opposed. The Supreme Court\nobserved that the relationship of a state bar and its members\nwas analogous to the relationship of employee unions and\ntheir members and that agency-shop laws were enacted to\nprevent those who receive the benefit of union negotiation\nbut who do not join the union and pay dues from avoiding\npaying their fair share of the cost of a process from which\nthey benefit.\n   Furthermore, the Court stated that it was appropriate that\nall of the lawyers who derive benefits from being admitted\n\n\n45\t\n      Teachers v.

The\n      State Bar may therefore constitutionally fund activities\n      germane to those goals out of the mandatory dues of\n      all members. It may not, however, in such manner fund\n      activities of an ideological nature which fall outside of\n      those areas of activity.49\n   In order to define activities not germane to the bar associa-\ntion’s goals, the guiding standard is “whether the challenged\nexpenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the pur-\npose of regulating the legal profession or ‘improving the qual-\nity of the legal service available to the people of the State.’”50\nThe Court declared that “an integrated bar could certainly\nmeet its Abood obligation by adopting the sort of procedures\ndescribed in Hudson.”51\n   United States v. United Foods, Inc.52 teaches that the test\nto determine what group speech is constitutionally permis-\nsible is not whether the speech is political or ideological\nin nature, but, rather, whether the speech is germane. The\nSupreme Court iterated that “speech need not be characterized\nas political before it receives First Amendment protection”53\nand that “[l]awyers could be required to pay moneys in sup-\nport of activities that were germane to the reason justifying\nthe compelled association in the first place, for example,\n\n\n48\t\n      Id., 496 U.S. at 12.\n49\t\n      Id., 496 U.S. at 13-14.\n50\t\n      Id., 496 U.S. at 14.\n51\t\n      Id., 496 U.S. at 17.\n52\t\n      United States v.

Colegio\nde Abogados de Puerto Rico.55 In that case, the mandatory bar\nin Puerto Rico required members to purchase life insurance\nfrom its group life insurance program. There was no provision\nwhich would allow a member to refuse the life insurance and\nretain the portion of the member’s dues that would otherwise\nhave been spent on life insurance premiums. The First Circuit\ndetermined that the required payment for group life insurance\nwas unconstitutional, because it was not germane to the bar\nassociation’s purpose of regulating the legal profession and\nimproving the quality of legal services. As the First Circuit\nstated, “[T]hat an individual may be compelled to associate\nand financially contribute for some purposes does not mean\nshe may be compelled to associate and financially contribute\nfor all purposes.”56\n   Likewise, in Kingstad v. State Bar of Wis.,57 three Wisconsin\nattorneys objected to the state bar’s use of a portion of their\nmandatory dues to fund a public image campaign. The Seventh\nCircuit held that in order to withstand scrutiny under the First\nAmendment, expenditures by the state bar which are funded\nby mandatory dues must be germane to legitimate purposes\nof the bar, regardless of the ideological and political nature\nof the activity. In other words, a bar member may not, under\nKingstad, be compelled to subsidize “nongermane” activities\nof any type. The Seventh Circuit determined, however, that\nthe disputed public image campaign—which had the goal of\nimproving the public’s perception of Wisconsin lawyers—was\ngermane to the legitimate purposes of the bar, because the\n\n\n54\t\n      Id., 533 U.S. at 414.\n55\t\n      Romero v.

Service Employees Intern. Union,58\nwherein the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether a union\ncould require objecting nonmembers to pay a special fee for\nthe purpose of financing the union’s political and ideologi-\ncal activities without running afoul of the First Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court recalled that it had held “[t]he First\nAmendment . . . does not permit a public-sector union to\nadopt procedures that have the effect of requiring objecting\nnonmembers to lend the union money to be used for politi-\ncal, ideological, and other purposes not germane to collec-\ntive bargaining.”59\n   The Knox Court cast doubt on the constitutional validity\nof opt-out systems for dissenting members. The Court stated,\n“By authorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers and\npermitting the use of an opt-out system for the collec­ion of\n                                                           t\nfees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our prior deci-\nsions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what the First\nAmendment can tolerate.”60 The Knox Court further stated,\n“Our cases have tolerated a substantial impingement on First\nAmendment rights by allowing unions to impose an opt-out\nrequirement at all.”61 With regard to the collection of spe-\ncial assessment dues at issue in Knox, the Court determined\nthat “the union should have sent out a new notice allowing\nnonmembers to opt in to the special fee rather than requiring\nthem to opt out.”62 We note that the Knox Court did not strike\ndown the use of an opt-out system altogether, but the concur-\nrence points out that its continued viability is in doubt, stating\nthat “while the majority’s novel rule is, on its face, limited to\n\n\n58\t\n      Knox v.

The Knox Court explained its\ndecision in United Foods, Inc. as follows:\n      We made it clear that compulsory subsidies for private\n      speech are subject to exacting First Amendment scru-\n      tiny and cannot be sustained unless two criteria are met.\n      First, there must be a comprehensive regulatory scheme\n      involving a “mandated association” among those who\n      are required to pay the subsidy. . . . Such situations are\n      exceedingly rare because, as we have stated elsewhere,\n      mandatory associations are permissible only when they\n      serve a “compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be\n      achieved through means significantly less restrictive of\n      associational freedoms.” . . . Second, even in the rare case\n      where a mandatory association can be justified, compul-\n      sory fees can be levied only insofar as they are a “neces-\n      sary incident” of the “larger regulatory purpose which\n      justified the required association.”71\nThat second criterion set forth in Knox reinforces the Kingstad\n“germaneness” analysis and the significance of that factor\nin protecting “associational freedoms.” The two-part Knox\ntest focuses directly on the United Foods, Inc. characteriza-\ntion of Keller despite the “mundane commercial nature of\n[the] speech.”72\n   Thus, there appears to be ample support for the view\nexpressed in Kingstad that germaneness is central to a modern\nview of Keller.\n\n70\t\n      Fenner, supra note 67.\n71\t\n      Knox v.

The nature of the proceeding before\nthis court, i.e., a petition for a rule change under the court’s\ninherent authority, does not require us to resolve a case or\ncontroversy between two parties as would a proceeding under\nthis court’s appellate or original action jurisdiction. The present\npetition requires this court to assess the future and the structure\nof the mandatory bar in Nebraska at an administrative level and\ndetermine, based on trends in the law since 1937, how to best\nmeet the needs of the judicial system, Nebraska attorneys, and\nthe citizens of this state.\n   As noted at the outset, there were several important reasons\nunderlying our 1937 decision to integrate the bar in Nebraska.73\nThose reasons still exist and remain valid justifications for a\nmandatory bar to this day. This court recognized in 1937 that\n“a few unethical practitioners ha[d] degraded the public esteem\nof the bar as a whole.”74 Our decisions in disciplinary cases\nsince 1937 demonstrate the continued necessity of regulating\nthe bar and ensuring that ethical rules for lawyers are main-\ntained and enforced. This court also observed in 1937 that\ninformed public opinion\n      favor[ed] bar integration by supreme court rule as a\n      means of providing better service to the public by the\n      legal profession, of effectively combating the unautho­\n      rized practice of law, and of improving the ethical stan-\n      dards of the profession and giving to it the high public\n      esteem that it should enjoy.75\nThe demand for additional legal services has grown exponen-\ntially since 1937. In this age of instantaneous communications\nreaching to virtually every household, the need to combat the\nunauthorized practice of law presents new challenges. And\n\n\n73\t\n      In re Integration of Nebraska State Bar Ass’n, supra note 6.\n74\t\n      Id. at 290, 275 N.W. at 268.\n75\t\n      Id. at 284, 275 N.W. at 266.\n\f                       Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t        IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL.

This purpose clearly\nincludes the functions of (1) admitting qualified applicants to\nmembership in the Bar Association, (2) maintaining the records\nof membership, (3) enforcing the ethical rules governing the\nBar Association’s members, (4) regulating the mandate of con-\ntinuing legal education, (5) maintaining records of trust fund\nrequirements for lawyers, and (6) pursuing those who engage\nin the unauthorized practice of law. The mandatory Supreme\nCourt assessments supporting these functions will be paid to\nthe Bar Association on behalf of the Nebraska Supreme Court\nin much the same way that the existing disciplinary assessment\nis administered. By limiting the use of mandatory assessments\nto the arena of regulation of the legal profession, we ensure\nthat the Bar Association remains well within the limits of the\ncompelled-speech jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court\nand avoid embroiling this court and the legal profession in\nunending quarrels and litigation over the germaneness of an\nactivity in whole or in part, the constitutional adequacy of a\n\n\n76\t\n      See, Neb.

Voluntary bar dues fall outside the realm of\nthe compelled-speech jurisprudence. Many members of the Bar\nAssociation may well elect to pay the voluntary dues assess-\nment—particularly if the Bar Association strictly adheres to\nthe use of such funds for purposes clearly benefiting the bar\nas a whole and avoids entanglement in ideological or political\nissues or legislation. The Bar Association has, over the years,\ndeveloped and administered many laudable and worthwhile\nprograms which have served the legal profession well. The\nVolunteer Lawyers Project with its legal self-help desks, the\nNebraska Lawyers Assistance Program, the Casemaker Digest,\nits continuing legal education programs, and the SCOPE men-\ntoring program are but a few of the worthy services offered by\nthe Bar Association. Such services and programs and others\nlike them can continue to thrive with the aid of voluntary dues,\ngrants, and gifts from those who choose to support the volun-\ntary components of the Bar Association.\n   We disagree with the parade of horrors predicted by both\npetitioner and the Bar Association regarding such an arrange-\nment. Petitioner cautioned during his oral presentation that\nsuch a bar would be “cumbersome” compared to a purely\nvoluntary bar. But petitioner’s approach fails to preserve the\nregulatory structure erected beginning in 1937 and would aban-\ndon the public’s reliance upon the existence of a mandatory\nbar. And our prior segregation of a bar-disciplinary assessment\nclearly demonstrates that administrative issues can be managed\neasily. Thus, we conclude that petitioner’s fear is unfounded.\nThe Bar Association, on the other hand, asserted that having\nto perform an item-by-item germaneness analysis would be\n“not workable” and “way too expensive.” But our approach\nentirely avoids any such difficulty. We recognize that we have\nintentionally chosen to draw the line in a manner that forgoes\nthe opportunity to expend mandatory assessments for some\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t    IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL.

By drawing\nthe line for use of mandatory bar assessments well within the\nbounds of the compelled-speech jurisprudence, we ensure that\nthe assessments—which will be administered by the Supreme\nCourt—will be used only for activities that are clearly ger-\nmane. Here again, our experience with the disciplinary assess-\nment shows that this separation between mandatory and vol-\nuntary dues can be readily accomplished. And by drawing the\nline in this way, we will clearly avoid the morass of continuing\nlitigation experienced in other jurisdictions.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n   Although we reject petitioner’s request for complete deuni-\nfication of the Bar Association, we sustain the petition to\nthe extent that we amend this court’s rules to limit the use\nof mandatory bar dues, now to be referred to as “mandatory\nmembership assessments,” to the regulation of the legal pro-\nfession. The Bar Association may collect voluntary dues to\nfinance nonregulatory activities which may benefit the legal\nprofession as a whole.

The Site Supervisor must rapidly\ngo to the site of any incident or emergency and quickly assess\nthe situation. If the situation requires it, 911 should be called\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1042\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nimmediately. The safety of the applicants, proctors, and staff is\nalways of primary concern. The Executive Director director of\nadmissions must be contacted promptly and given a report of\nthe incident or emergency. If 911 is called, the Site Supervisor\nshould immediately notify facility staff so that they can assist\nin meeting the emergency personnel and directing them to the\nappropriate location.\nIn any situation where a dispute arises, the Site Supervisor or\nstaff member should attempt to calm the applicant and inform\nthe applicant that the matter is being reported to the Executive\nDirector director of admissions so that a decision can be made\non how to proceed. As with any incident, the “Emergency\nReport” form (Form A) should be completed by the Site\nSupervisor as soon as possible.\n....\nDelayed Starting Time\nWhile there may be very good reasons for delaying the exami-\nnation, every attempt should be made to start the examination\non time. If time permits, the Site Supervisor should contact the\nExecutive Director director of admissions to report the delay\nand get instructions on when to begin the afternoon session.\nThe Executive Director director of admissions will advise of\nthe correct action to take, but in any event, the afternoon ses-\nsion should not begin less than 1 hour after the applicants have\nbeen dismissed from the morning session.\nIn the event of a natural disaster, the Executive Director direc-\ntor of admissions should be contacted prior to the start of the\nexamination, as soon as the problem is identified. If the deci-\nsion is made to give all applicants extra time, the Speaker will\nbe directed to make such an announcement. If a decision is\nmade to give individual applicants extra time, a board staff\nmember will advise each affected applicant that he/she has\nbeen granted a certain amount of extra time. The applicant\nwill be instructed to continue the examination after the other\napplicants have been dismissed. The applicant will be stopped\nindividually when the extra time is up.\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t    IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL. STATE BAR ASSN.\t1043\n\t                       Cite as 286 Neb. 1018\n\nExtended Time\nGenerally, extended time to complete an examination ses-\nsion by the amount of time lost due to a personal incident is\nnot given.\nIf it is determined that a Major Disruption has occurred or that\na small number of applicants have been negatively affected\nby a circumstance beyond their control and that it is possible\nto maintain the integrity of the testing environment, then the\nexamination can be stopped for up to 11⁄2 hours if the test site\ncan accommodate the extended time. The Speaker should begin\nto read the disruption text that is attached as Appendix A to this\nEmergency Preparedness Plan. This should only be read after\nreceiving instructions from the Executive Director director of\nadmissions to do so.\n....\nRestart or Dismiss\nAfter a determination to stop an examination has been made,\nthe Executive Director director of admissions needs to deter-\nmine whether to restart the examination or dismiss the exam-\ninees for the session. An examination can be restarted after the\nfollowing criteria have been considered:\n....\nDisputed Time Announcements\nThe Site Supervisor is responsible for the accuracy of time\nannouncements. The Site Supervisor will stand at the podium\nto ensure the announcements are the correct time and given at\nthe appropriate time. If an applicant disputes a time announce-\nment, the Site Supervisor should be contacted immediately. The\nSite Supervisor should report any such dispute to the Executive\nDirector director of admissions and complete a “Record of\nIrregularity” form (Form B).\nFlooding, Etc., at Facility\nAs soon as such an incident is determined, the Site Supervisor\nmust contact the Executive Director director of admissions\nimmediately. Several proctors should be assigned to the\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1044\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nentrances of the examination room to advise the applicants that\nthe situation is being assessed and further information will be\nprovided as soon as it becomes available. Facility staff should\nbe contacted immediately to determine what can be done to\nrectify the situation and make whatever arrangements are nec-\nessary to start the examination on time or as close to on time\nas possible.\nFire Drills\nThe Site Supervisor should immediately determine if the fire\nalarm is a drill or an actual alarm. If it is a drill, the Site\nSupervisor should immediately contact facility staff and have\nthe alarm shut off. The Executive Director director of admis-\nsions should then be contacted to determine if the disruption\nwas significant enough to warrant the granting of additional\ntesting time. If the alarm is valid, the procedures for the evac­\nuation of the facility, stated below, should be followed.\nEvacuation of Facility\nBefore the examination, you should review the set-up dia-\ngram of the facility to familiarize yourself with the location\nof all exits. If time permits, the Executive Director director\nof admissions should be contacted immediately and evacua­\ntion procedures should be followed. The examination must\nbe stopped and the time noted. The proctors should begin to\nmove the applicants out of the building. The applicants may\nresist all efforts to be “herded.” However, sufficient pres-\nence should be displayed to avoid panic. A calm, solicitous\napproach, suggesting that the orderly and rapid exit and\nreassembly is to the applicant’s personal advantage is much\nmore likely to result in a successful emergency exit than is\nan attitude on the part of the proctors which tends to demand\nmilitary precision or gives the impression of such demands.\nIf there is time, proctors should collect all examination mate-\nrials. If there is a threat of fire, the last person out should\nclose the doors. If there is a bomb threat, the doors should be\nleft open.\n....\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t    IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL.

If the facility staff\ndoes comply with the demand, the Executive Director direc-\ntor of admissions should be contacted as soon as the prob-\nlem has been resolved with the action that was taken. If the\nfacility staff refused to comply with the demand, the Site\nSupervisor must contact the Executive Director director of\nadmissions immediately.\nWhen noise problems occur outside of the facility, the Site\nSupervisor must immediately go to the source of the noise and\nattempt to get the noise stopped. The Site Supervisor should\nthen return to the room and make notes regarding the problem.\nAn exact diagram of the room should be drawn so that the\nExecutive Director director of admissions will know exactly\nwhich of the applicants were affected by the noise problem.\nMake sure proctors in the area write a detailed incident report\non the “Record of Irregularity” form (Form B). If the Site\nSupervisor is unsuccessful in stopping the noise, the Executive\nDirector director of admissions should be contacted to deter-\nmine a course of action. Any of the Applicants who complain\nshould be moved to another area if there is space available. It\nmay be determined that the examination will be stopped until\nthe noise ceases; however, the Executive Director director of\nadmissions can only make that decision.\nElectrical Problems\n....\nIn the event of a power outage, the exact time of the outage\nand the length of time of the outage should be documented.\nThe Site Supervisor should notify the Executive Director direc-\ntor of admissions immediately of any such outage. The appli-\ncants should be given additional time that is equal to the length\nof time of the outage.\nPlease note: The Site Supervisor should first check to see if\nthe electrical problem may have been caused by plugs being\nkicked out of wall or floor outlets.\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1046\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nApplicants Leaving Examination Room\nAny applicant who leaves the examination room prior to com-\npleting the session should not be readmitted. If he/she objects,\nthe Executive Director director of admissions should be con-\ntacted immediately to report the situation and ask for guidance.\n....\nMBE Answer Sheet\nIf an applicant marks circles (M/C) in their question book, con-\ntact the Executive Director director of admissions for guidance.\n....\nPeople Wanting to Learn Whereabouts of Applicants\nAll applicant information is confidential, and no staff mem-\nber or proctor is to release any information regarding the\nwhereabouts of an applicant. If the inquirer states that it is an\nemergency, the information should be taken and the Executive\nDirector director of admissions must be contacted immediately\nfor further guidance. No indication is to be given regarding\nwhether or not an applicant is present. These instructions relate\nto the media and law enforcement personnel as well.\nPossible Imposters\nIn the possibility that an imposter is suspected of taking the\nexamination for someone else, the incident must be well\ndocumented. The Site Supervisor and the Section Supervisor\nmust provide a detailed description of the applicant; carefully\nobserve the applicant involved and state, in detail, the reason\nfor suspecting that the applicant is an imposter. Do not inter-\nrupt the applicant or otherwise disturb him/her. During the\nroll call portion of the examination, the Section Supervisor\nshould pay extra attention that the photo identification pro-\nvided is valid. The Executive Director director of admis-\nsions should be contacted immediately to report the suspected\nimposter. The Site Supervisor should clandestinely take the\nsuspected imposter’s photograph with the digital camera (at\neach test site).\n....\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t    IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL.

After the session is complete, he/she should interview\nthe complaining applicant. The Site Supervisor should not get\ninvolved with an argument or take either side. It is his/her pri-\nmary responsibility to calm both parties and gather facts.\nThe Site Supervisor should advise the complaining applicant\nthat the matter will be reported in detail to the Executive\nDirector director of admissions and that if he/she wishes to\nfile an additional statement, it should be forwarded to the\nExecutive Director director of admissions. The Site Supervisor\nshould offer to move the applicant to a vacant seat in another\nsection. The Site Supervisor should get a detailed account of\nthe incident from the proctor and submit it in conjunction with\nhis/her report of the incident.\nUnruly Applicants\nThe Site Supervisor and security personnel should observe the\napplicant and immediately determine if the applicant should\nbe moved to another area of the testing room, or escorted out\nof the testing room. The Site Supervisor should contact the\nExecutive Director director of admissions prior to having the\napplicant leave the testing room.\n....\nTypographical Errors\nIf such an error is reported, the Executive Director director of\nadmissions should be contacted immediately. Make no com-\nment to any proctor or applicant regarding the error. Advise\nanyone inquiring about the error that the matter is being\nreported and that they should answer the question as stated.\nIf the applicant feels there is an issue, the applicant should\nsubmit a detailed written description to the Executive Director\ndirector of admissions immediately after the bar examination\nhas concluded.\nReceipt of Threat to Safety\nNotice of the possibility of a condition that might require\nthe emergency exit from an examination site can arrive from\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1048\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\na variety of sources. Possibly an applicant may return from\nlunch with a rumor of a planned disruption which he or she\nhas overheard. A member of the facility staff may report some\nreference to an emergency. A bomb threat might be incoming\non the telephone. Irrespective of the source and nature of the\ninformation received, the recipient should gain all possible\ninformation. The “Response to Personally Delivered Threat\nInformation” form (From D) should be made available in all\nsections. Upon rapid, thorough, and accurate completion of\nthe form, it should be quickly hand-delivered to either the\nExecutive Director director of admissions or Site Supervisor,\nwhoever happens to be the most readily available.\nIn the event the threat is such that the site will probably be\nuninhabitable preventing reentry, a dismissal exit should occur,\nbut must first be approved by the Executive Director director\nof admissions. The time remaining in the session would also be\na consideration. If there is only the threat of unknown validity,\nthe emergency should be thoroughly analyzed before the exit\nis ordered.\nDeath or Serious Injury Notification\n....\nThe Executive Director director of admissions must be advised\nbefore any action is taken or the applicant is notified. The\nExecutive Director director of admissions or, if delegated, the\nSite Supervisor will personally make the notification. . . .\nMedia Coverage (TV, Newspapers, Magazines, Etc.)\nIf media personnel, such as reporters or camera men, are pres-\nent at the bar examination site, the Site Supervisor or his/her\ndesignee must notify the Executive Director director of admis-\nsions as soon as possible. Only the Site Supervisor is autho-\nrized to speak to the media and then, can ONLY discuss topics\nregarding general bar examination information that could be\nfound on the Board’s Web site.

State Bar of California,2 where it took up the ques-\ntion of “permissible expenditures” of mandatory bar dues.\nRelying on Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,3 a govern-\nmental employee union case, the Court delineated the First\nAmendment boundaries of a bar association’s expenditures of\ncompulsory dues.\n         Abood held that a union could not expend a dissent-\n      ing individual’s dues for ideological activities not “ger-\n      mane” to the purpose for which compelled association\n      was justified: collective bargaining. Here the compelled\n      association and integrated bar are justified by the State’s\n      interest in regulating the legal profession and improving\n      the quality of legal services. The State Bar may therefore\n      constitutionally fund activities germane to those goals\n      out of the mandatory dues of all members. It may not,\n      however, in such manner fund activities of an ideological\n      nature which fall outside of those areas of activity. The\n      difficult question, of course, is to define the latter class\n      of activities.4\n   Thus, the Court held, “the guiding standard must be whether\nthe challenged expenditures are necessarily or reasonably\nincurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or\n‘improving the quality of the legal service available to the\npeople of the State.’”5\n   It is that “difficult question” of the use of mandatory bar\ndues for “germane” versus “nongermane” activities which,\nas in some other states, forms the basis for the challenge to\nNebraska’s mandatory bar which is before us today.\n\n\n\n\n 2\t\n      Keller v.

We reasoned that in the\nabsence of an express grant of power to any of the branches,\nthe power must be exercised by the branch to which it natu-\nrally belonged. In concluding that this court had the inherent\npower to promulgate rules providing for an integrated bar,\nwe explained that we had the exclusive power to regulate the\nconduct and qualifications of attorneys as officers of the court,\nthat the proper administration of justice was the main business\nof a court, and that “[t]he practice of law is so intimately con-\nnected and bound up with the exercise of judicial power in the\nadministration of justice that the right to define and regulate its\npractice naturally and logically belongs to the judicial depart-\nment of our state government.”8 Because the bench and bar\nwere so intimately related, we concluded that the problems of\none were the problems of the other.\n   In our 1937 opinion, this court set forth the initial rules\ncreating, controlling, and regulating the Bar Association.\nWe formed the Bar Association “[f]or the advancement of\nthe administration of justice according to law, and for the\n\n\n 6\t\n      See In re Integration of Nebraska State Bar Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3547563\"><a href=\"/opinion/3568207/in-re-integration-of-nebraska-state-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Neb.</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span>\n      <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1937).\n 7\t\n      Id.\n 8\t\n      Id. at 289, 275 N.W. at 268.\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1022\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nadvancement of the honor and dignity of the legal profession,\nand encouragement of cordial intercourse among the members\nthereof, for the improvement of the service rendered the public\nby the Bench and Bar . . . .”9 At that time, those persons who\nwere residents of Nebraska licensed to practice law in the state\nconstituted the membership of the Bar Association.

Upon the first motion seeking inte-\ngration, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin postponed the matter\nto a time after the lawyers in military service returned home\nfrom World War II.16 When the matter of integration next came\nbefore the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, the court concluded\nthat a voluntary bar was preferable and that the bar should not\nbe integrated.17 But upon the third motion for integration, the\nSupreme Court of Wisconsin determined that the bar should\nbe integrated when proper rules and procedures had been\nadopted by further order of the court.18 Thus, the Wisconsin bar\nbecame an integrated bar on January 1, 1957, under rules and\nbylaws promulgated by the court.19 The U.S. Supreme Court\nlater upheld a constitutional challenge to integration of the\nbar’s membership.20\n   The Supreme Court of Wisconsin had further opportunities\nto consider whether the bar should remain integrated.

As discussed below, the U.S. Supreme Court\nhas determined that some mandatory associations, such as\nsome unions and state bar associations, do not violate the\nFirst Amendment, because the forced speech serves legitimate\npurposes for the benefit of its entire membership. The critical\ninquiry in forced speech cases is whether the speech or activity\nbeing “forced” on the dissenting member is “germane” to the\n“group’s constitutionally permissible purposes.”40 In Lathrop,41\na Wisconsin attorney argued that his compelled membership\nin the state bar violated his rights under the 14th Amendment\nto the U.S. Constitution because the bar engaged in political\nactivities which he opposed.

Detroit Board of Education,43 every local gov-\nernmental employee represented by a union, even though not a\nunion member, was required to pay to the union, as a condition\nof employment, a service fee equal in amount to union dues.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court considered whether that arrangement\nviolated the constitutional rights of employees who object to\npublic-sector unions or to various union activities financed by\nthe compulsory service fees. The Court reasoned:\n         We do not hold that a union cannot constitutionally\n      spend funds for the expression of political views, on\n      behalf of political candidates, or toward the advance-\n      ment of other ideological causes not germane to its\n      duties as ­  collective-bargaining representative. Rather,\n      the Constitution requires only that such expenditures be\n      financed from charges, dues, or assessments paid by\n      employees who do not object to advancing those ideas\n      and who are not coerced into doing so against their will\n      by the threat of loss of governmental employment.44\nThus, the Court held that the agency-shop clause was valid\ninsofar as the service fees were used to finance expenditures\n\n42\t\n      Id., 367 U.S. at 843.\n43\t\n      Abood v.

Hudson,45 employees who did not belong\nto a union challenged the procedure used to determine the\nproportionate share that they were required to contribute to\nsupport the union as a collective bargaining agent, alleg-\ning that it violated their 1st and 14th Amendment rights and\npermitted the use of their proportionate shares for impermis-\nsible purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court held that “the con-\nstitutional requirements for the Union’s collection of agency\nfees include an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee,\na reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of\nthe fee before an impartial decisionmaker, and an escrow\nfor the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges\nare pending.”46\n   As noted at the outset of our opinion, it is the seminal and\noft-cited case of Keller v. State Bar of California47 which is\nthe foundation of this petition and, indeed, most claims chal-\nlenging mandatory state bar associations. In Keller, members\nof the State Bar of California sued the bar, alleging that it\nviolated their rights under the First Amendment by using their\nmembership dues to finance certain ideological or political\nactivities to which they were opposed. The Supreme Court\nobserved that the relationship of a state bar and its members\nwas analogous to the relationship of employee unions and\ntheir members and that agency-shop laws were enacted to\nprevent those who receive the benefit of union negotiation\nbut who do not join the union and pay dues from avoiding\npaying their fair share of the cost of a process from which\nthey benefit.\n   Furthermore, the Court stated that it was appropriate that\nall of the lawyers who derive benefits from being admitted\n\n\n45\t\n      Teachers v.

The\n      State Bar may therefore constitutionally fund activities\n      germane to those goals out of the mandatory dues of\n      all members. It may not, however, in such manner fund\n      activities of an ideological nature which fall outside of\n      those areas of activity.49\n   In order to define activities not germane to the bar associa-\ntion’s goals, the guiding standard is “whether the challenged\nexpenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the pur-\npose of regulating the legal profession or ‘improving the qual-\nity of the legal service available to the people of the State.’”50\nThe Court declared that “an integrated bar could certainly\nmeet its Abood obligation by adopting the sort of procedures\ndescribed in Hudson.”51\n   United States v. United Foods, Inc.52 teaches that the test\nto determine what group speech is constitutionally permis-\nsible is not whether the speech is political or ideological\nin nature, but, rather, whether the speech is germane.

Colegio\nde Abogados de Puerto Rico.55 In that case, the mandatory bar\nin Puerto Rico required members to purchase life insurance\nfrom its group life insurance program. There was no provision\nwhich would allow a member to refuse the life insurance and\nretain the portion of the member’s dues that would otherwise\nhave been spent on life insurance premiums. The First Circuit\ndetermined that the required payment for group life insurance\nwas unconstitutional, because it was not germane to the bar\nassociation’s purpose of regulating the legal profession and\nimproving the quality of legal services. As the First Circuit\nstated, “[T]hat an individual may be compelled to associate\nand financially contribute for some purposes does not mean\nshe may be compelled to associate and financially contribute\nfor all purposes.”56\n   Likewise, in Kingstad v. State Bar of Wis.,57 three Wisconsin\nattorneys objected to the state bar’s use of a portion of their\nmandatory dues to fund a public image campaign. The Seventh\nCircuit held that in order to withstand scrutiny under the First\nAmendment, expenditures by the state bar which are funded\nby mandatory dues must be germane to legitimate purposes\nof the bar, regardless of the ideological and political nature\nof the activity. In other words, a bar member may not, under\nKingstad, be compelled to subsidize “nongermane” activities\nof any type. The Seventh Circuit determined, however, that\nthe disputed public image campaign—which had the goal of\nimproving the public’s perception of Wisconsin lawyers—was\ngermane to the legitimate purposes of the bar, because the\n\n\n54\t\n      Id., 533 U.S. at 414.\n55\t\n      Romero v.

Service Employees Intern. Union,58\nwherein the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether a union\ncould require objecting nonmembers to pay a special fee for\nthe purpose of financing the union’s political and ideologi-\ncal activities without running afoul of the First Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court recalled that it had held “[t]he First\nAmendment . . . does not permit a public-sector union to\nadopt procedures that have the effect of requiring objecting\nnonmembers to lend the union money to be used for politi-\ncal, ideological, and other purposes not germane to collec-\ntive bargaining.”59\n   The Knox Court cast doubt on the constitutional validity\nof opt-out systems for dissenting members. The Court stated,\n“By authorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers and\npermitting the use of an opt-out system for the collec­ion of\n                                                           t\nfees levied to cover nonchargeable expenses, our prior deci-\nsions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what the First\nAmendment can tolerate.”60 The Knox Court further stated,\n“Our cases have tolerated a substantial impingement on First\nAmendment rights by allowing unions to impose an opt-out\nrequirement at all.”61 With regard to the collection of spe-\ncial assessment dues at issue in Knox, the Court determined\nthat “the union should have sent out a new notice allowing\nnonmembers to opt in to the special fee rather than requiring\nthem to opt out.”62 We note that the Knox Court did not strike\ndown the use of an opt-out system altogether, but the concur-\nrence points out that its continued viability is in doubt, stating\nthat “while the majority’s novel rule is, on its face, limited to\n\n\n58\t\n      Knox v.

The Knox Court explained its\ndecision in United Foods, Inc. as follows:\n      We made it clear that compulsory subsidies for private\n      speech are subject to exacting First Amendment scru-\n      tiny and cannot be sustained unless two criteria are met.\n      First, there must be a comprehensive regulatory scheme\n      involving a “mandated association” among those who\n      are required to pay the subsidy. . . . Such situations are\n      exceedingly rare because, as we have stated elsewhere,\n      mandatory associations are permissible only when they\n      serve a “compelling state interes[t] . . . that cannot be\n      achieved through means significantly less restrictive of\n      associational freedoms.” . . . Second, even in the rare case\n      where a mandatory association can be justified, compul-\n      sory fees can be levied only insofar as they are a “neces-\n      sary incident” of the “larger regulatory purpose which\n      justified the required association.”71\nThat second criterion set forth in Knox reinforces the Kingstad\n“germaneness” analysis and the significance of that factor\nin protecting “associational freedoms.” The two-part Knox\ntest focuses directly on the United Foods, Inc. characteriza-\ntion of Keller despite the “mundane commercial nature of\n[the] speech.”72\n   Thus, there appears to be ample support for the view\nexpressed in Kingstad that germaneness is central to a modern\nview of Keller.\n\n70\t\n      Fenner, supra note 67.\n71\t\n      Knox v.

The nature of the proceeding before\nthis court, i.e., a petition for a rule change under the court’s\ninherent authority, does not require us to resolve a case or\ncontroversy between two parties as would a proceeding under\nthis court’s appellate or original action jurisdiction. The present\npetition requires this court to assess the future and the structure\nof the mandatory bar in Nebraska at an administrative level and\ndetermine, based on trends in the law since 1937, how to best\nmeet the needs of the judicial system, Nebraska attorneys, and\nthe citizens of this state.\n   As noted at the outset, there were several important reasons\nunderlying our 1937 decision to integrate the bar in Nebraska.73\nThose reasons still exist and remain valid justifications for a\nmandatory bar to this day. This court recognized in 1937 that\n“a few unethical practitioners ha[d] degraded the public esteem\nof the bar as a whole.”74 Our decisions in disciplinary cases\nsince 1937 demonstrate the continued necessity of regulating\nthe bar and ensuring that ethical rules for lawyers are main-\ntained and enforced. This court also observed in 1937 that\ninformed public opinion\n      favor[ed] bar integration by supreme court rule as a\n      means of providing better service to the public by the\n      legal profession, of effectively combating the unautho­\n      rized practice of law, and of improving the ethical stan-\n      dards of the profession and giving to it the high public\n      esteem that it should enjoy.75\nThe demand for additional legal services has grown exponen-\ntially since 1937. In this age of instantaneous communications\nreaching to virtually every household, the need to combat the\nunauthorized practice of law presents new challenges.

This purpose clearly\nincludes the functions of (1) admitting qualified applicants to\nmembership in the Bar Association, (2) maintaining the records\nof membership, (3) enforcing the ethical rules governing the\nBar Association’s members, (4) regulating the mandate of con-\ntinuing legal education, (5) maintaining records of trust fund\nrequirements for lawyers, and (6) pursuing those who engage\nin the unauthorized practice of law. The mandatory Supreme\nCourt assessments supporting these functions will be paid to\nthe Bar Association on behalf of the Nebraska Supreme Court\nin much the same way that the existing disciplinary assessment\nis administered. By limiting the use of mandatory assessments\nto the arena of regulation of the legal profession, we ensure\nthat the Bar Association remains well within the limits of the\ncompelled-speech jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court\nand avoid embroiling this court and the legal profession in\nunending quarrels and litigation over the germaneness of an\nactivity in whole or in part, the constitutional adequacy of a\n\n\n76\t\n      See, Neb.

Voluntary bar dues fall outside the realm of\nthe compelled-speech jurisprudence. Many members of the Bar\nAssociation may well elect to pay the voluntary dues assess-\nment—particularly if the Bar Association strictly adheres to\nthe use of such funds for purposes clearly benefiting the bar\nas a whole and avoids entanglement in ideological or political\nissues or legislation. The Bar Association has, over the years,\ndeveloped and administered many laudable and worthwhile\nprograms which have served the legal profession well. The\nVolunteer Lawyers Project with its legal self-help desks, the\nNebraska Lawyers Assistance Program, the Casemaker Digest,\nits continuing legal education programs, and the SCOPE men-\ntoring program are but a few of the worthy services offered by\nthe Bar Association. Such services and programs and others\nlike them can continue to thrive with the aid of voluntary dues,\ngrants, and gifts from those who choose to support the volun-\ntary components of the Bar Association.\n   We disagree with the parade of horrors predicted by both\npetitioner and the Bar Association regarding such an arrange-\nment. Petitioner cautioned during his oral presentation that\nsuch a bar would be “cumbersome” compared to a purely\nvoluntary bar. But petitioner’s approach fails to preserve the\nregulatory structure erected beginning in 1937 and would aban-\ndon the public’s reliance upon the existence of a mandatory\nbar. And our prior segregation of a bar-disciplinary assessment\nclearly demonstrates that administrative issues can be managed\neasily. Thus, we conclude that petitioner’s fear is unfounded.\nThe Bar Association, on the other hand, asserted that having\nto perform an item-by-item germaneness analysis would be\n“not workable” and “way too expensive.” But our approach\nentirely avoids any such difficulty. We recognize that we have\nintentionally chosen to draw the line in a manner that forgoes\nthe opportunity to expend mandatory assessments for some\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t    IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL.

By drawing\nthe line for use of mandatory bar assessments well within the\nbounds of the compelled-speech jurisprudence, we ensure that\nthe assessments—which will be administered by the Supreme\nCourt—will be used only for activities that are clearly ger-\nmane. Here again, our experience with the disciplinary assess-\nment shows that this separation between mandatory and vol-\nuntary dues can be readily accomplished. And by drawing the\nline in this way, we will clearly avoid the morass of continuing\nlitigation experienced in other jurisdictions.\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n   Although we reject petitioner’s request for complete deuni-\nfication of the Bar Association, we sustain the petition to\nthe extent that we amend this court’s rules to limit the use\nof mandatory bar dues, now to be referred to as “mandatory\nmembership assessments,” to the regulation of the legal pro-\nfession. The Bar Association may collect voluntary dues to\nfinance nonregulatory activities which may benefit the legal\nprofession as a whole. We attach to this opinion the necessary\nrule changes in chapter 3, “Attorneys and the Practice of Law,”\nof the Nebraska Supreme Court Rules, which include amend-\nments to the following articles thereof:\n• \u0007 rticle 1: Admission Requirements for the Practice of Law;\n  A\n• \u0007 rticle 3: Discipline Procedures for Lawyers;\n  A\n• \u0007 rticle 8: State Bar Association; Creation; Control; and\n  A\n  Regulation;\n• \u0007 rticle 9: Trust Fund Requirements for Lawyers; and\n  A\n• \u0007 rticle 10: Unauthorized Practice of Law.\n  A\n• \u0007 ebraska Commission on Unauthorized Practice of Law\n  N\n  Administrative Rules, Regulations, and Procedures.\nThe amendments to articles 3 and 8, and the amendments to\nNeb. Ct. R. §§ 3-100 and 3-1010, shall be effective on January\n1, 2014. In order to ensure an orderly transition of adminis-\ntrative functions regarding admissions, trust funds, and the\nunauthorized practice of law, all other amendments to the rules,\nregulations, and procedures identified above shall be effective\non April 1, 2014.\n\f     Nebraska Advance Sheets\n1038\t286 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\n   And we reiterate that the need for further amendments may\narise. We have already quoted the recognition in our 1937\nopinion that correction or abandonment of a rule may be\naccomplished by amendment or revocation in the exercise of\nour sound judicial discretion.77 While abandonment and revo-\ncation are unlikely, correction by amendment may be required\nas the implementation of these changes progresses.\n   We recognize that as of the date of issuance of this opin-\nion, the billing statements for bar dues for 2014 have been\ndistributed. Indeed, this court just recently approved the rates\nfor bar dues and the disciplinary assessment required for 2014.\nTherefore, in order to effectuate the directive of this court\nbased on this opinion and ensure an orderly transition in the\nstructure of the financing of the Bar Association, we direct that\nthe Bar Association conduct, as soon as practicable, a special\nmailing advising each of its members that (1) the member\nmust pay mandatory membership assessments established by\nthe Supreme Court in the amount appropriate to the member’s\nclass of membership as set forth below:\nMembership\t         § 3-100(B)\t § 3-301(E)\t § 3-1010(B)\nClass\t                (Adm.)\t(Discipline)\t (UPL)\t Total\nRegular Active\t        $25.00\t    $60.00\t      $13.00\t $98.00\nJunior Active\t         $25.00\t    $60.00\t      $13.00\t $98.00\nSenior Active\t         $25.00\t    $60.00\t      $13.00\t $98.00\nJudicial Active\t       $25.00\t    $60.00\t      $13.00\t $98.00\nMilitary Active\t            0\t          0\t           0\t         0\nRegular Inactive\t $12.50\t         $30.00\t      $  6.50\t $49.00\nEmeritus Inactive\t          0\t          0\t           0\t         0\n(2) the member may elect to pay the voluntary dues component\nof the Bar Association by paying such voluntary dues in an\namount to be established by the Bar Association for the 2014\ncalendar year, with credit for any amount previously paid in\nexcess of the mandatory membership assessments; and (3)\nif the member elects not to pay the voluntary dues compo-\nnent, the member shall be entitled to a refund of any amounts\n\n\n77\t\n      See In re Integration of Nebraska State Bar Ass’n, supra note 6.\n\f                    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t     IN RE PETITION FOR RULE TO CREATE VOL.

If it is a drill, the Site\nSupervisor should immediately contact facility staff and have\nthe alarm shut off. The Executive Director director of admis-\nsions should then be contacted to determine if the disruption\nwas significant enough to warrant the granting of additional\ntesting time. If the alarm is valid, the procedures for the evac­\nuation of the facility, stated below, should be followed.\nEvacuation of Facility\nBefore the examination, you should review the set-up dia-\ngram of the facility to familiarize yourself with the location\nof all exits. If time permits, the Executive Director director\nof admissions should be contacted immediately and evacua­\ntion procedures should be followed. The examination must\nbe stopped and the time noted. The proctors should begin to\nmove the applicants out of the building. The applicants may\nresist all efforts to be “herded.” However, sufficient pres-\nence should be displayed to avoid panic. A calm, solicitous\napproach, suggesting that the orderly and rapid exit and\nreassembly is to the applicant’s personal advantage is much\nmore likely to result in a successful emergency exit than is\nan attitude on the part of the proctors which tends to demand\nmilitary precision or gives the impression of such demands.\nIf there is time, proctors should collect all examination mate-\nrials.

A bomb threat might be incoming\non the telephone. Irrespective of the source and nature of the\ninformation received, the recipient should gain all possible\ninformation. The “Response to Personally Delivered Threat\nInformation” form (From D) should be made available in all\nsections.

The time remaining in the session would also be\na consideration. If there is only the threat of unknown validity,\nthe emergency should be thoroughly analyzed before the exit\nis ordered.\nDeath or Serious Injury Notification\n....\nThe Executive Director director of admissions must be advised\nbefore any action is taken or the applicant is notified. The\nExecutive Director director of admissions or, if delegated, the\nSite Supervisor will personally make the notification. . . .\nMedia Coverage (TV, Newspapers, Magazines, Etc.)\nIf media personnel, such as reporters or camera men, are pres-\nent at the bar examination site, the Site Supervisor or his/her\ndesignee must notify the Executive Director director of admis-\nsions as soon as possible.
