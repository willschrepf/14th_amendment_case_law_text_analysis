Secs. 1343 and 2201, and 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1983 and 1985.  Biagiarelli alleges that he has been deprived of certain of his constitutional rights, in particular his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, by having been placed in segregated confinement without a due process hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After hearing argument and testimony, the district court directed a declaratory judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  After careful consideration, the record requires that the district court order be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>*****</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff charged in his complaint that he was taken from his cell on October 19, 1971, without notice or warning, and placed in solitary confinement, where he remained until December 24, 1971.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The prison authorities defended their action on the basis that they had received information that Biagiarelli was involved in a conspiracy to escape from prison and that an emergency situation existed which required prompt action.  The district court included this finding in its opinion (349 F.Supp. at 914):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>\"The prison authorities presented evidence that an emergency situation existed on October 19, 1971.  They were unable to give him any hearing because they had received information of a conspiracy for a prison break in which plaintiff was involved from reliable sources, to wit: the Chief of Police of the City of Pittsburgh.  In their judgment this emergency situation justified placing the plaintiff in solitary immediately for reasons of security.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants assert in their appeal that since Biagiarelli was placed in \"administrative\" segregation, as opposed to \"punitive\" segregation, he was not entitled to the minimal due process requirements set out by the district court.  These included: (1) a written notice of charges; (2) a statement of the general nature of evidence supporting the charges; and (3) a hearing before a designated official where the prisoner has an opportunity to respond to charges.  See note 3, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff has filed a cross-appeal contending that the opinion and order of the district court did not provide sufficient safeguards for a prisoner subject to isolation from the general prison population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Gray v. Creamer, 465 F.2d 179 (3d Cir. 1972), we were presented with the claim that \"[the] plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law was abridged by the circumstances of their transfers from the general prison population to 'segregation' or 'punitive segregation.' \" 465 F.2d at 184.  In Gray we held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>\". . . the transfer of a prisoner from the general prison population to solitary confinement without either notice of the charges or a hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6--1\" id=\"fn6--1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>does not, absent unusual circumstances . . ., meet minimal due process requirements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">465 F.2d at 185.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent of the rights guaranteed to a state prisoner under the Fourteenth Amendment is not unlimited.<sup>6</sup>  As Judge Aldisert explained in Gittlemacker v. Prasse, 428 F.2d 1, 4 (3d Cir. 1970):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>\"To determine, with precision, those rights which follow an inmate into prison involves a process of weighing and balancing conflicting interests.  The desire that there be a maximum opportunity for the exercise of rights and privileges may often collide with the practical necessities of managing and administering a complicated penal community.  The task of striking the proper balance between these conflicting interests is generally within the competence of the prison authorities.  Thus, the federal courts have been understandably reluctant to intervene in matters of state prison administration, recognizing that a wide latitude for judgment and discretion must be extended to prison officials.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an example of the \"unusual circumstances\" referred to in Gray.  Here the prison authorities, in order to maintain control and to insure the continued security of the institution, were entitled to postpone notice of the charges, or the holding of a hearing for a reasonable period of time.  See Gray, supra, 465 F.2d at 185 n.6.  This was not the ordinary case of a prisoner being placed in administrative or punitive segregation<sup>6a</sup> for disciplinary purposes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> ] but the case of a prisoner alleged to have been involved in a conspiracy to escape from the prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the district court's order establishing a per se rule that the placement of a prisoner in solitary confinement, whether punitive or administrative segregation according to the previous Pennsylvania terminology, without written notice of the charge, a statement of the general nature of the evidence, and a hearing, constitutes a constitutional deprivation.  See United States ex rel. Arzonica v. Scheipe, et al., 474 F.2d 720 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not prepared to hold that the due process clause requires the prison authorities to provide a prisoner with a statement of the evidence, which forms the basis for the removal of the prisoner from the general prison population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Even where the question is raised at the time of a criminal trial in the federal courts, the defendant generally is not entitled to have the prosecution furnish him with a detailed statement of the evidence the prosecution plans to use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biagiarelli was only entitled to either written notice of the basis for his removal from the prison population and an opportunity to rebut the charge, or a hearing.  When the notice reasonably should have been given, or the hearing held, depended on when the threat to the institution subsided, regardless of whether he was held in punitive or administrative segregation.  It is not feasible for courts to adopt hard and fast rules that will apply to every institution, or to every situation that might arise within a particular institution.  Emergency conditions may require prompt and decisive administrative actions, and what is reasonable must be measured against the urgency of the circumstance necessitating the action.  See Arzonica, supra.  This rule of reason involves the weighing and balancing of conflicting interests referred to in Gittlemacker v. Prasse, supra, 428 F.2d at p. 4.  See United States ex rel. Tyrrell v. Speaker, 471 F.2d 1197, 1201 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the notice of appeal was filed on October 30, 1972, the Bureau of Correction in Pennsylvania has issued new guidelines for all state correctional facilities.  See Administrative Directive, Bureau of Correction, BC-ADM 801 (Parts I, III and IV are set forth in the Appendix).  These regulations, which took effect on November 1, 1972, reflect a careful effort to comport with this court's position in Gray and the district court should have an opportunity to consider them.  It appears, however, that they do not provide for either notice of the charges or a hearing where administrative custody, which may continue for at least 30 days before an interview with the Program Review Committee, is involved, even though no threatened prison breach or similar emergency is present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's September 13, 1972, Final Decree and Declaratory Judgment will be vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of this opinion and Administrative Directive BC-ADM 801.APPENDIX</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BC-ADM 801</p>\n    <p>Administrative Directive</p>\n    <p>Subject:</p>\n    <p>Adjustment of Behavior</p>\n    <p>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</p>\n    <p>Department of Justice</p>\n    <p>Bureau of Correction</p>\n    <p>I.

The JBC-141 form (Misconduct Report) shall be changed in style to a three-sheet snap set, one copy of which must be given directly to the resident by the staff member who writes the Misconduct Report.  No action on the Misconduct Report will be taken unless this is done.  One copy shall be retained by the staff person who wrote the misconduct.  The third copy shall be forwarded to the Deputy Superintendent for Treatment Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. As copies of the Misconduct Reports are received, the Deputy Superintendent for Treatment Services shall divide them into minor and major categories, consistent with the general intent of this directive.  Major misconduct shall ordinarily be limited to acts which violate the penal laws of the Commonwealth or to repetitive violations of rules and regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Minor Misconduct Reports shall be referred to the resident's support team-the team to include the individual resident's counselor, his housing unit officer and the relevant work and/or school supervisor.  In the absence of any team member, his immediate supervisor shall substitute.  The team shall be scheduled by the most appropriate member depending on the physical structure and general institutional procedures of each institution.  The convening of the team shall be within 36 hours of the report, except that reports filed on Friday and Saturday shall be heard the following Monday.  The team shall meet with the staff person who initiated the report and the resident involved at any convenient location.  The meeting shall be conducted as an informal but private group discussion aimed at achieving consensus in terms of the situation rather than as an adversary proceeding.  The primary objectives shall be to gain accurate knowledge of the facts, an understanding of the underlying causes of the behavior and to arrive at a sound decision for the treatment and control of the behavior exhibited.  One or more of a wide range of alternative dispositions may be used as indicated by the individual situation, i. e., counseling, peer group interaction, group therapy, assessment of damages for property willfully destroyed, change of cell, restriction of privileges, reclassification with respect to custody or program status, and recommendation for transfer.  Segregation status shall not be imposed by the support team.  If the support team concludes on the basis of previous work with the resident that more serious sanctions may be appropriate, the team may refer the matter to the Hearing Committee with a written explanation regarding the referral.  The decision of the team shall be reached in the presence of the resident and the staff member concerned when possible, but in all cases shall be given immediately to both parties along with the rationale for the decision.  It will also be within the authority of the team to expunge the meeting from the record when they feel this warranted.  As a general rule, Misconduct Reports handled by the team will not be formally entered against the resident's record for purposes such as parole, commutation, etc., but shall be recorded on the JBC-14 form only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Major misconducts shall be referred to the Hearing Committee which shall be composed of the Chairman who shall be the permanent member (Major of the Guard), the resident's counselor or his immediate supervisor, and the resident's work/school supervisor or his immediate supervisor.  When the matter has been referred from the support team, the counselor and work supervisor shall always be replaced by a supervisor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.

Biagiarelli alleges that he has been deprived of certain of his constitutional rights, in particular his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, by having been placed in segregated confinement without a due process hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After hearing argument and testimony, the district court directed a declaratory judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  After careful consideration, the record requires that the district court order be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>*****</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff charged in his complaint that he was taken from his cell on October 19, 1971, without notice or warning, and placed in solitary confinement, where he remained until December 24, 1971.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The prison authorities defended their action on the basis that they had received information that Biagiarelli was involved in a conspiracy to escape from prison and that an emergency situation existed which required prompt action.  The district court included this finding in its opinion (349 F.Supp. at 914):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>\"The prison authorities presented evidence that an emergency situation existed on October 19, 1971.  They were unable to give him any hearing because they had received information of a conspiracy for a prison break in which plaintiff was involved from reliable sources, to wit: the Chief of Police of the City of Pittsburgh.  In their judgment this emergency situation justified placing the plaintiff in solitary immediately for reasons of security.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants assert in their appeal that since Biagiarelli was placed in \"administrative\" segregation, as opposed to \"punitive\" segregation, he was not entitled to the minimal due process requirements set out by the district court.  These included: (1) a written notice of charges; (2) a statement of the general nature of evidence supporting the charges; and (3) a hearing before a designated official where the prisoner has an opportunity to respond to charges.

The desire that there be a maximum opportunity for the exercise of rights and privileges may often collide with the practical necessities of managing and administering a complicated penal community.  The task of striking the proper balance between these conflicting interests is generally within the competence of the prison authorities.  Thus, the federal courts have been understandably reluctant to intervene in matters of state prison administration, recognizing that a wide latitude for judgment and discretion must be extended to prison officials.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an example of the \"unusual circumstances\" referred to in Gray.  Here the prison authorities, in order to maintain control and to insure the continued security of the institution, were entitled to postpone notice of the charges, or the holding of a hearing for a reasonable period of time.  See Gray, supra, 465 F.2d at 185 n.6.  This was not the ordinary case of a prisoner being placed in administrative or punitive segregation<sup>6a</sup> for disciplinary purposes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> ] but the case of a prisoner alleged to have been involved in a conspiracy to escape from the prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with the district court's order establishing a per se rule that the placement of a prisoner in solitary confinement, whether punitive or administrative segregation according to the previous Pennsylvania terminology, without written notice of the charge, a statement of the general nature of the evidence, and a hearing, constitutes a constitutional deprivation.  See United States ex rel. Arzonica v. Scheipe, et al., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"308794\"><a href=\"/opinion/308794/united-states-ex-rel-paul-e-arzonica-v-walter-g-scheipe-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span> (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not prepared to hold that the due process clause requires the prison authorities to provide a prisoner with a statement of the evidence, which forms the basis for the removal of the prisoner from the general prison population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Even where the question is raised at the time of a criminal trial in the federal courts, the defendant generally is not entitled to have the prosecution furnish him with a detailed statement of the evidence the prosecution plans to use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Biagiarelli was only entitled to either written notice of the basis for his removal from the prison population and an opportunity to rebut the charge, or a hearing.  When the notice reasonably should have been given, or the hearing held, depended on when the threat to the institution subsided, regardless of whether he was held in punitive or administrative segregation.  It is not feasible for courts to adopt hard and fast rules that will apply to every institution, or to every situation that might arise within a particular institution.  Emergency conditions may require prompt and decisive administrative actions, and what is reasonable must be measured against the urgency of the circumstance necessitating the action.  See Arzonica, supra.  This rule of reason involves the weighing and balancing of conflicting interests referred to in Gittlemacker v. Prasse, supra, 428 F.2d at p. 4.  See United States ex rel.

These regulations, which took effect on November 1, 1972, reflect a careful effort to comport with this court's position in Gray and the district court should have an opportunity to consider them.
