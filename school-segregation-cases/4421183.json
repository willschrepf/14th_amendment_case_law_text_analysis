CLARK,\n\n                Plaintiff,\n\n         v.\n                                                            Civil Action No. 14-120 (RDM)\n JEH JOHNSON, Secretary of Homeland\n Security, and DEPARTMENT OF\n HOMELAND SECURITY,\n\n                Defendants.\n\n\n                         MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\n       Sheila Clark, who is proceeding pro se, alleges that her former employer, Federal\n\nEmergency Management Agency (“FEMA”), discriminated against her on the basis of race and\n\nretaliated against her for engaging in protected conduct, in violation of Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964. FEMA, which is a component of the Department of Homeland Security\n\n(“DHS”), revoked Clark’s security clearance and terminated her employment following\n\ninvestigations into alleged misconduct. The first investigation, which was conducted by FEMA,\n\narose from allegations made in an anonymous letter, and the second investigation—which\n\nFEMA referred to another component of DHS for investigation—arose from evidence of\n\nunrelated misconduct discovered in the course of the initial investigation. Clark alleges that she\n\nwas subjected to disparate treatment on the basis of her race during both investigations, and that\n\nin the second investigation, FEMA retaliated against her for filing Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity (“EEO”) and whistleblower complaints.\n\n       FEMA has moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on the grounds\n\nthat (1) all of Clark’s claims are non-justiciable because the Court cannot review matters related\n\fto Executive Branch security-clearance decisions, (2) Clark failed to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies with respect to some of her claims, and (3) Clark does not allege an adverse\n\nemployment action. See Dkt. 8. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant in part\n\nand deny in part FEMA’s motion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Clark, an African-American woman, worked as the Chief Component Human Capital\n\nOfficer for FEMA from December 26, 2010, until her termination on May 6, 2013. Compl. ¶¶ 4,\n\n14. According to her formal EEO complaint, Clark had been in federal service for twenty-eight\n\nyears, Dkt. 8-11 at 36, culminating in her “rank” as a member of the Senior Executive Service,\n\nid. at 25; Compl. ¶ 14. 1 Around December 12, 2011, however, the DHS Office of the Inspector\n\nGeneral (“OIG”) received an anonymous letter alleging misconduct by Clark and others. Id.\n\n¶ 16. (The nature of the alleged misconduct is not described in the complaint.) Although the\n\nOIG declined to investigate the allegations, FEMA’s Office of the Chief Security Officer\n\n(“OCSO”) began an investigation. Id. ¶ 17. In the course of that investigation, OCSO reviewed\n\nClark’s email and discovered evidence that Clark “may have [engaged in misconduct by]\n\nassist[ing] with the hiring of OSCO Special Agent Marvin Washington.” Id. ¶¶ 18, 26. In May\n\n2012, FEMA referred the allegations that Clark committed misconduct in the hiring of\n\n\n1 “In adjudicating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may consider, along\nwith the facts alleged in the complaint, ‘any documents either attached to or incorporated in the\ncomplaint and matters’ subject to ‘judicial notice.’” Nichols v. Vilsack, No. 13-01502, 2015 WL\n9581799, at *1 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 2015) (quoting EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117\nF.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). When Clark’s complaint in this action is read in combination\nwith her formal administrative complaint, which is referenced in her complaint, see Compl. ¶ 11,\nthe Court is able to discern the following factual allegations on which she premises her claims.\nSee Laughlin v. Holder, 923 F. Supp. 2d 204, 209 (D.D.C. 2013) (taking judicial notice of formal\nadministrative complaint that, “though not attached to [plaintiff’s] complaint, [is] referred to in\nthe complaint, . . . [is] integral to [plaintiff’s exhaustion of administrative remedies, and [is] [a]\npublic record[] subject to judicial notice” (internal citation omitted)).\n\n                                                  2\n\fWashington to another component of DHS, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’s\n\n(“USCIS”) Office of Security and Integrity (“OSI”), for investigation. Id. ¶ 26.\n\n       Between July 2012 and the end of August 2012, Clark was absent from work on medical\n\nleave. Dkt. 8-11 at 29. Clark nonetheless initiated the informal EEO process on July 24, 2012.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 10, 52; Dkt. 8-11 at 5 n.5. It appears that Clark’s initial complaints focused on\n\nmatters not at issue in this litigation. Dkt. 8-11 at 39. Over time, however, Clark supplemented\n\nher complaints, asserting, for example, that her supervisor had sought to discredit and demean\n\nher by telling “the entire office” that Clark was “under investigation and [that] the case [was]\n\nmov[ing] forward.” Dkt. 8-11 at 40, 45-46. Then, according to the complaint, on August 17,\n\n2012, Clark “made a whistleblower disclosure against FEMA leadership.” Compl. ¶ 27. The\n\ncomplaint does not reveal the nature of Clark’s disclosure.\n\n       The complaint further alleges that, on September 27, 2012, John Rooney, the selecting\n\nofficial for the OSCO special agent position for which Washington was hired, referred\n\nallegations relating to Clark’s conduct in assisting Washington to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for\n\nprosecution. Compl. ¶¶ 28, 70. In particular, one issue under investigation was whether Clark\n\nviolated the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, by disclosing certain agency records to Washington.\n\nAccording to Rooney, he made the referral at the request of the FEMA Office of Chief Counsel\n\nsimply to obtain a declination of prosecution in order to facilitate OCSA’s efforts to interview\n\nClark as part of its investigation. Dkt. 8-14 at 6. Clark disputes this account, Dkt. 18 at 47-49,\n\nbut all agree that the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute. On October 1, 2012, Clark\n\nwas detailed to a special human resources project for 120 days, Compl. ¶ 29; Dkt. 8-11 at 34, and\n\non October 3 and 4, 2012, she was interviewed by two USCIS special agents as part of the\n\nadministrative investigation, Compl. ¶ 45.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f        The day after she was interviewed, Clark filed a formal EEO complaint alleging that\n\nFEMA “engaged in an ongoing pattern and practice of discrimination and hostile work\n\nenvironment harassment toward [her] on the basis of [her] race (African American), color\n\n(brown complexion), sex (female), disability (perceived) and prior EEO activity.” Dkt. 8-11 at\n\n29. As relevant here, the EEO complaint alleged that Clark is “a member of FEMA’s senior\n\nleadership[,] yet [she] [is] continuously treated differently (disparate treatment).” Id. at 32.\n\nClark claimed that the allegations of “misconduct concerning” her assistance to Washington in\n\nthe FEMA hiring process “should have been handled through an independent investigation”\n\n“[p]er FEMA’s own policy,” but that, instead, FEMA ignored requirements applicable to\n\nadministrative investigations in order to “pursue a fishing/witch hunt expedition with no\n\nboundaries.” Id. at 33–34. Clark further alleged that “the entire [administrative investigation]\n\nprocess was inconsistent . . . [with] how other similarly situated executives are” treated; that she\n\nwas subjected to disparate treatment with respect to the October 3 and 4th interviews; that\n\n“Rooney’s actions did not follow FEMA’s normal practices (disparate treatment) or DHS policy\n\nin forwarding matters that they believe are criminal in nature to the DHS OIG to investigate;”\n\nand that she “believ[ed] [that she] was treated in this manner because [she is] an African-\n\nAmerican female.” Id. at 34–35. Clark also alleged that she was detailed to the special human\n\nresources project in retaliation for her EEO complaint. Dkt. 8-11 at 34.\n\n        At some point following the USCIS investigation, Clark was placed on administrative\n\nleave for twenty-two weeks. Id. ¶ 78. On December 6, 2012, her top secret security clearance\n\nwas suspended. Id. ¶ 79. Then, on May 6, 2013, Clark was removed from federal service “for\n\ninappropriate conduct,” id. ¶ 80, and on June 25, 2013, her security clearance was revoked, id.\n\n¶ 81.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f       Clark filed this suit on January 30, 2014. See Dkt. 1. Clark’s complaint alleges disparate\n\ntreatment in the course of FEMA’s investigation into the anonymous letter and disparate\n\ntreatment and retaliation with respect to the subsequent USCIS investigation. 2 With respect to\n\nthe investigation of the anonymous letter, Clark alleges that FEMA used the investigation as a\n\npretext to search her email and that, when non-African American employees were investigated,\n\ntheir emails were not searched. Compl. ¶¶ 18–23. She further alleges that the subsequent\n\nUSCIS investigation was conducted in retaliation for “her prior EEOC activity and\n\nwhistleblower disclosures” and that she was again subjected to disparate treatment in the course\n\nof that investigation. Id. ¶¶ 47–52.\n\n       With respect to disparate treatment in the USCIS investigation, Clark claims that\n\nUSCIS’s investigation of her was purportedly governed by the “USCIS OSI Investigations\n\nDivision Operational Guidance,” and that, in contrast, when non-African American employees\n\nare investigated, those investigations are conducted either by FEMA or the DHS OIG and the\n\ninvestigations are governed by FEMA regulations. Id. ¶¶ 46–50. She further alleges that she\n\nwas required to complete two sworn statements as part of the investigation, and that, in contrast,\n\nwhen non-African American employees are under investigation, they are either not interviewed\n\nat all or not required to provide statements under oath, id. ¶ 51, and that unlike in her case,\n\n“[w]hen allegations of . . . misconduct [involving] white employees are made, [those employees]\n\nare not detailed from their positions,” id. ¶ 30. Clark also points to several other claimed\n\n\n\n2  Although Clark’s allegations are included in a single count, that does not preclude the Court\nfrom treating them as raising more than one claim. See Nichols v. Vilsack, No. CV 13-01502\n(RDM), 2015 WL 9581799, at *9 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 2015) (“‘Although absence of segregation in\nthe complaint doubtless complicates the court’s task, the complication can presumably be cured\nby insistence on suitably targeted briefing, and is not an independent ground for’ treating the\nallegations as raising only discrete claims.” (quoting Baird v. Gotbaum, 662 F.3d 1246, 1253\n(D.C. Cir. 2011)).\n                                                  5\n\firregularities in the USCIS investigation, including that (1) she did not receive a Required\n\nAppearance Memorandum prior to being interviewed, id. ¶¶ 58, 64; (2) the misconduct\n\nallegations were not referred to the DHS OIG, id. ¶ 61; (3) she was not given an opportunity to\n\nreview or correct a transcript of the interview, id. ¶ 62; (4) she “was asked over 340 questions” in\n\nthe interview, id. ¶ 63; (5) she received a “Kalkines notice” 3 the day of the interview, id. ¶ 65;\n\n(6) the investigation was biased, id. ¶ 66; and (7) “[t]he USCIS investigators coerced statements\n\nfrom witnesses,” id. ¶ 67. Finally, Clark alleges that as a result of the purportedly discriminatory\n\nand retaliatory investigation, she was placed on administrative leave for twenty-two weeks, her\n\nsecurity clearance was suspended, she was removed from federal service, and her security\n\nclearance was revoked. Id. ¶¶ 77–81.\n\n       Rather than answer the complaint, FEMA moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for\n\nsummary judgment, appending various evidentiary exhibits to its motion—some of which were\n\npart of the EEO administrative record, and some of which were not. See Dkt. 8. Consistent with\n\nthe D.C. Circuit’s decision in Fox v. Strickland, 837 F.2d 507 (D.C. Cir. 1988), FEMA advised\n\nClark that her failure to respond to the motion could result in dismissal of her case. Dkt. 8 at 1.\n\nClark filed a memorandum opposing FEMA’s motion, but did not offer any additional evidence\n\nin support of her position and did not provide a statement of material facts in dispute, see Dkt.\n\n11, and FEMA filed its reply brief, see Dkt. 13. The Court then issued a Fox-Neal order further\n\ncautioning Clark about the need fully to respond to FEMA’s motion, including the need to\n\nidentify any contested issues of fact, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, and\n\nproviding Clark with an opportunity to file a supplemental response or opposition. Dkt. 15.\n\n\n\n3 See generally Kalkines v. United States, 473 F.2d 1391 (Cl. Ct. 1973) (invalidating employee\ndischarge for refusal to answer questions when investigator failed to advise employee that\nanswers and their fruits could not be used against him in criminal prosecution).\n                                                  6\n\fSee Dkt. 15 at 1; see also Fox v. Strickland, 837 F.2d 507 (D.C. Cir. 1988); Neal v. Kelly, 963\n\nF.2d 453 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Clark accepted this invitation and filed a revised opposition to\n\nFEMA’s motion on August 31, 2015, along with a statement of disputed facts and documentary\n\nevidence. 4 See Dkt. 18.\n\n                                 II.     LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must have ‘facial plausibility,’ meaning it\n\nmust ‘plead[ ] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\n\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.’” Hettinga v. United States, 677 F.3d 471, 476\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). “In evaluating a Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion, the Court must construe the complaint ‘in favor of the plaintiff, who must be\n\ngranted the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.’” Id. (quoting\n\nSchuler v. United States, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C.Cir.1979)). Furthermore, “a pro se complaint,\n\nhowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted\n\nby lawyers.” Abdelfattah v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 787 F.3d 524, 533 (D.C. Cir. 2015)\n\n(quoting Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007)). “The [C]ourt, however, need not accept as\n\ntrue a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation, or inferences . . . unsupported by the facts\n\nset out in the complaint.” Ames v. Johnson, 121 F. Supp. 3d 126, 129 (D.D.C. 2015) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted) (second alteration in original).\n\n       Summary judgment is appropriate when “the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986). “A fact is\n\n\n4 Because Clark included a statement of disputed facts in her revised opposition, the Court\nrejects FEMA’s argument (made before the Court issued its Fox-Neal order) that the Court\nshould treat FEMA’s statement of undisputed material as admitted. See Dkt. 13 at 2–3.\n\n                                                  7\n\fmaterial if it ‘might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,’ and a dispute about\n\na material fact is genuine ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for\n\nthe nonmoving party.’” Steele v. Schafer, 535 F.3d 689, 692 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quoting Liberty\n\nLobby, 477 U.S. at 248). “Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the\n\ndrawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge. . . . The\n\nevidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his\n\nfavor.” Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255. To prevail at summary judgment, the non-moving party\n\nmust, however, offer more than “a scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252.\n\n“[T]here must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.” Id.\n\n                                        III.    ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Justiciability\n\n       FEMA first contends that this case must be dismissed in its entirety because it involves\n\nnational security matters that are non-justiciable under Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). See\n\nDkt. 8 at 17. The Court reviews this portion of FEMA’s motion under the standards applicable\n\nto a motion to dismiss, as FEMA contends that “it is clear on the face of the complaint that”\n\nClark’s Title VII charges are barred under Egan and does not rely on any evidence outside the\n\ncomplaint in support of its non-justiciability argument. Dkt. 8 at 19; see also Dkt. 13 at 3–6.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit, moreover, has held that a motion to dismiss under Egan should be reviewed\n\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), and not for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).\n\nSee Oryszak v. Sullivan, 576 F.3d 522, 525 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (holding issue of non-justiciability\n\nunder Egan does not go to Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction); see also Ames v. Johnson, 121 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 126, 129 (D.D.C. 2015) (same); cf. Thomas v. Johnson, 4 F. Supp. 3d 157, 159–60\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f(D.D.C. 2014) (ruling on non-justiciability under Egan on motion for judgment on the pleadings\n\npursuant to Rule 12(c)). 5\n\n       In Egan, the Supreme Court held that the Merit Systems Protection Board (“MSPB”)\n\nlacked authority “to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security\n\nclearance,” id. at 520, “where the grant of security clearance to a particular employee [is] a\n\nsensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call . . . committed by law to the appropriate\n\nagency of the Executive Branch,” id. at 527. The Court explained that “the protection of\n\nclassified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible” and\n\nthat “it is not reasonably possible for an outside non[-]expert body to review the substance of\n\nsuch a judgment and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary\n\naffirmative prediction [of potential risk] with confidence.” Id. at 529.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit has applied Egan to bar Title VII claims challenging “an adverse\n\nemployment action based on denial or revocation of a security clearance.” Ryan v. Reno, 168\n\nF.3d 520, 524 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also Bennett v. Chertoff, 425 F.3d 999 (D.C. Cir. 2005). As\n\nit has explained, employment-discrimination cases are typically reviewed under the McDonnell\n\nDouglas burden-shifting framework, the second step of which requires “the defendant employer\n\nto articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action.” Ryan,\n\n168 F.3d at 523 (quoting Paquin v. Fed. Nat’l Mortg. Ass’n, 119 F.3d 23, 26 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).\n\n\n\n5  Any lingering confusion about whether Egan implicates the Court’s jurisdiction may stem\nfrom the fact that the D.C. Circuit has not addressed whether a defendant can waive an Egan\nissue, and relatedly, whether the Court should raise an Egan issue sua sponte. See Rattigan v.\nHolder (“Rattigan I”), 643 F.3d 975, 982 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (declining to reach whether the non-\njusticiability of a claim may be waived, citing Judge Ginsburg’s concurrence in Oryszak);\nOryszak, 576 F.3d at 526–27 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (arguing that although Egan does not\ndeprive a court of subject-matter jurisdiction, “a court must decline to adjudicate a non[-]\njusticiable claim even if the defendant does not move to dismiss it under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6)”). Neither of those considerations are at issue here.\n                                                 9\n\fAnd, in cases based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance, “a court cannot clear the\n\nsecond step of McDonnell Douglas without running smack up against Egan” because, when the\n\ngovernment’s proffered non-discriminatory reason pertains to national security, the plaintiff\n\n“c[an]not challenge the proffered reason’s authenticity without also challenging its validity.” Id.\n\nThus, under Egan, when the “district court . . . c[an]not proceed with the . . . discrimination\n\naction without reviewing the merits of [the] decision not to grant a clearance, the court [is]\n\nforeclosed from proceeding at all.” Id.\n\n       FEMA is thus correct to the extent that it argues that, under Egan and its progeny, Clark\n\ncannot challenge the suspension or revocation of her security clearance or decisions “tantamount\n\nto [security] clearance denials.” Id. at 524; see also Bland v. Johnson, 66 F. Supp. 3d 69, 73\n\n(D.D.C. 2014) (holding Egan applies to suspension of security clearance), rev’d in part on other\n\ngrounds, 637 F. App’x 2 (D.C. Cir. 2016). But FEMA’s argument that Egan “also bars review\n\nof related actions leading up to [the security clearance] decision,” see Dkt. 8 at 21, sweeps too\n\nbroadly. In support of that argument, FEMA relies on cases from other circuits holding that the\n\ninitiation of a security investigation and the “circumstances surrounding” a clearance revocation\n\nare unreviewable under Egan. Dkt. 8 at 21 (citing Hill v. White, 321 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2003);\n\nBecerra v. Dalton, 94 F.3d 145 (4th Cir. 1996); Panoke v. U.S. Army Military Police Brigade,\n\n307 Fed. App’x. 54 (9th Cir. 2009); Hall v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Admin. Review Bd., 476 F.3d\n\n847, 853 (10th Cir. 2007)). It is far from clear that these out-of-circuit precedents would support\n\nFEMA’s capacious reading of Egan. But, even if they did, “this Court is bound by D.C. Circuit\n\nprecedent.” See Burns-Ramirez v. Napolitano, 962 F. Supp. 2d 253, 257 (D.D.C. 2013)\n\n(rejecting contention that Hill, Becerra, and Panoke support broad rule of non-justiciability in\n\nthis Circuit). And, under the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Rattigan v. Holder (“Rattigan II”), “Egan\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f[does not] insulate[] from Title VII all decisions that might bear upon an employee’s eligibility\n\nto access classified information.” 689 F.3d 764, 767 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original).\n\n       As the Court of Appeals explained in Rattigan II, “Egan emphasized that the decision to\n\n. . . deny security clearance requires a ‘[p]redictive judgment’ that ‘must be made by those with\n\nthe necessary expertise in protecting classified information.’” Id. (quoting Egan, 484 U.S. at\n\n529). “It is this expert, predictive judgment made by ‘appropriately trained’ personnel that Egan\n\ninsulates from judicial review.” Id. (quoting Rattigan v. Holder (“Rattigan I”), 643 F.3d 975,\n\n983 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). From this general principle, the Court of Appeals derived two distinct\n\nrules. First, where a plaintiff challenges a “security clearance-related decision[] made by\n\ntrained” personnel, Egan imposes an “absolute bar on judicial review.” Id. at 768. Second, suit\n\nis also barred in cases in which “Title VII liability for security reporting claims w[ould] impair\n\nthe ability of the [responsible officials] to [perform their duties] by ‘chill[ing] the timely and\n\nadequate reporting of security issues.’” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike\n\nchallenges to security clearance-related decisions themselves, however, this latter rule is not\n\nabsolute; in particular, because a “knowingly false reporting present[s] no serious risk of chill,”\n\npermitting Title VII claims in those circumstances “can coexist with Egan” and the Executive\n\nOrder on access to classified information. Id. at 770. Stated more broadly, the second rule\n\nrecognizes that Title VII litigation that does not directly challenge the revocation or suspension\n\nof a security clearance may implicate national security concerns and the discretion and expertise\n\nof the Executive Branch to assess who should have access to classified information. See\n\nExecutive Order 12,986. But because decisions or actions of that type do not trigger the absolute\n\nbar imposed in Egan, “the limits . . . place[d] on Title VII liability for [these] other decisions\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fmust be no broader than necessary to protect the integrity of the [agency’s] security clearance-\n\nrelated responsibilities.” Rattigan II, 689 F.3d at 771 (emphasis in original). 6\n\n       The Court, accordingly, agrees with FEMA that Egan precludes Clark from challenging\n\nthe suspension and revocation of her security clearance. But, at least at this juncture, FEMA has\n\nnot shown that adjudication of Clark’s other claims would chill any of the processes—including\n\nthe reporting of security concerns—contemplated by Executive Order 12,986 or that it would\n\notherwise interfere with “the integrity of [Executive Branch’s] security clearance-related\n\nresponsibilities.” In her opposition, Clark explains that she seeks to challenge the disparate\n\ntreatment that she allegedly received during the investigation of the misconduct allegations\n\nagainst her—including the interview procedures, departures from FEMA regulations, and the\n\ndetail from her position—and that she believes this treatment was retaliatory. See Dkt. 18 at 1–2.\n\nAdjudication of these claims “merely requires consideration of whether similarly situated\n\nemployees were treated the same under the relevant policies, a consideration that lies squarely\n\nwithin the Court’s Title VII jurisdiction.” Thomas, 4 F. Supp. 3d at 160. Indeed, it is unclear\n\nthat these claims even implicate the substance of the allegations made against Clark. Similarly,\n\nit is difficult to understand—and FEMA has failed to elucidate—how FEMA’s decision to assign\n\nClark to a 120-day detail before her clearance was suspended or revoked has anything to do with\n\nExecutive Order 12,968 or the discretion of the Executive Branch to make security-clearance\n\ndecisions free from judicial interference.\n\n\n\n\n6 FEMA contends that Rattigan I and Rattigan II are simply inapplicable here because “the\nplaintiff in Rattigan had received a ‘favorable’ security clearance decision,” whereas Clark “did\nnot receive a ‘favorable’ security clearance decision.” Dkt. 8 at 22 n.2. “While it is true that Mr.\nRattigan’s security clearance was not revoked, the reasoning of Rattigan I and II was not in any\nway based on this fact.” Burns-Ramirez v. Napolitano, 962 F. Supp. 2d 253, 257 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n                                                  12\n\f       This is not to say that FEMA is necessarily foreclosed from pursuing its broader Egan\n\ndefense. If FEMA can demonstrate, for example, that the steps the agency took against Clark\n\nwere based on predictive judgments about national security made by “those with the necessary\n\nexpertise in protecting classified information” Rattigan II, 689 F.3d at 767 (quoting Egan, 484\n\nU.S. at 529), it would have solid basis for re-asserting the defense. But, as the record now\n\nstands, there is no basis to conclude that any such judgments informed any of FEMA’s actions\n\nother than its ultimate suspension and revocation of Clark’s top secret clearance. And if Clark\n\nsuffered an adverse action based on a violation of a generally applicable policy, rather than based\n\non a national-security determination, Egan would not bar her claims. Compare, e.g., Ames, 121\n\nF. Supp. 3d at 132 (explaining that Egan arguably would not bar a claim where plaintiff was\n\nsuspended for “adjudicat[ing] a security clearance under a ‘conflict of interest’” because “[s]he\n\neither operated under a conflict of interest or she did not”), Jones v. Ashcroft, 321 F. Supp. 2d 1,\n\n8 (D.D.C. 2004) (FBI’s suitability determination not subject to Egan because it was “distinct\n\nfrom national security determinations”), and Thomas, 4 F. Supp. 3d at 160 (finding Egan\n\ninapplicable because “Plaintiff’s demotion is not alleged to have been ‘based on’ any decision\n\nregarding his eligibility for a security clearance. Instead [he] alleges that he was demoted based\n\non (among other things) his purported violation of a general policy . . . .”), with Bennett, 425\n\nF.3d at 1003 (holding Egan applicable where government offered sworn statement that plaintiff’s\n\n“termination was ‘due to her inability to sustain a security clearance’”). For present purposes,\n\nhowever, the Court must reject FEMA’s contention that it is “clear on the face of the complaint”\n\nthat Egan bars all of Clark’s claims. Dkt. 8 at 19\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss with prejudice Clark’s complaint to the\n\nextent that it seeks to challenge the suspension and revocation of her security clearance, see\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fCompl. ¶¶ 79, 81, but, on the present record, will decline to dismiss the remainder of the\n\ncomplaint as non-justiciable.\n\nB.     Exhaustion\n\n       Next, FEMA alleges that Clark failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to\n\nsome of her claims. See Dkt. 8 at 28–29. “Exhaustion is required in order to give federal\n\nagencies an opportunity to handle matters internally whenever possible and to ensure that the\n\nfederal courts are burdened only when reasonably necessary.” Brown v. Marsh, 777 F.2d 8, 14\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1985). A Title VII complainant must timely exhaust administrative proceedings\n\nbefore filing suit in federal court, although the limits are not jurisdictional and “are subject to\n\nequitable tolling, estoppel, and waiver.” Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433, 437 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1997). Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense, which is typically resolved at summary\n\njudgment. See Nichols, 2015 WL 9581799, at *7. Although it is unclear that FEMA’s\n\nexhaustion motion requires consideration of any material beyond “the pleadings and undisputed\n\n[administrative] documents in the record,” see id. (quoting Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d at\n\n437; Dkt. 18 at 23–35, the Court will, out of an abundance of caution, resolve this portion of\n\nFEMA’s motion under the summary judgment standard.\n\n       The EEOC has promulgated detailed regulations establishing administrative procedures\n\nfor the resolution of Title VII employment discrimination claims against federal agencies. The\n\nD.C. Circuit has summarized those procedures as follows:\n\n       Under Title VII, [federal] employees who believe they have been discriminated\n       against must first consult an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Counselor\n       within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory acts. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1).\n       Should the employee and the Counselor fail to resolve the discrimination claim\n       within 30 days, the Counselor sends the employee a notice explaining the\n       administrative complaint procedure. Id. § 1614.105(d). The employee then has 15\n       days to file an individual and/or class complaint with the employing agency. Id.\n       § 1614.106 (regulations governing individual complaints); id. § 1614.204\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f       (regulations governing class complaints); see also id. § 1614.103 (noting types of\n       complaints governed by agency processing procedures outlined in regulations).\n       Upon receipt of a final agency decision—known as a “FAD”—disposing of the\n       administrative complaints, the employee has either 30 days to appeal to the Equal\n       Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), id. §§ 1614.401(a), 1614.402(a),\n       or 90 days to file suit in federal court, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c).\n\nIn re James, 444 F.3d 643, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2006). An employee is also authorized to file suit in\n\nfederal court if, as here, 180 days have passed from the “date of filing an appeal with the” EEOC\n\nand the EEOC has failed to render a final decision. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c); 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.407(d).\n\n       The following facts regarding Clark’s efforts to exhaust her administrative remedies are\n\nundisputed. The parties agree that Clark initiated EEO counseling on July 24, 2012 and\n\namended her informal complaint twice, once on August 1, 2012, and again on September 10,\n\n2012. See Dkt. 8 at 5 (Def.’s SUMF ¶ 13); Dkt. 18 at 40 (“Clark accepts Def. Fact[] . . . [¶] 13).\n\nThey agree that she filed her formal EEO complaint on October 5, 2012, see Dkt. 18 at 6 (Def.’s\n\nSUMF ¶ 19); Compl. ¶ 11; Dkt. 18 at 51, although the agency’s EEO office did not accept the\n\ncomplaint for investigation until February 11, 2013, see Dkt. 8 at 27; Dkt. 18 at 51. They also\n\nagree that when Clark filed this suit on January 30, 2014, 180 days had transpired without final\n\nagency action on her EEO complaint. See Dkt. 8 at 7 (Def.’s SUMF ¶ 21); Dkt 18 at 53.\n\nFinally, the parties agree that on May 30, 2013, Clark appealed her termination to the MSPB—a\n\nmixed-case appeal in which she alleges both that she did not commit misconduct and that her\n\ntermination was discriminatory and retaliatory—and that as of February 29, 2014, the MSPB\n\nadministrative judge had not issued a decision on the appeal. See Dkt. 8 at 9 (Def.’s SUMF\n\n¶ 30); Dkt. 8-12 at 1–4; Dkt. 18 at 40 (“Clark accepts Def. Fact[] . . . ¶ 30); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.302(a)(2) (“A mixed case appeal is an appeal filed with the MSPB that alleges that an\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fappealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis\n\nof race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, or genetic information.”).\n\n        The parties dispute, however, whether the EEO proceedings encompassed the claims\n\nraised in this action and, for that matter, what claims Clark is raising here. According to FEMA,\n\nClark has failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to her allegations that:\n\n        (1) FEMA engages in a pattern and practice of systemic discrimination against\n        African Americans; (2) the investigation of Plaintiff’s misconduct that USCIS\n        conducted on behalf of FEMA OSCO was discriminatory and retaliatory; and (3)\n        as a result of the discriminatory investigation, Plaintiff was (a) placed on\n        administrative leave . . . ; (b) her security clearance was suspended . . . ; (c) she was\n        removed from the [f]ederal service . . . ; (d) her security clearance was revoked . . . .\n\nDkt. 8 at 29 (internal citations omitted). FEMA concedes that Clark exhausted claims regarding\n\n“her detail to work on a special project in October 2012; FEMA’s investigation of anonymous\n\nallegations that she committed misconduct; her treatment relating to an October 3–4, 2012\n\ninterview by USCIS; and the forwarding of her misconduct case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in\n\nSeptember 2012.” Dkt. 8 at 28 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Clark responds that FEMA has misinterpreted her claims and that, by redefining her\n\nclaims, it has incorrectly “infer[e]d that she has not exhausted the administrative process.” Dkt.\n\n18 at 21. According to Clark, she is currently challenging only FEMA’s failure to follow its own\n\nregulations, policies and procedures in the misconduct investigation, see Dkt. 18 at 21; the\n\n“punitive detail,” id. at 27; and disparate treatment with respect to the interview by USCIS\n\nofficers, id. See also id. at 1–2.\n\n        Clark, of course, is the master of her own complaint, and, in light of her response, the\n\nCourt construes her complaint as not raising a systemic discrimination claim; to the extent she\n\nincludes allegations of disparate treatment of other African-American employees, see Compl.\n\n¶¶ 20–23, 30–43, the Court will construe these allegations as providing general background and\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fsupport for Clark’s allegations that she was the victim of racial discrimination. The Court also\n\nneed not address FEMA’s contention that Clark failed to exhaust her challenge to the suspension\n\nand revocation of her security clearance because, as explained above, any such allegations are in\n\nany event non-justiciable. See supra pp. 8–14.\n\n       As for FEMA’s contention that Clark has failed to exhaust administrative remedies\n\nregarding her placement on administrative leave and her subsequent termination, it is unclear\n\nwhether Clark even intends to pursue a challenge to either of these actions here. Although her\n\ncomplaint states that her placement on leave and subsequent termination resulted from the\n\nallegedly discriminatory and retaliatory misconduct investigation, see Compl. ¶¶ 78, 80, the bulk\n\nof the complaint focuses on the alleged disparate treatment and retaliation in the course of the\n\ninvestigation and her placement on detail, see id. ¶¶ 14–77. In addition, as noted above, Clark’s\n\nopposition brief frames her case as a challenge to the “regulations, policy and procedure” that\n\nFEMA followed in its investigation, to FEMA’s decision to detail Clark to a special human\n\nresources project for 120 days, and to the manner in which FEMA conducted her interview on\n\nOctober 3 and 4, 2012. See Dkt. 18 at 1–2. Moreover, Clark has sought to exhaust a challenge\n\nto her termination in a separate mixed-case complaint filed with the MSPB, and she has never\n\nsuggested that she intends to incorporate the grievances that she has raised with the MSPB into\n\nthis action. See Dkt. 8-12 at 1–4; Compl. ¶¶ 10–13 (stating that Clark exhausted her\n\nadministrative remedies in the 2012 EEO proceeding); Dkt. 8 at 9 (SUMF ¶ 30) (“The MSPB\n\nAdministrative Judge has not yet issued an initial decision on the appeal”); Dkt. 18 at 40 (“Clark\n\naccepts Def. Fact[] . . . [¶] 30”). To the contrary, FEMA reports that at least as of February\n\n2014—after this action was filed—the parties were still actively litigating the MSPB case. Dkt. 8\n\nat 34 n.5\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f        In any event, to the extent that Clark is alleging—in this action—that her placement on\n\nadministrative leave or her termination were discriminatory and retaliatory adverse actions, she\n\ndid not administratively exhaust those claims in the 2012 EEO proceedings. “Where an\n\nemployee alleges discrete claims of discrimination [or retaliation], such as a failure to promote or\n\na demotion[,] . . . the employee must exhaust administrative remedies for each discrete claim.”\n\nAchagzai v. Broad. Bd. of Governors, No. 14-768, 2016 WL 1089214, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 18,\n\n2016), reconsideration denied, No. 14-768, 2016 WL 2642959 (D.D.C. May 9, 2016). Clark did\n\nnot raise her placement on administrative leave or her termination in her October 5, 2012 EEO\n\ncomplaint, and, in fact, her administrative complaint preceded those events. See Dkt. 8 at 5–9,\n\n(Def.’s SUMF ¶¶ 13, 19, 21, 24, 29, 30); Compl. ¶ 11; Dkt. 18 at 40, 51. Nor did Clark\n\nsubsequently amend her EEO complaint to include those events. Cf. Weber v. Battista, 494 F.3d\n\n179, 184 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (holding plaintiff can exhaust subsequently occurring, related claims\n\nby amending formal EEO complaint).\n\n        Although before the Supreme Court’s decision in National Railroad Passenger Corp. v.\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), a “plaintiff [could] pursue an unexhausted claim if that claim was\n\n‘like or reasonably related to the allegations of [an] [exhausted] charge and grow[s] out of such\n\nallegations,’ . . . [m]ost district court decisions in this circuit have concluded that this rule did not\n\nsurvive Morgan.” Achagzai v. Broad. Bd. of Governors, No. 14-768, 2016 WL 471274, at *6\n\n(D.D.C. Feb. 8, 2016) (citing Rashad v. Wash. Metro Area Transit. Auth., 945 F. Supp. 2d 152,\n\n166 (D.D.C. 2013)). Rather, following Morgan, “the procedural requirements of Title VII . . .\n\nmust be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis and . . . satisfaction of the procedural requirements\n\nfor a ‘relate[d]’ act of discrimination is insufficient, except in those cases in which the ‘very\n\nnature’ of the claim ‘involves repeated conduct.’” Hargrove v. AARP, No. 13-1320 (RDM), slip\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fop. at 35 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2016) (quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114-15)). To the extent Clark\n\nseeks to pursue claims for wrongful termination or suspension, those claims would fall squarely\n\nin the category of discrete acts of alleged discrimination requiring separate exhaustion. See\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. at 114 (“Discrete acts” include actions “such as termination, failure to\n\npromote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire”). Because Clark has failed to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to these claims, she may not pursue them in this\n\nproceeding. Id.\n\n       The Court also concludes that Clark failed to exhaust her claim that “FEMA did not\n\ninvestigate the allegations of misconduct against [her] in accordance with regulations, policy and\n\nprocedures.’” Dkt. 18 at 2. FEMA contends that Clark failed to “advise the EEO Counselor that\n\nshe believed the USCIS investigation itself to be discriminatory,” citing the EEO counselor’s\n\nreport of investigation. Dkt. 8 at 32. At the informal counseling stage, the employee need not\n\n“expressly identify . . . the precise action or legal theory that she thereafter raised in her formal\n\nEEO complaint and in her district court complaint,” because counseling is intended to be “‘a step\n\ntoward remediation’” rather than “‘a trap for unwary counselees.’” Miles v. Kerry, 961 F. Supp.\n\n2d 272, 287 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Artis v. Bernanke, 630 F.3d 1031, 1034–35 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011)). But the informal counseling process initiated by the employee must be sufficient to\n\nachieve the purpose of the counseling requirement—that is, “to enable the agency and its\n\nemployee to try to informally resolve the matter before an administrative charge is filed.” Id.\n\n(quoting Artis, 630 F.3d at 1034). Here, the undisputed facts establish that Clark failed to meet\n\neven that low bar.\n\n        The counselor’s report cited by FEMA contains no indication that Clark ever mentioned\n\nor raised any failure of the USCIS investigators to comply with FEMA regulations and\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fprocedures. See Dkt. 8-11 at 38–70. Rather, Clark discussed with the counselor allegations that\n\na supervisor named Carla Gammon created a hostile work environment by requiring Clark to\n\nprovide additional documentation of her medical leave. Dkt. 8-11 at 38–44. Clark then amended\n\nher informal complaint to assert that Gammon also violated her rights under Title VII by telling\n\nClark’s staff that Clark was under investigation and that a work experience survey was\n\nconducted in a discriminatory and retaliatory manner. See Dkt. 8-11 at 45–48.\n\n       Had Clark identified any evidence disputing FEMA’ characterization of the issues she\n\nraised in the counseling process, the Court might well conclude that summary judgment is not\n\nwarranted. See, e.g., Steele v. Schafer, 535 F.3d 689, 693 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (reversing grant of\n\nsummary judgment on non-exhaustion grounds where record reflected “discrepancy” as to\n\nwhether employee contacted EEO counselor on an additional occasion). But, avoiding summary\n\njudgment requires that the non-movant identify actual countervailing evidence. Indeed, the\n\nCourt cautioned Clark before offering her the opportunity to file a supplemental opposition that,\n\nonce the moving party produces evidence “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\n\nand [that] [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,” the non-moving party must then point\n\nto evidence that there is in fact a genuine dispute of fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Dkt. 15 at 2.\n\nYet, despite receiving an opportunity to supplement her opposition, Clark offers no evidence or\n\nargument that the EEO counselor’s report and informal complaints proffered by FEMA provide\n\nan inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading account of the issues she raised with the counselor.\n\nSee, e.g., Dkt. 18 at 40, 46 (Pl.’s SUMF, accepting “as written” FEMA’s account of her contact\n\nwith an EEO counselor). And the Court’s own review of the record does not reveal a “scintilla\n\nof evidence” of a disputed issue of fact on the matter. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252. The\n\nCourt, accordingly, concludes that, at the counseling stage, Clark raised entirely different\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fallegations than those she raises here, preventing the “‘counseling [from] produc[ing] sufficient\n\ninformation to enable the agency to investigate the claim.’” Miles, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 287\n\n(quoting Artis, 630 F.3d at 1035)); cf. Koch v. Walter, 935 F. Supp. 2d 143, 151 (D.D.C. 2013)\n\n(“To satisfy the counseling requirement, an employee must present claims “in a manner that\n\nlends itself to potential resolution. . . . [P]roviding the agency with bare ‘notice’ of the basis of a\n\ncomplaint during the counseling stage is not enough.” (quoting Artis v. Greenspan, 158 F.3d\n\n1301, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Clark failed to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to challenges to her placement on administrative leave and\n\nsuspension (to the extent Clark even seeks to raise such a claim here), and with respect to her\n\nclaim that FEMA engaged in retaliation and disparate treatment by failing to follow FEMA\n\nregulations and procedures during the course of the misconduct investigation.\n\nC.      Adverse Action\n\n        Finally, FEMA contends that Clark’s “claims (i.e., other than her removal) do not meet\n\nthe legal standards for a materially adverse action.” Dkt. 8 at 37. In light of the Court’s rulings\n\nwith respect to non-justiciability and exhaustion, the Court will address only whether Clark has\n\nalleged a sufficient adverse action with respect to her claims regarding the detail and the October\n\n3 and 4 USCIS interviews. See Dkt. 18 at 27 (Clark’s description of her claims); see also Dkt. 8\n\nat 27–28 (FEMA’s concession that such claims were administratively exhausted). Because\n\nFEMA relies on evidence outside the administrative record in arguing that the detail did not\n\nconstitute a materially adverse action, the Court applies the summary judgment standard in\n\nevaluating this defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f        To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment under Title VII, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that “(1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he suffered an adverse employment\n\naction, and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination.” Forkkio v.\n\nPowell, 306 F.3d 1127, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 2002). An adverse employment action is a “diminution\n\nin pay or benefits” or “some other materially adverse consequences affecting the terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of her employment or her future employment opportunities such that a\n\nreasonable trier of fact could conclude that the plaintiff has suffered objectively tangible harm.”\n\nBrown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 457 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Thus, while “hiring, firing, failing to\n\npromote, [and] reassignment with significantly different responsibilities categorically are adverse\n\nemployment actions,” Douglas v. Donovan, 559 F.3d 549, 556 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (alteration in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted), “[p]urely subjective injuries, such as dissatisfaction\n\nwith a reassignment . . . or public humiliation or loss or reputation, . . . are not adverse actions,”\n\nForkkio, 306 F.3d at 1130–31. The question is not whether an employer has taken an action that\n\nmakes “an employee unhappy,” Russell v. Principi, 257 F.3d 815, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001), but\n\nwhether the action resulted in a “significant” and “objectively tangible” harm, Douglas, 559 F.3d\n\nat 552 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        A prima facie case of retaliation also requires the plaintiff to show that she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action. In retaliation cases, however, “the adverse action concept has a\n\nbroader meaning” than in discrimination cases. Baird v. Gotbaum, 662 F.3d 1246, 1249 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[A]ctions giving rise to [retaliation] claims are\n\n‘not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment,’ but\n\nreach any harm that ‘well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting\n\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fa charge of discrimination.’” Id. (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S.\n\n53, 64 (2006)).\n\n       With respect to Clark’s contention that her detail to the special human resources project\n\nconstituted an adverse action, FEMA responds that the assignment was only temporary—it was\n\nfor 120 days, Compl. ¶ 29; Dkt. 8-11 at 34—and that it did not affect Clark’s grade, salary, or\n\nSES status, see Dkt. 8 at 6 (Def.’s SUMF ¶ 17). Clark does not dispute this. See Dkt. 18 at 49–\n\n50 (Clark’s “clarification” in response to Def.’s SUMF ¶ 17, stating only that Clark tried to tell\n\nher supervisor that she did not want to be detailed, but that her supervisor was out of the office).\n\nBut, there remains a disputed issue of fact as to whether the detail was the equivalent of a\n\n“reassignment with significantly different responsibilities[,] [which] . . . generally indicates an\n\nadverse action.” Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 902 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Forkkio, 306\n\nF.3d at 1131). Clark alleges that the detail was “for the purpose of demeaning [her] and\n\nreliev[ing] her of her duties as the head of human resources,” Compl. ¶ 44, and, while Gammon\n\navers that it was a detail to “an existing major project” involving an analysis of outsourcing, Dkt.\n\n8-11 at 138, Clark contends that “[t]he project did not require 8 hours of work daily” yet became\n\nher “only duty at a SES pay level,” id. at 88. On the present record, the Court cannot determine\n\nwhether, despite “never suffer[ing] a reduction in grade, pay, or benefits,” Clark nonetheless\n\n“experience[d] an extraordinary reduction in responsibilities . . . from which a reasonable jury\n\ncould conclude [that she] suffered ‘objectively tangible harm.’” Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 902.\n\n       Clark also argues that aspects of her October 3 and 4 USCIS interview constituted\n\nadverse action. In particular, she points to the following alleged irregularities in the interview:\n\n(1) she was required to complete two sworn statements, Compl. ¶ 51; (2) she did not receive a\n\nRequired Appearance Memorandum prior to being interviewed, id. ¶¶ 58, 64; (3) she was not\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fgiven an opportunity to review or correct a transcript of the interview, id. ¶ 62; (4) she “was\n\nasked over 340 questions,” id. ¶ 63; (5) she received a Kalkines notice the day of the interview,\n\nid. ¶ 65; (6) the investigation was biased, id. ¶ 66; and (7) “[t]he USCIS investigators coerced\n\nstatements from witnesses,” id. ¶ 67. With respect to disparate treatment claims, a “[m]ere\n\ninvestigation[] by plaintiff’s employer”—much less an interview during such an investigation—\n\n“cannot constitute an adverse action because they have no adverse effect on plaintiff’s\n\nemployment.” Mack v. Strauss, 134 F. Supp. 2d 103, 114 (D.D.C. 2001), aff’d, No. 01-5122,\n\n2001 WL 1286263 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 28, 2001). That is, “although the discipline imposed as a\n\nresult of an investigation may have a sufficiently adverse effect on plaintiff’s employment to be\n\nactionable, the mere initiation of the investigation does not.” Ware v. Billington, 344 F. Supp. 2d\n\n63, 76 (D.D.C. 2004). And in this case, as explained above, Clark has failed to exhaust a\n\nchallenge to her placement on administrative leave and termination, which allegedly resulted\n\nfrom the misconduct investigation. See supra pp. 17–19.\n\n       Finally, although “the prospect of . . . an investigation” may in some circumstances be\n\nsufficiently harmful to “dissuade a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination”—that is, it may constitute an adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim,\n\nVelikonja v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 122, 124 (D.C. Cir. 2006)—Clark has not adduced any\n\ncompetent evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the foregoing alleged\n\nprocedural irregularities in the October 3 and 4th interviews rose to such a level, cf. Rattigan I,\n\n643 F.3d at 986 (“[R]eferral [for security investigation] alone created the very real possibility not\n\nonly that Rattigan would face a stressful and potentially reputation-damaging investigation, but\n\nalso that the FBI would revoke his security clearance and terminate his employment.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f       The Court, accordingly, denies summary judgment to FEMA with respect to Clark’s\n\nchallenge to her detail, but grants summary judgment to FEMA with respect to her challenge to\n\nthe October 3 and 4 interviews.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS dismissal with prejudice to FEMA to the\n\nextent that Clark seeks to challenge the suspension or revocation of her security clearance. The\n\nCourt also GRANTS summary judgment to FEMA on Clark’s remaining claims, with the\n\nexception of Clark’s challenge to her October 1, 2012 detail. On the latter claim, summary\n\njudgment is DENIED.\n\n       SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                    /s/ Randolph D.

FEMA, which is a component of the Department of Homeland Security\n\n(“DHS”), revoked Clark’s security clearance and terminated her employment following\n\ninvestigations into alleged misconduct. The first investigation, which was conducted by FEMA,\n\narose from allegations made in an anonymous letter, and the second investigation—which\n\nFEMA referred to another component of DHS for investigation—arose from evidence of\n\nunrelated misconduct discovered in the course of the initial investigation. Clark alleges that she\n\nwas subjected to disparate treatment on the basis of her race during both investigations, and that\n\nin the second investigation, FEMA retaliated against her for filing Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity (“EEO”) and whistleblower complaints.\n\n       FEMA has moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on the grounds\n\nthat (1) all of Clark’s claims are non-justiciable because the Court cannot review matters related\n\fto Executive Branch security-clearance decisions, (2) Clark failed to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies with respect to some of her claims, and (3) Clark does not allege an adverse\n\nemployment action. See Dkt. 8. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant in part\n\nand deny in part FEMA’s motion.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Clark, an African-American woman, worked as the Chief Component Human Capital\n\nOfficer for FEMA from December 26, 2010, until her termination on May 6, 2013. Compl. ¶¶ 4,\n\n14. According to her formal EEO complaint, Clark had been in federal service for twenty-eight\n\nyears, Dkt. 8-11 at 36, culminating in her “rank” as a member of the Senior Executive Service,\n\nid. at 25; Compl. ¶ 14. 1 Around December 12, 2011, however, the DHS Office of the Inspector\n\nGeneral (“OIG”) received an anonymous letter alleging misconduct by Clark and others. Id.\n\n¶ 16. (The nature of the alleged misconduct is not described in the complaint.) Although the\n\nOIG declined to investigate the allegations, FEMA’s Office of the Chief Security Officer\n\n(“OCSO”) began an investigation. Id. ¶ 17. In the course of that investigation, OCSO reviewed\n\nClark’s email and discovered evidence that Clark “may have [engaged in misconduct by]\n\nassist[ing] with the hiring of OSCO Special Agent Marvin Washington.” Id. ¶¶ 18, 26. In May\n\n2012, FEMA referred the allegations that Clark committed misconduct in the hiring of\n\n\n1 “In adjudicating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may consider, along\nwith the facts alleged in the complaint, ‘any documents either attached to or incorporated in the\ncomplaint and matters’ subject to ‘judicial notice.’” Nichols v.

When Clark’s complaint in this action is read in combination\nwith her formal administrative complaint, which is referenced in her complaint, see Compl. ¶ 11,\nthe Court is able to discern the following factual allegations on which she premises her claims.\nSee Laughlin v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. ¶ 26.\n\n       Between July 2012 and the end of August 2012, Clark was absent from work on medical\n\nleave. Dkt. 8-11 at 29. Clark nonetheless initiated the informal EEO process on July 24, 2012.\n\nCompl. ¶¶ 10, 52; Dkt. 8-11 at 5 n.5. It appears that Clark’s initial complaints focused on\n\nmatters not at issue in this litigation. Dkt. 8-11 at 39. Over time, however, Clark supplemented\n\nher complaints, asserting, for example, that her supervisor had sought to discredit and demean\n\nher by telling “the entire office” that Clark was “under investigation and [that] the case [was]\n\nmov[ing] forward.” Dkt. 8-11 at 40, 45-46. Then, according to the complaint, on August 17,\n\n2012, Clark “made a whistleblower disclosure against FEMA leadership.” Compl. ¶ 27. The\n\ncomplaint does not reveal the nature of Clark’s disclosure.\n\n       The complaint further alleges that, on September 27, 2012, John Rooney, the selecting\n\nofficial for the OSCO special agent position for which Washington was hired, referred\n\nallegations relating to Clark’s conduct in assisting Washington to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for\n\nprosecution. Compl. ¶¶ 28, 70. In particular, one issue under investigation was whether Clark\n\nviolated the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, by disclosing certain agency records to Washington.\n\nAccording to Rooney, he made the referral at the request of the FEMA Office of Chief Counsel\n\nsimply to obtain a declination of prosecution in order to facilitate OCSA’s efforts to interview\n\nClark as part of its investigation. Dkt. 8-14 at 6. Clark disputes this account, Dkt. 18 at 47-49,\n\nbut all agree that the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to prosecute. On October 1, 2012, Clark\n\nwas detailed to a special human resources project for 120 days, Compl. ¶ 29; Dkt. 8-11 at 34, and\n\non October 3 and 4, 2012, she was interviewed by two USCIS special agents as part of the\n\nadministrative investigation, Compl. ¶ 45.\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f        The day after she was interviewed, Clark filed a formal EEO complaint alleging that\n\nFEMA “engaged in an ongoing pattern and practice of discrimination and hostile work\n\nenvironment harassment toward [her] on the basis of [her] race (African American), color\n\n(brown complexion), sex (female), disability (perceived) and prior EEO activity.” Dkt. 8-11 at\n\n29. As relevant here, the EEO complaint alleged that Clark is “a member of FEMA’s senior\n\nleadership[,] yet [she] [is] continuously treated differently (disparate treatment).” Id. at 32.\n\nClark claimed that the allegations of “misconduct concerning” her assistance to Washington in\n\nthe FEMA hiring process “should have been handled through an independent investigation”\n\n“[p]er FEMA’s own policy,” but that, instead, FEMA ignored requirements applicable to\n\nadministrative investigations in order to “pursue a fishing/witch hunt expedition with no\n\nboundaries.” Id. at 33–34. Clark further alleged that “the entire [administrative investigation]\n\nprocess was inconsistent . . . [with] how other similarly situated executives are” treated; that she\n\nwas subjected to disparate treatment with respect to the October 3 and 4th interviews; that\n\n“Rooney’s actions did not follow FEMA’s normal practices (disparate treatment) or DHS policy\n\nin forwarding matters that they believe are criminal in nature to the DHS OIG to investigate;”\n\nand that she “believ[ed] [that she] was treated in this manner because [she is] an African-\n\nAmerican female.” Id. at 34–35. Clark also alleged that she was detailed to the special human\n\nresources project in retaliation for her EEO complaint. Dkt. 8-11 at 34.\n\n        At some point following the USCIS investigation, Clark was placed on administrative\n\nleave for twenty-two weeks. Id. ¶ 78. On December 6, 2012, her top secret security clearance\n\nwas suspended. Id. ¶ 79. Then, on May 6, 2013, Clark was removed from federal service “for\n\ninappropriate conduct,” id. ¶ 80, and on June 25, 2013, her security clearance was revoked, id.\n\n¶ 81.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f       Clark filed this suit on January 30, 2014. See Dkt. 1. Clark’s complaint alleges disparate\n\ntreatment in the course of FEMA’s investigation into the anonymous letter and disparate\n\ntreatment and retaliation with respect to the subsequent USCIS investigation. 2 With respect to\n\nthe investigation of the anonymous letter, Clark alleges that FEMA used the investigation as a\n\npretext to search her email and that, when non-African American employees were investigated,\n\ntheir emails were not searched. Compl. ¶¶ 18–23. She further alleges that the subsequent\n\nUSCIS investigation was conducted in retaliation for “her prior EEOC activity and\n\nwhistleblower disclosures” and that she was again subjected to disparate treatment in the course\n\nof that investigation. Id. ¶¶ 47–52.\n\n       With respect to disparate treatment in the USCIS investigation, Clark claims that\n\nUSCIS’s investigation of her was purportedly governed by the “USCIS OSI Investigations\n\nDivision Operational Guidance,” and that, in contrast, when non-African American employees\n\nare investigated, those investigations are conducted either by FEMA or the DHS OIG and the\n\ninvestigations are governed by FEMA regulations. Id. ¶¶ 46–50. She further alleges that she\n\nwas required to complete two sworn statements as part of the investigation, and that, in contrast,\n\nwhen non-African American employees are under investigation, they are either not interviewed\n\nat all or not required to provide statements under oath, id. ¶ 51, and that unlike in her case,\n\n“[w]hen allegations of . . . misconduct [involving] white employees are made, [those employees]\n\nare not detailed from their positions,” id. ¶ 30. Clark also points to several other claimed\n\n\n\n2  Although Clark’s allegations are included in a single count, that does not preclude the Court\nfrom treating them as raising more than one claim.

See Rattigan v.\nHolder (“Rattigan I”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613539\"><a href=\"/opinion/613539/rattigan-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 982 (D.C.

In support of that argument, FEMA relies on cases from other circuits holding that the\n\ninitiation of a security investigation and the “circumstances surrounding” a clearance revocation\n\nare unreviewable under Egan.

It is far from clear that these out-of-circuit precedents would support\n\nFEMA’s capacious reading of Egan. But, even if they did, “this Court is bound by D.C.

And, under the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Rattigan v. Holder (“Rattigan II”), “Egan\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f[does not] insulate[] from Title VII all decisions that might bear upon an employee’s eligibility\n\nto access classified information.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">689</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (emphasis in original).\n\n       As the Court of Appeals explained in Rattigan II, “Egan emphasized that the decision to\n\n. . . deny security clearance requires a ‘[p]redictive judgment’ that ‘must be made by those with\n\nthe necessary expertise in protecting classified information.’” Id. (quoting Egan, 484 U.S. at\n\n529). “It is this expert, predictive judgment made by ‘appropriately trained’ personnel that Egan\n\ninsulates from judicial review.” Id. (quoting Rattigan v. Holder (“Rattigan I”), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613539\"><a href=\"/opinion/613539/rattigan-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n983 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). From this general principle, the Court of Appeals derived two distinct\n\nrules. First, where a plaintiff challenges a “security clearance-related decision[] made by\n\ntrained” personnel, Egan imposes an “absolute bar on judicial review.” Id. at 768. Second, suit\n\nis also barred in cases in which “Title VII liability for security reporting claims w[ould] impair\n\nthe ability of the [responsible officials] to [perform their duties] by ‘chill[ing] the timely and\n\nadequate reporting of security issues.’” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike\n\nchallenges to security clearance-related decisions themselves, however, this latter rule is not\n\nabsolute; in particular, because a “knowingly false reporting present[s] no serious risk of chill,”\n\npermitting Title VII claims in those circumstances “can coexist with Egan” and the Executive\n\nOrder on access to classified information. Id. at 770. Stated more broadly, the second rule\n\nrecognizes that Title VII litigation that does not directly challenge the revocation or suspension\n\nof a security clearance may implicate national security concerns and the discretion and expertise\n\nof the Executive Branch to assess who should have access to classified information. See\n\nExecutive Order 12,986. But because decisions or actions of that type do not trigger the absolute\n\nbar imposed in Egan, “the limits . . . place[d] on Title VII liability for [these] other decisions\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fmust be no broader than necessary to protect the integrity of the [agency’s] security clearance-\n\nrelated responsibilities.” Rattigan II, 689 F.3d at 771 (emphasis in original). 6\n\n       The Court, accordingly, agrees with FEMA that Egan precludes Clark from challenging\n\nthe suspension and revocation of her security clearance. But, at least at this juncture, FEMA has\n\nnot shown that adjudication of Clark’s other claims would chill any of the processes—including\n\nthe reporting of security concerns—contemplated by Executive Order 12,986 or that it would\n\notherwise interfere with “the integrity of [Executive Branch’s] security clearance-related\n\nresponsibilities.” In her opposition, Clark explains that she seeks to challenge the disparate\n\ntreatment that she allegedly received during the investigation of the misconduct allegations\n\nagainst her—including the interview procedures, departures from FEMA regulations, and the\n\ndetail from her position—and that she believes this treatment was retaliatory. See Dkt. 18 at 1–2.\n\nAdjudication of these claims “merely requires consideration of whether similarly situated\n\nemployees were treated the same under the relevant policies, a consideration that lies squarely\n\nwithin the Court’s Title VII jurisdiction.” Thomas, 4 F. Supp. 3d at 160. Indeed, it is unclear\n\nthat these claims even implicate the substance of the allegations made against Clark. Similarly,\n\nit is difficult to understand—and FEMA has failed to elucidate—how FEMA’s decision to assign\n\nClark to a 120-day detail before her clearance was suspended or revoked has anything to do with\n\nExecutive Order 12,968 or the discretion of the Executive Branch to make security-clearance\n\ndecisions free from judicial interference.\n\n\n\n\n6 FEMA contends that Rattigan I and Rattigan II are simply inapplicable here because “the\nplaintiff in Rattigan had received a ‘favorable’ security clearance decision,” whereas Clark “did\nnot receive a ‘favorable’ security clearance decision.” Dkt. 8 at 22 n.2. “While it is true that Mr.\nRattigan’s security clearance was not revoked, the reasoning of Rattigan I and II was not in any\nway based on this fact.” Burns-Ramirez v. Napolitano, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n                                                  12\n\f       This is not to say that FEMA is necessarily foreclosed from pursuing its broader Egan\n\ndefense. If FEMA can demonstrate, for example, that the steps the agency took against Clark\n\nwere based on predictive judgments about national security made by “those with the necessary\n\nexpertise in protecting classified information” Rattigan II, 689 F.3d at 767 (quoting Egan, 484\n\nU.S. at 529), it would have solid basis for re-asserting the defense. But, as the record now\n\nstands, there is no basis to conclude that any such judgments informed any of FEMA’s actions\n\nother than its ultimate suspension and revocation of Clark’s top secret clearance. And if Clark\n\nsuffered an adverse action based on a violation of a generally applicable policy, rather than based\n\non a national-security determination, Egan would not bar her claims. Compare, e.g., Ames, 121\n\nF. Supp. 3d at 132 (explaining that Egan arguably would not bar a claim where plaintiff was\n\nsuspended for “adjudicat[ing] a security clearance under a ‘conflict of interest’” because “[s]he\n\neither operated under a conflict of interest or she did not”), Jones v.

Id. § 1614.105(d). The employee then has 15\n       days to file an individual and/or class complaint with the employing agency. Id.\n       § 1614.106 (regulations governing individual complaints); id. § 1614.204\n\n\n                                                  14\n\f       (regulations governing class complaints); see also id. § 1614.103 (noting types of\n       complaints governed by agency processing procedures outlined in regulations).\n       Upon receipt of a final agency decision—known as a “FAD”—disposing of the\n       administrative complaints, the employee has either 30 days to appeal to the Equal\n       Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), id. §§ 1614.401(a), 1614.402(a),\n       or 90 days to file suit in federal court, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c).\n\nIn re James, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186661\"><a href=\"/opinion/186661/in-re-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2006). An employee is also authorized to file suit in\n\nfederal court if, as here, 180 days have passed from the “date of filing an appeal with the” EEOC\n\nand the EEOC has failed to render a final decision. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c); 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.407(d).\n\n       The following facts regarding Clark’s efforts to exhaust her administrative remedies are\n\nundisputed. The parties agree that Clark initiated EEO counseling on July 24, 2012 and\n\namended her informal complaint twice, once on August 1, 2012, and again on September 10,\n\n2012. See Dkt. 8 at 5 (Def.’s SUMF ¶ 13); Dkt. 18 at 40 (“Clark accepts Def. Fact[] . . . [¶] 13).\n\nThey agree that she filed her formal EEO complaint on October 5, 2012, see Dkt. 18 at 6 (Def.’s\n\nSUMF ¶ 19); Compl. ¶ 11; Dkt. 18 at 51, although the agency’s EEO office did not accept the\n\ncomplaint for investigation until February 11, 2013, see Dkt. 8 at 27; Dkt. 18 at 51. They also\n\nagree that when Clark filed this suit on January 30, 2014, 180 days had transpired without final\n\nagency action on her EEO complaint. See Dkt. 8 at 7 (Def.’s SUMF ¶ 21); Dkt 18 at 53.\n\nFinally, the parties agree that on May 30, 2013, Clark appealed her termination to the MSPB—a\n\nmixed-case appeal in which she alleges both that she did not commit misconduct and that her\n\ntermination was discriminatory and retaliatory—and that as of February 29, 2014, the MSPB\n\nadministrative judge had not issued a decision on the appeal. See Dkt. 8 at 9 (Def.’s SUMF\n\n¶ 30); Dkt. 8-12 at 1–4; Dkt. 18 at 40 (“Clark accepts Def. Fact[] . . . ¶ 30); see also 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.302(a)(2) (“A mixed case appeal is an appeal filed with the MSPB that alleges that an\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fappealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis\n\nof race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, or genetic information.”).\n\n        The parties dispute, however, whether the EEO proceedings encompassed the claims\n\nraised in this action and, for that matter, what claims Clark is raising here. According to FEMA,\n\nClark has failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to her allegations that:\n\n        (1) FEMA engages in a pattern and practice of systemic discrimination against\n        African Americans; (2) the investigation of Plaintiff’s misconduct that USCIS\n        conducted on behalf of FEMA OSCO was discriminatory and retaliatory; and (3)\n        as a result of the discriminatory investigation, Plaintiff was (a) placed on\n        administrative leave . . . ; (b) her security clearance was suspended . . . ; (c) she was\n        removed from the [f]ederal service . . . ; (d) her security clearance was revoked . . . .\n\nDkt. 8 at 29 (internal citations omitted). FEMA concedes that Clark exhausted claims regarding\n\n“her detail to work on a special project in October 2012; FEMA’s investigation of anonymous\n\nallegations that she committed misconduct; her treatment relating to an October 3–4, 2012\n\ninterview by USCIS; and the forwarding of her misconduct case to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in\n\nSeptember 2012.” Dkt. 8 at 28 (internal citations omitted).\n\n        Clark responds that FEMA has misinterpreted her claims and that, by redefining her\n\nclaims, it has incorrectly “infer[e]d that she has not exhausted the administrative process.” Dkt.\n\n18 at 21. According to Clark, she is currently challenging only FEMA’s failure to follow its own\n\nregulations, policies and procedures in the misconduct investigation, see Dkt. 18 at 21; the\n\n“punitive detail,” id. at 27; and disparate treatment with respect to the interview by USCIS\n\nofficers, id. See also id. at 1–2.\n\n        Clark, of course, is the master of her own complaint, and, in light of her response, the\n\nCourt construes her complaint as not raising a systemic discrimination claim; to the extent she\n\nincludes allegations of disparate treatment of other African-American employees, see Compl.\n\n¶¶ 20–23, 30–43, the Court will construe these allegations as providing general background and\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fsupport for Clark’s allegations that she was the victim of racial discrimination. The Court also\n\nneed not address FEMA’s contention that Clark failed to exhaust her challenge to the suspension\n\nand revocation of her security clearance because, as explained above, any such allegations are in\n\nany event non-justiciable. See supra pp. 8–14.\n\n       As for FEMA’s contention that Clark has failed to exhaust administrative remedies\n\nregarding her placement on administrative leave and her subsequent termination, it is unclear\n\nwhether Clark even intends to pursue a challenge to either of these actions here. Although her\n\ncomplaint states that her placement on leave and subsequent termination resulted from the\n\nallegedly discriminatory and retaliatory misconduct investigation, see Compl. ¶¶ 78, 80, the bulk\n\nof the complaint focuses on the alleged disparate treatment and retaliation in the course of the\n\ninvestigation and her placement on detail, see id. ¶¶ 14–77. In addition, as noted above, Clark’s\n\nopposition brief frames her case as a challenge to the “regulations, policy and procedure” that\n\nFEMA followed in its investigation, to FEMA’s decision to detail Clark to a special human\n\nresources project for 120 days, and to the manner in which FEMA conducted her interview on\n\nOctober 3 and 4, 2012. See Dkt. 18 at 1–2. Moreover, Clark has sought to exhaust a challenge\n\nto her termination in a separate mixed-case complaint filed with the MSPB, and she has never\n\nsuggested that she intends to incorporate the grievances that she has raised with the MSPB into\n\nthis action. See Dkt. 8-12 at 1–4; Compl. ¶¶ 10–13 (stating that Clark exhausted her\n\nadministrative remedies in the 2012 EEO proceeding); Dkt. 8 at 9 (SUMF ¶ 30) (“The MSPB\n\nAdministrative Judge has not yet issued an initial decision on the appeal”); Dkt. 18 at 40 (“Clark\n\naccepts Def. Fact[] . . . [¶] 30”). To the contrary, FEMA reports that at least as of February\n\n2014—after this action was filed—the parties were still actively litigating the MSPB case. Dkt. 8\n\nat 34 n.5\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f        In any event, to the extent that Clark is alleging—in this action—that her placement on\n\nadministrative leave or her termination were discriminatory and retaliatory adverse actions, she\n\ndid not administratively exhaust those claims in the 2012 EEO proceedings. “Where an\n\nemployee alleges discrete claims of discrimination [or retaliation], such as a failure to promote or\n\na demotion[,] . . . the employee must exhaust administrative remedies for each discrete claim.”\n\nAchagzai v.

See Dkt. 8 at 5–9,\n\n(Def.’s SUMF ¶¶ 13, 19, 21, 24, 29, 30); Compl. ¶ 11; Dkt. 18 at 40, 51. Nor did Clark\n\nsubsequently amend her EEO complaint to include those events. Cf. Weber v.

Rather, following Morgan, “the procedural requirements of Title VII . . .\n\nmust be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis and . . . satisfaction of the procedural requirements\n\nfor a ‘relate[d]’ act of discrimination is insufficient, except in those cases in which the ‘very\n\nnature’ of the claim ‘involves repeated conduct.’” Hargrove v. AARP, No. 13-1320 (RDM), slip\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fop. at 35 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2016) (quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114-15)). To the extent Clark\n\nseeks to pursue claims for wrongful termination or suspension, those claims would fall squarely\n\nin the category of discrete acts of alleged discrimination requiring separate exhaustion. See\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. at 114 (“Discrete acts” include actions “such as termination, failure to\n\npromote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire”). Because Clark has failed to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies with respect to these claims, she may not pursue them in this\n\nproceeding. Id.\n\n       The Court also concludes that Clark failed to exhaust her claim that “FEMA did not\n\ninvestigate the allegations of misconduct against [her] in accordance with regulations, policy and\n\nprocedures.’” Dkt. 18 at 2. FEMA contends that Clark failed to “advise the EEO Counselor that\n\nshe believed the USCIS investigation itself to be discriminatory,” citing the EEO counselor’s\n\nreport of investigation. Dkt. 8 at 32. At the informal counseling stage, the employee need not\n\n“expressly identify . . . the precise action or legal theory that she thereafter raised in her formal\n\nEEO complaint and in her district court complaint,” because counseling is intended to be “‘a step\n\ntoward remediation’” rather than “‘a trap for unwary counselees.’” Miles v.

But the informal counseling process initiated by the employee must be sufficient to\n\nachieve the purpose of the counseling requirement—that is, “to enable the agency and its\n\nemployee to try to informally resolve the matter before an administrative charge is filed.” Id.\n\n(quoting Artis, 630 F.3d at 1034). Here, the undisputed facts establish that Clark failed to meet\n\neven that low bar.\n\n        The counselor’s report cited by FEMA contains no indication that Clark ever mentioned\n\nor raised any failure of the USCIS investigators to comply with FEMA regulations and\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\fprocedures. See Dkt. 8-11 at 38–70. Rather, Clark discussed with the counselor allegations that\n\na supervisor named Carla Gammon created a hostile work environment by requiring Clark to\n\nprovide additional documentation of her medical leave. Dkt. 8-11 at 38–44. Clark then amended\n\nher informal complaint to assert that Gammon also violated her rights under Title VII by telling\n\nClark’s staff that Clark was under investigation and that a work experience survey was\n\nconducted in a discriminatory and retaliatory manner. See Dkt. 8-11 at 45–48.\n\n       Had Clark identified any evidence disputing FEMA’ characterization of the issues she\n\nraised in the counseling process, the Court might well conclude that summary judgment is not\n\nwarranted. See, e.g., Steele v. Schafer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187238\"><a href=\"/opinion/187238/steele-v-schafer/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (reversing grant of\n\nsummary judgment on non-exhaustion grounds where record reflected “discrepancy” as to\n\nwhether employee contacted EEO counselor on an additional occasion). But, avoiding summary\n\njudgment requires that the non-movant identify actual countervailing evidence. Indeed, the\n\nCourt cautioned Clark before offering her the opportunity to file a supplemental opposition that,\n\nonce the moving party produces evidence “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\n\nand [that] [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,” the non-moving party must then point\n\nto evidence that there is in fact a genuine dispute of fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Dkt. 15 at 2.\n\nYet, despite receiving an opportunity to supplement her opposition, Clark offers no evidence or\n\nargument that the EEO counselor’s report and informal complaints proffered by FEMA provide\n\nan inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading account of the issues she raised with the counselor.\n\nSee, e.g., Dkt. 18 at 40, 46 (Pl.’s SUMF, accepting “as written” FEMA’s account of her contact\n\nwith an EEO counselor). And the Court’s own review of the record does not reveal a “scintilla\n\nof evidence” of a disputed issue of fact on the matter. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 252. The\n\nCourt, accordingly, concludes that, at the counseling stage, Clark raised entirely different\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fallegations than those she raises here, preventing the “‘counseling [from] produc[ing] sufficient\n\ninformation to enable the agency to investigate the claim.’” Miles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Adverse Action\n\n        Finally, FEMA contends that Clark’s “claims (i.e., other than her removal) do not meet\n\nthe legal standards for a materially adverse action.” Dkt. 8 at 37. In light of the Court’s rulings\n\nwith respect to non-justiciability and exhaustion, the Court will address only whether Clark has\n\nalleged a sufficient adverse action with respect to her claims regarding the detail and the October\n\n3 and 4 USCIS interviews. See Dkt. 18 at 27 (Clark’s description of her claims); see also Dkt. 8\n\nat 27–28 (FEMA’s concession that such claims were administratively exhausted). Because\n\nFEMA relies on evidence outside the administrative record in arguing that the detail did not\n\nconstitute a materially adverse action, the Court applies the summary judgment standard in\n\nevaluating this defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f        To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment under Title VII, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that “(1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he suffered an adverse employment\n\naction, and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination.” Forkkio v.\n\nPowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185794\"><a href=\"/opinion/185794/forkkio-samuel-e-v-powell-donald/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1130 (D.C.

In particular, she points to the following alleged irregularities in the interview:\n\n(1) she was required to complete two sworn statements, Compl. ¶ 51; (2) she did not receive a\n\nRequired Appearance Memorandum prior to being interviewed, id. ¶¶ 58, 64; (3) she was not\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fgiven an opportunity to review or correct a transcript of the interview, id. ¶ 62; (4) she “was\n\nasked over 340 questions,” id. ¶ 63; (5) she received a Kalkines notice the day of the interview,\n\nid. ¶ 65; (6) the investigation was biased, id. ¶ 66; and (7) “[t]he USCIS investigators coerced\n\nstatements from witnesses,” id. ¶ 67. With respect to disparate treatment claims, a “[m]ere\n\ninvestigation[] by plaintiff’s employer”—much less an interview during such an investigation—\n\n“cannot constitute an adverse action because they have no adverse effect on plaintiff’s\n\nemployment.” Mack v. Strauss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2444243\"><a href=\"/opinion/2444243/mack-v-strauss/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Cir. Sept. 28, 2001). That is, “although the discipline imposed as a\n\nresult of an investigation may have a sufficiently adverse effect on plaintiff’s employment to be\n\nactionable, the mere initiation of the investigation does not.” Ware v. Billington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368934\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368934/ware-v-billington/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (D.D.C. 2004). And in this case, as explained above, Clark has failed to exhaust a\n\nchallenge to her placement on administrative leave and termination, which allegedly resulted\n\nfrom the misconduct investigation. See supra pp. 17–19.\n\n       Finally, although “the prospect of . . . an investigation” may in some circumstances be\n\nsufficiently harmful to “dissuade a reasonable employee from making or supporting a charge of\n\ndiscrimination”—that is, it may constitute an adverse action for purposes of a retaliation claim,\n\nVelikonja v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124 (D.C. Cir. 2006)—Clark has not adduced any\n\ncompetent evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the foregoing alleged\n\nprocedural irregularities in the October 3 and 4th interviews rose to such a level, cf. Rattigan I,\n\n643 F.3d at 986 (“[R]eferral [for security investigation] alone created the very real possibility not\n\nonly that Rattigan would face a stressful and potentially reputation-damaging investigation, but\n\nalso that the FBI would revoke his security clearance and terminate his employment.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f       The Court, accordingly, denies summary judgment to FEMA with respect to Clark’s\n\nchallenge to her detail, but grants summary judgment to FEMA with respect to her challenge to\n\nthe October 3 and 4 interviews.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS dismissal with prejudice to FEMA to the\n\nextent that Clark seeks to challenge the suspension or revocation of her security clearance. The\n\nCourt also GRANTS summary judgment to FEMA on Clark’s remaining claims, with the\n\nexception of Clark’s challenge to her October 1, 2012 detail. On the latter claim, summary\n\njudgment is DENIED.\n\n       SO ORDERED.\n\n                                                    /s/ Randolph D.
