Board of Education of Baldwin County, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 848.  There we gave 'tentative' and 'partial' approval to a Jefferson-model plan because at that time the stale record seemed to indicate that a freedom of choice plan offered the best promise of disestablishing the dual system.  We remanded the case, however, to bring the record up to date and directed the district court to request HEW to collaborate with the Board of Education in formulating a plan 'to desegregate fully and affirmatively all public schools in the county.'  We specified some mandatory changes, but pointed out that on a new record, the district court 'may well conclude * * * that, indeed, zoning, pairing, or closing certain schools is required 'to convert promptly to a system without a 'white' and a 'Negro' school, but just schools'.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court reapproved the freedom of choice plan with modifications very similar to those we applauded as steps in the right direction but found insufficient in the Bibb County case Singleton v.

West Feliciana Parish, 1970, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477, on remand, Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 1211; see Bivins v. Bibb County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 97.  Even less progress has been made here than in Bibb County, however.  About sixteen percent of the approximately 3000 Negro students are in full-time attendance at formerly white schools; only four percent of the white students are involved in the program of part-time desegregation.  The faculties of the schools are now composed so that one of every five is different from the race of the majority of faculty members at that school; complete faculty integration so that a school is no longer racially identifiable will be delayed until September 1, 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances of this case, neither the instructions of our previous mandate nor the district court's order approving the Board's plan as modified nor the plan itself may stand in the face of supervening changes in the law.  Thorpe v. Housing Authority of the City of Durham, 1969, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474; Bell v. Maryland, 1964, 378 U.S. 226, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 12 L.Ed.2d 822.  The record demonstrates that this plan does not comply with Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19, United States v. Hinds County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1969, 423 F.2d 1264, and Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1969, 419 F.2d 1211, modified as to date sub nom.  Carter v.

This plan is based on zoning.  The new record, in contrast to the stale record we had when the case was before us earlier, now provides some evidence that Baldwin County's residential segregation does not necessarily preclude a unitary system based on a zoning plan.  But our data is scant: the Baldwin County system has no pupil-locator maps, so that HEW could draw only approximate zone lines.  Nevertheless, as this Court said in Singleton, 'the tenor of the decision in Alexander v. Holmes County, is to shift the burden from the standpoint of time for converting to unitary school systems.  The shift is from a status of litigation to one of unitary operation pending litigation'.  Since the HEW plan is the only one currently available that gives any promise of ending the dual system, we must order its implementation despite its defects.  The burden is now on the School Board to prepare pupil locator maps and demonstrate to the district court whether and how the zone lines must be altered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">It is therefore ordered</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 1211, this Court has judicially determined that the ordinary procedures for appellate review in school segregation cases have to be suitably adopted to assure that each system, whose case is before us, 'begin immediately to operate as unitary school systems'.
