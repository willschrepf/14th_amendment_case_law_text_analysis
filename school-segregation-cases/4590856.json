You express    conc~ern\nthat, were the election        to rollback   the tax rate increase,       the tax for\nindigent    health    care would be rolled      back as well.       Such an interpre-\ntation   would require     an isolated    and mechanical     reading of subsections\n26.07(a)    and 26.07(e)     and would ignore     subsection    26.07(h).\n\n       We must look to the :ntent            of the legislature         and construe      the\nstatute     to give      effect    to that      intent.
