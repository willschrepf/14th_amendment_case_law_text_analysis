Abdulwahab appeals his convictions and sentence\nfor several crimes relating to an investment scheme that\nresulted in nearly $100 million in losses for investors. We\nreverse Abdulwahab’s convictions for money laundering but\naffirm the remainder of his convictions. Because we reverse\nthe money laundering convictions, we vacate his sentence and\nremand for resentencing.\n\n                             I.\n\n   Christian M. Allmendinger and Brent Oncale founded a\ncompany known as \"A&O\" in Houston, Texas, in late 2004.\nThe company sold life settlement investments, which are\ninterests in life insurance policies. Until the end of 2006,\nA&O sold \"bonded life settlements,\" which were interests in\nparticular life insurance policies. The investments were for\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                      3\nfixed terms of between four and seven years. If the insured\ndied during the term, the life insurance company would pay\na benefit, but if the insured remained alive, a reinsurance\nbond, which A&O purchased from Provident Capital Indem-\nnity (\"PCI\"), was designed to pay out and take over the life\ninsurance policy (so long as the life insurance policy premi-\nums were current).\n\n   Allmendinger and Oncale marketed and sold A&O’s\nbonded life settlements directly to investors, and in early\n2005, they hired Abdulwahab to market and sell their prod-\nucts. At the time, Abdulwahab was selling a different product\nfor a different company, BHC Marketing. BHC soon termi-\nnated Abdulwahab, however, and he began working full-time\nas A&O’s \"national accounts director.\" J.A. 116. Abdulwahab\nowned and operated Houston Investment Center (\"HIC\"), a\nTexas company that served as A&O’s marketing arm.\nThrough HIC, Abdulwahab employed mid-level sales manag-\ners who, in turn, supervised independent A&O sales agents\naround the country. A&O paid HIC its first commission on\nMay 26, 2005.\n\n   In marketing A&O’s products, both orally and through\nwritten materials they created, Allmendinger, Oncale, and\nAbdulwahab lied about many critical facts. For example, they\nrepresented that investor funds were placed in a segregated\naccount dedicated to those payments and used right away to\npay policy premiums up front. In reality, A&O had no sepa-\nrate account to pay premiums and A&O paid the premiums\nonly as they became due. Indeed, A&O commingled investor\nmoney in a general operating account that A&O used for pay-\ning its bills.1 While A&O was operating, Allmendinger,\nOncale, and Abdulwahab misappropriated millions of dollars\nfrom this account for their personal benefit.\n  1\n   The payment of premiums was no small concern because, without such\npayment, policies would lapse, rendering the associated investments\nworthless.\n\f4               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   The coconspirators also misrepresented A&O’s size, staff,\nand record of earning returns for its investors. In 2005 and\n2006, A&O’s websites listed fictional people as company\nprincipals, falsely stated that A&O had offices in multiple\nstates, greatly exaggerated the number of A&O employees,\nand falsely stated that A&O had particular legal and business\nprofessionals on its staff. The sites also stated in July 2005\nthat A&O had \"enabled [its] clients to leverage $375 million\ninto $800 million in less than five years,\" J.A. 120 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), when in actuality, no investor had\nreceived any pay out at that time and Abdulwahab had been\ninformed of that fact. Abdulwahab assisted in creating the\n2006 version of the website, and his business card listed the\nwebsite address.\n\n   In 2006, Allmendinger and Oncale invited Abdulwahab,\nwho was, at that point, responsible for 80-90% of A&O’s\nsales, to become a partner. Thereafter, the three men each\nheld an equal interest in A&O and shared authority over the\ncompany. Abdulwahab also was added as a signatory to\nA&O’s bank accounts. HIC continued to market A&O’s prod-\nucts, and A&O’s commission payments to HIC remained\nunchanged.\n\n   By late 2006, regulators from different states began to send\ninquiries to A&O regarding its life settlement product, based\nlargely on concerns that A&O was selling an unregistered\nsecurity. These inquiries prompted the three partners to con-\nsult with Florida attorney Michael Lapat, who assisted A&O\nin setting up hedge funds that were backed by life settlements.\nBy early 2007, A&O began offering fractionalized interests in\nthese funds that they called \"capital appreciation bonds.\"\n\n  The three partners agreed that Abdulwahab would serve as\nfund manager. In the course of drafting the necessary offering\ndocuments and disclosures, Lapat used information from a\ndocument that Abdulwahab had completed earlier in 2006 in\nconnection with an unrelated hedge fund (\"the 2006 docu-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                        5\nment\"). Abdulwahab had falsely represented on that docu-\nment that he had earned an economics degree from Louisiana\nState University when he had neither attended LSU nor\nobtained a college degree from any school. Abdulwahab had\nchecked \"no\" in response to the question of whether he had\n\"been convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere, no contest\n. . . to a felony or misdemeanor involving investments or\ninvestment-related business, fraud, false statements or omis-\nsions, wrongful taking of property, bribery, forgery, counter-\nfeiting or extortion.\" J.A. 262 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). He also had checked \"no\" in response to the ques-\ntion of whether \"[he] or an organization of which [he] exer-\ncised management or policy control [had] ever been charged\nwith any felony or charged with a misdemeanor\" of the type\ndescribed in the previous question. J.A. 262 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). In actuality, Abdulwahab had pled guilty\nin 2004 in Harris County, Texas, to the felony of forgery of\na commercial instrument. The court that accepted Abdul-\nwahab’s guilty plea deferred a final adjudication in his case\nand placed him on a five-year period of community supervi-\nsion. Indeed, Abdulwahab was serving that term when he\ncompleted the 2006 document.2\n\n   Lapat used the 2006 document to draft a biography and the\nA&O funds’ disclosure documents, including the private\noffering memorandum (\"POM\"). In so doing, Lapat discussed\nparticular language with Abdulwahab. Because the POM was\nbased on the 2006 document, the POM stated that Abdul-\nwahab had earned his degree from LSU and did not disclose\nhis felony plea. Although A&O regularly paid commissions\nof more than 10% to its sales agents, the POM nonetheless\nstated that A&O would invest 95% of investor funds in accor-\ndance with its investment objectives.\n  2\n   On June 4, 2007, the court terminated Abdulwahab’s period of supervi-\nsion early and dismissed the case.\n\f6               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   After making the change to selling capital appreciation\nbonds, A&O continued to operate in much the same way that\nit had previously, including using HIC to sell the bonds. A&O\nalso continued to perpetuate various misrepresentations by\ncreating new marketing materials. For example, the three\nprincipals and co-conspirator Eric Kunz drafted a \"History\nSheet\" for A&O stating again that Abdulwahab had earned his\neconomics degree from LSU, and A&O mailed this document\ndaily in 2007 to sales agents and investors. In fact, A&O reg-\nularly utilized the mail to send marketing materials and inves-\ntor documents.\n\n   As things turned out, A&O’s decision to sell capital appre-\nciation bonds instead of life settlements did not stem the tide\nof regulator inquiries. For this reason and because of some\ntension among the partners, Allmendinger, Oncale, and\nAbdulwahab agreed to sell A&O to a company called \"Blue\nDymond.\" Before the sale, however, Allmendinger, Oncale,\nand Abdulwahab helped themselves — for what Allmen-\ndinger believed was one final time — to several hundred\nthousand dollars from A&O’s operating fund. After this raid\non A&O’s coffers, only $2.9 million remained in A&O’s\nbank accounts — not even half of the amount A&O needed\nto pay the premiums on all of its policies up through their\nbonding dates.\n\n   Abdulwahab was retained as a consultant for six months\nafter the sale as part of the sales contract. However, although\nAllmendinger did not know it, Abdulwahab and Oncale had\nconstructed an elaborate secret plan to purchase the company\nthemselves and continue running it. Blue Dymond — the\nbuyer of A&O — was little more than a front for Abdulwahab\nand Oncale; it was an offshore shell company created and\nfunded by Abdulwahab and Oncale with the assistance of\nattorney Russell Mackert and without the knowledge of All-\nmendinger.\n\n   To fund the \"sale,\" Oncale and Allmendinger each depos-\nited $380,000 from their personal A&O disbursements into\n\f                UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                  7\nMackert’s attorney trust account. Under the terms of the sale,\nthe partners were to receive $750,000, with the expectation of\nan additional $250,000 in the 18 months following the sale.\nWhile Allmendinger received his $750,000 check, Oncale and\nAbdulwahab — unbeknownst to Allmendinger — each\nreceived checks in the amount of only $750 and secretly con-\ntinued the business through Blue Dymond. Mackert wrote all\nthree of these checks from his attorney trust account.\n\n  In September 2007, Mackert, at the direction of Abdul-\nwahab and Oncale, also formed another offshore shell com-\npany, Physicians Trust, LLC, in the Caribbean Island of\nNevis. This new company allegedly purchased Blue Dymond\nin order to further disguise Abdulwahab’s and Oncale’s\ninvolvement with A&O. That same month, Abdulwahab and\nOncale hired David White to serve as A&O’s president.\n\n   Through August 31, 2007, the date of the sale, Allmen-\ndinger had personally received $8,455,033.60 from A&O;\nOncale had received $7,303,496.98; and Abdulwahab had\nreceived $2,889,366.70. With Allmendinger gone, A&O con-\ntinued generally to operate in much the same manner as it had\nbefore. However, the remaining principals accelerated their\nmisappropriation of investor funds. Indeed, after the sham\nsale, Abdulwahab and Oncale transferred approximately $10\nmillion of investor funds from A&O’s bank accounts to Mac-\nkert’s attorney trust account, about $5.1 million of which was\nfor Abdulwahab’s benefit.\n\n   All told, A&O signed 843 investor contracts investing a\ntotal of $104,048,660.18 between 2004 and 2008. During that\nperiod, Abdulwahab personally received $8,002,904.78 from\nthe scheme.\n\n   Mackert took over the management of the A&O entities in\nMarch 2008. A&O had stopped taking new investor funds by\nthat time, and Mackert’s role was essentially to make sure that\npremiums were paid, investor questions were answered, and\n\f8                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\ninvestor files and policy files were protected. The policy pre-\nmiums were to be paid in part from $4.6 million that White\nhad paid to Prestige Escrow Company. In March 2009, how-\never, Mackert discovered that Prestige had stolen a large por-\ntion of that money. In the next two months, Mackert\nundertook to determine how much money would be needed to\ncontinue to pay the policy premiums. He concluded not only\nthat there was not enough money after the theft but also that,\neven had the theft not occurred, the $4.6 million \"wasn’t even\nclose\" to being sufficient to pay the policy premiums. J.A.\n522. With A&O lacking sufficient funds to make premium\npayments, Mackert subsequently placed A&O into bank-\nruptcy.\n\n   On September 7, 2010, Allmendinger, Abdulwahab, and\nWhite, were indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia. On\nFebruary 1, 2011, the grand jury returned a superseding\nindictment against the three men. Abdulwahab was charged\nwith one count of mail fraud conspiracy, see 18 U.S.C. § 1349\n(Count 1); six counts of mail fraud, see 18 U.S.C. § 1341\n(Counts 2-7); one count of money laundering conspiracy, see\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) (Count 8); six counts of money launder-\ning, see 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (Counts 9-14); and four\ncounts of securities fraud, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), 77x\n(Counts 15-18).3 The superseding indictment charged that a\npurpose of the alleged mail fraud conspiracy was \"to mislead\ninvestors regarding A&O’s safekeeping and use of investor\nfunds and the risks of A&O’s investment offerings, in order\nto obtain investor funds so that the conspirators could person-\nally profit.\" J.A. 43.\n    3\n    After cooperating with the government, Oncale pleaded guilty pursuant\nto a plea agreement to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and\none count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He received a sen-\ntence of 10 years’ imprisonment. White pleaded guilty to a criminal infor-\nmation alleging conspiracy to commit mail fraud, money laundering, and\nsecurities fraud, and he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                        9\n   After resolving several pretrial motions, the district court\ngranted motions by Abdulwahab and Allmendinger to sever\ntheir respective trials.4\n\n   On the government’s motion, the district court dismissed\nCounts 4, 10, and 16 of the superseding indictment as to\nAbdulwahab. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a). At the close of the\ngovernment’s case, Abdulwahab moved for a judgment of\nacquittal on the remaining counts with the exception of Count\n1 (conspiracy to commit mail fraud) and Count 8 (conspiracy\nto commit money laundering). See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\nRegarding the money laundering counts, Abdulwahab argued\nthat the transactions identified in the indictment did not con-\nstitute money laundering because they were simply payment\nof commissions that had already been earned for sales of\nA&O products. The district court expressed some doubt as to\nwhether the payment of the earned commissions was \"money\nlaundering as opposed to just evidence of the [underlying]\nfraud.\" J.A. 715. Nevertheless, the district court denied the\nmotion as to those counts and as to the remaining charges as\nwell. Abdulwahab then presented his case, which consisted\nonly of his testimony. Afterwards, he unsuccessfully renewed\nhis motion for judgment of acquittal. The jury found him\nguilty on all remaining counts.\n\n   Following his conviction, Abdulwahab moved unsuccess-\nfully for a judgment of acquittal on each count of conviction\nor, in the alternative, for a new trial. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n  4\n    Allmendinger was subsequently convicted of one count of conspiracy\nto commit mail fraud, two counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy\nto commit money laundering, two counts of money laundering, and one\ncount of securities fraud. He was sentenced to 540 months’ imprisonment\nand ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $101,963,048.05. We\naffirmed his sentence on appeal. See United States v. Allmendinger, 706\nF.3d 330, 340-44 (4th Cir. 2013). Mackert pleaded guilty to a criminal\ninformation alleging mail fraud conspiracy and bulk cash smuggling, see\n31 U.S.C. § 5332, and received a sentence of 188 months’ imprisonment.\n\f10              UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n29(c)(1), 33(a); United States v. Abdulwahab, 2011 WL\n4434236 (E.D. Va. Sept. 22, 2011).\n\n   The court then turned to sentencing. Pursuant to an agree-\nment reached by the parties, the court adopted the evidence\nfrom Allmendinger’s earlier-conducted sentencing, and the\nparties also presented additional evidence. Included in that\nadditional evidence was testimony from IRS Special Agent\nJohn Norton that, based on his review of bank records, inves-\ntor listings, and bankruptcy records, investors lost at least\n$101,857,687.11 from May 26, 2005 — when the government\ncontended Abdulwahab joined the conspiracy — until the\nscheme ended in January 2008. Acknowledging that\n$8,287,051.65 had been recovered through A&O’s bank-\nruptcy, the government argued that a loss of $93,570,635.46\nwas foreseeable and attributable to Abdulwahab. Abdulwahab\nargued for a much smaller loss amount for two reasons. First,\nhe maintained that he did not join the conspiracy until he was\nmade an equity partner of A&O on November 1, 2006, and\nthus should not be responsible for the loss of funds invested\nprior to that date. Second, he contended that he should not be\nresponsible for the losses caused by Prestige Escrow Compa-\nny’s theft of A&O’s $4.6 million or by the fact that several\nof PCI’s bonds turned out to be fraudulent.\n\n   The district court rejected Abdulwahab’s arguments and\nadopted the government’s proposed loss amount. Regarding\nthe scope of the activity Abdulwahab agreed to undertake, the\ncourt determined that he agreed \"to secure funds from people\nby using fraudulent misrepresentations.\" J.A. 1432. The dis-\ntrict court found that Abdulwahab \"knew that the representa-\ntions being used to induce these people to invest in A&O\nwere false\" and that he \"helped create some of the false\nimpressions himself.\" J.A. 1432-33. The court specifically\nnoted Abdulwahab’s misrepresentations about A&O’s past\nrecord of success and its scope and his claims that he had\ninvested money with A&O and that his clients had succeeded\nwith A&O. The court noted that A&O was built on a series\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                          11\nof lies designed to make investors feel that their investment\nwas risk-free, when in fact quite the contrary was true, as\nAbdulwahab well knew. The court determined that a person\ndoes not \"have to be a partner to be a conspirator\" and that\nAbdulwahab had joined the conspiracy by May 26, 2005,\nwhen he received his first commission payment. J.A. 1432.\n\n   Citing United States v. Jimenez, 513 F.3d 62 (3d Cir.\n2008), the court determined that the fact that the investors’\nlosses may have been partly the result of intervening causes\nconcerning the misdeeds of Prestige Escrow Company or PCI\nwould not affect the calculation of Abdulwahab’s loss\namount, although those actions could justify a downward\nvariance from the advisory guideline range. In the end, the\ncourt concluded that Abdulwahab was responsible for all\ninvestor losses because they were reasonably foreseeable to\nAbdulwahab as a potential result of his scheme. The court\nreasoned that\n\n      knowing the way that business was operated,\n      [Abdulwahab] knew that they were basically robbing\n      Peter to pay Paul, that, in fact, they were trying to\n      pay premiums on policies as they came in, and it was\n      reasonably foreseeable to him that if the premiums\n      didn’t come in or something happened to affect the\n      business, the scheme would fall on its face as it did.\n\nJ.A. 1434.\n\n   Adopting the government’s suggested loss amount of\n$93,570,635.46, the district court applied a 24-level increase\nfor a loss exceeding $50 million. See U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(M) (2010). Several other enhancements\nincreased Abdulwahab’s total offense level to 43.5 This level,\n  5\n   Although the total offense level was actually 45, an offense level\nexceeding 43 is treated as an offense level of 43 under the Guidelines. See\nU.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, cmt. n.2.\n\f12               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\ncombined with Abdulwahab’s category III criminal history,\nyielded a guideline range of life imprisonment, capped by a\nstatutory maximum of 3,060 months’ imprisonment.\n\n   The district court stated that it was the \"intention of the\nCourt to impose a sentence of 60 years [720 months] impris-\nonment.\" J.A. 1450. In so doing, the court varied downward\nby 2,340 months from the guideline range of 3,060 months.\nThe court decided to vary downward in that amount in part\nbecause the losses \"were exacerbated by intervening events\nover which the defendant had no control,\" including the\nactions of Prestige Escrow and PCI. J.A. 1449. The court also\nordered Abdulwahab to pay more than $100 million in restitu-\ntion.\n\n                               II.\n\n   Abdulwahab argues that the district court erred in denying\nhis motion for a judgment of acquittal as to several counts.\nWe review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of\nacquittal. See United States v. Smith, 451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th\nCir. 2006). In considering a claim that the evidence was insuf-\nficient to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government and \"sustain the jury’s\nverdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essen-\ntial elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\" United States v. Penniegraft, 641 F.3d 566, 571 (4th\nCir. 2011).\n\n                               A.\n\n   Abdulwahab first maintains that his money laundering con-\nvictions are barred by the \"merger problem\" identified in\nUnited States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 517 (2008), since those\nconvictions are based on allegations that he paid the expenses\n\f                    UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                           13\nof completed frauds with money that the frauds generated. We\nagree.6\n\n   In Santos, the Court considered whether the term \"pro-\nceeds\" in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1), the federal money-\nlaundering statute, means \"receipts\" or \"profits\" for the partic-\nular crime there at issue. The crime at issue in that case was\noperating an illegal gambling operation, wherein the defen-\ndant employed a number of helpers. See 553 U.S. at 509. At\nbars and restaurants, the defendant’s runners would gather\nbets, keep a portion of the bets as their commissions, and\ndeliver the rest to the defendant’s collectors. See id. The col-\nlectors then gave the money to the defendant, who used some\nof it to pay the salaries of collectors and to pay the winners.\n  6\n    Abdulwahab argued to the district court in support of his Rule 29\nmotion regarding these counts that the transactions identified in the indict-\nment did not constitute money laundering because they were simply pay-\nment of commissions that had already been earned for sales of A&O\nproducts. See J.A. 709 (\"I submit that putting checks in the mail for com-\nmissions that were earned [is] not money laundering under the statute,\nwithin the intent of the statute.\"); J.A. 710 (\"[T]hese are commissions that\nare earned from sales. Respective people are being paid, but it’s not\nmoney laundering.\"). Indeed, before denying the motion as to these\ncounts, the district court expressed some doubt as to whether the payment\nof the earned commissions was \"money laundering as opposed to just evi-\ndence of the [underlying] fraud.\" J.A. 715. Although Abdulwahab could\nhave explained in greater detail why he believed that the fact that the\ntransactions in question were simply payments for earned commissions\nentitled him to a judgment of acquittal, we conclude that he did enough\nto preserve the issue, and we note that the government does not argue oth-\nerwise.\n   The district court instructed the jury that to show that money constituted\n\"proceeds\" of Abdulwahab’s mail fraud, the government needed to prove\nonly that the \"money came from the mail fraud money.\" J.A. 991.\nAlthough Abdulwahab did not object to that instruction, the error he\nalleges on appeal is not an instructional error, but rather an error in deny-\ning his Rule 29 motion at the close of the government’s case. In reviewing\nthat claimed error, we apply the correct law regardless of whether it was\ncharged by the district court. See United States v. Perry, 335 F.3d 316, 320\nn.6 (4th Cir. 2003).\n\f14               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\nSee id. Those payments to runners, collectors, and winners\nwere the basis for the money laundering charges and convic-\ntions in that case. See id. at 510, 524. The district court\nvacated the money laundering convictions, however, on the\nbasis that \"the proceeds admittedly used by Santos to pay\nwinners and couriers could only have been gross proceeds,\"\nas opposed to net proceeds. United States v. Santos, 342 F.\nSupp. 2d 781, 799 (N.D. Ind. 2004), aff’d, 461 F.3d 886 (7th\nCir. 2006).\n\n   The Supreme Court affirmed in a 4-1-4 decision on the\nbasis of a so-called \"merger problem.\" Santos, 553 U.S. at\n515 (internal quotation marks omitted). Writing for the plural-\nity, Justice Scalia noted that if \"proceeds\" referred to \"gross\nreceipts,\" \"nearly every violation of the illegal-lottery statute\nwould also be a violation of the money-laundering statute,\nbecause paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving\nreceipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on\nof the lottery.\" Id. \"Since few lotteries, if any, will not pay\ntheir winners, the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries, 18\nU.S.C. § 1955, would ‘merge’ with the money-laundering\nstatute.\" Id. at 515-16. Justice Scalia also concluded that simi-\nlar problems would arise \"[f]or a host of predicate crimes.\" Id.\nat 516.\n\n   Representing the fifth vote for the Court’s judgment, Jus-\ntice Stevens agreed that specifically with respect to the gam-\nbling enterprise with which the defendants had been convicted\nin Santos, it was unclear whether Congress intended that \"pro-\nceeds\" would mean only profits or rather that it would include\nall receipts. Id. at 525-26 (Stevens, J., concurring). He con-\ncurred in the judgment only, finding that \"[a]llowing the Gov-\nernment to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating\nan illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practi-\ncal effect tantamount to double jeopardy.\" Id. at 527 (Stevens,\nJ., concurring).\n\n  In United States v. Halstead, 634 F.3d 270 (4th Cir. 2011),\nwe considered the meaning of the Santos decision in a case\n\f                UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                 15\ninvolving a healthcare fraud scheme. We began by noting\nthat, in the case of a plurality opinion, the holding of the\nCourt is the narrowest holding that garnered five votes. See\nHalstead, 634 F.3d at 277 (citing Marks v. United States, 430\nU.S. 188, 193 (1977)). As for what that holding was, we\nexplained:\n\n    [W]e read Santos to hold that when a merger prob-\n    lem arises in the context of money laundering and\n    illegal gambling, the required solution is to define\n    the proceeds of the illegal gambling business as its\n    net profits. When, however, a merger problem arises\n    in the context of money laundering and an illegal\n    activity other than illegal gambling, because of Jus-\n    tice Stevens’ opinion that would require addressing\n    that situation on a case-by-case approach, we will\n    leave further development of a solution to a future\n    case that presents the problem.\n\n634 F.3d at 279.\n\n   We then turned to the question of whether the case pre-\nsented a merger problem. As the Halstead court explained, in\nthe case of a money laundering statute criminalizing financial\ntransactions involving the \"proceeds\" of an illegal activity, a\nmerger problem can occur if a person is convicted \"for paying\nthe ‘essential expenses of operating’ the underlying crime.\"\nId. (quoting Santos, 353 U.S. at 528).\n\n   In Halstead, Halstead engaged in a scheme in which insur-\nance companies were fraudulently billed. See id. at 272-73.\nOnce a clinic that had been opened at Halstead’s direction\nreceived the payments, it transferred the money to another\ncompany Halstead had formed, which, in turn, transferred the\nmoney to checking accounts belonging to Halstead and his\nco-conspirator. See id. at 273. We found no merger problem\non those facts, concluding that Halstead’s fraud was complete\nonce the insurance company made the payments. See id. at\n\f16                 UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n280. Thus, the money received by the clinic constituted \"pro-\nceeds\" of the fraud, and there was no merger problem with\nmoney laundering convictions based on a transaction involv-\ning those proceeds. See id. at 280-81.\n\n   We had occasion again to apply Santos in United States v.\nCloud, 680 F.3d 396 (4th Cir. 2012). Cloud’s scheme, at its\nessence, involved convincing people to invest in real estate\nproperties that, unbeknownst to the buyers, Cloud had\nrecently purchased for a lesser amount. See id. at 399-400.\nThe scheme also involved falsification of loan applications\nand the payment of \"thousands of dollars in kickbacks to buy-\ners, at least one mortgage broker, and the recruiters responsi-\nble for finding the buyers.\" Id. at 400. Cloud was convicted\nof several crimes, including, as is relevant here, one count of\nconspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of\nmoney laundering. See id. at 399. The substantive counts all\nconcerned various payments Cloud made \"to recruiters, buy-\ners, and other coconspirators for the role each person played\nin the mortgage fraud scheme.\" Id. at 406. On appeal, we\nreversed those convictions, finding that they suffered from the\nmerger problem identified in Santos. See id. at 408. We con-\ncluded that, unlike the payments in Halstead, the charged\ntransactions were payment of \"the essential expenses of the\nunderlying fraud\" because it was only through the promise of\nthese payments that Cloud was able to persuade his cocon-\nspirators to do business with him.7 See id. at 406-08. That the\npayments were made after the services were performed did\nnothing to change that. See id. at 408. In order to correct the\nmerger problem, we defined \"proceeds\" as \"profits,\" as the\nSantos Court had done, and reversed the money laundering\nconvictions on that basis. See id. at 409.\n  7\n    We noted that the same could not be said of the payments in Halstead\nsince the transactions constituting money laundering were not payments\nfor services rendered. See United States v. Cloud, 680 F.3d 396, 407 (4th\nCir. 2010).\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                          17\n   On the other hand, we found no merger problem with\nCloud’s conviction for conspiracy to commit money launder-\ning because \"[u]nlike Cloud’s substantive money laundering\ncharges, the conspiracy charge was not tied to any specific\npayment to a recruiter, buyer, or coconspirator\" and \"there\nwas evidence that Cloud used the profits from his previous\n[illegal deals] to finance additional purchases.\" Id. at 408.\nThus, we affirmed the conspiracy conviction. See id.\n\n   Abdulwahab’s case creates a merger problem very similar\nto that present in Cloud. The money laundering counts at\nissue concerned commission payments to HIC sales agent\nTim Bromseth. These payments, like those in Cloud, were for\nservices that played a critical role in the underlying fraud\nscheme in that it was the promise of payment for services ren-\ndered that enticed HIC and Bromseth to obtain investors for\nA&O. As such, Abdulwahab was no different than \"the felon\nwho uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car\"\nor \"the initial recipient of the wealth\" in \"any wealth-\nacquiring crime with multiple participants . . . [who] gives his\nconfederates their shares.\" Id. at 404 (quoting Santos, 553\nU.S. at 516). Unlike the transactions in Halstead, the commis-\nsion payments were essential expenses of the illegal activity.\nThus, the merger problem we identified in Cloud arises in this\ncase as well, and, following Cloud, we correct it by defining\n\"proceeds\" as \"net profits.\" See id. at 409. Under this defini-\ntion, while payment of the commissions may have constituted\nevidence of the fraud underlying the money laundering\ncharges, the payments did not constitute money laundering.\nWe therefore hold that the district court erred in rejecting\nAbdulwahab’s contrary argument and denying his motion for\njudgment of acquittal as to those counts.8\n   8\n     After the Supreme Court decided Santos, Congress amended the\nmoney-laundering statute to specifically define \"proceeds\" as \"any prop-\nerty derived from or obtained or retained, directly or indirectly, through\nsome form of unlawful activity, including the gross receipts of such activ-\nity.\" Fraud Enforcement and Regulatory Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111–21,\n§ 2(f)(1), 123 Stat. 1617, 1618 (2009) (codified at 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1956(c)(9)). With \"proceeds\" now specifically defined, the issue we\naddress today should not recur in many future cases. See Cloud, 680 F.3d\nat 409 n.6.\n\f18               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   The government contends that our reversal of the money\nlaundering convictions should not warrant a full resentencing\nsince all of Abdulwahab’s sentences for these counts were\nordered to be served concurrently with the three consecutive\n240-month sentences he received for Counts 1, 2, and 3.\nHowever, as the government concedes, the error is not harm-\nless in light of the court’s imposition of a separate special\nassessment for each count. See Ray v. United States, 481 U.S.\n736, 737 (1987) (per curiam). On the facts before us, we\nbelieve a remand is appropriate so that the district court may\nconsider whether the reversal of the money laundering con-\nvictions warrants any change in Abdulwahab’s sentence.\n\n                               B.\n\n  Abdulwahab argues that his conviction for conspiracy to\ncommit money laundering suffers from the same merger prob-\nlem as his convictions for substantive money laundering and\nthus that the district court erred in not granting his motion for\njudgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge.\n\n   Because Abdulwahab did not raise this issue in the district\ncourt, we review it for plain error. See United States v. Wal-\nlace, 515 F.3d 327, 331-32 (4th Cir. 2008). To obtain relief\nunder plain-error review, Abdulwahab must first establish that\n\"the district court erred, that the error was plain, and that it\naffected his substantial rights.\" United States v. Robinson, 627\nF.3d 941, 954 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted). \"Even when this burden is met, we have\ndiscretion whether to recognize the error, and should not do\nso unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v.\nHargrove, 625 F.3d 170, 184 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Here, Abdulwahab cannot even establish\nerror, let alone plain error.\n\n  Unlike the money laundering charges, the charge for con-\nspiracy to commit money laundering \"was not tied to any spe-\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                     19\ncific payment.\" Cloud, 680 F.3d at 408. We therefore consider\nwhether the record contained evidence that could support the\nconviction. See id. Here, the government presented such evi-\ndence relating to the sham sale that Abdulwahab and Oncale\norchestrated to allow them to continue with their scheme once\nAllmendinger ceased his involvement. In anticipation of the\nsale, Abdulwahab and Oncale each deposited into Mackert’s\nclient trust account $380,000 that they had taken from per-\nsonal A&O disbursements, and they had Mackert write\nchecks on this account in the amounts of $750,000 to All-\nmendinger and $750 each to Abdulwahab and Oncale. A\nrational jury certainly could have found that these transactions\nwere intended to promote the continuation of the investment\nscheme after Allmendinger left, and thus that the agreement\nto execute this plan constituted a promotional money launder-\ning conspiracy. See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (making it a\ncrime for an individual, \"knowing that the property involved\nin a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some\nform of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct\nsuch a financial transaction which in fact involves the pro-\nceeds of specified unlawful activity . . . with the intent to pro-\nmote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\"). These\ntransactions — at least the $750 payments — did not consti-\ntute paying expenses or giving coconspirators their shares of\nprofits.9 Rather, they were simply part of a deception that fur-\nthered Abdulwahab and Oncale’s plan to continue their\nscheme to defraud investors once Allmendinger had departed.\nAs such, there was no merger problem regarding these trans-\nactions.\n\n                                 C.\n\n  Abdulwahab next maintains that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion for judgment of acquittal regarding his\n  9\n   In light of this conclusion, we need not determine whether the\n$750,000 payment to Allmendinger would also constitute money launder-\ning.\n\f20               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\nconvictions for conspiracy to commit mail fraud and for mail\nfraud and securities fraud. He specifically contends that the\nevidence was insufficient to prove that he knew of, and\nintended to participate in, a scheme to defraud. He also argues\nthat he believed that he had no duty to disclose his criminal\nhistory to A&O’s investors and that there was no evidence\nthat his representation that he earned an economics degree\nfrom LSU was material to any investor’s decision to invest.\n\n   \"To obtain a conviction for mail fraud, the Government\nmust prove (1) the existence of a scheme to defraud and (2)\nthe use of the mails (or another interstate carrier) for the pur-\npose of executing the scheme.\" United States v. Delfino, 510\nF.3d 468, 471 (4th Cir. 2007). To obtain a conviction for\nsecurities fraud under 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a), the government\nmust show that the defendant willfully offered to sell or actu-\nally sold a security through the mails, knowing that he was\nemploying a statement containing either material misstate-\nments or omissions of material fact. See United States v.\nUnited Med. & Surgical Supply Corp., 989 F.2d 1390, 1402\n(4th Cir. 1993).\n\n  As the district court concluded after the trial, the govern-\nment presented \"extensive evidence from which the jury\ncould have concluded that [Abdulwahab] engaged in the\nscheme to defraud\" regarding the mail fraud counts, as well\nas \"ample evidence from which a rational jury could have\nconcluded that [he] engaged in securities fraud.\" Abdulwahab,\n2011 WL 4434236, at *2-3.\n\n  Evidence showed that Abdulwahab not only was aware of\nmisrepresentations being used to lure in clients, but he was\nmaking such misrepresentations himself. Considering\nAbdulwahab’s central role with A&O, a jury might have rea-\nsonably inferred that he knew of A&O’s misrepresentations\nconcerning its number of employees, its number of offices, its\nyears of experience, and its record of success. Evidence also\ndemonstrated Abdulwahab’s willingness to lie about his own\n\f                 UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                 21\ninvolvement with A&O. For example, investor Wallace Ben-\nnett testified that Abdulwahab told him in the spring of 2005\nthat Abdulwahab had personally invested all of his investable\nassets in A&O life settlements and that he had several clients\nwho had invested their funds, cashed out, and then reinvested\nthose funds back into life settlements. In fact, evidence\nshowed Abdulwahab had not invested one penny in life settle-\nments and none of his clients had received payment on a life\nsettlement investment.\n\n   Several witnesses also testified about Abdulwahab’s role in\ncreating and disseminating the so-called A&O History Sheet\nand the POM, both of which contained false information\nabout Abdulwahab’s educational background while failing to\ndisclose his forgery plea. Abdulwahab argues that the govern-\nment failed to show that whether he had earned an economics\ndegree from LSU was material to investors’ decisions to\ninvest with A&O. As for the failure to disclose his felony\nplea, Abdulwahab does not contest the materiality of that\nomission, but he argues that his failure to disclose it was sim-\nply a good-faith error insofar as he believed that since the\ncourt accepting his plea deferred adjudication on his case, \"it\nwould be like it would no longer be there.\" J.A. 745. We need\nnot address Abdulwahab’s argument concerning the misrepre-\nsentations of his educational background because the jury cer-\ntainly could have rationally concluded that any suggestion by\nhim that he was acting in good faith by omitting his felony\nplea was belied by his representation, on the 2006 document,\nthat he had never even been charged with a felony.\n\n  Additionally, extensive evidence documented Abdul-\nwahab’s involvement in the sham sales of A&O to Blue\nDymond and Physicians Trust and in the transfer of millions\nof dollars to himself and Oncale. All of Oncale and Abdul-\nwahab’s efforts to hide their connection to, and control of, the\nbusiness further demonstrated that the men were both well\naware of their wrongdoing.\n\f22                 UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   Simply put, as the district court noted, the evidence sup-\nporting Abdulwahab’s various fraud convictions was strong\nand well beyond what was necessary to support his convic-\ntions. The district court was correct to deny his motion for a\njudgment of acquittal on these charges.\n\n                                   III.\n\n   Abdulwahab finally maintains that the district court erred\nin holding him responsible at sentencing for losses of funds\nthat were invested with A&O before he became an equity\npartner. We disagree.10\n\n   \"[T]he determination of loss attributable to a fraud scheme\nis a factual issue for resolution by the district court, and we\nreview such a finding of fact only for clear error.\" United\nStates v. Godwin, 272 F.3d 659, 671 (4th Cir. 2001). \"The\ncourt need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.\"\nU.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. n.3(C). Because \"[t]he sentencing\njudge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and esti-\nmate the loss based upon the evidence . . . , the court’s loss\ndetermination is entitled to appropriate deference.\" Id. In the\ncontext of § 2B1.1, \"loss is the greater of actual loss or\nintended loss,\" and \"actual loss\" is \"the reasonably foresee-\nable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\" Id. cmt.\nn.3(A), n.3(A)(i). The term \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary\nharm\" is defined as \"pecuniary harm that the defendant knew\nor, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known,\nwas a potential result of the offense.\" Id. cmt. n.3(A)(iv).\n\n   The district court found that Abdulwahab and his cocon-\nspirators agreed to make false representations to investors in\norder to induce them to invest their money with A&O. The\ndistrict court explained that these lies included misrepresenta-\n  10\n    Although we vacate Abdulwahab’s sentence in light of our reversal of\nthe money laundering convictions, we address this issue in this appeal for\nthe sake of judicial efficiency.\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                         23\ntions concerning A&O’s size, the number of people it\nemployed and number of its offices, the prior investment suc-\ncess of its products, and the way A&O used the funds it\nreceived from investors. Rejecting Abdulwahab’s argument\nthat he did not join the conspiracy until he became an equity\npartner in A&O, the court found that Abdulwahab joined no\nlater than May 26, 2005, when HIC received its first A&O\ncommission payment.\n\n   Abdulwahab contends that the district court clearly erred in\nfinding that he joined the conspiracy before becoming an\nequity partner because even if he \"suspected that portions of\nthe marketing information provided by Allmendinger and\nOncale were erroneous,\" his marketing of their products did\nnot amount to participation in a conspiracy. Appellant’s brief\nat 25. This argument simply fails to come to terms with the\nfact that the district court found that by May 26, 2005,\nAbdulwahab did not simply suspect that A&O was obtaining\ninvestors’ funds by fraud, but that he knew they were, and he\nwas acting in concert with them to help them do it. See United\nStates v. Mills, 995 F.2d 480, 485 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting that\n\"the critical inquiry\" regarding whether a conspiracy has\noccurred \"concerns whether the Government proved agree-\nment between at least two persons to concerted action\" (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)). The district court did not\nclearly err in its selection of the May 26, 2005, date.11\n  11\n    Abdulwahab also maintains that the district court erred in refusing to\nreduce his loss amount based on a purported intervening cause of the\ninvestor’s losses, namely, that Prestige Escrow Company allegedly misap-\npropriated certain investor funds independently of the A&O fraud. This\nargument fails, however, for the same reason we held in Allmendinger’s\nappeal of his sentence that the district court did not err in refusing to\nreduce Allmendinger’s loss based on the fact that PCI’s bonds turned out\nto be fraudulent. See Allmendinger, 706 F.3d at 342-43.\n\f24              UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n                             IV.\n\n   In sum, we reverse Abdulwahab’s money laundering con-\nvictions but affirm the remainder of his convictions. Although\nwe find no error in Abdulwahab’s sentence, in light of our\nreversal of the money laundering convictions, we vacate his\nsentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n                                      AFFIRMED IN PART,\n                                      REVERSED IN PART,\n                                       VACATED IN PART,\n                                         AND REMANDED\n\f",

Allmendinger and Brent Oncale founded a\ncompany known as \"A&O\" in Houston, Texas, in late 2004.\nThe company sold life settlement investments, which are\ninterests in life insurance policies. Until the end of 2006,\nA&O sold \"bonded life settlements,\" which were interests in\nparticular life insurance policies. The investments were for\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                      3\nfixed terms of between four and seven years. If the insured\ndied during the term, the life insurance company would pay\na benefit, but if the insured remained alive, a reinsurance\nbond, which A&O purchased from Provident Capital Indem-\nnity (\"PCI\"), was designed to pay out and take over the life\ninsurance policy (so long as the life insurance policy premi-\nums were current).\n\n   Allmendinger and Oncale marketed and sold A&O’s\nbonded life settlements directly to investors, and in early\n2005, they hired Abdulwahab to market and sell their prod-\nucts. At the time, Abdulwahab was selling a different product\nfor a different company, BHC Marketing. BHC soon termi-\nnated Abdulwahab, however, and he began working full-time\nas A&O’s \"national accounts director.\" J.A. 116. Abdulwahab\nowned and operated Houston Investment Center (\"HIC\"), a\nTexas company that served as A&O’s marketing arm.\nThrough HIC, Abdulwahab employed mid-level sales manag-\ners who, in turn, supervised independent A&O sales agents\naround the country. A&O paid HIC its first commission on\nMay 26, 2005.\n\n   In marketing A&O’s products, both orally and through\nwritten materials they created, Allmendinger, Oncale, and\nAbdulwahab lied about many critical facts. For example, they\nrepresented that investor funds were placed in a segregated\naccount dedicated to those payments and used right away to\npay policy premiums up front. In reality, A&O had no sepa-\nrate account to pay premiums and A&O paid the premiums\nonly as they became due. Indeed, A&O commingled investor\nmoney in a general operating account that A&O used for pay-\ning its bills.1 While A&O was operating, Allmendinger,\nOncale, and Abdulwahab misappropriated millions of dollars\nfrom this account for their personal benefit.\n  1\n   The payment of premiums was no small concern because, without such\npayment, policies would lapse, rendering the associated investments\nworthless.\n\f4               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   The coconspirators also misrepresented A&O’s size, staff,\nand record of earning returns for its investors. In 2005 and\n2006, A&O’s websites listed fictional people as company\nprincipals, falsely stated that A&O had offices in multiple\nstates, greatly exaggerated the number of A&O employees,\nand falsely stated that A&O had particular legal and business\nprofessionals on its staff. The sites also stated in July 2005\nthat A&O had \"enabled [its] clients to leverage $375 million\ninto $800 million in less than five years,\" J.A. 120 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), when in actuality, no investor had\nreceived any pay out at that time and Abdulwahab had been\ninformed of that fact. Abdulwahab assisted in creating the\n2006 version of the website, and his business card listed the\nwebsite address.\n\n   In 2006, Allmendinger and Oncale invited Abdulwahab,\nwho was, at that point, responsible for 80-90% of A&O’s\nsales, to become a partner. Thereafter, the three men each\nheld an equal interest in A&O and shared authority over the\ncompany. Abdulwahab also was added as a signatory to\nA&O’s bank accounts. HIC continued to market A&O’s prod-\nucts, and A&O’s commission payments to HIC remained\nunchanged.\n\n   By late 2006, regulators from different states began to send\ninquiries to A&O regarding its life settlement product, based\nlargely on concerns that A&O was selling an unregistered\nsecurity. These inquiries prompted the three partners to con-\nsult with Florida attorney Michael Lapat, who assisted A&O\nin setting up hedge funds that were backed by life settlements.\nBy early 2007, A&O began offering fractionalized interests in\nthese funds that they called \"capital appreciation bonds.\"\n\n  The three partners agreed that Abdulwahab would serve as\nfund manager. In the course of drafting the necessary offering\ndocuments and disclosures, Lapat used information from a\ndocument that Abdulwahab had completed earlier in 2006 in\nconnection with an unrelated hedge fund (\"the 2006 docu-\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                        5\nment\"). Abdulwahab had falsely represented on that docu-\nment that he had earned an economics degree from Louisiana\nState University when he had neither attended LSU nor\nobtained a college degree from any school. Abdulwahab had\nchecked \"no\" in response to the question of whether he had\n\"been convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere, no contest\n. . . to a felony or misdemeanor involving investments or\ninvestment-related business, fraud, false statements or omis-\nsions, wrongful taking of property, bribery, forgery, counter-\nfeiting or extortion.\" J.A. 262 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). He also had checked \"no\" in response to the ques-\ntion of whether \"[he] or an organization of which [he] exer-\ncised management or policy control [had] ever been charged\nwith any felony or charged with a misdemeanor\" of the type\ndescribed in the previous question. J.A. 262 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). In actuality, Abdulwahab had pled guilty\nin 2004 in Harris County, Texas, to the felony of forgery of\na commercial instrument. The court that accepted Abdul-\nwahab’s guilty plea deferred a final adjudication in his case\nand placed him on a five-year period of community supervi-\nsion. Indeed, Abdulwahab was serving that term when he\ncompleted the 2006 document.2\n\n   Lapat used the 2006 document to draft a biography and the\nA&O funds’ disclosure documents, including the private\noffering memorandum (\"POM\"). In so doing, Lapat discussed\nparticular language with Abdulwahab. Because the POM was\nbased on the 2006 document, the POM stated that Abdul-\nwahab had earned his degree from LSU and did not disclose\nhis felony plea. Although A&O regularly paid commissions\nof more than 10% to its sales agents, the POM nonetheless\nstated that A&O would invest 95% of investor funds in accor-\ndance with its investment objectives.\n  2\n   On June 4, 2007, the court terminated Abdulwahab’s period of supervi-\nsion early and dismissed the case.\n\f6               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   After making the change to selling capital appreciation\nbonds, A&O continued to operate in much the same way that\nit had previously, including using HIC to sell the bonds. A&O\nalso continued to perpetuate various misrepresentations by\ncreating new marketing materials. For example, the three\nprincipals and co-conspirator Eric Kunz drafted a \"History\nSheet\" for A&O stating again that Abdulwahab had earned his\neconomics degree from LSU, and A&O mailed this document\ndaily in 2007 to sales agents and investors. In fact, A&O reg-\nularly utilized the mail to send marketing materials and inves-\ntor documents.\n\n   As things turned out, A&O’s decision to sell capital appre-\nciation bonds instead of life settlements did not stem the tide\nof regulator inquiries. For this reason and because of some\ntension among the partners, Allmendinger, Oncale, and\nAbdulwahab agreed to sell A&O to a company called \"Blue\nDymond.\" Before the sale, however, Allmendinger, Oncale,\nand Abdulwahab helped themselves — for what Allmen-\ndinger believed was one final time — to several hundred\nthousand dollars from A&O’s operating fund. After this raid\non A&O’s coffers, only $2.9 million remained in A&O’s\nbank accounts — not even half of the amount A&O needed\nto pay the premiums on all of its policies up through their\nbonding dates.\n\n   Abdulwahab was retained as a consultant for six months\nafter the sale as part of the sales contract. However, although\nAllmendinger did not know it, Abdulwahab and Oncale had\nconstructed an elaborate secret plan to purchase the company\nthemselves and continue running it. Blue Dymond — the\nbuyer of A&O — was little more than a front for Abdulwahab\nand Oncale; it was an offshore shell company created and\nfunded by Abdulwahab and Oncale with the assistance of\nattorney Russell Mackert and without the knowledge of All-\nmendinger.\n\n   To fund the \"sale,\" Oncale and Allmendinger each depos-\nited $380,000 from their personal A&O disbursements into\n\f                UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                  7\nMackert’s attorney trust account. Under the terms of the sale,\nthe partners were to receive $750,000, with the expectation of\nan additional $250,000 in the 18 months following the sale.\nWhile Allmendinger received his $750,000 check, Oncale and\nAbdulwahab — unbeknownst to Allmendinger — each\nreceived checks in the amount of only $750 and secretly con-\ntinued the business through Blue Dymond. Mackert wrote all\nthree of these checks from his attorney trust account.\n\n  In September 2007, Mackert, at the direction of Abdul-\nwahab and Oncale, also formed another offshore shell com-\npany, Physicians Trust, LLC, in the Caribbean Island of\nNevis. This new company allegedly purchased Blue Dymond\nin order to further disguise Abdulwahab’s and Oncale’s\ninvolvement with A&O. That same month, Abdulwahab and\nOncale hired David White to serve as A&O’s president.\n\n   Through August 31, 2007, the date of the sale, Allmen-\ndinger had personally received $8,455,033.60 from A&O;\nOncale had received $7,303,496.98; and Abdulwahab had\nreceived $2,889,366.70. With Allmendinger gone, A&O con-\ntinued generally to operate in much the same manner as it had\nbefore. However, the remaining principals accelerated their\nmisappropriation of investor funds. Indeed, after the sham\nsale, Abdulwahab and Oncale transferred approximately $10\nmillion of investor funds from A&O’s bank accounts to Mac-\nkert’s attorney trust account, about $5.1 million of which was\nfor Abdulwahab’s benefit.\n\n   All told, A&O signed 843 investor contracts investing a\ntotal of $104,048,660.18 between 2004 and 2008. During that\nperiod, Abdulwahab personally received $8,002,904.78 from\nthe scheme.\n\n   Mackert took over the management of the A&O entities in\nMarch 2008. A&O had stopped taking new investor funds by\nthat time, and Mackert’s role was essentially to make sure that\npremiums were paid, investor questions were answered, and\n\f8                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\ninvestor files and policy files were protected. The policy pre-\nmiums were to be paid in part from $4.6 million that White\nhad paid to Prestige Escrow Company. In March 2009, how-\never, Mackert discovered that Prestige had stolen a large por-\ntion of that money. In the next two months, Mackert\nundertook to determine how much money would be needed to\ncontinue to pay the policy premiums. He concluded not only\nthat there was not enough money after the theft but also that,\neven had the theft not occurred, the $4.6 million \"wasn’t even\nclose\" to being sufficient to pay the policy premiums. J.A.\n522. With A&O lacking sufficient funds to make premium\npayments, Mackert subsequently placed A&O into bank-\nruptcy.\n\n   On September 7, 2010, Allmendinger, Abdulwahab, and\nWhite, were indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia. On\nFebruary 1, 2011, the grand jury returned a superseding\nindictment against the three men. Abdulwahab was charged\nwith one count of mail fraud conspiracy, see 18 U.S.C. § 1349\n(Count 1); six counts of mail fraud, see 18 U.S.C. § 1341\n(Counts 2-7); one count of money laundering conspiracy, see\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) (Count 8); six counts of money launder-\ning, see 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (Counts 9-14); and four\ncounts of securities fraud, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), 77x\n(Counts 15-18).3 The superseding indictment charged that a\npurpose of the alleged mail fraud conspiracy was \"to mislead\ninvestors regarding A&O’s safekeeping and use of investor\nfunds and the risks of A&O’s investment offerings, in order\nto obtain investor funds so that the conspirators could person-\nally profit.\" J.A. 43.\n    3\n    After cooperating with the government, Oncale pleaded guilty pursuant\nto a plea agreement to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and\none count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He received a sen-\ntence of 10 years’ imprisonment. White pleaded guilty to a criminal infor-\nmation alleging conspiracy to commit mail fraud, money laundering, and\nsecurities fraud, and he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                        9\n   After resolving several pretrial motions, the district court\ngranted motions by Abdulwahab and Allmendinger to sever\ntheir respective trials.4\n\n   On the government’s motion, the district court dismissed\nCounts 4, 10, and 16 of the superseding indictment as to\nAbdulwahab. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a). At the close of the\ngovernment’s case, Abdulwahab moved for a judgment of\nacquittal on the remaining counts with the exception of Count\n1 (conspiracy to commit mail fraud) and Count 8 (conspiracy\nto commit money laundering). See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\nRegarding the money laundering counts, Abdulwahab argued\nthat the transactions identified in the indictment did not con-\nstitute money laundering because they were simply payment\nof commissions that had already been earned for sales of\nA&O products. The district court expressed some doubt as to\nwhether the payment of the earned commissions was \"money\nlaundering as opposed to just evidence of the [underlying]\nfraud.\" J.A. 715. Nevertheless, the district court denied the\nmotion as to those counts and as to the remaining charges as\nwell. Abdulwahab then presented his case, which consisted\nonly of his testimony. Afterwards, he unsuccessfully renewed\nhis motion for judgment of acquittal. The jury found him\nguilty on all remaining counts.\n\n   Following his conviction, Abdulwahab moved unsuccess-\nfully for a judgment of acquittal on each count of conviction\nor, in the alternative, for a new trial. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n  4\n    Allmendinger was subsequently convicted of one count of conspiracy\nto commit mail fraud, two counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy\nto commit money laundering, two counts of money laundering, and one\ncount of securities fraud. He was sentenced to 540 months’ imprisonment\nand ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $101,963,048.05. We\naffirmed his sentence on appeal. See United States v. Allmendinger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340-44 (4th Cir. 2013). Mackert pleaded guilty to a criminal\ninformation alleging mail fraud conspiracy and bulk cash smuggling, see\n31 U.S.C. § 5332, and received a sentence of 188 months’ imprisonment.\n\f10              UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n29(c)(1), 33(a); United States v.

Sept. 22, 2011).\n\n   The court then turned to sentencing. Pursuant to an agree-\nment reached by the parties, the court adopted the evidence\nfrom Allmendinger’s earlier-conducted sentencing, and the\nparties also presented additional evidence. Included in that\nadditional evidence was testimony from IRS Special Agent\nJohn Norton that, based on his review of bank records, inves-\ntor listings, and bankruptcy records, investors lost at least\n$101,857,687.11 from May 26, 2005 — when the government\ncontended Abdulwahab joined the conspiracy — until the\nscheme ended in January 2008. Acknowledging that\n$8,287,051.65 had been recovered through A&O’s bank-\nruptcy, the government argued that a loss of $93,570,635.46\nwas foreseeable and attributable to Abdulwahab. Abdulwahab\nargued for a much smaller loss amount for two reasons. First,\nhe maintained that he did not join the conspiracy until he was\nmade an equity partner of A&O on November 1, 2006, and\nthus should not be responsible for the loss of funds invested\nprior to that date. Second, he contended that he should not be\nresponsible for the losses caused by Prestige Escrow Compa-\nny’s theft of A&O’s $4.6 million or by the fact that several\nof PCI’s bonds turned out to be fraudulent.\n\n   The district court rejected Abdulwahab’s arguments and\nadopted the government’s proposed loss amount. Regarding\nthe scope of the activity Abdulwahab agreed to undertake, the\ncourt determined that he agreed \"to secure funds from people\nby using fraudulent misrepresentations.\" J.A. 1432. The dis-\ntrict court found that Abdulwahab \"knew that the representa-\ntions being used to induce these people to invest in A&O\nwere false\" and that he \"helped create some of the false\nimpressions himself.\" J.A. 1432-33. The court specifically\nnoted Abdulwahab’s misrepresentations about A&O’s past\nrecord of success and its scope and his claims that he had\ninvested money with A&O and that his clients had succeeded\nwith A&O. The court noted that A&O was built on a series\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                          11\nof lies designed to make investors feel that their investment\nwas risk-free, when in fact quite the contrary was true, as\nAbdulwahab well knew. The court determined that a person\ndoes not \"have to be a partner to be a conspirator\" and that\nAbdulwahab had joined the conspiracy by May 26, 2005,\nwhen he received his first commission payment. J.A. 1432.\n\n   Citing United States v. Jimenez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1270415\"><a href=\"/opinion/1270415/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n2008), the court determined that the fact that the investors’\nlosses may have been partly the result of intervening causes\nconcerning the misdeeds of Prestige Escrow Company or PCI\nwould not affect the calculation of Abdulwahab’s loss\namount, although those actions could justify a downward\nvariance from the advisory guideline range. In the end, the\ncourt concluded that Abdulwahab was responsible for all\ninvestor losses because they were reasonably foreseeable to\nAbdulwahab as a potential result of his scheme. The court\nreasoned that\n\n      knowing the way that business was operated,\n      [Abdulwahab] knew that they were basically robbing\n      Peter to pay Paul, that, in fact, they were trying to\n      pay premiums on policies as they came in, and it was\n      reasonably foreseeable to him that if the premiums\n      didn’t come in or something happened to affect the\n      business, the scheme would fall on its face as it did.\n\nJ.A. 1434.\n\n   Adopting the government’s suggested loss amount of\n$93,570,635.46, the district court applied a 24-level increase\nfor a loss exceeding $50 million. See U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(M) (2010). Several other enhancements\nincreased Abdulwahab’s total offense level to 43.5 This level,\n  5\n   Although the total offense level was actually 45, an offense level\nexceeding 43 is treated as an offense level of 43 under the Guidelines. See\nU.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A, cmt. n.2.\n\f12               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\ncombined with Abdulwahab’s category III criminal history,\nyielded a guideline range of life imprisonment, capped by a\nstatutory maximum of 3,060 months’ imprisonment.\n\n   The district court stated that it was the \"intention of the\nCourt to impose a sentence of 60 years [720 months] impris-\nonment.\" J.A. 1450. In so doing, the court varied downward\nby 2,340 months from the guideline range of 3,060 months.\nThe court decided to vary downward in that amount in part\nbecause the losses \"were exacerbated by intervening events\nover which the defendant had no control,\" including the\nactions of Prestige Escrow and PCI. J.A. 1449. The court also\nordered Abdulwahab to pay more than $100 million in restitu-\ntion.\n\n                               II.\n\n   Abdulwahab argues that the district court erred in denying\nhis motion for a judgment of acquittal as to several counts.\nWe review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of\nacquittal.

In considering a claim that the evidence was insuf-\nficient to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government and \"sustain the jury’s\nverdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essen-\ntial elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\" United States v.

ABDULWAHAB                           13\nof completed frauds with money that the frauds generated. We\nagree.6\n\n   In Santos, the Court considered whether the term \"pro-\nceeds\" in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1), the federal money-\nlaundering statute, means \"receipts\" or \"profits\" for the partic-\nular crime there at issue. The crime at issue in that case was\noperating an illegal gambling operation, wherein the defen-\ndant employed a number of helpers. See 553 U.S. at 509. At\nbars and restaurants, the defendant’s runners would gather\nbets, keep a portion of the bets as their commissions, and\ndeliver the rest to the defendant’s collectors. See id. The col-\nlectors then gave the money to the defendant, who used some\nof it to pay the salaries of collectors and to pay the winners.\n  6\n    Abdulwahab argued to the district court in support of his Rule 29\nmotion regarding these counts that the transactions identified in the indict-\nment did not constitute money laundering because they were simply pay-\nment of commissions that had already been earned for sales of A&O\nproducts. See J.A. 709 (\"I submit that putting checks in the mail for com-\nmissions that were earned [is] not money laundering under the statute,\nwithin the intent of the statute.\"); J.A. 710 (\"[T]hese are commissions that\nare earned from sales. Respective people are being paid, but it’s not\nmoney laundering.\"). Indeed, before denying the motion as to these\ncounts, the district court expressed some doubt as to whether the payment\nof the earned commissions was \"money laundering as opposed to just evi-\ndence of the [underlying] fraud.\" J.A. 715. Although Abdulwahab could\nhave explained in greater detail why he believed that the fact that the\ntransactions in question were simply payments for earned commissions\nentitled him to a judgment of acquittal, we conclude that he did enough\nto preserve the issue, and we note that the government does not argue oth-\nerwise.\n   The district court instructed the jury that to show that money constituted\n\"proceeds\" of Abdulwahab’s mail fraud, the government needed to prove\nonly that the \"money came from the mail fraud money.\" J.A. 991.\nAlthough Abdulwahab did not object to that instruction, the error he\nalleges on appeal is not an instructional error, but rather an error in deny-\ning his Rule 29 motion at the close of the government’s case. In reviewing\nthat claimed error, we apply the correct law regardless of whether it was\ncharged by the district court. See United States v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782622\"><a href=\"/opinion/782622/united-states-v-ammad-bashaun-perry-aka-benjamin-franklin-moffit/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320\nn.6 (4th Cir. 2003).\n\f14               UNITED STATES v.

Justice Scalia also concluded that simi-\nlar problems would arise \"[f]or a host of predicate crimes.\" Id.\nat 516.\n\n   Representing the fifth vote for the Court’s judgment, Jus-\ntice Stevens agreed that specifically with respect to the gam-\nbling enterprise with which the defendants had been convicted\nin Santos, it was unclear whether Congress intended that \"pro-\nceeds\" would mean only profits or rather that it would include\nall receipts. Id. at 525-26 (Stevens, J., concurring). He con-\ncurred in the judgment only, finding that \"[a]llowing the Gov-\nernment to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating\nan illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practi-\ncal effect tantamount to double jeopardy.\" Id. at 527 (Stevens,\nJ., concurring).\n\n  In United States v. Halstead, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"206117\"><a href=\"/opinion/206117/united-states-v-halstead/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2011),\nwe considered the meaning of the Santos decision in a case\n\f                UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                 15\ninvolving a healthcare fraud scheme. We began by noting\nthat, in the case of a plurality opinion, the holding of the\nCourt is the narrowest holding that garnered five votes. See\nHalstead, 634 F.3d at 277 (citing Marks v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1977)). As for what that holding was, we\nexplained:\n\n    [W]e read Santos to hold that when a merger prob-\n    lem arises in the context of money laundering and\n    illegal gambling, the required solution is to define\n    the proceeds of the illegal gambling business as its\n    net profits. When, however, a merger problem arises\n    in the context of money laundering and an illegal\n    activity other than illegal gambling, because of Jus-\n    tice Stevens’ opinion that would require addressing\n    that situation on a case-by-case approach, we will\n    leave further development of a solution to a future\n    case that presents the problem.\n\n634 F.3d at 279.\n\n   We then turned to the question of whether the case pre-\nsented a merger problem. As the Halstead court explained, in\nthe case of a money laundering statute criminalizing financial\ntransactions involving the \"proceeds\" of an illegal activity, a\nmerger problem can occur if a person is convicted \"for paying\nthe ‘essential expenses of operating’ the underlying crime.\"\nId. (quoting Santos, 353 U.S. at 528).\n\n   In Halstead, Halstead engaged in a scheme in which insur-\nance companies were fraudulently billed. See id. at 272-73.\nOnce a clinic that had been opened at Halstead’s direction\nreceived the payments, it transferred the money to another\ncompany Halstead had formed, which, in turn, transferred the\nmoney to checking accounts belonging to Halstead and his\nco-conspirator. See id. at 273. We found no merger problem\non those facts, concluding that Halstead’s fraud was complete\nonce the insurance company made the payments. See id. at\n\f16                 UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n280. Thus, the money received by the clinic constituted \"pro-\nceeds\" of the fraud, and there was no merger problem with\nmoney laundering convictions based on a transaction involv-\ning those proceeds. See id. at 280-81.\n\n   We had occasion again to apply Santos in United States v.\nCloud, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801392\"><a href=\"/opinion/801392/united-states-v-cloud/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2012). Cloud’s scheme, at its\nessence, involved convincing people to invest in real estate\nproperties that, unbeknownst to the buyers, Cloud had\nrecently purchased for a lesser amount. See id. at 399-400.\nThe scheme also involved falsification of loan applications\nand the payment of \"thousands of dollars in kickbacks to buy-\ners, at least one mortgage broker, and the recruiters responsi-\nble for finding the buyers.\" Id. at 400. Cloud was convicted\nof several crimes, including, as is relevant here, one count of\nconspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of\nmoney laundering. See id. at 399. The substantive counts all\nconcerned various payments Cloud made \"to recruiters, buy-\ners, and other coconspirators for the role each person played\nin the mortgage fraud scheme.\" Id. at 406. On appeal, we\nreversed those convictions, finding that they suffered from the\nmerger problem identified in Santos. See id. at 408. We con-\ncluded that, unlike the payments in Halstead, the charged\ntransactions were payment of \"the essential expenses of the\nunderlying fraud\" because it was only through the promise of\nthese payments that Cloud was able to persuade his cocon-\nspirators to do business with him.7 See id. at 406-08. That the\npayments were made after the services were performed did\nnothing to change that. See id. at 408. In order to correct the\nmerger problem, we defined \"proceeds\" as \"profits,\" as the\nSantos Court had done, and reversed the money laundering\nconvictions on that basis. See id. at 409.\n  7\n    We noted that the same could not be said of the payments in Halstead\nsince the transactions constituting money laundering were not payments\nfor services rendered. See United States v. Cloud, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"801392\"><a href=\"/opinion/801392/united-states-v-cloud/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407 (4th\nCir. 2010).\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                          17\n   On the other hand, we found no merger problem with\nCloud’s conviction for conspiracy to commit money launder-\ning because \"[u]nlike Cloud’s substantive money laundering\ncharges, the conspiracy charge was not tied to any specific\npayment to a recruiter, buyer, or coconspirator\" and \"there\nwas evidence that Cloud used the profits from his previous\n[illegal deals] to finance additional purchases.\" Id. at 408.\nThus, we affirmed the conspiracy conviction. See id.\n\n   Abdulwahab’s case creates a merger problem very similar\nto that present in Cloud. The money laundering counts at\nissue concerned commission payments to HIC sales agent\nTim Bromseth. These payments, like those in Cloud, were for\nservices that played a critical role in the underlying fraud\nscheme in that it was the promise of payment for services ren-\ndered that enticed HIC and Bromseth to obtain investors for\nA&O. As such, Abdulwahab was no different than \"the felon\nwho uses the stolen money to pay for the rented getaway car\"\nor \"the initial recipient of the wealth\" in \"any wealth-\nacquiring crime with multiple participants . . . [who] gives his\nconfederates their shares.\" Id. at 404 (quoting Santos, 553\nU.S. at 516). Unlike the transactions in Halstead, the commis-\nsion payments were essential expenses of the illegal activity.\nThus, the merger problem we identified in Cloud arises in this\ncase as well, and, following Cloud, we correct it by defining\n\"proceeds\" as \"net profits.\" See id. at 409. Under this defini-\ntion, while payment of the commissions may have constituted\nevidence of the fraud underlying the money laundering\ncharges, the payments did not constitute money laundering.\nWe therefore hold that the district court erred in rejecting\nAbdulwahab’s contrary argument and denying his motion for\njudgment of acquittal as to those counts.8\n   8\n     After the Supreme Court decided Santos, Congress amended the\nmoney-laundering statute to specifically define \"proceeds\" as \"any prop-\nerty derived from or obtained or retained, directly or indirectly, through\nsome form of unlawful activity, including the gross receipts of such activ-\nity.\" Fraud Enforcement and Regulatory Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111–21,\n§ 2(f)(1), 123 Stat. 1617, 1618 (2009) (codified at 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1956(c)(9)). With \"proceeds\" now specifically defined, the issue we\naddress today should not recur in many future cases. See Cloud, 680 F.3d\nat 409 n.6.\n\f18               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   The government contends that our reversal of the money\nlaundering convictions should not warrant a full resentencing\nsince all of Abdulwahab’s sentences for these counts were\nordered to be served concurrently with the three consecutive\n240-month sentences he received for Counts 1, 2, and 3.\nHowever, as the government concedes, the error is not harm-\nless in light of the court’s imposition of a separate special\nassessment for each count. See Ray v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111889\"><a href=\"/opinion/111889/ray-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (1987) (per curiam). On the facts before us, we\nbelieve a remand is appropriate so that the district court may\nconsider whether the reversal of the money laundering con-\nvictions warrants any change in Abdulwahab’s sentence.\n\n                               B.\n\n  Abdulwahab argues that his conviction for conspiracy to\ncommit money laundering suffers from the same merger prob-\nlem as his convictions for substantive money laundering and\nthus that the district court erred in not granting his motion for\njudgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge.\n\n   Because Abdulwahab did not raise this issue in the district\ncourt, we review it for plain error. See United States v. Wal-\nlace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1024982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1024982/united-states-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331-32 (4th Cir. 2008). To obtain relief\nunder plain-error review, Abdulwahab must first establish that\n\"the district court erred, that the error was plain, and that it\naffected his substantial rights.\" United States v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180185\"><a href=\"/opinion/180185/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and\nalterations omitted). \"Even when this burden is met, we have\ndiscretion whether to recognize the error, and should not do\nso unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v.\nHargrove, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179539\"><a href=\"/opinion/179539/united-states-v-hargrove/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Here, Abdulwahab cannot even establish\nerror, let alone plain error.\n\n  Unlike the money laundering charges, the charge for con-\nspiracy to commit money laundering \"was not tied to any spe-\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                     19\ncific payment.\" Cloud, 680 F.3d at 408. We therefore consider\nwhether the record contained evidence that could support the\nconviction. See id. Here, the government presented such evi-\ndence relating to the sham sale that Abdulwahab and Oncale\norchestrated to allow them to continue with their scheme once\nAllmendinger ceased his involvement. In anticipation of the\nsale, Abdulwahab and Oncale each deposited into Mackert’s\nclient trust account $380,000 that they had taken from per-\nsonal A&O disbursements, and they had Mackert write\nchecks on this account in the amounts of $750,000 to All-\nmendinger and $750 each to Abdulwahab and Oncale. A\nrational jury certainly could have found that these transactions\nwere intended to promote the continuation of the investment\nscheme after Allmendinger left, and thus that the agreement\nto execute this plan constituted a promotional money launder-\ning conspiracy. See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (making it a\ncrime for an individual, \"knowing that the property involved\nin a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some\nform of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct\nsuch a financial transaction which in fact involves the pro-\nceeds of specified unlawful activity . . . with the intent to pro-\nmote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\"). These\ntransactions — at least the $750 payments — did not consti-\ntute paying expenses or giving coconspirators their shares of\nprofits.9 Rather, they were simply part of a deception that fur-\nthered Abdulwahab and Oncale’s plan to continue their\nscheme to defraud investors once Allmendinger had departed.\nAs such, there was no merger problem regarding these trans-\nactions.\n\n                                 C.\n\n  Abdulwahab next maintains that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion for judgment of acquittal regarding his\n  9\n   In light of this conclusion, we need not determine whether the\n$750,000 payment to Allmendinger would also constitute money launder-\ning.\n\f20               UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\nconvictions for conspiracy to commit mail fraud and for mail\nfraud and securities fraud. He specifically contends that the\nevidence was insufficient to prove that he knew of, and\nintended to participate in, a scheme to defraud. He also argues\nthat he believed that he had no duty to disclose his criminal\nhistory to A&O’s investors and that there was no evidence\nthat his representation that he earned an economics degree\nfrom LSU was material to any investor’s decision to invest.\n\n   \"To obtain a conviction for mail fraud, the Government\nmust prove (1) the existence of a scheme to defraud and (2)\nthe use of the mails (or another interstate carrier) for the pur-\npose of executing the scheme.\" United States v.

To obtain a conviction for\nsecurities fraud under 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a), the government\nmust show that the defendant willfully offered to sell or actu-\nally sold a security through the mails, knowing that he was\nemploying a statement containing either material misstate-\nments or omissions of material fact. See United States v.\nUnited Med. & Surgical Supply Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603778\"><a href=\"/opinion/603778/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97402-38-fed-r-evid-serv-462-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1402\n(4th Cir. 1993).\n\n  As the district court concluded after the trial, the govern-\nment presented \"extensive evidence from which the jury\ncould have concluded that [Abdulwahab] engaged in the\nscheme to defraud\" regarding the mail fraud counts, as well\nas \"ample evidence from which a rational jury could have\nconcluded that [he] engaged in securities fraud.\" Abdulwahab,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4434236</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2-3.\n\n  Evidence showed that Abdulwahab not only was aware of\nmisrepresentations being used to lure in clients, but he was\nmaking such misrepresentations himself. Considering\nAbdulwahab’s central role with A&O, a jury might have rea-\nsonably inferred that he knew of A&O’s misrepresentations\nconcerning its number of employees, its number of offices, its\nyears of experience, and its record of success. Evidence also\ndemonstrated Abdulwahab’s willingness to lie about his own\n\f                 UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB                 21\ninvolvement with A&O. For example, investor Wallace Ben-\nnett testified that Abdulwahab told him in the spring of 2005\nthat Abdulwahab had personally invested all of his investable\nassets in A&O life settlements and that he had several clients\nwho had invested their funds, cashed out, and then reinvested\nthose funds back into life settlements. In fact, evidence\nshowed Abdulwahab had not invested one penny in life settle-\nments and none of his clients had received payment on a life\nsettlement investment.\n\n   Several witnesses also testified about Abdulwahab’s role in\ncreating and disseminating the so-called A&O History Sheet\nand the POM, both of which contained false information\nabout Abdulwahab’s educational background while failing to\ndisclose his forgery plea. Abdulwahab argues that the govern-\nment failed to show that whether he had earned an economics\ndegree from LSU was material to investors’ decisions to\ninvest with A&O. As for the failure to disclose his felony\nplea, Abdulwahab does not contest the materiality of that\nomission, but he argues that his failure to disclose it was sim-\nply a good-faith error insofar as he believed that since the\ncourt accepting his plea deferred adjudication on his case, \"it\nwould be like it would no longer be there.\" J.A. 745. We need\nnot address Abdulwahab’s argument concerning the misrepre-\nsentations of his educational background because the jury cer-\ntainly could have rationally concluded that any suggestion by\nhim that he was acting in good faith by omitting his felony\nplea was belied by his representation, on the 2006 document,\nthat he had never even been charged with a felony.\n\n  Additionally, extensive evidence documented Abdul-\nwahab’s involvement in the sham sales of A&O to Blue\nDymond and Physicians Trust and in the transfer of millions\nof dollars to himself and Oncale. All of Oncale and Abdul-\nwahab’s efforts to hide their connection to, and control of, the\nbusiness further demonstrated that the men were both well\naware of their wrongdoing.\n\f22                 UNITED STATES v. ABDULWAHAB\n   Simply put, as the district court noted, the evidence sup-\nporting Abdulwahab’s various fraud convictions was strong\nand well beyond what was necessary to support his convic-\ntions. The district court was correct to deny his motion for a\njudgment of acquittal on these charges.\n\n                                   III.\n\n   Abdulwahab finally maintains that the district court erred\nin holding him responsible at sentencing for losses of funds\nthat were invested with A&O before he became an equity\npartner. We disagree.10\n\n   \"[T]he determination of loss attributable to a fraud scheme\nis a factual issue for resolution by the district court, and we\nreview such a finding of fact only for clear error.\" United\nStates v.

Rejecting Abdulwahab’s argument\nthat he did not join the conspiracy until he became an equity\npartner in A&O, the court found that Abdulwahab joined no\nlater than May 26, 2005, when HIC received its first A&O\ncommission payment.\n\n   Abdulwahab contends that the district court clearly erred in\nfinding that he joined the conspiracy before becoming an\nequity partner because even if he \"suspected that portions of\nthe marketing information provided by Allmendinger and\nOncale were erroneous,\" his marketing of their products did\nnot amount to participation in a conspiracy. Appellant’s brief\nat 25. This argument simply fails to come to terms with the\nfact that the district court found that by May 26, 2005,\nAbdulwahab did not simply suspect that A&O was obtaining\ninvestors’ funds by fraud, but that he knew they were, and he\nwas acting in concert with them to help them do it. See United\nStates v. Mills, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608859\"><a href=\"/opinion/608859/united-states-v-brian-keith-mills-two-cases-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (4th Cir. 1993) (noting that\n\"the critical inquiry\" regarding whether a conspiracy has\noccurred \"concerns whether the Government proved agree-\nment between at least two persons to concerted action\" (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)).

This\nargument fails, however, for the same reason we held in Allmendinger’s\nappeal of his sentence that the district court did not err in refusing to\nreduce Allmendinger’s loss based on the fact that PCI’s bonds turned out\nto be fraudulent.
