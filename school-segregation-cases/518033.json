Brown, Senior United States District\nJudge for the District of Kansas, sitting by designation.\n\f     Plaintiff-appellants, pursuant to the provisions of 28\n\nU.S.C. 1983 and 1988, appealed the district court’s entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants.   The court exercises\n\nappellate jurisdiction under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. §1291.\n\n     Corporal Martinez was a Wyoming Department of Corrections\n\nOfficer at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlings, Wyoming.\n\nWhile on duty in the \"Shift Command Office\" of the Maximum\n\nSecurity Unit at the prison, he was attacked and murdered by\n\nthree inmates who were attempting to escape.\n     All defendants are sued in their individual capacities.\n\nEach was an employee of the Department of Corrections at the time\nof Martinez's death. 1   Plaintiffs have brought this action under\n\nthe provisions of 28 U.S.C. §§1983, 1988 upon the theory that\n\ndefendants' conduct deprived Martinez of substantive due process,\na guarantee that persons will not be deprived of life, liberty or\n\nproperty through arbitrary and capricious state action.   In this\ncase, plaintiffs alleged that defendants deliberately failed to\n\nensure proper training and supervision of penitentiary personnel,\nfailed to provide safe and adequate staffing, and failed to take\n\ncorrective action to protect Martinez.   More particularly,\n\nplaintiffs claimed that the prison officials knew or should have\n\nknown that an escape was planned by inmates, that they knew of\n\n\n\n       1\n          Judith Uphoff was the Director of the Department of\nCorrections, Robert Ortega was the Deputy Director and Prison\nAdministrator, James Ferguson was the Warden, William Hettgar was\nthe Deputy Warden, and Kenneth Kinney was the Associate Warden of\nSecurity.\n                                2\n\fthe violent tendencies of two of the three inmate involved in the\n\nmurder, and that they had knowledge that the overcrowding and low\n\nstaffing in the \"Maximum Unit\" where Martinez met his death,\n\ncreated dangerous working conditions, which the defendants failed\n\nto modify.   In this respect, plaintiffs relied on a series of\n\ncases which have recognized potential liability for state actors\n\nunder the \"danger creation theory.\"\n\n    The district court sustained defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment, ruling that plaintiffs' allegations failed to state a\nclaim under §1983 under a \"danger-creation\" theory.    The district\n\ncourt further determined that all defendants were entitled to the\ndefense of qualified immunity.    In this appeal, plaintiffs claim\n\nthat the grant of summary judgment was erroneous because there\n\nare disputed factual issues concerning the extent of defendants'\n\nknowledge of the dangerous situation which led to Martinez's\n\ndeath.\n    We review the district court's grant of summary judgment by\n\napplying the standards set out under Rule 56(c) Fed. R. Civ.\nProc.    We must first determine if there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact in dispute, and, if not, then we determine if the\n\ntrial court correctly applied substantive law.    Uhlrig v. Harder,\n64 F. 3d 567, 571 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. den. 516 U.S. 1118, 133\n\nL.Ed. 853.\n\n    After a review of the record, we find that the trial court's\n\norder granting defendants' motion for summary judgment should be\n\naffirmed.\n\n                                 3\n\f     In affirming the grant of summary judgment, we will be\n\nguided by the principles discussed in Uhlrig v. Harder, supra 64\n\nF.3d 567, and Liebson v. New Mexico Corrections Dept. , 73 F.3d\n\n274 (10th Cir. 1996).    In both cases, we ruled that defendants\n\nwere entitled to entry of summary judgment.\n\n     In Uhlrig, the plaintiff was the executor of the estate of\nhis wife, Stephanie Uhlrig, an employee of a state mental\n\nhospital.   Mrs. Uhlrig was murdered by an inmate confined in the\n\ninstitution.   The action was brought under the provisions of 42\nU.S.C. §1983 against administrators of the hospital who had\n\nterminated a special unit in the institution reserved for the\ncriminally insane.   Plaintiff claimed that defendants' reckless\n\ndecision to terminate the special unit led to the placement of\n\nthe inmate who murdered Mrs. Uhlrig in the general hospital\n\npopulation where the deceased worked as an activity therapist.\n\nIn this respect, plaintiff claimed that defendants were liable\nunder §1983 for violating the employee's right to substantive due\n\nprocess by recklessly creating the danger that led to her death.\n\n     In Liebson, plaintiff was employed as a librarian in a\n\ncommunity college, and under a contract; she was assigned to\nprovide library services to inmates housed in the maximum\n\nsecurity unit of the New Mexico State Penitentiary.   A prison\n\nguard was present in the library at all times that plaintiff was\n\non duty until March 21, 1992, when the prison administrators\n\nchanged library hours and the schedule of the library guard.     A\n\nfew days later, plaintiff was on duty without a guard when she\n\n                                4\n\fwas kidnapped, held hostage, and sexually assaulted by an inmate\n\nlibrary assistant.\n\n        \"While state actors are generally liable under the Due\n\nProcess Clause only for their own acts and not for private\n\nviolence, DeShaney v. Winnebago Soc. Servs. , 489 U.S. 189, 196-\n\n97, 117 L.Ed. 2 nd 249 (1989) 2, . . . there are two recognized ...\nexceptions to this rule: (1) the special relationship doctrine;\n\nand (2) the 'danger' creation theory.\"     Uhlrig, supra, 64 F.3d at\n\n572.3\n        In this case, the defendants can be liable only for acts\n\nwhich created the danger that harmed Corporal Martinez.     These\nacts must go beyond mere negligence, since the evidence must\n\nestablish that defendants recklessly created the danger that led\nto Martinez's death, or that they acted in a \"conscience\n\nshocking\" manner which caused a constitutional violation under 42\n\nU.S.C.A. §1983. In Uhlrig, this court discussed the type of\n\n\n\n\n    2\n       In DeShaney, state department of social services failed to\nremove child from father’s custody although there was adequate\nevidence child was abused. The Supreme Court held there was no\nduty under §1983 when child was not in defendants’ custody.\n    3\n       The special relationship doctrine will apply only when the\nstate assumes such control over an individual that an affirmative\nduty is undertaken to protect that person from danger. Examples of\nsuch control include a person who is a prisoner, or is\ninvoluntarily committed to a mental institution. Uhlrig, supra, 64\nF. 2d at 572.\n       The trial court here correctly found that there was no\nspecial relationship in the case of Martinez since he was an\nemployee of the state, a relationship which was consensual in\nnature. See discussion, infra.\n                                  5\n\fevidence which is needed to establish a recovery under the danger\n\ncreation theory:\n\n             . . . many state activities have the\n         potential for creating some danger - as is\n         true of most human endeavors - but not all\n         such activities constitute a \"special\" danger\n         giving rise to §1983 liability. For the\n         state to be liable under §1983 for creating a\n         special danger. . . a plaintiff must allege a\n         constitutionally cognizable danger. That is,\n         the danger creation theory must ultimately\n         rest on the specifics of a substantive due\n         process claim - i.e. a claim predicated on\n         reckless or intentional injury causing state\n         action which \"shocks the conscience.\" (64\n         F.2d at 572)\n\n    We further emphasized that the \"shock the conscience\"\n\nstandard \"requires a high level of outrageousness. . . . (since)\na substantive due process violation requires more than an\n\nordinary tort and that merely allowing unreasonable risks to\n\npersist in the workplace is not necessarily conscience shocking.\"\n\n(Uhlrig, 64 Fed. 3d at 574, quoting Collins v. City of Harker\nHeights Tex., 503 U.S. 115, 128; 117 L.Ed. 2d 261 (1992)(No\n\nremedy under §1983 for employee’s death.)\n\n    In this case, plaintiffs claimed that the defendants\n\ndeliberately failed to ensure proper training and supervision of\nits personnel, deliberately failed to provide safe and adequate\n\nstaffing, and deliberately failed to take corrective action to\n\nprotect Martinez’s constitutional rights.   Plaintiffs claim that\n\ndefendants knew or should have known that an escape attempt was\n\nplanned, and that defendants knew Martinez would be placed in a\n\nlife-threatening situation when he was assigned to the Maximum\n\n\n                               6\n\fSecurity Unit.    It is also suggested that defendants knew of the\n\nviolent tendencies of two of the inmates involved in the murder,\n\nbut failed to take appropriate precautions to protect Corporal\n\nMartinez. 4\n\n     In a lengthy memorandum and order, the trial court fairly\n\nstated the facts giving rise to this action, and thoroughly\n\nreviewed the applicable law pertaining to defendants' alleged\n\nliability.    Plaintiffs submitted numerous exhibits relating to\n\nalleged deficiencies at the state prison, including overcrowding,\ndefendants' alleged failure to properly train and to supervise\n\nits employees in safety measures, excessive turnover in employees\nand inadequate staffing.\n\n     In its ruling, the district court found that it was \"not\n\nentirely clear. . . how the inmates who murdered Corporal\n\nMartinez obtained access to the Shift Command Office in which he\n\nwas working.\" (Aplt. App. B-1, p. 20).    While the official policy\nat the prison was that the Shift Command Office door should be\n\nkept locked at all times, it appears that this rule was not\n\nalways followed because items issued to inmates were kept in the\n\noffice.   The trial court found that \"(t)he materials before the\n\nCourt do not shed much light on what happened on June 26, 1997\n\n\n\n     4\n        Plaintiffs suggest that prison records indicated that one\ninmate was not in segregation although he had a history of\ndiscipline problems, had tested positive for drugs the week before,\nand contraband had been found in his cell. Another inmate had a\nknown history of mental problems and had tested positive for drugs,\nwhile the third inmate was not in segregation although he had been\nidentified as dangerous and assaultive.\n                                 7\n\fwhen Corporal Martinez was attacked and murdered and leave open\n\nto speculation why Corporal Martinez allowed the door to the\n\nShift Command Office to remain open and unlocked so as to allow\n\nthe inmates to gain entry to that office.” (Ibid at p. 21).\n\n       After reviewing all of the evidence submitted by the parties\n\non the motion for summary judgment, the trial court determined\n\nthat\n\nplaintiffs had failed to state a claim.    In so doing, the court\n\nviewed the evidence in this manner:\n           The plaintiffs' claims regarding the created\n           danger are essentially threefold: the prison\n           was overcrowded, understaffed, and training\n           for prison employees was not adequate. While\n           the Court does not intend to suggest that\n           these concerns are not of tremendous\n           significance to employees. . . as well as the\n           general public, they are not such that they\n           come within the established contours of the\n           law regarding the danger creation theory and\n           are not of such a magnitude that the Court is\n           able to conclude they shock the\n           conscience,....\n                          * * * *\n           ... the level of culpability of the\n           defendants in this case must be analyzed\n           against the backdrop of causation. The\n           defendants are not alleged to have harmed\n           Corporal Martinez or have caused his death.\n           The claims against the state actors in this\n           case are a number of steps in the causative\n           chain removed from Corporal Martinez’ tragic\n           death at the hands of inmates Dowdell,\n           Collins and Harlow. Corporal Martinez knew\n           the prison was a dangerous environment within\n           which to work. He had the choice of being\n           employed as a guard at the WSP or not being\n           so employed.\n           (Aplt. App. B, pp. 43-44)\n       As pointed out by the district court, the plaintiff failed\n\nto provide facts which would tie the institutional deficiencies\n\n                                 8\n\fat the prison to the death of Corporal Martinez.      There was no\n\nevidence that he or any other guard was not aware of \"the mental\n\nstates or violent propensities\" of inmates confined in the\n\nMaximum Security Unit.      There was no evidence that the\n\nconfiscation of weapons or contraband, or the presence of drugs\n\nwithin the prison were specifically related to the death of\n\nMartinez. 5     We agree with the conclusion of the trial court that,\n\nunder the circumstances of this case, \"inaction in the face of\n\nknown dangers or risks [was] not enough to satisfy the danger-\ncreation theory's conscience shocking standard.\"      ( Ibid. at p.\n45)\n          We have considered plaintiffs reliance on Sutton v. Utah\n\nState School for the Deaf and Blind , 173 F. 3d 1226 (10th Cir.\n\n1999) and agree with the trial court's conclusion that it is\n\nclearly distinguishable from the situation involving the Wyoming\n\nState Penitentiary.      That case involved sexual molestation of a\nminor child who suffered from cerebral palsy, mental retardation,\n\ntotal blindness and inability to speak.      The school\n\nsuperintendent, the principal, and the child's teacher had been\n\npreviously informed of a prior attack on the child.       These\n\ndefendants assured the mother that this could not happen.         The\n\nSutton case involved a \"special relationship\" situation, an\n\n\n\n      5\n       As the lower court noted, the fact that inmates were tested\nfor drugs and that weapons had been confiscated through regular\nsearches tended to prove that prison officials demonstrated \"an\naffirmative step .... intended to eliminate or reduce risks to WSP\nstaff and guards....\" ( Ibid at p. 44).\n                                    9\n\fexception to the general rule that a state will not be liable for\n\nthe actions of private parties.    Corporation Martinez's situation\n\nwas not in any way similar to that of the child in Sutton.\n\n    Since plaintiffs failed to state a claim for denial of\n\nsubstantive due process under the danger creation theory, we\n\nfurther agree with the conclusion of the district court that\n\ndefendants are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.\n\n    Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of defendants in AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f",

While the official policy at the prison was that the Shift Command Office door should be kept locked at all times, it appears that this rule was not always followed because items issued to inmates were kept in the office. The trial court found that \"(t)he materials before the Court do not shed much light on what happened on June 26, 1997 when Corporal Martinez was attacked and murdered and leave open to speculation why Corporal Martinez allowed the door to the Shift Command Office to remain open and unlocked so as to allow the inmates to gain entry to that office.\" (Ibid at p. 21).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing all of the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court determined that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim.

While the Court does not intend to suggest that these concerns are not of tremendous significance to employees. . . as well as the general public, they are not such that they come within the established contours of the law regarding the danger creation theory and are not of such a magnitude that the Court is able to conclude they shock the conscience,......</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\t*\t*\t*\t*</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the level of culpability of the defendants in this case must be analyzed against the backdrop of causation. The defendants are not alleged to have harmed Corporal Martinez or have caused his death. The claims against the state actors in this case are a number of steps in the causative chain removed from Corporal Martinez' tragic death at the hands of inmates Dowdell, Collins and Harlow. Corporal Martinez knew the prison was a dangerous environment within which to work. He had the choice of being employed as a guard at the WSP or not being so employed.  (Aplt. App. B, pp. 43-44)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As pointed out by the district court, the plaintiff failed to provide facts which would tie the institutional deficiencies at the prison to the death of Corporal Martinez. There was no evidence that he or any other guard was not aware of \"the mental states or violent propensities\" of inmates confined in the Maximum Security Unit. There was no evidence that the confiscation of weapons or contraband, or the presence of drugs within the prison were specifically related to the death of Martinez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We agree with the conclusion of the trial court that, under the circumstances of this case, \"inaction in the face of known dangers or risks [was] not enough to satisfy the danger-creation theory's conscience shocking standard.\" (Ibid. at p. 45)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered plaintiffs reliance on Sutton v. Utah State School for the Deaf and Blind, 173 F. 3d 1226 (10th Cir. 1999) and agree with the trial court's conclusion that it is clearly distinguishable from the situation involving the Wyoming State Penitentiary. That case involved sexual molestation of a minor child who suffered from cerebral palsy, mental retardation, total blindness and inability to speak. The school superintendent, the principal, and the child's teacher had been previously informed of a prior attack on the child. These defendants assured the mother that this could not happen. The Sutton case involved a \"special relationship\" situation, an exception to the general rule that a state will not be liable for the actions of private parties. Corporation Martinez's situation was not in any way similar to that of the child in Sutton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since plaintiffs failed to state a claim for denial of substantive due process under the danger creation theory, we further agree with the conclusion of the district court that defendants are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants in AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Honorable Wesley E.

In this case, plaintiffs alleged that defendants deliberately failed to ensure proper training and supervision of penitentiary personnel, failed to provide safe and adequate staffing, and failed to take corrective action to protect Martinez. More particularly, plaintiffs claimed that the prison officials knew or should have known that an escape was planned by inmates, that they knew of the violent tendencies of two of the three inmate involved in the murder, and that they had knowledge that the overcrowding and low staffing in the \"Maximum Unit\" where Martinez met his death, created dangerous working conditions, which the defendants failed to modify.

The trial court found that \"(t)he materials before the Court do not shed much light on what happened on June 26, 1997 when Corporal Martinez was attacked and murdered and leave open to speculation why Corporal Martinez allowed the door to the Shift Command Office to remain open and unlocked so as to allow the inmates to gain entry to that office.\" (Ibid at p. 21).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing all of the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion for summary judgment, the trial court determined that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim. In so doing, the court viewed the evidence in this manner:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' claims regarding the created danger are essentially threefold: the prison was overcrowded, understaffed, and training for prison employees was not adequate. While the Court does not intend to suggest that these concerns are not of tremendous significance to employees. . . as well as the general public, they are not such that they come within the established contours of the law regarding the danger creation theory and are not of such a magnitude that the Court is able to conclude they shock the conscience,......</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*\t*\t*\t*\t*</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the level of culpability of the defendants in this case must be analyzed against the backdrop of causation. The defendants are not alleged to have harmed Corporal Martinez or have caused his death. The claims against the state actors in this case are a number of steps in the causative chain removed from Corporal Martinez' tragic death at the hands of inmates Dowdell, Collins and Harlow. Corporal Martinez knew the prison was a dangerous environment within which to work. He had the choice of being employed as a guard at the WSP or not being so employed.  (Aplt. App. B, pp. 43-44)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As pointed out by the district court, the plaintiff failed to provide facts which would tie the institutional deficiencies at the prison to the death of Corporal Martinez. There was no evidence that he or any other guard was not aware of \"the mental states or violent propensities\" of inmates confined in the Maximum Security Unit. There was no evidence that the confiscation of weapons or contraband, or the presence of drugs within the prison were specifically related to the death of Martinez.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We agree with the conclusion of the trial court that, under the circumstances of this case, \"inaction in the face of known dangers or risks [was] not enough to satisfy the danger-creation theory's conscience shocking standard.\" (Ibid. at p. 45)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered plaintiffs reliance on Sutton v. Utah State School for the Deaf and Blind, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157630\"><a href=\"/opinion/157630/sutton-v-utah-state-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1226</span></a></span> (10th Cir. 1999) and agree with the trial court's conclusion that it is clearly distinguishable from the situation involving the Wyoming State Penitentiary. That case involved sexual molestation of a minor child who suffered from cerebral palsy, mental retardation, total blindness and inability to speak. The school superintendent, the principal, and the child's teacher had been previously informed of a prior attack on the child. These defendants assured the mother that this could not happen. The Sutton case involved a \"special relationship\" situation, an exception to the general rule that a state will not be liable for the actions of private parties. Corporation Martinez's situation was not in any way similar to that of the child in Sutton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since plaintiffs failed to state a claim for denial of substantive due process under the danger creation theory, we further agree with the conclusion of the district court that defendants are entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants in AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Honorable Wesley E.
