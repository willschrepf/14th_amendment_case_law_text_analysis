For purposes of this\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of\nlaw of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its\npersuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n       **\n          The Honorable Nancy D. Freudenthal, Chief United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Wyoming, sitting by designation.\n\fappeal, Rhodes claims violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504).\n\n       The district court held Rhodes could not establish a prima facie discrimination\n\nclaim under Section 504 and the ADA because certain claims were barred under the\n\napplicable two year statute of limitations, and because Rhodes had not offered the\n\nrequired evidence of a disability that substantially limits a major life activity. Rhodes\n\nargues the district court erred in finding Rhodes is not disabled under Section 504 or the\n\nADA, or in not finding a retroactive application of the 2008 Amendments to the ADA.\n\nRhodes also argues the district court erred in barring claims under the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n       We conclude the district court correctly refused to give retroactive application to\n\nthe 2008 Amendments to the ADA and correctly found that Rhodes is not disabled as a\n\nmatter of law. We also conclude the district court correctly applied the statute of\n\nlimitations to bar certain claims. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we\n\naccordingly AFFIRM.\n\n                                       I. Background\n\n       In 2000, Rhodes was in a serious car accident that resulted in a partial left leg\n\namputation and a traumatic brain injury. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, p. 464. Rhodes was fitted\n\nfor and wears a prosthesis. Id. He claims that his below-the-knee amputation limits the\n\nmajor life activities of walking and caring for himself. Rhodes also claims that his\n\ntraumatic head injury limits the major life activity of learning.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       In 2006, Rhodes had neuropsychological testing to evaluate deficiencies and\n\nrecommend accommodations for his learning impairment. Aplt. App., Vol. 3, pp. 480-\n\n489. The tests evaluated Rhodes’ intellectual functioning against an estimate of what his\n\nfunctioning should have been based on his demographic characteristics. Id. at 482.\n\nRhodes’ demographic characteristics are identified in the report as a 31-year-old\n\nCaucasian male who graduated from high school and is attending classes toward a degree\n\nin nursing. Id.\n\n       Based on these demographic characteristics and without considering any\n\nimpairment, the evaluator assigned Rhodes an estimate of intellectual functioning in the\n\nhigh average range. Id. However, Rhodes’ neuropsychological evaluation placed him\n\nconsistently in the average range of intellectual functioning with some variability. Id.\n\nThe evaluator noted impairment in the areas of reading comprehension, writing to\n\ndictation, sustained attention, verbal and nonverbal/visual memory, speed of information\n\nprocessing, visual perception, and concept formation. Id. at 483. The evaluator also\n\nnoted that Rhodes’ neurocognitive strengths allow him to compensate fairly well for\n\nseveral areas of weaknesses. Id. The evaluator recommended various accommodations\n\nto aid learning. Id.\n\n       In 2006, Rhodes enrolled at Langston, a land grant university that receives federal\n\nfunds. Rhodes provided his neuropsychological evaluation and requested\n\naccommodations for his learning impairment. Langston’s ADA Officer submitted notice\n\nto Rhode’s professors that Rhodes requested the following accommodations: 1) extended\n\ntime on tests, 2) extra time on reading, writing and computer assignments, 3) permission\n\n                                            -3-\n\fto utilize a volunteer note taker, 4) copies of course syllabi to be issued in advance of the\n\ncourse, and 5) special consideration for spelling error. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, p. 225.\n\n       Rhodes successfully completed his first three semesters at Langston.\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, Rhodes claims Langston’s professors denied some of the\n\nrequested accommodations for his learning impairment. Rhodes also complains that his\n\nphysical access to classrooms was difficult due to the location of classes in areas of\n\ncampus that were not readily accessible. In the spring semester of 2008, Rhodes\n\nencountered difficulties in two of his clinical courses. Facing failing grades in these two\n\nclinical courses, Rhodes withdrew from Langston. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, pp. 466-470. He\n\nfiled this lawsuit on August 12, 2009.\n\n                                         II. Analysis\n\n       We review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether any\n\ngenuine issues of material fact are in dispute and, if not, whether the district court\n\ncorrectly applied the substantive law. Viernow v. Euripides Dev. Corp., 157 F.3d 785, 792\n\n(10th Cir.1998). For all issues we review de novo, “applying the same standards that the\n\ndistrict court should have applied.” Jensen v. Solvay Chemicals, 625 F.3d 641, 650 (10th\n\nCir. 2010) (quotations omitted). Because this appeal is from a grant of summary judgment\n\nto Langston, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to Rhodes. Berry & Murphy P.C. v. Carolina Cas.\n\nIns. Co., 586 F.3d 803, 808 (10th Cir. 2009). “On those issues for which [he] bears the\n\nburden of proof at trial, the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and designate\n\nspecific facts so as to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\n\n                                              -4-\n\fessential to [his] case in order to survive summary judgment.” Mountain Highlands, LLC\n\nv. Hendricks, 616 F.3d 1167, 1170 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotations omitted). “We can affirm\n\non any ground supported by the record, so long as the appellant has had a fair opportunity\n\nto address that ground.” Alpine Bank v. Hubbell, 555 F.3d 1097, 1108 (10th Cir. 2009)\n\n(quotations omitted).\n\nA. Retroactive Application of ADAAA\n\n       Rhodes argues for a retroactive application of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008\n\n(ADAAA) to the facts of this case. The ADAAA was enacted on September 25, 2008\n\nand became effective January 1, 2009. Lytes v. DC Water and Sewer Authority, 572 F.3d\n\n936, 940 (10th Cir. 2009). All conduct and issues giving rise to Rhodes claims concluded\n\nin May, 2008 when Rhodes withdrew from Langston. Rhodes filed suit on August 12,\n\n2009, after the ADAAA took effect.\n\n       Rhodes argues under the tests set out in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S.\n\n244 (1994) and Bradley v. School Bd. of City of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696 (1974), the\n\ndistrict court should have considered the ADAAA to be clarifying rather than affecting\n\nsubstantive obligations and rights of the parties. Under this analysis, Rhodes argues the\n\ndistrict court should have applied the ADAAA as it was the law in effect at the time the\n\ncase was filed and the district court rendered its decision, and the district court erred in\n\nconsidering Rhodes’ prosthesis in analyzing Rhodes’ ability to walk or care for himself.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f       The ADAAA was enacted with the explicit purpose of rejecting certain standards\n\nand reasoning of several Supreme Court opinions1 regarding interpretation of the ADA\n\nand to “reinstat[e] a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA.” PL\n\n110-325, 122 Stat 3553 (September 25, 2008). Among these changes was a rejection of\n\nan analysis “that whether an impairment substantially limits a major activity is to be\n\ndetermined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures.” Id.\n\n       The overwhelming number of cases examining this issue have held that the\n\nADAAA should not be applied retroactively, and all circuit courts have so held. See\n\nLawson v. Plantation General Hosp., L.P., 704 F.Supp.2d 1254, 1272-74 (S.D. Fla. 2010)\n\n(collecting cases). The reasoning of these cases is persuasive, which includes concerns\n\nthat congress did not make it clear the ADAAA should be retroactive; there would be\n\n“retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights, liabilities,\n\nor duties on the basis of conduct arising before [the ADAAA’s] enactment,” Lytes, 572\n\nF.3d at 940 (quotations omitted); and the delayed effective date of January 1, 2009 has no\n\nreasonable “time-neutral” alternative explanation other than an intent to provide\n\nprospective effect and “give fair warning of the [ADAAA] to affected parties to protect\n\nsettled expectations.” Id. at 940-41.\n\n       While Rhodes argues there would be no disfavored retroactive consequence\n\nbecause Langston always had an obligation toward disabled students, such an argument\n\nbegs the question of whether Rhodes is disabled. We conclude the ADAAA is not\n\n\n       1\n      Sutton v. United Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and Toyota Motor\nManufacturing, Kentucky v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002).\n\n                                             -6-\n\fclarifying but rather is a substantive change in settled law. As such, we conclude the\n\ndistrict court did not err in refusing to give the ADAAA retrospective application to the\n\nfacts of this case.\n\nB. Discrimination Claims Under the ADA\n\n       To establish a prima facie case under the ADA before the 2008 amendments, a\n\nplaintiff must first prove he or she “is a qualified individual with a disability.” Gohier v.\n\nEnright, 186 F.3d 1216, 1219 (10th Cir.1999). Merely having either a medical condition\n\nor an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA. Therefore, the\n\nfirst issue for consideration is whether the conditions presented in the case - Rhodes’\n\namputated leg and his traumatic brain injury - constitute disabilities under the ADA. To\n\nsatisfy the ADA’s definition of disability, a plaintiff must “(1) have a recognized\n\nimpairment, (2) identify one or more appropriate major life activities, and (3) show the\n\nimpairment substantially limits one or more of those activities.”2 Berry v. T-Mobile USA,\n\nInc., 490 F.3d 1211, 1216 (10th Cir.2007) (emphases added) (citation omitted); see also\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).3\n\n       A plaintiff must “articulate with precision” both his impairment and the major life\n\nactivity it substantially limits. Johnson v. Weld County, Colorado, 594 F.3d 1202, 1218\n\n\n       2\n         Rhodes argued before the district court that Langston admitted he had disabilities,\nand did not specifically argue that he was regarded as disabled by Langston. Because this\nis not raised as error, we will not consider the issue of whether Rhodes meets the\ndefinition of disabled because he was regarded as having an impairment by Langston. 42\nU.S.C. § 12102(1)(C).\n       3\n      Before the 2008 amendments, this section in the statute was 12102(2), and after it\nbecame and now is 12102(1).\n\n                                              -7-\n\f(10th Cir. 2010) (citing Doebele v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 342 F.3d 1117, 1129 (10th\n\nCir.2003) (quoting Poindexter v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 168 F.3d 1228,\n\n1232 (10th Cir.1999))). It is undisputed between the parties that Rhodes has physical and\n\nmental impairments and that walking, caring for one’s self and learning are major life\n\nactivities. However, the question is whether any of these activities have been\n\nsubstantially limited by Rhodes’ impairments.\n\n       The ADA does not define the term “substantially limits.” However, “substantial[\n\n]” is an inherently relative term, one that demands some further standard of measure - as\n\ndo the synonyms “‘considerable’ or ‘to a large degree,’” offered by the Supreme Court in\n\nToyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 196, 122 S.Ct.\n\n681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002). In speaking of the major life activity of performing manual\n\ntasks, the Court required that an impairment “prevent[ ] or severely restrict[ ] the\n\nindividual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people’s daily\n\nlives.” Id. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681 (emphasis added). It added that the statutory text must\n\n“be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.” Id. at\n\n197, 122 S.Ct. 681. Consistent with this precedent, we have construed the phrase\n\n“substantially limiting” to require an impairment that renders an individual either unable\n\nor significantly restricted in ability to perform a major life activity “compared to the\n\naverage person in the general population.” Johnson, 594 F.3d at 1218.\n\n       As noted by the district court, the sole assessment provided by Rhodes in support\n\nof his contention of a substantial limitation is the affidavit and report of Leanne Buttross,\n\nPh.D., a neuropsychologist who examined Rhodes in 2006. This report placed Rhodes\n\n                                             -8-\n\fconsistently in the average range of intellectual functioning with some variability. The\n\ndistrict court did not err in concluding that the affidavit and evaluation, combined with\n\nthe fact that Rhodes was a successful student for three semesters at Langston, does not\n\nshow that Rhodes is substantially limited in the major life activity of learning.4\n\n       Further, the neuropsychological evaluation is a comparison of Rhodes to an\n\nestimate of a fictional person sharing his demographic characteristics. Aplt. App., Vol. 3,\n\np. 482. These demographic characteristics represent the cognitive abilities of a 31-year-\n\nold man with a high school degree who is attending college courses in nursing, rather than\n\nany comparison to the cognitive abilities of persons in the general population. Rhodes’\n\nneuropsychological evaluation does not answer the question of whether his impairment\n\nsubstantially limits Rhodes’ ability to learn as a whole for purposes of daily living, as\n\ncompared to most people. Rather, it is a comparison to a fictional person sharing his\n\ndemographic characteristics and its purpose was to identify potential accommodations to\n\nhelp Rhodes with demanding classroom and clinical nursing courses.\n\n       The ADA is designed to address the problems that “historically, society has tended\n\nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities”; that “people with disabilities, as a\n\ngroup, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially,\n\n\n\n       4\n         We would note that Rhodes was a successful student even though he was not\nconsistently provided accommodations. Rhodes complains that, in the fall of 2006, his\nstatistics professor denied him additional time in taking tests and he could not find a\nvolunteer notetaker. In the fall of 2007, Rhodes complains he was not allowed additional\ntime to prepare for the final exam and the course syllabus he was provided did not match\nthe textbook. He obtained passing grades in both courses. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, pp. 466-\n467.\n\n                                              -9-\n\fvocationally, economically, and educationally”; and that “individuals with disabilities are\n\na discrete and insular minority who have been ... relegated to a position of political\n\npowerlessness.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2), (6), (7). Congress found that discrimination\n\ndenies this group “the opportunity to compete on an equal basis . . . and costs the United\n\nStates billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and\n\nnonproductivity”; the ADA therefore seeks to offer the disabled “equality of opportunity,\n\nfull participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.” Id. §\n\n12101(a)(8)-(9).\n\n       A plaintiff who, despite an impairment, can participate in all major life activities at\n\nthe level of the average person in the general population neither is denied “independent\n\nliving and economic self-sufficiency,” nor burdens society with “dependency and\n\nnonproductivity,” nor falls within the kind of “isolate[d] and segregate[d]” minority\n\ndescribed by the statute’s text. Therefore, Rhodes’ learning impairments are not\n\nsubstantially limiting for purposes of qualifying as a disability under the ADA.\n\n       Rhodes also argues that it was error for the district court to conclude, even with his\n\nprosthesis, that he was not substantially limited in walking and caring for himself.\n\nRhodes identifies his two surgeries, arguing that they were the result of his overuse of the\n\nprosthesis to attend classes. Further, Rhodes claims to have some difficulty in the major\n\nlife activity of caring for himself. Finally, he argues that when a leg is missing, there\n\nshould be no debate regarding whether a man is disabled.\n\n       For substantially the same reasons identified by the district court, we conclude\n\nRhodes’ amputation and use of a prostheses constitute a physical impairment that is not\n\n                                             -10-\n\fsubstantially limiting. As noted by the district court, Rhodes did not present any evidence\n\nto determine the impact of his amputation and how his ability to walk using the prosthesis\n\ncompares with the walking ability of the general population. Further, any temporary\n\ncondition, such as a wheel chair or crutches post-surgery, does not qualify as a disability.\n\nSee Borgialli v. Thunder Basin Coal Co., 235 F.3d 1284, 1290 (10th Cir. 2000) (the ADA\n\nwas not designed to apply to temporary conditions). We will not address Rhodes’\n\nargument relating to the overuse of his prostheses which resulted in two surgeries because\n\nof our conclusion that these complaints are barred by the applicable two-year statute of\n\nlimitations. Finally, as to Rhodes’ argument that he is substantially limited in caring for\n\nhimself, because of insufficient briefing we will affirm the district court on this issue.\n\nC. Discrimination Claims Under Section 504\n\n       To establish a prima facie case under Section 504, a plaintiff must first\n\ndemonstrate he or she is an “otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” See 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794(a); Hollonbeck v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 513 F.3d 1191, 1194 (10th\n\nCir.2008), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 129 S.Ct. 114, 172 L.Ed.2d 240 (2008). Because the\n\nlanguage of disability in Section 504 mirrors that of the ADA, our analysis of Rhodes’\n\nSection 504 claim is the same as it was for the ADA. See Miller ex rel. S.M. v. Bd. of Ed.\n\nof Albuquerque Pub. Schs., 565 F.3d 1232, 1245 (10th Cir.2009) (Section 504 and the\n\nADA involve the same substantive standards); Cummings v. Norton, 393 F.3d 1186, 1190\n\nn. 2 (10th Cir.2005) (same). Given that Rhodes failed to offer evidence showing how his\n\nimpairments substantially limit a major life activity compared to the average person in the\n\ngeneral population, his attempt to establish a prima facie Section 504 claim fails as well.\n\n                                             -11-\n\fD. The Statute of Limitations\n\n       The district court concluded that Rhodes’ accessibility claims5 occurring prior to\n\nAugust 12, 2007 are barred by Oklahoma’s two-year statute of limitations period.6\n\nRhodes acknowledges his claims are subject to a two year statute of limitations.\n\nHowever, he argues none of Langston’s discriminatory acts can be tied to specific dates\n\nas all were on-going events which only concluded after he was forced out of the nursing\n\nprogram in 2008. We disagree.\n\n       Rhodes complains of specific classroom accessibility and overheating problems\n\noccurring in the fall of 2006, which resulted in an infection from overuse of his\n\nprosthesis. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, p. 266. Rhodes had surgery in December 2006 to address\n\nthis infection. Id. Rhodes also complains of classes he took in the spring of 2007, which\n\nwere located in buildings without suitable ramps or handicap accessible doors. Id. This\n\nagain resulted in overuse of his prosthesis and another surgery in the spring of 2008. Id. at\n\n467. These complaints represent discrete accessibility issues rather than a continuation\n\nby Langston of related and repetitive unlawful acts or practices. Therefore, the district\n\ncourt did not err in barring Rhodes’ claims which accrued prior to August 12, 2007, that\n\narose from the alleged failure by Langston to provide program accessibility.\n\n\n\n       5\n         Given our conclusion that Rhodes does not suffer a learning disability under the\nADA, we need not address Rhodes’ contention that Langston violated the ADA by\nfailing to accommodate his learning impairment prior to August 12, 2007.\n       6\n        Since neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the ADA sets forth a statute of\nlimitations, the Oklahoma two year statute of limitations applies.

For purposes of this\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of\nlaw of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its\npersuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n       **\n          The Honorable Nancy D. Freudenthal, Chief United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Wyoming, sitting by designation.\n\fappeal, Rhodes claims violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nand Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504).\n\n       The district court held Rhodes could not establish a prima facie discrimination\n\nclaim under Section 504 and the ADA because certain claims were barred under the\n\napplicable two year statute of limitations, and because Rhodes had not offered the\n\nrequired evidence of a disability that substantially limits a major life activity. Rhodes\n\nargues the district court erred in finding Rhodes is not disabled under Section 504 or the\n\nADA, or in not finding a retroactive application of the 2008 Amendments to the ADA.\n\nRhodes also argues the district court erred in barring claims under the statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n       We conclude the district court correctly refused to give retroactive application to\n\nthe 2008 Amendments to the ADA and correctly found that Rhodes is not disabled as a\n\nmatter of law. We also conclude the district court correctly applied the statute of\n\nlimitations to bar certain claims. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we\n\naccordingly AFFIRM.\n\n                                       I. Background\n\n       In 2000, Rhodes was in a serious car accident that resulted in a partial left leg\n\namputation and a traumatic brain injury. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, p. 464. Rhodes was fitted\n\nfor and wears a prosthesis. Id. He claims that his below-the-knee amputation limits the\n\nmajor life activities of walking and caring for himself. Rhodes also claims that his\n\ntraumatic head injury limits the major life activity of learning.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       In 2006, Rhodes had neuropsychological testing to evaluate deficiencies and\n\nrecommend accommodations for his learning impairment. Aplt. App., Vol. 3, pp. 480-\n\n489. The tests evaluated Rhodes’ intellectual functioning against an estimate of what his\n\nfunctioning should have been based on his demographic characteristics. Id. at 482.\n\nRhodes’ demographic characteristics are identified in the report as a 31-year-old\n\nCaucasian male who graduated from high school and is attending classes toward a degree\n\nin nursing. Id.\n\n       Based on these demographic characteristics and without considering any\n\nimpairment, the evaluator assigned Rhodes an estimate of intellectual functioning in the\n\nhigh average range. Id. However, Rhodes’ neuropsychological evaluation placed him\n\nconsistently in the average range of intellectual functioning with some variability. Id.\n\nThe evaluator noted impairment in the areas of reading comprehension, writing to\n\ndictation, sustained attention, verbal and nonverbal/visual memory, speed of information\n\nprocessing, visual perception, and concept formation. Id. at 483. The evaluator also\n\nnoted that Rhodes’ neurocognitive strengths allow him to compensate fairly well for\n\nseveral areas of weaknesses. Id. The evaluator recommended various accommodations\n\nto aid learning. Id.\n\n       In 2006, Rhodes enrolled at Langston, a land grant university that receives federal\n\nfunds. Rhodes provided his neuropsychological evaluation and requested\n\naccommodations for his learning impairment. Langston’s ADA Officer submitted notice\n\nto Rhode’s professors that Rhodes requested the following accommodations: 1) extended\n\ntime on tests, 2) extra time on reading, writing and computer assignments, 3) permission\n\n                                            -3-\n\fto utilize a volunteer note taker, 4) copies of course syllabi to be issued in advance of the\n\ncourse, and 5) special consideration for spelling error. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, p. 225.\n\n       Rhodes successfully completed his first three semesters at Langston.\n\nNotwithstanding this fact, Rhodes claims Langston’s professors denied some of the\n\nrequested accommodations for his learning impairment. Rhodes also complains that his\n\nphysical access to classrooms was difficult due to the location of classes in areas of\n\ncampus that were not readily accessible. In the spring semester of 2008, Rhodes\n\nencountered difficulties in two of his clinical courses. Facing failing grades in these two\n\nclinical courses, Rhodes withdrew from Langston. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, pp. 466-470. He\n\nfiled this lawsuit on August 12, 2009.\n\n                                         II.

Retroactive Application of ADAAA\n\n       Rhodes argues for a retroactive application of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008\n\n(ADAAA) to the facts of this case. The ADAAA was enacted on September 25, 2008\n\nand became effective January 1, 2009. Lytes v. DC Water and Sewer Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">936</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 940 (10th Cir. 2009). All conduct and issues giving rise to Rhodes claims concluded\n\nin May, 2008 when Rhodes withdrew from Langston. Rhodes filed suit on August 12,\n\n2009, after the ADAAA took effect.\n\n       Rhodes argues under the tests set out in Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994) and Bradley v.

Under this analysis, Rhodes argues the\n\ndistrict court should have applied the ADAAA as it was the law in effect at the time the\n\ncase was filed and the district court rendered its decision, and the district court erred in\n\nconsidering Rhodes’ prosthesis in analyzing Rhodes’ ability to walk or care for himself.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f       The ADAAA was enacted with the explicit purpose of rejecting certain standards\n\nand reasoning of several Supreme Court opinions1 regarding interpretation of the ADA\n\nand to “reinstat[e] a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA.” PL\n\n110-325, 122 Stat 3553 (September 25, 2008). Among these changes was a rejection of\n\nan analysis “that whether an impairment substantially limits a major activity is to be\n\ndetermined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures.” Id.\n\n       The overwhelming number of cases examining this issue have held that the\n\nADAAA should not be applied retroactively, and all circuit courts have so held. See\n\nLawson v. Plantation General Hosp., L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2448607\"><a href=\"/opinion/2448607/lawson-v-plantation-general-hosp-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1272-74 (S.D. Fla. 2010)\n\n(collecting cases). The reasoning of these cases is persuasive, which includes concerns\n\nthat congress did not make it clear the ADAAA should be retroactive; there would be\n\n“retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights, liabilities,\n\nor duties on the basis of conduct arising before [the ADAAA’s] enactment,” Lytes, 572\n\nF.3d at 940 (quotations omitted); and the delayed effective date of January 1, 2009 has no\n\nreasonable “time-neutral” alternative explanation other than an intent to provide\n\nprospective effect and “give fair warning of the [ADAAA] to affected parties to protect\n\nsettled expectations.” Id. at 940-41.\n\n       While Rhodes argues there would be no disfavored retroactive consequence\n\nbecause Langston always had an obligation toward disabled students, such an argument\n\nbegs the question of whether Rhodes is disabled. We conclude the ADAAA is not\n\n\n       1\n      Sutton v.

As such, we conclude the\n\ndistrict court did not err in refusing to give the ADAAA retrospective application to the\n\nfacts of this case.\n\nB. Discrimination Claims Under the ADA\n\n       To establish a prima facie case under the ADA before the 2008 amendments, a\n\nplaintiff must first prove he or she “is a qualified individual with a disability.” Gohier v.\n\nEnright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158329\"><a href=\"/opinion/158329/gohier-v-enright/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (10th Cir.1999). Merely having either a medical condition\n\nor an impairment does not make one disabled for purposes of the ADA. Therefore, the\n\nfirst issue for consideration is whether the conditions presented in the case - Rhodes’\n\namputated leg and his traumatic brain injury - constitute disabilities under the ADA. To\n\nsatisfy the ADA’s definition of disability, a plaintiff must “(1) have a recognized\n\nimpairment, (2) identify one or more appropriate major life activities, and (3) show the\n\nimpairment substantially limits one or more of those activities.”2 Berry v.

Because this\nis not raised as error, we will not consider the issue of whether Rhodes meets the\ndefinition of disabled because he was regarded as having an impairment by Langston. 42\nU.S.C. § 12102(1)(C).\n       3\n      Before the 2008 amendments, this section in the statute was 12102(2), and after it\nbecame and now is 12102(1).\n\n                                              -7-\n\f(10th Cir. 2010) (citing Doebele v.

It is undisputed between the parties that Rhodes has physical and\n\nmental impairments and that walking, caring for one’s self and learning are major life\n\nactivities. However, the question is whether any of these activities have been\n\nsubstantially limited by Rhodes’ impairments.\n\n       The ADA does not define the term “substantially limits.” However, “substantial[\n\n]” is an inherently relative term, one that demands some further standard of measure - as\n\ndo the synonyms “‘considerable’ or ‘to a large degree,’” offered by the Supreme Court in\n\nToyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v.

In speaking of the major life activity of performing manual\n\ntasks, the Court required that an impairment “prevent[ ] or severely restrict[ ] the\n\nindividual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people’s daily\n\nlives.” Id. at 198, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Consistent with this precedent, we have construed the phrase\n\n“substantially limiting” to require an impairment that renders an individual either unable\n\nor significantly restricted in ability to perform a major life activity “compared to the\n\naverage person in the general population.” Johnson, 594 F.3d at 1218.\n\n       As noted by the district court, the sole assessment provided by Rhodes in support\n\nof his contention of a substantial limitation is the affidavit and report of Leanne Buttross,\n\nPh.D., a neuropsychologist who examined Rhodes in 2006. This report placed Rhodes\n\n                                             -8-\n\fconsistently in the average range of intellectual functioning with some variability. The\n\ndistrict court did not err in concluding that the affidavit and evaluation, combined with\n\nthe fact that Rhodes was a successful student for three semesters at Langston, does not\n\nshow that Rhodes is substantially limited in the major life activity of learning.4\n\n       Further, the neuropsychological evaluation is a comparison of Rhodes to an\n\nestimate of a fictional person sharing his demographic characteristics. Aplt. App., Vol. 3,\n\np. 482. These demographic characteristics represent the cognitive abilities of a 31-year-\n\nold man with a high school degree who is attending college courses in nursing, rather than\n\nany comparison to the cognitive abilities of persons in the general population. Rhodes’\n\nneuropsychological evaluation does not answer the question of whether his impairment\n\nsubstantially limits Rhodes’ ability to learn as a whole for purposes of daily living, as\n\ncompared to most people. Rather, it is a comparison to a fictional person sharing his\n\ndemographic characteristics and its purpose was to identify potential accommodations to\n\nhelp Rhodes with demanding classroom and clinical nursing courses.\n\n       The ADA is designed to address the problems that “historically, society has tended\n\nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities”; that “people with disabilities, as a\n\ngroup, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially,\n\n\n\n       4\n         We would note that Rhodes was a successful student even though he was not\nconsistently provided accommodations. Rhodes complains that, in the fall of 2006, his\nstatistics professor denied him additional time in taking tests and he could not find a\nvolunteer notetaker. In the fall of 2007, Rhodes complains he was not allowed additional\ntime to prepare for the final exam and the course syllabus he was provided did not match\nthe textbook. He obtained passing grades in both courses. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, pp. 466-\n467.\n\n                                              -9-\n\fvocationally, economically, and educationally”; and that “individuals with disabilities are\n\na discrete and insular minority who have been ... relegated to a position of political\n\npowerlessness.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2), (6), (7). Congress found that discrimination\n\ndenies this group “the opportunity to compete on an equal basis . . . and costs the United\n\nStates billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and\n\nnonproductivity”; the ADA therefore seeks to offer the disabled “equality of opportunity,\n\nfull participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.” Id. §\n\n12101(a)(8)-(9).\n\n       A plaintiff who, despite an impairment, can participate in all major life activities at\n\nthe level of the average person in the general population neither is denied “independent\n\nliving and economic self-sufficiency,” nor burdens society with “dependency and\n\nnonproductivity,” nor falls within the kind of “isolate[d] and segregate[d]” minority\n\ndescribed by the statute’s text. Therefore, Rhodes’ learning impairments are not\n\nsubstantially limiting for purposes of qualifying as a disability under the ADA.\n\n       Rhodes also argues that it was error for the district court to conclude, even with his\n\nprosthesis, that he was not substantially limited in walking and caring for himself.\n\nRhodes identifies his two surgeries, arguing that they were the result of his overuse of the\n\nprosthesis to attend classes. Further, Rhodes claims to have some difficulty in the major\n\nlife activity of caring for himself. Finally, he argues that when a leg is missing, there\n\nshould be no debate regarding whether a man is disabled.\n\n       For substantially the same reasons identified by the district court, we conclude\n\nRhodes’ amputation and use of a prostheses constitute a physical impairment that is not\n\n                                             -10-\n\fsubstantially limiting. As noted by the district court, Rhodes did not present any evidence\n\nto determine the impact of his amputation and how his ability to walk using the prosthesis\n\ncompares with the walking ability of the general population. Further, any temporary\n\ncondition, such as a wheel chair or crutches post-surgery, does not qualify as a disability.\n\nSee Borgialli v. Thunder Basin Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160540\"><a href=\"/opinion/160540/borgialli-v-thunder-basin-coal/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290 (10th Cir. 2000) (the ADA\n\nwas not designed to apply to temporary conditions). We will not address Rhodes’\n\nargument relating to the overuse of his prostheses which resulted in two surgeries because\n\nof our conclusion that these complaints are barred by the applicable two-year statute of\n\nlimitations. Finally, as to Rhodes’ argument that he is substantially limited in caring for\n\nhimself, because of insufficient briefing we will affirm the district court on this issue.\n\nC. Discrimination Claims Under Section 504\n\n       To establish a prima facie case under Section 504, a plaintiff must first\n\ndemonstrate he or she is an “otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” See 29\n\nU.S.C. § 794(a); Hollonbeck v. U.S. Olympic Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170198\"><a href=\"/opinion/170198/hollonbeck-v-us-olympic-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1194 (10th\n\nCir.2008), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008). Because the\n\nlanguage of disability in Section 504 mirrors that of the ADA, our analysis of Rhodes’\n\nSection 504 claim is the same as it was for the ADA. See Miller ex rel. S.M. v. Bd. of Ed.\n\nof Albuquerque Pub. Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1210963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1210963/miller-ex-rel-sm-v-bd-educ-albuq-pub-sch/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1245 (10th Cir.2009) (Section 504 and the\n\nADA involve the same substantive standards); Cummings v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165406\"><a href=\"/opinion/165406/cummings-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190\n\nn. 2 (10th Cir.2005) (same). Given that Rhodes failed to offer evidence showing how his\n\nimpairments substantially limit a major life activity compared to the average person in the\n\ngeneral population, his attempt to establish a prima facie Section 504 claim fails as well.\n\n                                             -11-\n\fD. The Statute of Limitations\n\n       The district court concluded that Rhodes’ accessibility claims5 occurring prior to\n\nAugust 12, 2007 are barred by Oklahoma’s two-year statute of limitations period.6\n\nRhodes acknowledges his claims are subject to a two year statute of limitations.\n\nHowever, he argues none of Langston’s discriminatory acts can be tied to specific dates\n\nas all were on-going events which only concluded after he was forced out of the nursing\n\nprogram in 2008. We disagree.\n\n       Rhodes complains of specific classroom accessibility and overheating problems\n\noccurring in the fall of 2006, which resulted in an infection from overuse of his\n\nprosthesis. Aplt. App., Vol. 2, p. 266. Rhodes had surgery in December 2006 to address\n\nthis infection. Id. Rhodes also complains of classes he took in the spring of 2007, which\n\nwere located in buildings without suitable ramps or handicap accessible doors. Id. This\n\nagain resulted in overuse of his prosthesis and another surgery in the spring of 2008. Id. at\n\n467. These complaints represent discrete accessibility issues rather than a continuation\n\nby Langston of related and repetitive unlawful acts or practices. Therefore, the district\n\ncourt did not err in barring Rhodes’ claims which accrued prior to August 12, 2007, that\n\narose from the alleged failure by Langston to provide program accessibility.\n\n\n\n       5\n         Given our conclusion that Rhodes does not suffer a learning disability under the\nADA, we need not address Rhodes’ contention that Langston violated the ADA by\nfailing to accommodate his learning impairment prior to August 12, 2007.\n       6\n        Since neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the ADA sets forth a statute of\nlimitations, the Oklahoma two year statute of limitations applies.
