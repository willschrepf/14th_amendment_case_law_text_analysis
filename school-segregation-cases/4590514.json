The\nCommittee comprises the Lieutenant Governor,.the     Speaker\nof the House, and the chairmen of the Senate State Affairs\nCommittee,   the Senate     Finance Committee, .the     House\nAppropriations Committee,    and the House Nays and Means\nCommittee.

Several of your\nquestions ra=    issues that have not been addressed      yet\nspecifically in any court case or any Attorney       General\nopinion in Texas: these are issues of first impression.\nThe first bill with which you are concerned, House Bill\nNo. 699 [hereinafter H.B. 6991 amends the Government     Code\nby adding several sections to chapter     321 governing   the\nState Auditor and       the Legislative   Audit   Committee,\nincluding sections    321.0133, 321.0134 and 321.016, that\ndefine specifically the sorts of audits that the auditor\nmay conduct with the approval of the committee.

The second\nbill with which you are concerned, House Bill No. 2181\n[hereinafter H.B. 21811, amends sections 51.005 and 61.065\nof the Education    Code, and purports to confer joint\nrulemaking authority on the State Auditor and the College\nCoordinating   Board.    Acts 1987, 70th Leg., ch. 823,\n§§3.06, 4.02, at 5712-13, 5725-26. Before we turn to your\nfirst question, we first present a brief history of the\nposition of State Auditor    in order that we may place    in\nperspective the scope of the 1987 amendments.\n\n\n\n                          p. 4225\n\f                                                                    .,i\n\nHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 2     (~~-872)\n\n\n                                                                ?\n\n\n      The position    of   \"State Auditor   and   Efficiency\nExpert,\" an executive branch officer      appointed  by the\nGovernor ', was created in 1929.1 Acts 1929, 41-d Leg., 1st     ?\nC-S., ch. 91, at 222. He was to be '*an investigator       of\nall custodians of public funds and disbursing officers ,of\nthe State and personnel of departments.\"    Acts 1929, 41st\nL-3., 1st C.S., ch. 91, 51, at 222.      He was granted   the\nauthority \"to inspect all the books and records of all the\nofficers,    departments  and institutions   of the     State\nGovernment\" and to   \"investigate the efficiency of the the\npersonnel and clerical    forces thereof.\" Acts 1929, 41st\nL-3. I 1st C.S., ch. 91, 53, at 223. Section 4 of the act\nprovided the following:\n\n        In addition to the other duties provided\n       for said Auditor,      he shall     thoroughly\n       examine all     departments  of    the   State\n       Government  with special regard to their\n       activities and the duplication     of efforts\n       between departments, and the efficiency     of\n       the subordinate   employees in each of such\n       several departments.   He shall examine   into\n       the work done by the subordinate     employees\n       in the several departments      of .the State\n       Government.\n\n          Upon completing  the examination   of any\n       department he shall furnish the head of said\n       department with a report on    (a) the effi-\n       ciency of the subordinate employees; (b) the\n       status and condition of all public funds in\n       charge of said department; (c) the amount of\n       duplication between work done by the depart-\n       ment so examined and other departments    of\n       the State Government: (d) such a system of\n       accounts as will provide      for a uniform\n       system of auditing, bookkeeping, and system\n\n\n\n      1. We note that section 402.026,         Gov't Code,\nreposes responsibility   in the Attorney    General,   inter\nu,    to inspect monthly   \"the accounts of the offices of\nthe state treasurer,   comptroller, and each other person\nresponsible for collection or custody of state funds.\" It\nappears that this provision, which was first enacted      in\n1879 and subsequently   recodified three times before    its\ninclusion in the non-substantive recodification      of the\nGovernment Code in 1985, heretofore has not been enforced.\n\n\n\n\n                         p. 4226\n\f    Honorable Bob Bullock - Page 3    (J&872)\n\n\n\n\n           of accounts for every department of State.\n           He shall also make recommendations to the\n           said head of      the departments   for   the\n           elimination of duplication and inefficiency.\n           A copy of each such report submitted by said\n           officer to the head of the department   shall\n           be forthwith furnished to the Governor,   the\n           Speaker of the House, and the President    of\n           the Senate. Nothing contained herein    shall\n           be construed   as    authorizing  the   State\n           Auditor to employ or discharge     any state\n           employee other than those herein authorized\n           to be appointed by him for his department.\n\n    Acts 1929, 41st Leg.; 1st C.S., ch. 91, 54, at 223.    And\n    finally, he was required, at section 5, to prepare       a\n    report showing the status of all public funds in the state\n    and to +ecommend   to the Legislature  such changes as he\n    deems necessary to provide uniform, adequate and efficient\n    systems of records and accounting in each department.\"\n    Acts 1929, 41st Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 91, 55, at 224.\n\n          The 1929 act was repealed in 1943. The position was\n    renamed \"State Auditor,\" and appointment power was vested\n    in the newly-created Legislative Audit Committee, a joint\n    interim committee    of the legislature.    Acts   1943, 48th\n    Leg.,  ch.293, at  429 [codified  at V.T.C.S.  arts.   4413a-13\n    through 4413a-241. Section 7 of 1943 act continued            to\n    repose in the Auditor the authority to audit all accounts,\n    books, and financial records of every agency of the state,\n    but the act for the first time purported to confer on the\n    Auditor the authority, not just to report to the legisla-\n    ture recommended changes, but also to direct the adminis-\n    tration or execution of the laws by executive            branch\n    agencies themselves    insofar as he was authorized:         \"TO\n    require such changes in the accounting system or systems\n    and record or records of any office, department,         board,\n    bureau, institution, commission or state agency, that 'in\n    his opinion will augment or provide a uniform,        adequate,\n    and efficient    system of records and accounting.\"         Acts\n    1943, 48th Leg., ch. 293, §7(3), at 431.      Section  8 of  the\n    1943 act also required the Auditor to prepare, again, a\n    report for the head of every agency on, inter alia, the\nP\n    efficiency   of subordinate      employees,   the amount      of\n    duplication between work done by the examined agency and\n    other agencies, and \"any suggested changes looking toward\n    economy and reduction of number of clerical          and other\n    employees,   and    the elimination     of duplication       and\n    inefficiency.\"    Section 8 also set forth the following:\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 4227\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 4 (JR-872)\n\n\n\n\n          Reports   shall   also contain    specific\n       recommendations to the Legislature for the\n       amendment of existing laws or the passage of\n       new laws designed to improve the functioning\n       of various    departments, boards, bureaus,\n       institutions or agencies of State Government\n       to the end that more efficient service    may\n       be rendered and the cost of government\n       reduced.\n\n          All recommendations   submitted by    the\n       State Auditor  shall be confined to those\n       matters properly coming within his jurisdic-\n       tion, which is to see that the laws passed\n       by the Legislature dealing with the expendi-\n       ture of public moneys are in all respects\n       carefully observed, and that the attention\n       of the Legislature is directed to all cases\n       of violation   of the law and to       those\n       instances where there is need for change of\n       existing laws or the passage of new laws to\n       secure the efficient 'spending of public\n       funds. The State Auditor shall not include\n       in his recommendations to the Legislature\n       any recommendations as to the sources   from\n       which taxes shall be raised to meet the\n       governmental expense.\n\nActs 1943, 48th Leg., ch. 293, 58, at 432. And finally,\nsection 10 of the act authorized      the Legislative   Audit\nCommittee to conduct hearings with the head of any agency\nwhere the Auditor   has found \"evidence of improper prac-\ntices of financial administration       or of any general\nincompetency  of    personnel,  inadequacy    of    financial\nrecords.\" Acts 1943, 48th Leg., ch. 293, 510, at 433.\nThe committee was required to report to the legislature\nany refusal of the agency officials        to remedy    \"Such\nincompetency  or    the, installation    of proper     fiscal\nrecords.\" Id.     Except for a 1977 amendment giving      the\ncommittee authority to subpoena information that it seeks,\nthe act remained unchanged until 1985. At that time, the\narticles governing the Legislative Audit Committee and the\nState Auditor were recodified in a nonsubstantive revision\nand placed in Chapter 3 of the newly-enacted      Government\nCode. House Bill No. 699 and House Bill No. 2181, the two\nbills about which you inquire, were adopted in 1987 by the\n70th session of the Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4228\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 5      (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n     Prior to the     enactment of    H.B. 699,     section\n321.013(a) of the Government Code provided, inter alia,\nthat the State Auditor shall \"perform an audit of all\ngovernmental accounts, books, and other financial   records\nof any state officer or department.\"  The chapter did not\ndefine \"audit,\" but section 321.014(a) provided that the\nVtate Auditor shall conduct each audit as directed by the\ncommittee and as prescribed by this chapter.\"     With the\npassage of H.B. 699, section 321.013(f) of the Government\nCode now confers authority on the State Auditor to conduct\nvarious types of audits, specifically \"financial ~audits,\ncompliance   audits,  economy   and   efficiency    audits,\neffectiveness audits, special audits, and investigations\nas defined by this chapter.\"\n\n     Sections 321.0133 and 321.0134 of the Government Code\ndefine \"economy and efficiency audit\" and \"effectiveness\naudit\" respectively.  Section 321.0133 of the Government\nCode provides:\n\n       An economy and efficiency audit is an   audit\n       to determine:\n\n           (1) whether   the  audited    entity   is\n       managing    or  utilizing   its    resources,\n       including state funds, personnel,   property,\n       equipment, and space, in an economical    and\n       efficient manner:\n\n           (2) causes of inefficiencies or uneconom-\n       ical practices,   including  inadequacies   in\n       management information systems, internal and\n       administrative   procedures,   organizational\n       structure, use of resources, allocation     of\n       personnel, purchasing, policies, and eguip-\n       ment; and\n\n          (3) whether financial, program, and stat-\n       istical reports of      the audited   entity\n       contain    useful  data    and  are   fairly\n       presented.\n\nSection 321.0134 of the Government Code provides:\n\n          (a) An effectiveness audit is an audit to\n       determine,  according   to established\n       designated prcgram objectives, responsibilyf\n       ties or duties, statutes and regulations,\n       program performance   criteria,  or program\n       evaluation standards:\n\n\n\n                          p. 4229\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 6 W-872)\n\n\n\n\n             (1) whether   the    objectives    and\n          intended benefits are being      achieved\n          efficiently and effectively: and\n\n             (2) whether the program duplicates,\n          overlaps, or conflicts with another state\n          program.\n\n           (b) An effectiveness audit may be sched-\n       uled only when the audited entity     is not\n       scheduled for review under the Texas Sunset\n       Act (Chapter 325).\n\nSection 321.016 of the Government Code requires,      inter\nu,    that the State Auditor report to the Governor,    the\nLegislative Audit Committee,  the administrative head and\nthe chairman of the governing body of the affected agency,\nany evidence of improper practices of financial    adminis-\ntration or \"ineffective program performance\"; the Legisla-\ntive Audit Committee  is required then to report to the\nlegislature any refusal by the administrative head or the\ngoverning body of the agency to make changes    recommended\nby the committee.\n\n     You first ask whether section 321.016 of the Govern-\nment Code, as amended by H.B. 699, is unconstitutional   to\nthe extent that it purports to give the Legislative   Audit\nCommittee the authority to order changes in the way in\nwhich legislation  is implemented  or administered   by an\nexecutive agency. Section 321.016, Government Code, now\nprovides the following:\n\n           (a) If in the course of an audit the\n       State Auditor    finds evidence of improper\n       practices    of     financial    administration,\n       inadequate fiscal records, uneconomical       use\n       of    resources,     or    ineffective   program\n       performance,    the     State   Auditor,    after\n       consulting with the head of the agency,\n       shall immediately report the evidence to the\n       governor, the committee, and the administra-\n       tive head and the chairman of the governing\n       body of the affected department.\n\n          (b) If in the course of an audit the\n       State Auditor finds evidence of an illegal\n       transaction,  the   State   Auditor,    after\n       consulting with the head of the agency,\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4230\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 7 (JB-872)\n\n\n\n\n       shall immediately report the transaction to\n       the governor, the committee, and the appro-\n       priate legal authority.\n\n          (c) Immediately    after   the   committee\n       receives a report from the State Auditor\n       alleging  improper practices     of financial\n       administration,     uneconomical    use    of\n       resources, or ineffective program perform-\n       ance, the committee shall review the report       '\n       and shall consult with and may hold hearings\n       with the     administrative  head   and   the\n       chairman of the governing      body of    the\n       affected department regarding the report.\n\n          (d) If the administrative   head or the\n       governing body of the affected department\n       refuses to make the changes recommended   by\n       the committee at the hearing or provide  any\n       additional information or reports requested,\n       the committee  shall report the refusal to\n       the legislature.\n\n     The various    statutes enacted through the       years\nconferring authority upon the Legislative Audit Committee\nand its effective agent, the State Auditor, reveal a trend\ntoward the conferral of ever-expanding authority on both.\nThe 1929 act      conferred upon the State Auditor       and\nEfficiency Expert the authority to examine the fiscal\nrecords of every state agency and to make recommendations\nto the    legislature    regarding   the   elimination    of\nduplication and inefficiency.   The 1943 act attempted    to\nexpand the authority of the newly-named State Auditor     by\nconferring upon him the power, not only to report to the\nlegislature recommended changes, but to direct the admin-\nistration or execution of the laws by requiring         each\nagency to install whatever method of accounting and record\nkeeping that he recommended.     After conducting  hearings\nwith the heads of those agencies      in which the State\nAuditor found evidence of improper practices of financial\nadministration, inadequate financial records, or \"general\nincompetency of personnel,\" the newly-created   Legislative\nAudit Committee was required to report to the legislature\nas a whole any refusal of agency officials to remedy those\nidentified problems. And with the 1987 amendments to the\nrecently-codified   Government   Code, the State Auditor\nappears to be empowered to \"audit\" not just the efficiency\nand cost effectiveness of an agency's performance,       but\nalso the substantive performance       of the tasks      and\nresponsibilities imposed by law on an executive      agency,\n\n\n\n\n                          p, 4231\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 8 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n .   to determine whether there is \"ineffective     program\n;eZormance.\"   It appears, for example, that inquiry into\nwhether the College Coordinating  Board, for instance,   is\nin fact carrying out its statutory responsibilities   rests\nnow with the Legislative Audit Committee rather than with\nthe Committee   on Higher Education    in the House      of\nRepresentatives and with the Committee on Education in the\nSenate.\n\n     Article II, section 1, of the Texas Constitution\nprovides   for the separation   of powers between     the\nexecutive, the judicial, and the legislative branches  of\ngovernment.   It states:\n\n       The powers of the Government of the State of\n       Texas shall be divided into three distinct\n       departments, each of which shall be confided\n       to a separate body of magistracy, to wit:\n       Those which are Legislative   to one, those\n      'which are Executive to another, and those\n       which are Judicial to another: and        no\n       person, or collection  of persons, being of\n       one of these departments, shall exercise any\n       power properly  attached to either of the\n       others,  except in the instances      herein\n       expressly permitted.\n\n    This office has consistently held that any attempt by\nthe legislature to supervise the implementation of duly\nenacted statutes through the means of a legislative\ncommittee or through some means other than the normal\nlegislative processes (set forth in sections 28 through 40\nof article III of the Texas Constitution) violates article\nII, section 1. Attorney General Opinions MW-460      (1982) r\nV-1305 (1951); V-1254 (1951); and O-4609     (1942).    This\nrule is the rule in virtually every other state that has\nhad cause to address this issue. See, e.9.      Legislative\nResearch Comm'n v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907 (Ky: 1984); State\nex rel.

This\noffice held that only   so much of the  act that created   a\njoint legislative advisory committee to study school   laws\nas an aid to their recodification was constitutional;    the\nprovisions reposing   in the committee   the authority    to\nadminister the law were unconstitutional.\n\n       It is the function of the legislative branch\n       of the government  to make the laws: it is\n       the function of the executive branch of the\n       government to administer  and execute those\n       laws. In the statute under consideration,\n       the Legislature of the State of Texas has\n       undertaken not only to declare what the law\n       shall be, which is clearly its prerogative,\n       but has also undertaken to clothe a portion\n       of the membership of the Legislature,     the\n       Joint Legislative Advisory Committee,    with\n       the authority to execute and administer   the\n       law passed by     the Legislature.

Davis,\n    426 S.W.2d 827   (Tex. 1968); Texas National Guard Armory\n    Board v. McGraw     126 S.W.2d 627 (Tex. 1939).    We are\n    required, moreov&,    to construe the code .provisions at\n    issue in a way that comports with the constitution, if any\n    such reasonable c'onstruction is possible.    McKinnev\n    Blankenshin, 282 S.W.2d 691 (Tex. 1955); Thomas v. Groeby;\n    212 S.W.2d 625 (Tex. 1948). See also Gov't Code, 5311.021\n    (Code Construction     Act): Local   Gov't Code,    51.002\n    (application of Code Construction Act to Local Government\n    Code).\n\n         If we were to construe section 321.016 of the\n    Government Code in the fashion that you suggest, i.e., as\n    conferring authority on the Legislative Audit Committee to\n    order changes in the way that executive agencies implement\n    or administer duly       enacted statutes,    we would     be\n    constrained  to    hold    the   section   unconstitutional.\n    However, we do not so construe that provision.    Subsection\n    (c) of section 321.016 merely confers on the committee the\n    authority to make recommendations to the various executive\n    agencies, recommendations    that each agency may ignore.\n    However, subsection    (d) provides that, if any agency\n    refuses to accept any such recommendation, the committee\n    is required to inform the legislature as a whole of that\n    fact. Subsection (d) permits an ill-disguised attempt by\n    the committee to direct the methods by which    investigated\n    administrative agencies execute the laws. While it is true\n    that the committee itself technically is not conferred the\n    authority to impose sanctions or to enforce compliance     by\n    those administrative agencies that refuse to comply with\n    committee recommendations, the absence of such conferral\n    of authority does not resolve the article II, section      1,\n    issue. Subsection    (d) clearly acts in a punitive,      and\n    perhaps in 6 coercive, fashion that is tantamount to a\n    legislative usurpation of executive power, in violation of\n    article II, section 1, of the Texas Constitution.      We do\n    not question the authority of the legislature or of a\n    committee of the legislature to gather information and to\nP\n    investigate those matters about which     it properly   could\n    enact legislation,   a subject that we will address more\n    fully in answer to your fourth and fifth questions.        We\n    question only the propriety of making a committee's report\n    to the legislature as a whole mandatory upon an adminis-\n    trative agency's refusal to comply with the committee's\n    recommendations.\n\n\n\n                            p. 4235\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 12 (JB-872)\n\n\n\n\n     As a matter of law, the committee does not have the\nauthority to order any executive agency to implement      or\nadminister any law in any particular manner, any more than\nit has authority to direct officers in the judicial branch\nin the construction   of the laws, which the constitution\nreposes   in   the judicial    branch. The    legislature's\nauthority to direct the administration      of laws whose\nexecution is reposed by statute in.so-called   \"legislative\nagencies,\" see. e.g., Gov't Code, §§326.001-326.003,      is\ngreater, 'of course. Accordingly, we conclude that chapter\n321 of the Government Code, which creates the Legislative\nAudit Committee   and the office of State Auditor       and\nconfers powers and duties thereon, does not authorize   the\nLegislative Audit Committee to order an executive    agency\nto change the way in which    it implements or administers\nany law; however, subsection   (d) of section 321.016 does\nauthorize an impermissible intrusion by the legislative\nbranch into areas of administration reposed by the Texas\nConstitution in the executive branch.     Insofar as that\nsubsection requires the committee to report to the legis-\nlature as a whole    in the event that an administrative\nagency fails to adopt its recommendations,   subsection (d)\nis unconstitutional.\n\n     You next ask whether   the State Auditor,    whom you\ncharacterize as, in effect, an employee of the Legisla-\nture, may properly exercise authority to supervise members\nof the executive branch     in their implementation      of\nstatutes or whether his proper role is investigatory only.\nAs we noted earlier, the position of State Auditor      was\ncreated in 1943 to replace an executive       officer, the\n\"State Auditor and Efficiency Expert,\" appointed by the\ngovernor.  Acts 1929, 41st Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 91, at 222.\nThe 1943 act repealed the 1929 act, created the Legisla-\ntive Audit    Committee,  renamed    the position    \"State\nAuditor,\" and conferred   authority on the committee     to\nappoint him. There is no question that the State Auditor\nis an appointee and an agent of the legislature.        &g\nGov't Code, §§326.001-326.003    (authorizing co-operation\nbetween houses    of the    legislature   and   leaislative\nagencies) (formerly codified as article 5429g, V.T.C.S.);\nsee also Attorney General Opinions MB-192 (1980): H-1063\n(1977); V-504 (1948). Accordingly,    we conclude that the\nState Auditor is a subordinate of the legislative branch.\n\n     For the reasons set forth in answer to your     first\nquestion, if we were to construe chapter 321 as conferring\non the State Auditor the authority to order any changes in\nthe way in which executive agencies administer the laws,\nwe would be constrained   to declare any such provisions\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4236\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 13 04-872)\n\n\n\n\nunconstitutional as a violation of article II, section   1,\nof the Texas Constitution.   And, again, for the reasons\nset forth in answer to your first question, we do not\nconstrue any provision  of chapter 321 of the Government\nCode as conferring authority on the State Auditor to order\nexecutive agencies to change the way in which statutes are\nimplemented or administered.   If the State Auditor were\npart of the executive branch whose activities          were\ndirected, as they were prior to the 1943 enactment, by the\nGovernor rather than by the Legislative Audit Committee,\nhis authority possibly could be broader.  But such is not\nthe case.\n\n     Section 321.013 of the Government Code sets forth the\npowers and duties of the State Auditor and provides:\n\n           (a) The State   Auditor shall    conduct\n       audits of all departments, including  insti-\n       tutions of higher education, as specified in\n       the audit plan. At the direction     of the\n       committee, the State Auditor shall conduct\n       .an audit or investigation   of any entity\n       receiving funds from the state.\n\n           (b) The State Auditor shall conduct the\n       audits in accordance with generally accepted\n       auditing standards as prescribed      by the\n       American   Institute   of Certified    Public\n       Accountants,   the Governmental    Accounting\n       Standards Board, the United States General\n       Accounting Office, or other professionally\n       recognized entities that prescribe   auditing\n       standards.\n\n           (c) The State Auditor shall determine the\n       audit plan for the state for each fiscal\n       year.    In devising the    plan, the State\n       Auditor    shall   consider   recommendations\n       concerning coordination of agency functions\n       made by the committee composed       of    the\n       Legislative Budget Board, Sunset Advisory\n       Commission, and State Auditor's Office. The\n       plan shall provide   for auditing of federal\n       programs at least once in each fiscal bien-\n       nium and shall ensure that audit reguire-\n       ments of all bond covenants and other credit\n       or financial agreements are satisfied.

Nothing in these sections or in section 321.016,\npurports to confer any authority upon the State Auditor to\ndirect the activities of state agencies.\n\n     In your third question you ask whether        sections\n51.005 and 61.065 of the Education Code, as amended by\nH.B. 2181, are unconstitutional insofar as they purport to\nallow the State Auditor,     an agent of the legislative\nbranch, to prescribe    administrative   rules for    state\ninstitutions of higher education.      Prior to the 1987\namendments, the authority to prescribe such administrative\nrules was reposed solely in the College Coordinating\nBoard. In a letter accompanying a brief submitted to this\noffice by the State Auditor, it is urged that, if it is\nconstitutional for the legislature to delegate to a member\nof the executive branch the authority properly to promul-\ngate rules that have the force and effect of law, it is\ncertainly constitutional for the legislature to delegate\nsuch authority to a member of the legislative branch.    We\ndisagree; we conclude that the amended sections of the\nEducation   Code are unconstitutional    insofar as    they\npurport to confer joint rulemaking authority on the State\nAuditor and the College Coordinating Board.\n\n     Section 51.005 of the EducationCode     provides:\n\n           (a) True and full accounts shall be kept\n       by the governing board and by the employees\n       of the institution of all funds collected\n       from all sources and of all sums paid out\n       and the persons to whom and the purposes for\n       which the sums are paid.

Walker\nv. Baker, m.      The legislature,   of course, may in the\nfirst instance severely     restrict the discretion      of\nexecutive officers or administrators   to make rules by so\nthoroughly detailing  legislation before    it leaves its\nambit that little or no room is left for administrative\ninterpretation.  &g Fire DsDartment    f Citv of Fort Worth\nv.

Article   III,\n    section 1, of the constitution vests the legislative power\n    of the state \"in a Senate and House of Representatives,\n    which together  shall be styled 'The Legislature of the\n    State of Texas.\"' Sections 29 through 40 of that article\n    detail at great length the manner in which the legislature.\n    must exercise its right to legislate.    Because the means\n    by which the legislature is to accomplish the enactment of\n    laws is expressly provided by the constitution,        any\n    authority for the legislature to exercise that right in a\n    different mode is excluded.    m   Walker v.

It is\n    contended that the older view, perhaps best exemplified by\n    Kilbourn v. Thomnson, 103 U.S. 168 (1880), has been dis-\n    carded in favor of a more flexible construction of the\n    constitutional provision.  In Kilbourn v.

United\nStates, 276 U.S. 394 (1928):\n\n       Our   Federal     Constitution  and     State\n       Constitutions of this country divide the\n       governmental   power   into three    branches\n       . . . . [T]he rule is . . . in carrying   out\n       that constitutional    division into    three\n       branches it is a breach of the fundamental\n       law if Congress gives up its legislative\n       power and transfers it to the President    or\n       to the Judicial branch, or if by law it\n       attempts to invest itself or its members\n       with either executive or judicial power.\n       This is not to say that the'three    branches\n       are not coordinate Darts of one government\n       and that each in the field of its duties may\n       not invoke the action of the other two\n       branches insofar as the action invoked shall\n       not be an assumvtion of the Constitutional\n       field of action of another branch.

But see, Singer,       2a\n        Sutherland on Statuto rv Construction, 53.07. The rule    as\n        stated in Sutherland seems to be:\n\n               This interpretation of the doctrine permits\n               the exercise by one department      of some\n               powers of the other departments when it is\n               essential to the discharge    of a primary\n               function, when it is not an assumption   of\n               the whole power of another department,  and\n               when the exercise of the other power does\n               not jeopardize individual liberty.\n\n        Id. at 83.06 (and cases cited therein).\n\n             The'argument that. Texas adopts the more modern view\n    P\n        rests primarily   upon language found in a case that\n        received no review by the Supreme Court, Coates v.\n        Windham, 613 S.W.Zd 572 (Tex. Civ. App. - Austin 1981, no\n        writ), which upheld an appropriations     act rider that\n        conferred upon certain, specified public officers the\n        limited and negative power of declining   approval of any\n        particular prison site proposed by the Department      of\n        Corrections.  The relevant passage provides:\n\n               We believe that it is well settled that this\n               constitutional   prohibition   [providing for\n               separation of powers] states a princivle      of\n               government and not a rigid classification as\n               in a table of organization. This provision\n               must be     interpreted along     with    other\n               constitutional provisions, and when this is\n               done it is clear that the Constitution      does\n               three things:   (1) it provides     for three\n               polar functions of      government;    (2)    it\n               delegates certain powers to each of the\n               three departments in a distribution of all\n               governmental   powers;   and  (3) it     blends\nP\n               legislative, executive, and judicial powers\n               in a great many cases. [Footnote omitted.]\n               The proper   interpretation   of Article     II,\n               section   1  is  therefore dictated by its\n               context. The proper interpretation is that\n               this provision   prohibits   a transfer    of a\n\n\n\n                                  p. 4245\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 22 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n       whole mass of powers from one department  to\n       another and it prohibits   a person of one\n       branch from exercising a power historically             --..\n       or inherently belonging  to another depart-\n       ment. It may not be interpreted    in a way\n       that prevents  cooperation  or coordination\n       between two or more branches of government,\n       hindering altogether effective governmental\n       action. It was designed,     as were other\n       checks and balances, to prevent    excesses.\n       (Emphasis in original).\n\n613 S.W.2d 572 at 576.\n\n      For purposes of this discussion, we are not prepared\n to accept the proposition    that Texas adopts the more\n modern, flexible construction of the separation of powers\n doctrine, absent a definite ruling of the Texas Supreme\n Court. We note that it is only under that construction\n that article II, section 1, would permit the legislature,\n or more specifically a joint interim committee thereof, to\n'appoint the State Auditor, since the appointment    power,\n except for specific constitutional    provisions  reposing\n such authority in others, is historically one that inheres\n in the office of Governor.   See, Walker v. Baker, w.\n Because you do not ask about the constitutionality of the\n statute pursuant to which the State Auditor is appointed,\n we need not resolve that issue.      But even this more\n flexible construction   will not    permit the sort      of\n intrusion that the Education Code amendments contemplate.\n\n      In State Board of Insurance v. Betts, 308 S.W.Zd 846\n(Tex. 1958), the court held that, in an instance in which\nthe attorney  for a statutory receiver   for an insurance\ncompany resigned and the board of insurance commissioners\ndid not designate a successor,    the district  judge had\ndiscretionary  power to appoint an attorney      for    the\nreceiver, since he had judicial control or supervision   of\nthe receivership    case.  The   statute then in      force\nconferred appointment authority upon the board. The court\nseemed to accept the modern construction of the separation\nof powers principle when it rejected a challenge to the\njudge's action under article II, section 1. But the court\nstated, at 851-852:\n                                                               -I\n        However the controlling  factor in settling\n        the constitutional  point presented  is the\n        presence or absence of interference with the\n        effective judicial control occasioned by the\n        executive power to select a liquidator.\n        . . . It is onlv when the functioning of the\n\n\n                          p. 4246\n\f        Honorable Bob Bullock - Page 23 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n               judicial orocess in a field constitutionally\n               committed to the control of the courts      is\n               interfered  with    bv   the   executive    or\n               legislative branches th t      constitutional\n               problem arises.   (Emphas?s zdded.)\n\n             Analogously, we conclude that the Education        Code\n        amendments about which you inquire permit the legislature,\n        or more specifically an effective agent of a committee    of\n        the legislature, to interfere with the proper    functioning\n        of an executive branch agency in a field constitutionally\n        committed to its control,     i.e. the proper execution   or\n        administration of the law and the responsibilities      duly\n        imposed upon it by statute. Our construction of article\n        II, section 1, and article III, section 1, suggests that\n        the State Auditor may. not constitutionally        prescribe\n        accounting and record keeping procedures for all state\n        agencies. There is no question that the legislature        is\n        authorized to prescribe the accounting and record keeping\n        procedures to be followed by state agencies.          It is\n        doubtful, however, whether the State Auditor        and the\n        Legislative Audit Committee may prescribe such procedures.\n    -\n        Although such authority has been conferred by statute\n        sinc.e 1943, general acquiescence in a custom which may not\n        have resulted in a harmful violation of the constitution\n        does not nreclude    a contest when substantial rights are\n        insisted upon. Citv of Los Anaeles v. Los Anaeies       City\n        Water Co., 177 U.S. 558 (1919).     If it be urged that the\n        result that we reach here is unrealistic, impractical, and\n        inefficient, we note the words of the United          States\n        Supreme Court in the recent case of Immiciration and\n        Naturalization Service v.

But it is in no way certain     that\narticle III, section 49a, fails to set forth the manner or\nform by which you are required to perform your duty. See.\n-,    Attorney   General Opinion WW-640     (1959) (holding\nunconstitutional   in part the predecessor      statute    to\narticle 4348a, V.T.C.S., now codified as Government     Code,\n§5403.013,   403.121-403.122).   This. office declared     in\nAttorney General Opinion JM-666 (1987):\n\n          In Attorney     General    Opinion   WW-640\n       (1959),   Attorney    General    Will   Wilson\n       considered the constitutionality    of a bill\n       that, among other things,       attempted    to\n       control the Comptroller's   estimates of the\n       outstanding but undisbursed     appropriations\n       to be expected at the end of a biennium.\n       The opinion concluded, 'Insofar as this bill\n       attempts to make estimates it is unconstitu-\n       tional as a legislative     invasion of the\n       duties of the comptroller.'\n\n          The bill at issue there, with the offend-\n       ing provision   'making estimates1    deleted,\n       became article     4348a,   V.T.C.S.,    still\n       extant. The remainder of the bill, in the\n       form it was considered by Attorney     General\n       Wilson, was characterized as an instruction\n       to the     Comptroller  'to   use the     cash\n       accounting    basis'   and   was   pronounced\n       constitutional inasmuch as, according to the\n       opinion:\n\n          Reading Section 49a of Article III from\n          its four corners, it is our opinion that\n          this constitutional   provision    contem-\n          plates that the Comptroller,    in making\n          his estimate for certification of bills,\n          use the cash accounting method.\n\n          Thus, article 4348a. V.T.C.S.. is to be\n       read not as a legislative mandate   defininq\n       the Dower of the Comntroller under section\n       49a with resoect to certifications or esti-\n       mates made for the ourvose. but. rather. as\n       a direction that he conform to the reciuire-\n       ments of section 49a itself bv usina the\n       cash accountins  method in arriving at his\n       estimates  for   that nurnose.     (Emphasis\n       added.)\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4250\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 27 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n     For purposes of this opinion, we accept the assertion\nthat the means and manner by which you must perform     the\nbudget   certification/revenue    estimate    certification\nprocesses are set forth in the constitution with suffic-\nient specificity   such that the legislature    is without\nauthority, absent a constitutional    amendment, to direct\nyou in the manner   in which you carry out your constitu-\ntional responsibilities.   It necessarily follows that the\nlegislature is without authority to inquire into the\nmanner and method by which you arrive at the budget\ncertification/revenue estimate figures, if the purpose for\nwhich it seeks the information'is    to enact legislation.\nBut, article XVII, section 1, of the Texas Constitution\nreposes in the legislature   the sole authority to propose\namendments to the constitution;    the issue then focuses\nupon the authority of the legislature to inquire into the\nmanner and method by which you perform your constitutional\nduties if such inquiry is done in aid of determining     the\nneed for any such amendments.\n\n     We are not unmindful    of the importance    of this\nquestion: indeed, it goes to the very heart of the nature\nof the kind of government   that we have. Texas, unlike\nmany states; sets forth in its constitution the duties and\nresponsibilities of many of its state officers.     If we\npermit the State Auditor and the Legislative Audit Commit-\ntee, under the guise of performing \"economy and efficiency\naudits\" or \"effectiveness   audits\" to inquire   into the\nmanner by which you perform the duties reposed in you by\nthe constitution of this state, we perforce would have to\npermit such an E'audit@'inquiry into the manner in which\nother constitutional officers perform their constitutional\nduties. We would have to permit the Legislative      Audit\nCommittee and the State Auditor to inquire into the manner\nby which the Governor exercises his appointment power and\nhis authority   to veto legislation. We would have to\npermit the Legislative Audit Committee      and the State\nAuditor to inquire into the manner in which the justices\nof the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals administer their respective caseloads and deliber-\nate and arrive at their decisions.      We would have to\npermit the Legislative Audit Committee      and the State\nAuditor to inquire into the manner in which the Attorney\nGeneral advises and represents state agencies.\n\n     We do not resolve here the issue as to the scope that\nany such legislative inquiry could possess. We think that\nyour question raises the significant issue as to whether\nthe direction or guidance instructing any such investigat-\ning committee must be reasonably specific and whether  any\n\n\n\n                         p. 4251\n\f    Honorable Bob Bullock - Page 28 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n    resolution   constituting   such investigation     must    be\n    inveighed with sufficient   dignity to convey the extreme\n    significance of what is undertaken.   We question whether a\n    mere decision by the State Auditor     and the Legislative\n    Audit Committee to so investigate,     under the guise of\n    conducting   an \"economy and efficiency     audit\" or      an\n    \"effectiveness   audit,\"  is sufficient.    We need      not,\n    however, determine whether the State Auditor        and the\n    Legislative Audit Committee may conduct an \"economy and\n    efficiency audit\" or an \"effectiveness     audit\"   for the\n    purpose of making an inquiry into the manner in which you\n    perform  the    duties reposed    in you    by the      Texas\n    Constitution.   We need note only that nothing       in the\n    Government Code purports to confer such authority in the\n    first place. Subsection    (e) of section 321.013 permits\n    the Auditor to examine, for example, whether   subscription\n    material exists, but not the use to which it is put.      Nor\n    does it authorize an inquiry into discretionary    decision-\n    making by you that is personal to you as a constitutional\n    officer. We add that the Legislative Audit Committee,      of\n    course, has no authority   to direct you in the manner     in\n    which the budget certification/revenue    estimate   figures\n    are derived.\n\n         Finally, you ask whether the State Auditor has the\n.   authority to direct an executive agency or officer to seek\n    amendments to the laws or to evaluate the agency or\n    officer on the basis of whether      such amendments   are\n    sought. The answer to your question is clearly %o.\"\n\n         It is well established that a state agency has only\n    those powers expressly granted to it by statute          or\n    necessarily implied from the statutory authority conferred\n    or duties  imposed.

No provision   in chapter  321 of the\n       Government Code, which sets forth the duties\n       of the State Auditor and the Legislative\n      ,.Audit Committee,    purports   to    confer\n       authority  on   the committee    to   direct\n       executive agencies  in the manner in which\n       they execute or administer the laws.\n\n          2. No provision   in chapter 321 of the\n       Government Code purports to confer authority\n       on the State Auditor to direct executive\n       agencies in the manner in which they execute\n       or administer the laws.\n\n          3. Sections 51.005 and 61.005       of the\n       Education Code are unconstitutional    insofar\n       as they purport to confer authority    on the\n       State Auditor to promulgate    rules   jointly\n       with the College Coordinating Board.\n\n          4. Legislative committees properly may\n       gather information and conduct investiga-\n       tions upon any matters about which legisla-\n       tion may be enacted.\n\n           5. Because    the   Texas     Constitution\n       reposes in the legislature sole authority to\n       propose constitutional amendments,    legisla-\n       tive committees may gather information     and\n       conduct investigations in aid of such auth-\n       ority. However, it is questionable whether a\n       mere decision by the Legislative         Audit\n       Committee   and the State Auditor to         so\n       investigate, under the guise of conducting\n       an \"economy and efficiency audit\" or an\n       \"effectiveness   audit,\" is sufficient       to\n       permit such a serious intrusion      into the\n       performance   of   constitutionally    imposed\n       duties as is here contemplated by an inquiry\n       into the methods and means whereby         you\n       derive the     budget   certification/revenue\n       estimate  figures. This issue need not be\n       decided, because nothing in the Government\n       Code purports to confer the authority        to\n       conduct such an inquiry in the first place.\n       The Legislative Audit Committee may not\n       direct the manner   in which the Comptroller\n       derives such estimates.\n\n\n\n                         p. 4253\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 30 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n          6.

He shall examine   into\n       the work done by the subordinate     employees\n       in the several departments      of .the State\n       Government.\n\n          Upon completing  the examination   of any\n       department he shall furnish the head of said\n       department with a report on    (a) the effi-\n       ciency of the subordinate employees; (b) the\n       status and condition of all public funds in\n       charge of said department; (c) the amount of\n       duplication between work done by the depart-\n       ment so examined and other departments    of\n       the State Government: (d) such a system of\n       accounts as will provide      for a uniform\n       system of auditing, bookkeeping, and system\n\n\n\n      1. We note that section 402.026,         Gov't Code,\nreposes responsibility   in the Attorney    General,   inter\nu,    to inspect monthly   \"the accounts of the offices of\nthe state treasurer,   comptroller, and each other person\nresponsible for collection or custody of state funds.\" It\nappears that this provision, which was first enacted      in\n1879 and subsequently   recodified three times before    its\ninclusion in the non-substantive recodification      of the\nGovernment Code in 1985, heretofore has not been enforced.\n\n\n\n\n                         p. 4226\n\f    Honorable Bob Bullock - Page 3    (J&872)\n\n\n\n\n           of accounts for every department of State.\n           He shall also make recommendations to the\n           said head of      the departments   for   the\n           elimination of duplication and inefficiency.\n           A copy of each such report submitted by said\n           officer to the head of the department   shall\n           be forthwith furnished to the Governor,   the\n           Speaker of the House, and the President    of\n           the Senate. Nothing contained herein    shall\n           be construed   as    authorizing  the   State\n           Auditor to employ or discharge     any state\n           employee other than those herein authorized\n           to be appointed by him for his department.\n\n    Acts 1929, 41st Leg.; 1st C.S., ch. 91, 54, at 223.    And\n    finally, he was required, at section 5, to prepare       a\n    report showing the status of all public funds in the state\n    and to +ecommend   to the Legislature  such changes as he\n    deems necessary to provide uniform, adequate and efficient\n    systems of records and accounting in each department.\"\n    Acts 1929, 41st Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 91, 55, at 224.\n\n          The 1929 act was repealed in 1943. The position was\n    renamed \"State Auditor,\" and appointment power was vested\n    in the newly-created Legislative Audit Committee, a joint\n    interim committee    of the legislature.    Acts   1943, 48th\n    Leg.,  ch.293, at  429 [codified  at V.T.C.S.  arts.   4413a-13\n    through 4413a-241. Section 7 of 1943 act continued            to\n    repose in the Auditor the authority to audit all accounts,\n    books, and financial records of every agency of the state,\n    but the act for the first time purported to confer on the\n    Auditor the authority, not just to report to the legisla-\n    ture recommended changes, but also to direct the adminis-\n    tration or execution of the laws by executive            branch\n    agencies themselves    insofar as he was authorized:         \"TO\n    require such changes in the accounting system or systems\n    and record or records of any office, department,         board,\n    bureau, institution, commission or state agency, that 'in\n    his opinion will augment or provide a uniform,        adequate,\n    and efficient    system of records and accounting.\"         Acts\n    1943, 48th Leg., ch. 293, §7(3), at 431.      Section  8 of  the\n    1943 act also required the Auditor to prepare, again, a\n    report for the head of every agency on, inter alia, the\nP\n    efficiency   of subordinate      employees,   the amount      of\n    duplication between work done by the examined agency and\n    other agencies, and \"any suggested changes looking toward\n    economy and reduction of number of clerical          and other\n    employees,   and    the elimination     of duplication       and\n    inefficiency.\"    Section 8 also set forth the following:\n\n\n\n\n                               p. 4227\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 4 (JR-872)\n\n\n\n\n          Reports   shall   also contain    specific\n       recommendations to the Legislature for the\n       amendment of existing laws or the passage of\n       new laws designed to improve the functioning\n       of various    departments, boards, bureaus,\n       institutions or agencies of State Government\n       to the end that more efficient service    may\n       be rendered and the cost of government\n       reduced.\n\n          All recommendations   submitted by    the\n       State Auditor  shall be confined to those\n       matters properly coming within his jurisdic-\n       tion, which is to see that the laws passed\n       by the Legislature dealing with the expendi-\n       ture of public moneys are in all respects\n       carefully observed, and that the attention\n       of the Legislature is directed to all cases\n       of violation   of the law and to       those\n       instances where there is need for change of\n       existing laws or the passage of new laws to\n       secure the efficient 'spending of public\n       funds. The State Auditor shall not include\n       in his recommendations to the Legislature\n       any recommendations as to the sources   from\n       which taxes shall be raised to meet the\n       governmental expense.\n\nActs 1943, 48th Leg., ch. 293, 58, at 432. And finally,\nsection 10 of the act authorized      the Legislative   Audit\nCommittee to conduct hearings with the head of any agency\nwhere the Auditor   has found \"evidence of improper prac-\ntices of financial administration       or of any general\nincompetency  of    personnel,  inadequacy    of    financial\nrecords.\" Acts 1943, 48th Leg., ch. 293, 510, at 433.\nThe committee was required to report to the legislature\nany refusal of the agency officials        to remedy    \"Such\nincompetency  or    the, installation    of proper     fiscal\nrecords.\" Id.     Except for a 1977 amendment giving      the\ncommittee authority to subpoena information that it seeks,\nthe act remained unchanged until 1985. At that time, the\narticles governing the Legislative Audit Committee and the\nState Auditor were recodified in a nonsubstantive revision\nand placed in Chapter 3 of the newly-enacted      Government\nCode. House Bill No. 699 and House Bill No. 2181, the two\nbills about which you inquire, were adopted in 1987 by the\n70th session of the Legislature.\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4228\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 5      (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n     Prior to the     enactment of    H.B. 699,     section\n321.013(a) of the Government Code provided, inter alia,\nthat the State Auditor shall \"perform an audit of all\ngovernmental accounts, books, and other financial   records\nof any state officer or department.\"  The chapter did not\ndefine \"audit,\" but section 321.014(a) provided that the\nVtate Auditor shall conduct each audit as directed by the\ncommittee and as prescribed by this chapter.\"     With the\npassage of H.B. 699, section 321.013(f) of the Government\nCode now confers authority on the State Auditor to conduct\nvarious types of audits, specifically \"financial ~audits,\ncompliance   audits,  economy   and   efficiency    audits,\neffectiveness audits, special audits, and investigations\nas defined by this chapter.\"\n\n     Sections 321.0133 and 321.0134 of the Government Code\ndefine \"economy and efficiency audit\" and \"effectiveness\naudit\" respectively.  Section 321.0133 of the Government\nCode provides:\n\n       An economy and efficiency audit is an   audit\n       to determine:\n\n           (1) whether   the  audited    entity   is\n       managing    or  utilizing   its    resources,\n       including state funds, personnel,   property,\n       equipment, and space, in an economical    and\n       efficient manner:\n\n           (2) causes of inefficiencies or uneconom-\n       ical practices,   including  inadequacies   in\n       management information systems, internal and\n       administrative   procedures,   organizational\n       structure, use of resources, allocation     of\n       personnel, purchasing, policies, and eguip-\n       ment; and\n\n          (3) whether financial, program, and stat-\n       istical reports of      the audited   entity\n       contain    useful  data    and  are   fairly\n       presented.\n\nSection 321.0134 of the Government Code provides:\n\n          (a) An effectiveness audit is an audit to\n       determine,  according   to established\n       designated prcgram objectives, responsibilyf\n       ties or duties, statutes and regulations,\n       program performance   criteria,  or program\n       evaluation standards:\n\n\n\n                          p. 4229\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 6 W-872)\n\n\n\n\n             (1) whether   the    objectives    and\n          intended benefits are being      achieved\n          efficiently and effectively: and\n\n             (2) whether the program duplicates,\n          overlaps, or conflicts with another state\n          program.\n\n           (b) An effectiveness audit may be sched-\n       uled only when the audited entity     is not\n       scheduled for review under the Texas Sunset\n       Act (Chapter 325).\n\nSection 321.016 of the Government Code requires,      inter\nu,    that the State Auditor report to the Governor,    the\nLegislative Audit Committee,  the administrative head and\nthe chairman of the governing body of the affected agency,\nany evidence of improper practices of financial    adminis-\ntration or \"ineffective program performance\"; the Legisla-\ntive Audit Committee  is required then to report to the\nlegislature any refusal by the administrative head or the\ngoverning body of the agency to make changes    recommended\nby the committee.\n\n     You first ask whether section 321.016 of the Govern-\nment Code, as amended by H.B. 699, is unconstitutional   to\nthe extent that it purports to give the Legislative   Audit\nCommittee the authority to order changes in the way in\nwhich legislation  is implemented  or administered   by an\nexecutive agency. Section 321.016, Government Code, now\nprovides the following:\n\n           (a) If in the course of an audit the\n       State Auditor    finds evidence of improper\n       practices    of     financial    administration,\n       inadequate fiscal records, uneconomical       use\n       of    resources,     or    ineffective   program\n       performance,    the     State   Auditor,    after\n       consulting with the head of the agency,\n       shall immediately report the evidence to the\n       governor, the committee, and the administra-\n       tive head and the chairman of the governing\n       body of the affected department.\n\n          (b) If in the course of an audit the\n       State Auditor finds evidence of an illegal\n       transaction,  the   State   Auditor,    after\n       consulting with the head of the agency,\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4230\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 7 (JB-872)\n\n\n\n\n       shall immediately report the transaction to\n       the governor, the committee, and the appro-\n       priate legal authority.\n\n          (c) Immediately    after   the   committee\n       receives a report from the State Auditor\n       alleging  improper practices     of financial\n       administration,     uneconomical    use    of\n       resources, or ineffective program perform-\n       ance, the committee shall review the report       '\n       and shall consult with and may hold hearings\n       with the     administrative  head   and   the\n       chairman of the governing      body of    the\n       affected department regarding the report.\n\n          (d) If the administrative   head or the\n       governing body of the affected department\n       refuses to make the changes recommended   by\n       the committee at the hearing or provide  any\n       additional information or reports requested,\n       the committee  shall report the refusal to\n       the legislature.\n\n     The various    statutes enacted through the       years\nconferring authority upon the Legislative Audit Committee\nand its effective agent, the State Auditor, reveal a trend\ntoward the conferral of ever-expanding authority on both.\nThe 1929 act      conferred upon the State Auditor       and\nEfficiency Expert the authority to examine the fiscal\nrecords of every state agency and to make recommendations\nto the    legislature    regarding   the   elimination    of\nduplication and inefficiency.   The 1943 act attempted    to\nexpand the authority of the newly-named State Auditor     by\nconferring upon him the power, not only to report to the\nlegislature recommended changes, but to direct the admin-\nistration or execution of the laws by requiring         each\nagency to install whatever method of accounting and record\nkeeping that he recommended.     After conducting  hearings\nwith the heads of those agencies      in which the State\nAuditor found evidence of improper practices of financial\nadministration, inadequate financial records, or \"general\nincompetency of personnel,\" the newly-created   Legislative\nAudit Committee was required to report to the legislature\nas a whole any refusal of agency officials to remedy those\nidentified problems. And with the 1987 amendments to the\nrecently-codified   Government   Code, the State Auditor\nappears to be empowered to \"audit\" not just the efficiency\nand cost effectiveness of an agency's performance,       but\nalso the substantive performance       of the tasks      and\nresponsibilities imposed by law on an executive      agency,\n\n\n\n\n                          p, 4231\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 8 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n .   to determine whether there is \"ineffective     program\n;eZormance.\"   It appears, for example, that inquiry into\nwhether the College Coordinating  Board, for instance,   is\nin fact carrying out its statutory responsibilities   rests\nnow with the Legislative Audit Committee rather than with\nthe Committee   on Higher Education    in the House      of\nRepresentatives and with the Committee on Education in the\nSenate.\n\n     Article II, section 1, of the Texas Constitution\nprovides   for the separation   of powers between     the\nexecutive, the judicial, and the legislative branches  of\ngovernment.   It states:\n\n       The powers of the Government of the State of\n       Texas shall be divided into three distinct\n       departments, each of which shall be confided\n       to a separate body of magistracy, to wit:\n       Those which are Legislative   to one, those\n      'which are Executive to another, and those\n       which are Judicial to another: and        no\n       person, or collection  of persons, being of\n       one of these departments, shall exercise any\n       power properly  attached to either of the\n       others,  except in the instances      herein\n       expressly permitted.\n\n    This office has consistently held that any attempt by\nthe legislature to supervise the implementation of duly\nenacted statutes through the means of a legislative\ncommittee or through some means other than the normal\nlegislative processes (set forth in sections 28 through 40\nof article III of the Texas Constitution) violates article\nII, section 1. Attorney General Opinions MW-460      (1982) r\nV-1305 (1951); V-1254 (1951); and O-4609     (1942).

The committee was given the authority to approve\nnumerous transactions,   including the receipt of tuition\npayments and transportation aid by school districts.   This\noffice held that only   so much of the  act that created   a\njoint legislative advisory committee to study school   laws\nas an aid to their recodification was constitutional;    the\nprovisions reposing   in the committee   the authority    to\nadminister the law were unconstitutional.\n\n       It is the function of the legislative branch\n       of the government  to make the laws: it is\n       the function of the executive branch of the\n       government to administer  and execute those\n       laws. In the statute under consideration,\n       the Legislature of the State of Texas has\n       undertaken not only to declare what the law\n       shall be, which is clearly its prerogative,\n       but has also undertaken to clothe a portion\n       of the membership of the Legislature,     the\n       Joint Legislative Advisory Committee,    with\n       the authority to execute and administer   the\n       law passed by     the Legislature.

See also Gov't Code, 5311.021\n    (Code Construction     Act): Local   Gov't Code,    51.002\n    (application of Code Construction Act to Local Government\n    Code).\n\n         If we were to construe section 321.016 of the\n    Government Code in the fashion that you suggest, i.e., as\n    conferring authority on the Legislative Audit Committee to\n    order changes in the way that executive agencies implement\n    or administer duly       enacted statutes,    we would     be\n    constrained  to    hold    the   section   unconstitutional.\n    However, we do not so construe that provision.    Subsection\n    (c) of section 321.016 merely confers on the committee the\n    authority to make recommendations to the various executive\n    agencies, recommendations    that each agency may ignore.\n    However, subsection    (d) provides that, if any agency\n    refuses to accept any such recommendation, the committee\n    is required to inform the legislature as a whole of that\n    fact. Subsection (d) permits an ill-disguised attempt by\n    the committee to direct the methods by which    investigated\n    administrative agencies execute the laws. While it is true\n    that the committee itself technically is not conferred the\n    authority to impose sanctions or to enforce compliance     by\n    those administrative agencies that refuse to comply with\n    committee recommendations, the absence of such conferral\n    of authority does not resolve the article II, section      1,\n    issue. Subsection    (d) clearly acts in a punitive,      and\n    perhaps in 6 coercive, fashion that is tantamount to a\n    legislative usurpation of executive power, in violation of\n    article II, section 1, of the Texas Constitution.      We do\n    not question the authority of the legislature or of a\n    committee of the legislature to gather information and to\nP\n    investigate those matters about which     it properly   could\n    enact legislation,   a subject that we will address more\n    fully in answer to your fourth and fifth questions.        We\n    question only the propriety of making a committee's report\n    to the legislature as a whole mandatory upon an adminis-\n    trative agency's refusal to comply with the committee's\n    recommendations.\n\n\n\n                            p. 4235\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 12 (JB-872)\n\n\n\n\n     As a matter of law, the committee does not have the\nauthority to order any executive agency to implement      or\nadminister any law in any particular manner, any more than\nit has authority to direct officers in the judicial branch\nin the construction   of the laws, which the constitution\nreposes   in   the judicial    branch. The    legislature's\nauthority to direct the administration      of laws whose\nexecution is reposed by statute in.so-called   \"legislative\nagencies,\" see. e.g., Gov't Code, §§326.001-326.003,      is\ngreater, 'of course. Accordingly, we conclude that chapter\n321 of the Government Code, which creates the Legislative\nAudit Committee   and the office of State Auditor       and\nconfers powers and duties thereon, does not authorize   the\nLegislative Audit Committee to order an executive    agency\nto change the way in which    it implements or administers\nany law; however, subsection   (d) of section 321.016 does\nauthorize an impermissible intrusion by the legislative\nbranch into areas of administration reposed by the Texas\nConstitution in the executive branch.     Insofar as that\nsubsection requires the committee to report to the legis-\nlature as a whole    in the event that an administrative\nagency fails to adopt its recommendations,   subsection (d)\nis unconstitutional.\n\n     You next ask whether   the State Auditor,    whom you\ncharacterize as, in effect, an employee of the Legisla-\nture, may properly exercise authority to supervise members\nof the executive branch     in their implementation      of\nstatutes or whether his proper role is investigatory only.\nAs we noted earlier, the position of State Auditor      was\ncreated in 1943 to replace an executive       officer, the\n\"State Auditor and Efficiency Expert,\" appointed by the\ngovernor.  Acts 1929, 41st Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 91, at 222.\nThe 1943 act repealed the 1929 act, created the Legisla-\ntive Audit    Committee,  renamed    the position    \"State\nAuditor,\" and conferred   authority on the committee     to\nappoint him. There is no question that the State Auditor\nis an appointee and an agent of the legislature.        &g\nGov't Code, §§326.001-326.003    (authorizing co-operation\nbetween houses    of the    legislature   and   leaislative\nagencies) (formerly codified as article 5429g, V.T.C.S.);\nsee also Attorney General Opinions MB-192 (1980): H-1063\n(1977); V-504 (1948). Accordingly,    we conclude that the\nState Auditor is a subordinate of the legislative branch.\n\n     For the reasons set forth in answer to your     first\nquestion, if we were to construe chapter 321 as conferring\non the State Auditor the authority to order any changes in\nthe way in which executive agencies administer the laws,\nwe would be constrained   to declare any such provisions\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4236\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 13 04-872)\n\n\n\n\nunconstitutional as a violation of article II, section   1,\nof the Texas Constitution.   And, again, for the reasons\nset forth in answer to your first question, we do not\nconstrue any provision  of chapter 321 of the Government\nCode as conferring authority on the State Auditor to order\nexecutive agencies to change the way in which statutes are\nimplemented or administered.   If the State Auditor were\npart of the executive branch whose activities          were\ndirected, as they were prior to the 1943 enactment, by the\nGovernor rather than by the Legislative Audit Committee,\nhis authority possibly could be broader.  But such is not\nthe case.\n\n     Section 321.013 of the Government Code sets forth the\npowers and duties of the State Auditor and provides:\n\n           (a) The State   Auditor shall    conduct\n       audits of all departments, including  insti-\n       tutions of higher education, as specified in\n       the audit plan. At the direction     of the\n       committee, the State Auditor shall conduct\n       .an audit or investigation   of any entity\n       receiving funds from the state.\n\n           (b) The State Auditor shall conduct the\n       audits in accordance with generally accepted\n       auditing standards as prescribed      by the\n       American   Institute   of Certified    Public\n       Accountants,   the Governmental    Accounting\n       Standards Board, the United States General\n       Accounting Office, or other professionally\n       recognized entities that prescribe   auditing\n       standards.\n\n           (c) The State Auditor shall determine the\n       audit plan for the state for each fiscal\n       year.    In devising the    plan, the State\n       Auditor    shall   consider   recommendations\n       concerning coordination of agency functions\n       made by the committee composed       of    the\n       Legislative Budget Board, Sunset Advisory\n       Commission, and State Auditor's Office. The\n       plan shall provide   for auditing of federal\n       programs at least once in each fiscal bien-\n       nium and shall ensure that audit reguire-\n       ments of all bond covenants and other credit\n       or financial agreements are satisfied.

Nothing in these sections or in section 321.016,\npurports to confer any authority upon the State Auditor to\ndirect the activities of state agencies.\n\n     In your third question you ask whether        sections\n51.005 and 61.065 of the Education Code, as amended by\nH.B. 2181, are unconstitutional insofar as they purport to\nallow the State Auditor,     an agent of the legislative\nbranch, to prescribe    administrative   rules for    state\ninstitutions of higher education.      Prior to the 1987\namendments, the authority to prescribe such administrative\nrules was reposed solely in the College Coordinating\nBoard. In a letter accompanying a brief submitted to this\noffice by the State Auditor, it is urged that, if it is\nconstitutional for the legislature to delegate to a member\nof the executive branch the authority properly to promul-\ngate rules that have the force and effect of law, it is\ncertainly constitutional for the legislature to delegate\nsuch authority to a member of the legislative branch.    We\ndisagree; we conclude that the amended sections of the\nEducation   Code are unconstitutional    insofar as    they\npurport to confer joint rulemaking authority on the State\nAuditor and the College Coordinating Board.\n\n     Section 51.005 of the EducationCode     provides:\n\n           (a) True and full accounts shall be kept\n       by the governing board and by the employees\n       of the institution of all funds collected\n       from all sources and of all sums paid out\n       and the persons to whom and the purposes for\n       which the sums are paid.

The relevant passage provides:\n\n               We believe that it is well settled that this\n               constitutional   prohibition   [providing for\n               separation of powers] states a princivle      of\n               government and not a rigid classification as\n               in a table of organization. This provision\n               must be     interpreted along     with    other\n               constitutional provisions, and when this is\n               done it is clear that the Constitution      does\n               three things:   (1) it provides     for three\n               polar functions of      government;    (2)    it\n               delegates certain powers to each of the\n               three departments in a distribution of all\n               governmental   powers;   and  (3) it     blends\nP\n               legislative, executive, and judicial powers\n               in a great many cases. [Footnote omitted.]\n               The proper   interpretation   of Article     II,\n               section   1  is  therefore dictated by its\n               context. The proper interpretation is that\n               this provision   prohibits   a transfer    of a\n\n\n\n                                  p. 4245\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 22 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n       whole mass of powers from one department  to\n       another and it prohibits   a person of one\n       branch from exercising a power historically             --..\n       or inherently belonging  to another depart-\n       ment.

We note that it is only under that construction\n that article II, section 1, would permit the legislature,\n or more specifically a joint interim committee thereof, to\n'appoint the State Auditor, since the appointment    power,\n except for specific constitutional    provisions  reposing\n such authority in others, is historically one that inheres\n in the office of Governor.   See, Walker v. Baker, w.\n Because you do not ask about the constitutionality of the\n statute pursuant to which the State Auditor is appointed,\n we need not resolve that issue.      But even this more\n flexible construction   will not    permit the sort      of\n intrusion that the Education Code amendments contemplate.\n\n      In State Board of Insurance v. Betts, 308 S.W.Zd 846\n(Tex. 1958), the court held that, in an instance in which\nthe attorney  for a statutory receiver   for an insurance\ncompany resigned and the board of insurance commissioners\ndid not designate a successor,    the district  judge had\ndiscretionary  power to appoint an attorney      for    the\nreceiver, since he had judicial control or supervision   of\nthe receivership    case.  The   statute then in      force\nconferred appointment authority upon the board. The court\nseemed to accept the modern construction of the separation\nof powers principle when it rejected a challenge to the\njudge's action under article II, section 1. But the court\nstated, at 851-852:\n                                                               -I\n        However the controlling  factor in settling\n        the constitutional  point presented  is the\n        presence or absence of interference with the\n        effective judicial control occasioned by the\n        executive power to select a liquidator.\n        . . .

(Emphas?s zdded.)\n\n             Analogously, we conclude that the Education        Code\n        amendments about which you inquire permit the legislature,\n        or more specifically an effective agent of a committee    of\n        the legislature, to interfere with the proper    functioning\n        of an executive branch agency in a field constitutionally\n        committed to its control,     i.e. the proper execution   or\n        administration of the law and the responsibilities      duly\n        imposed upon it by statute. Our construction of article\n        II, section 1, and article III, section 1, suggests that\n        the State Auditor may. not constitutionally        prescribe\n        accounting and record keeping procedures for all state\n        agencies. There is no question that the legislature        is\n        authorized to prescribe the accounting and record keeping\n        procedures to be followed by state agencies.          It is\n        doubtful, however, whether the State Auditor        and the\n        Legislative Audit Committee may prescribe such procedures.\n    -\n        Although such authority has been conferred by statute\n        sinc.e 1943, general acquiescence in a custom which may not\n        have resulted in a harmful violation of the constitution\n        does not nreclude    a contest when substantial rights are\n        insisted upon.

But it is in no way certain     that\narticle III, section 49a, fails to set forth the manner or\nform by which you are required to perform your duty. See.\n-,    Attorney   General Opinion WW-640     (1959) (holding\nunconstitutional   in part the predecessor      statute    to\narticle 4348a, V.T.C.S., now codified as Government     Code,\n§5403.013,   403.121-403.122).   This. office declared     in\nAttorney General Opinion JM-666 (1987):\n\n          In Attorney     General    Opinion   WW-640\n       (1959),   Attorney    General    Will   Wilson\n       considered the constitutionality    of a bill\n       that, among other things,       attempted    to\n       control the Comptroller's   estimates of the\n       outstanding but undisbursed     appropriations\n       to be expected at the end of a biennium.\n       The opinion concluded, 'Insofar as this bill\n       attempts to make estimates it is unconstitu-\n       tional as a legislative     invasion of the\n       duties of the comptroller.'\n\n          The bill at issue there, with the offend-\n       ing provision   'making estimates1    deleted,\n       became article     4348a,   V.T.C.S.,    still\n       extant. The remainder of the bill, in the\n       form it was considered by Attorney     General\n       Wilson, was characterized as an instruction\n       to the     Comptroller  'to   use the     cash\n       accounting    basis'   and   was   pronounced\n       constitutional inasmuch as, according to the\n       opinion:\n\n          Reading Section 49a of Article III from\n          its four corners, it is our opinion that\n          this constitutional   provision    contem-\n          plates that the Comptroller,    in making\n          his estimate for certification of bills,\n          use the cash accounting method.\n\n          Thus, article 4348a. V.T.C.S.. is to be\n       read not as a legislative mandate   defininq\n       the Dower of the Comntroller under section\n       49a with resoect to certifications or esti-\n       mates made for the ourvose. but. rather. as\n       a direction that he conform to the reciuire-\n       ments of section 49a itself bv usina the\n       cash accountins  method in arriving at his\n       estimates  for   that nurnose.     (Emphasis\n       added.)\n\n\n\n\n                          p. 4250\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 27 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n     For purposes of this opinion, we accept the assertion\nthat the means and manner by which you must perform     the\nbudget   certification/revenue    estimate    certification\nprocesses are set forth in the constitution with suffic-\nient specificity   such that the legislature    is without\nauthority, absent a constitutional    amendment, to direct\nyou in the manner   in which you carry out your constitu-\ntional responsibilities.   It necessarily follows that the\nlegislature is without authority to inquire into the\nmanner and method by which you arrive at the budget\ncertification/revenue estimate figures, if the purpose for\nwhich it seeks the information'is    to enact legislation.\nBut, article XVII, section 1, of the Texas Constitution\nreposes in the legislature   the sole authority to propose\namendments to the constitution;    the issue then focuses\nupon the authority of the legislature to inquire into the\nmanner and method by which you perform your constitutional\nduties if such inquiry is done in aid of determining     the\nneed for any such amendments.\n\n     We are not unmindful    of the importance    of this\nquestion: indeed, it goes to the very heart of the nature\nof the kind of government   that we have. Texas, unlike\nmany states; sets forth in its constitution the duties and\nresponsibilities of many of its state officers.     If we\npermit the State Auditor and the Legislative Audit Commit-\ntee, under the guise of performing \"economy and efficiency\naudits\" or \"effectiveness   audits\" to inquire   into the\nmanner by which you perform the duties reposed in you by\nthe constitution of this state, we perforce would have to\npermit such an E'audit@'inquiry into the manner in which\nother constitutional officers perform their constitutional\nduties. We would have to permit the Legislative      Audit\nCommittee and the State Auditor to inquire into the manner\nby which the Governor exercises his appointment power and\nhis authority   to veto legislation. We would have to\npermit the Legislative Audit Committee      and the State\nAuditor to inquire into the manner in which the justices\nof the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals administer their respective caseloads and deliber-\nate and arrive at their decisions.      We would have to\npermit the Legislative Audit Committee      and the State\nAuditor to inquire into the manner in which the Attorney\nGeneral advises and represents state agencies.\n\n     We do not resolve here the issue as to the scope that\nany such legislative inquiry could possess. We think that\nyour question raises the significant issue as to whether\nthe direction or guidance instructing any such investigat-\ning committee must be reasonably specific and whether  any\n\n\n\n                         p. 4251\n\f    Honorable Bob Bullock - Page 28 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n    resolution   constituting   such investigation     must    be\n    inveighed with sufficient   dignity to convey the extreme\n    significance of what is undertaken.   We question whether a\n    mere decision by the State Auditor     and the Legislative\n    Audit Committee to so investigate,     under the guise of\n    conducting   an \"economy and efficiency     audit\" or      an\n    \"effectiveness   audit,\"  is sufficient.    We need      not,\n    however, determine whether the State Auditor        and the\n    Legislative Audit Committee may conduct an \"economy and\n    efficiency audit\" or an \"effectiveness     audit\"   for the\n    purpose of making an inquiry into the manner in which you\n    perform  the    duties reposed    in you    by the      Texas\n    Constitution.   We need note only that nothing       in the\n    Government Code purports to confer such authority in the\n    first place. Subsection    (e) of section 321.013 permits\n    the Auditor to examine, for example, whether   subscription\n    material exists, but not the use to which it is put.      Nor\n    does it authorize an inquiry into discretionary    decision-\n    making by you that is personal to you as a constitutional\n    officer. We add that the Legislative Audit Committee,      of\n    course, has no authority   to direct you in the manner     in\n    which the budget certification/revenue    estimate   figures\n    are derived.\n\n         Finally, you ask whether the State Auditor has the\n.   authority to direct an executive agency or officer to seek\n    amendments to the laws or to evaluate the agency or\n    officer on the basis of whether      such amendments   are\n    sought. The answer to your question is clearly %o.\"\n\n         It is well established that a state agency has only\n    those powers expressly granted to it by statute          or\n    necessarily implied from the statutory authority conferred\n    or duties  imposed.

No provision   in chapter  321 of the\n       Government Code, which sets forth the duties\n       of the State Auditor and the Legislative\n      ,.Audit Committee,    purports   to    confer\n       authority  on   the committee    to   direct\n       executive agencies  in the manner in which\n       they execute or administer the laws.\n\n          2. No provision   in chapter 321 of the\n       Government Code purports to confer authority\n       on the State Auditor to direct executive\n       agencies in the manner in which they execute\n       or administer the laws.\n\n          3. Sections 51.005 and 61.005       of the\n       Education Code are unconstitutional    insofar\n       as they purport to confer authority    on the\n       State Auditor to promulgate    rules   jointly\n       with the College Coordinating Board.\n\n          4. Legislative committees properly may\n       gather information and conduct investiga-\n       tions upon any matters about which legisla-\n       tion may be enacted.\n\n           5. Because    the   Texas     Constitution\n       reposes in the legislature sole authority to\n       propose constitutional amendments,    legisla-\n       tive committees may gather information     and\n       conduct investigations in aid of such auth-\n       ority. However, it is questionable whether a\n       mere decision by the Legislative         Audit\n       Committee   and the State Auditor to         so\n       investigate, under the guise of conducting\n       an \"economy and efficiency audit\" or an\n       \"effectiveness   audit,\" is sufficient       to\n       permit such a serious intrusion      into the\n       performance   of   constitutionally    imposed\n       duties as is here contemplated by an inquiry\n       into the methods and means whereby         you\n       derive the     budget   certification/revenue\n       estimate  figures. This issue need not be\n       decided, because nothing in the Government\n       Code purports to confer the authority        to\n       conduct such an inquiry in the first place.\n       The Legislative Audit Committee may not\n       direct the manner   in which the Comptroller\n       derives such estimates.\n\n\n\n                         p. 4253\n\fHonorable Bob Bullock - Page 30 (JM-872)\n\n\n\n\n          6.
