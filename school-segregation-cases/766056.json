(No. 92-40064-\nWS), William Stafford, Judge.\n\nBefore TJOFLAT and COX, Circuit Judges, and CLARK, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n       TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge:\n\n       Harry L. Hunt is a retired Eastern Air Lines (\"Eastern\") pilot seeking to recover a lump-sum\n\nretirement benefit under the Eastern Air Lines Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for Pilots (the\n\n\"Plan\").1 Eastern, the Plan's administrator, which is a debtor before the Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York, has refused to pay the benefit because the Plan has been amended,\n\nwith the approval of the bankruptcy court, to foreclose the lump-sum benefit Hunt seeks. As the\n\nPlan now stands, Hunt is entitled to receive only a modified lump-sum benefit: he may receive a\npartial distribution immediately and subsequent payments over time as the Plan's assets are\n\nliquidated.\n\n       Hunt rejected this modified lump-sum benefit, as well as other payment options provided\n\nunder the Plan, and sued Eastern; the Air Line Pilots Association (\"ALPA\"), the pilots' union;\n\nCharles H. Copeland, the Chairman of the Trust Administrative Committee (the \"TAC\"), the Plan's\n\nnamed fiduciary; Paul M. O'Connor, Jr., of O'Connor, Morris & Jones, the TAC's legal counsel (the\n\n\"O'Connor law firm\"); and Hawthorne Associates, Inc. (\"Hawthorne\"), the TAC's principal\n\n   1\n    The Plan's originating document refers to the plan as the \"B-Plan.\" For simplicity, we use\nthe name \"Plan.\"\n\finvestment advisor, to recover his retirement benefit in a lump sum. Hunt brought his suit under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), Pub.L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829,\n\n29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461 (1994). His complaint, framed in six counts, asked for compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring the defendants to pay his\n\nlump-sum benefit, statutory penalties, and attorneys' fees.\n\n       Eastern's Bankruptcy Trustee, in a motion for summary judgment, contended that Eastern\n\ncould not be held liable to Hunt because it had properly discharged its responsibilities as\n\nadministrator under the Plan. Later, when opposing Hunt's motion for leave to file an amended\n\ncomplaint, Eastern argued that Hunt's claim for a lump-sum benefit had been foreclosed by a\n\nbankruptcy court ruling against Hunt in Eastern's bankruptcy case. In an apparent attempt to avoid\n\nthe effect of this ruling, Hunt voluntarily dismissed Eastern from the case with prejudice and, with\n\nleave of court, filed an amended complaint against three defendants—Hawthorne, the TAC, and the\n\nPlan—that asserted essentially the same claims presented in his initial complaint.\n\n       The case was tried to the district court; by that time, the only defendants before the court\n\nwere the TAC and the Plan. Without referring to the bankruptcy court's ruling against Hunt, the\n\ncourt held that he was entitled to his lump-sum benefit and entered judgment for Hunt in the amount\n\nof that benefit. The judgment stated that the benefit was to be satisfied out of the Plan's fund of\n\nassets. The court rejected Hunt's remaining claims and entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n       The TAC and the Plan now appeal. Hunt cross-appeals the court's rejection of his claim\n\nrequesting the court to impose a statutory penalty on the defendants. We reverse the court's\n\njudgment against the TAC and the Plan, and affirm its judgment on the statutory-penalty claim.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Hunt claims that, under ERISA and the provisions of the Plan, he is entitled to recover his\n\nretirement benefits in a lump sum. Unlike the typical scenario in which a participant in an employee\n\nbenefit plan sues to recover ERISA benefits, Hunt sought his lump-sum payment while the\n\nadministrator of the Plan, Eastern, was undergoing a highly publicized bankruptcy proceeding that\n\nultimately resulted in the company's demise. In addition to scrutinizing ERISA and the provisions\n\fand operation of the Plan, we must therefore consider the interrelationship between the Plan and\n\nEastern's bankruptcy in order to evaluate Hunt's claims for relief.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       ERISA is a \"comprehensive and reticulated statute\" that created a framework for the\n\nadministration and maintenance of private employee benefit plans. Nachman Corp. v. Pension\n\nBenefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 361, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1726, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980). The\n\ncornerstone of an ERISA plan is the written instrument, which must provide for \"the allocation of\n\nresponsibilities for the operation and administration of the plan.\" ERISA § 402(b)(2), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1102(b)(2); see also ERISA § 402(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1) (\"Every employee benefit plan\n\nshall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.\").\n\n        The written instrument must designate an \"administrator,\" ERISA § 3(16)(A)(i), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1002(16)(A)(i), \"to run the plan in accordance with the ... governing plan documents.\" Curtiss-\n\nWright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U.S. 73, 84-86, 115 S.Ct. 1223, 1231, 131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995);\n\nsee also Varity Corp. v. Howe, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 1086, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996)\n\n(\"Essentially, to administer the plan is to implement its provisions and to carry out plan duties\n\nimposed by [ERISA].\") (Thomas, J., dissenting). In some instances, ERISA imposes specific\n\nobligations on the plan administrator. See, e.g., ERISA § 101(b), 29 U.S.C. § 1021(b) (duty to file\n\nplan description, modifications and changes, and reports with the Department of Labor); ERISA\n§ 105(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1025(a) (duty to provide plan participants with information regarding their\n\nbenefits).\n\n        The written instrument must also \"provide for one or more named fiduciaries who jointly\n\nor severally shall have authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan.\"\n\nERISA § 402(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1102(a)(1). The administrator, as well as the named fiduciary, is\n\nconsidered a \"fiduciary\" under ERISA.2 Both the administrator and the named fiduciary must\n\n   2\n    The term \"fiduciary\" has a broader meaning under ERISA than at common law because\nERISA \"defines \"fiduciary' not in terms of formal trusteeship, but in functional terms of control\nand authority over the plan.\" Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S. 248, 262, 113 S.Ct. 2063,\n2071, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993). Under ERISA § 3(21)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), a fiduciary\nincludes not only those who \"exercise[ ] any discretionary authority or discretionary control\n\fdischarge their duties \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar\n\nas such documents and instruments are consistent with [ERISA],\" ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1104(a)(1)(D), \"for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their\n\nbeneficiaries,\" ERISA § 404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A).            Because both the plan\n\nadministrator and named fiduciary must discharge their duties in accordance with the written\n\ninstrument, we examine the provisions of the Plan in detail.3\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       The Plan is a variable benefit pension plan for Eastern pilots that was created in 1958\n\npursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between Eastern and ALPA. The parties rewrote the\n\nPlan in the 1970s to comply with ERISA and subsequently amended it in 1986.4\n\n       The Plan is a \"defined contribution plan.\"5 According to 26 U.S.C. § 414(i), a defined\n\ncontribution plan is a \"plan [that] provides for an individual account for each participant and for\n\nbenefits based solely on the amount contributed to the participant's account, and any income,\n\nexpenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be\n\nallocated to such participant's account.\" More simply, in the words of an ALPA newsletter sent to\n\nEastern pilots, a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan is \"determined solely by\n\n\nrespecting management of such plan or exercise[ ] any authority or control respecting\nmanagement or disposition of its assets,\" but also those who \"[have] discretionary authority or\ndiscretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\" The Supreme Court has referred\nto ERISA's definition of fiduciary as \"artificial.\" Mertens, 113 S.Ct. at 2068 n. 5, 508 U.S. at\n255 n. 5.\n   3\n    Given the seminal importance of the written instrument under ERISA, we are puzzled why\nthe parties made little more than a passing reference to the Plan documents in their briefs and at\noral argument.\n\n               For simplicity and clarity, we refer to the specific provisions of the Plan by citing\n       directly to the relevant section or subsection. In some instances, the title of the section or\n       subsection is noted parenthetically.\n   4\n   The original written instrument that established the Plan is known as \"Document 91.\" The\n1986 amendment is known as \"Document 91A.\"\n   5\n    Section 12.14 of the Plan, titled \"Plan Is Defined Contribution Plan,\" states: \"Since [the\nPlan's inception], the Plan has been and continues to be a defined contribution plan.\" This\nsection appears in Document 91C, an amendment to the Plan that will be discussed in part I.D,\ninfra.\n\fcontributions made in a beneficiary's name and the subsequent investment performance of those\n\ncontributions.\" The Plan requires that Eastern make contributions on behalf of each participant, see\n\n§ 4.1 (\"Eastern Contributions\"),6 for investment in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets. These\n\ninvestments constitute the Plan's \"Variable Fund\" (the \"Fund\"). See § 1.36 (\"Variable Fund\").7 As\n\na result, the value of a participant's interest in the Plan depends not only upon the funds contributed\n\nbut also on the investment return on the Fund's assets. See Borst v. Chevron Corp., 36 F.3d 1308,\n\n1311 n. 2 (5th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1066, 115 S.Ct. 1699, 131 L.Ed.2d 561 (1995). The\n\nvalue of the Fund is calculated annually as of December 31 of each calendar year. See § 5.1 (\"Fund\n\nValue\").\n\n       The Plan designates Eastern as the \"plan administrator.\" Eastern has \"those powers\n\nnecessary to carry out the day to day operation of the Plan.\" See § 2.2(a) (\"Administration\"). Those\n\npowers include the broad responsibility to \"initially determine all questions arising from the\n\nadministration, interpretation, and application of the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements\n\nand contracts and such determination shall be binding upon all persons, except as otherwise\n\nprovided by law, and further provided that each Participant shall be granted the same treatment\n\nunder similar conditions.\" Id. The Plan also charges Eastern with the responsibility for, inter alia,\n\nkeeping records, see § 2.4 (\"Records\"), preparing and distributing periodic Plan summaries, see §\n\n2.5 (\"Plan Summary\"), and sending to each participant an annual statement reflecting the value of\n\nhis investment in the Plan, see § 2.6 (\"Annual Statement\"). Section 13.1 of Article XIII, which is\n\ntitled \"Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance,\" grants Eastern the authority to unilaterally\n\n\n   6\n    According to the original agreement, Eastern was to contribute on behalf of each participant\nan amount equal to 11% of his compensation. On February 23, 1986, Eastern and ALPA signed\na collective bargaining agreement that adjusted Eastern's contribution level in two ways: (1) for\npilots employed before March 2, 1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 10% effective January 1,\n1988; (2) for pilots employed on or after March 2, 1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 3%. In\naddition, participants had the option of contributing up to 10% of their earnings as \"optional\nadditional contributions\" to augment their interest in the Plan. See § 4.2 (\"Optional Additional\nContributions\").\n   7\n    According to § 1.36, the Fund is \"the property of the Plan, ... all of which is held in trust\npursuant to Trust Agreement between the [TAC] and State Street Bank and Trust Company ...\nand any other trust created for such purpose by the [TAC].\"\n\fmodify, suspend, or discontinue any feature of the Plan, provided that any such action does not\n\n\"adversely affect\" any benefits \"already provided\" to a participant under the Plan. An exercise of\n\nthis authority, however, would not constitute an amendment to the Plan.8\n\n       The Plan designates the TAC, a small committee that monitors the management of the Plan's\n\nassets,9 as its \"named fiduciary.\" Under the Plan, the TAC has \"overall supervisory responsibility\n\nof the administrative functions of the Fund,\" see § 2.13(b)(i) (\"Fund Administration\"), and the duty\n\n\"to maintain surveillance over the status and administration of the Plan and the [Fund],\" see §\n\n10.2(b) (\"Rights and Duties of the [TAC]\"). It must \"regularly and periodically suppl[y]\"\n\ninformation to ALPA about \"transactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status,\n\ndocumentation and Fund performance,\" see § 2.11 (\"Information and Accountability\"), and furnish\n\nto ALPA and Plan participants reports about the TAC's \"functions, actions, and decisions ... as are\n\nreasonable and appropriate.\" See § 10.2(c). Furthermore, the TAC is charged with the responsibility\n\nof selecting and replacing investment advisors and trustees of the Fund's assets, see § 2.7(b) (\"Trust\n\nAgreement and Trustee\"), as well as giving directions and instructions to these trustees, see § 2.8\n\n(\"Directions to Trustee(s)\"). Before selecting or replacing investment advisors or trustees, however,\n\nthe TAC must notify ALPA of the TAC's planned course of action and give ALPA an opportunity\n\nto respond, see § 2.7(b), thus effectively giving ALPA a quasi-veto power over these decisions.\n\n   8\n    The Plan documents do not explicitly describe how the Plan may be formally amended. The\nclosest provision is § 14.1, which states that Eastern and ALPA must agree upon any\nmodification that is necessary for the Plan to qualify as a pension plan under ERISA. See § 14.1\n(\"Qualification of Plan\"). The record makes clear, however, that both Eastern and ALPA must\napprove any substantive amendment to the Plan, with the exception of an amendment made\npursuant to § 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 1113(e). See infra note 20.\n   9\n    The TAC initially consisted of two members selected by ALPA, two members selected by\nEastern, and three \"outside\" members chosen by ALPA and Eastern. By the time of the events\ninvolved in the present controversy, the Plan had been amended to provide that two members\nwere to be selected by ALPA, and five outside members would be appointed by the existing\nTAC members with ALPA's approval. TAC's outside members at this time included former\nPresident Gerald R. Ford; a former president of Citicorp, William I. Spencer; a former chairman\nof the board of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, George P. Jenkins; and a former dean of\nthe Harvard Business School, Lawrence E. Fouraker.\n\n               The compensation for the outside TAC members is paid by the Fund, see §\n       2.2(b)(iii), whereas the compensation for TAC members from ALPA is paid by ALPA,\n       see § 10.1(b)(ii).\n\fSimilarly, before giving any notice or instruction to a Fund trustee, the TAC must notify ALPA and\n\ngive it fifteen days to object. See § 2.8.\n\n        Pursuant to its authority under sections 2.7 and 2.13(d),10 the TAC hired Hawthorne as the\n\nPlan's principal investment advisor/manager for the time period relevant in this case. Hawthorne's\n\nduties are enumerated in a written \"investment advisor agreement\" between the TAC and\n\nHawthorne. According to the testimony of Hawthorne's chairman, Charles G. Dyer, Hawthorne\n\nassumed many of the TAC's administrative duties involving the Fund and its assets, including the\n\nscheduling of TAC meetings and the release of quarterly statements to participants about the value\n\nof the Fund's assets. In essence, Hawthorne served \"at the pleasure of the [TAC].\"\n\n                                                 C.\n\n        Since the Plan's inception, an Eastern pilot choosing normal or early retirement could elect\n\nto receive his benefits in the form of monthly annuity payments.11 Beginning in 1983, a retiring pilot\n\nalso could elect to receive his benefits in the form of a lump-sum payment.\n\n        Processing an application for a lump-sum benefit involved five steps.12 First, a pilot seeking\n\na lump-sum payment would complete the necessary paperwork and inform the Chief Pilot, an\n\nEastern management employee, of his intention to retire. Second, the Chief Pilot would check to\n\n   10\n     According to § 2.13(d), the TAC \"may delegate to any person, including, but not limited to,\nInvestment Advisors, all or any portion of the [TAC's] powers, duties and responsibilities to\nestablish and maintain a Fund Office, to maintain records and to prepare reports and\ndocumentation. The [TAC] shall make such delegations in writing and is authorized to pay\nreasonable fees, charges and costs of the person or persons providing such service.\" This\ndelegation of authority is consistent with ERISA. See ERISA § 402(c)(3), 29 U.S.C. §\n1102(c)(3).\n   11\n     The Plan provided participants with a panoply of annuity options. Retiring pilots selecting\nan annuity could choose from the post-retirement joint and survivor annuity, the contingent\nannuity, the level income option, the life annuity option, and the deferred payment option. See §\n6.2 (\"Available Forms of Payment\"). There also was a disability benefit option. See § 6.3\n(\"Disability Benefit\").\n   12\n     The Plan does not explicitly set forth the procedure for processing claims for retirement\nbenefits. The above account of the claims-processing procedure is taken from the deposition and\naffidavit of Charles Dyer of Hawthorne and from the affidavit of Brian P. White, who served as\nDirector of the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department. Both accounts of Eastern's\nclaims-processing procedure are virtually identical. After the trial, the district court, in\nfashioning its order directing the entry of judgment, relied exclusively on the account given in\nthe White affidavit.\n\fmake sure that the pilot met age criteria to qualify for normal or early retirement benefits under the\n\nPlan.13 Third, if the pilot met the age qualifications, the Chief Pilot would inform the Eastern\n\nPension and Insurance Department about the pilot's decision to retire. Fourth, the Eastern Pension\n\nand Insurance Department would contact the Plan's actuary, William M. Mercer, Inc., which would\n\ndetermine the precise amount of benefits to which the retiring pilot was entitled. Fifth, the actuary\n\nwould then give that information to the State Street Bank & Trust Company, a Plan trustee, which\n\nwould make the distribution to the pilot. The lump-sum payment would be equal to the entire\n\nactuarial present value14 of the pilot's accrued benefit15 as of his effective retirement date.16 See §\n\n6.2(e)(i) (\"Lump Sum Option\"). A pilot dissatisfied with the disposition of his application for\n\nbenefits could pursue administrative relief with the Pension Dispute Board pursuant to Article XI\n\n(\"Determination of Disputes\") of the Plan.17\n\n                                                  D.\n\n        In the late 1980s, Eastern was experiencing severe financial difficulties against the backdrop\n\nof a highly publicized labor dispute. On March 9, 1989, Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection\n\nunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 1101-1174, in the Bankruptcy Court for the\n\n\n   13\n    Normal retirement age under the Plan is 60. See § 1.22 (\"Normal Retirement Age\"). The\nminimum early retirement age is 50. See § 1.15 (\"Early Retirement Date\").\n   14\n    \"Actuarial present value\" is the current value of monthly benefits determined by the current\nvalue of an annuity unit at the most recent valuation. See § 1.6 (\"Actuarial Present Value\").\n   15\n     An \"accrued benefit\" is essentially the total number of \"annuity units\" credited to the\naccount of a participant. See § 1.2 (\"Accrued Benefit\"). An annuity unit is a unit of measure\nrepresenting a share in the Fund. See § 1.7 (\"Annuity Unit\").\n   16\n     \"Effective retirement date\" essentially means the normal retirement date or early retirement\ndate. See § 1.18 (\"Effective Retirement Date\"). The normal retirement date is the first day of the\nmonth coinciding with or otherwise next following a participant's 60th birthday. See § 1.23\n(\"Normal Retirement Date\"). The early retirement date is the first day of the month on which a\nparticipant elects to retire and receive a pension, provided that he is at least 50 years old. See §\n1.15(a) (\"Early Retirement Date\").\n   17\n    The Pension Dispute Board consisted of four members: two were selected by Eastern and\ntwo were selected by ALPA. The Board had the authority to hear and determine \"[a]ll disputes\nconcerning the application, interpretation or administration of the Plan in respect to individual\nemployees and their participation in or their benefits under the Plan.\" § 11.2 (\"Authority [of\nPension Dispute Board]\").\n\fSouthern District of New York. On March 20, 1990, Eastern and ALPA signed an interim letter of\n\nagreement, effective March 2, 1990, fixing Eastern's contribution to the Plan for all pilots at 3% of\n\ncompensation.18 On April 18, 1990, the bankruptcy court named Martin R. Shugrue as Bankruptcy\n\nTrustee of Eastern (the \"Bankruptcy Trustee\"). The Bankruptcy Trustee began liquidating certain\n\ncompany assets in an attempt to reorganize Eastern as a smaller carrier.19\n\n        On September 11, 1990, the Bankruptcy Trustee, proceeding under section 1113(e) of the\n\nBankruptcy Code, applied to the bankruptcy court for an order, which the court entered, approving\n\nan amendment to the Plan.20 Pursuant to this order, Eastern reduced its contribution to the Plan to\n\n0% for compensation earned by pilots after August 11, 1990, and provided for resumption of its\n\ncontribution of 3% for such compensation on or after June 1, 1991. This amendment also suspended\n\nthe Pension Dispute Board's powers effective August 11, 1991. ALPA objected to the Bankruptcy\n\nTrustee's action and appealed to the district court the bankruptcy court's order authorizing this\n\namendment. The record does not inform us of the district court's disposition of this appeal.\n\n        After Eastern's Chapter 11 filing, the Fund became increasingly illiquid due to three factors.\n\nFirst, because Eastern had suspended and eventually ceased making contributions to the Plan, the\n\nFund's sole source of cash was the return on its investments. Second, a substantial portion of the\n\nFund's assets were invested in real estate, which was depressed in value due to a nationwide real\n\nestate recession. Third, the lump-sum option for receiving benefits had become increasingly popular\n\nwith retiring pilots. In fact, the annual amount distributed in lump-sum payments had risen steadily\n\nfrom $52,000,000 in 1986 to more than $200,000,000 in 1990.\n\n   18\n   For Eastern pilots employed before March 2, 1986, Eastern had been contributing 10% of\ncompensation since January 1, 1988. See supra note 6.\n   19\n    The record indicates that the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department retained its\nauthority and continued to perform its responsibilities under the supervision of the Bankruptcy\nTrustee.\n   20\n     Section 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 1113(e), states that the bankruptcy\ncourt, \"after notice and a hearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the\nterms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by a collective bargaining agreement.\"\nThe bankruptcy court may authorize such measures only if they occur \"during a period when the\ncollective bargaining agreement continues in effect,\" and \"if [such measures are] essential to the\ncontinuation of the debtor's business, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate.\"\n\f        On January 18, 1991, Eastern shut down its operations, effectively retiring the approximately\n\n2,500 pilots in its employ at the time. The same day, O'Connor of the O'Connor law firm, which\n\nserved as counsel to the TAC, contacted Brian P. White, Director of Eastern's Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment, and told White that the TAC \"recommended\" that Eastern place a temporary\n\nmoratorium on lump-sum payments. White, in response, said that Eastern lacked the authority to\n\nimpose a moratorium. On January 19, 1991, O'Connor confirmed the recommendation by letter, a\n\ncopy of which he sent to ALPA, the TAC, and Hawthorne.\n\n        On January 27, 1991, according to the deposition testimony of former President Gerald R.\n\nFord, the TAC voted unanimously to impose the temporary moratorium.21 The record does not\n\ndisclose how the TAC planned to implement the moratorium.\n\n        On January 28, 1991, O'Connor, representatives of ALPA and Eastern and their respective\n\nattorneys,22 met to discuss the need to place a temporary moratorium on lump-sum payments. The\n\nrecord does not disclose whether at this meeting the parties discussed Article XIII of the Plan, which\n\ngives Eastern the power to \"modify, suspend ... or discontinu[e] ... any feature [of the Plan].\"\n\n        On February 1, 1991, the TAC issued a \"Certificate of Action of the [TAC of the Plan] Taken\n\nupon Unanimous Written Consent.\" In this document, the TAC stated that it, \"as named fiduciary\n\nof the [Plan], has decided to, and hereby does, impose a temporary moratorium upon the payment\n\nof benefits to all Eastern pilots who shall file requests for benefits after the close of business on\nJanuary 18, 1991.\"23 This Certificate also instructed O'Connor to \"notify [Eastern] of the [TAC's]\nrequest that Eastern, as [Plan] Administrator, promptly notify all Eastern pilots who shall file\n\nrequests for benefits after the close of business on January 18, 1991, that, until further notice, a\n\n\n   21\n    In his deposition, former President Ford, a member of the TAC at the time the moratorium\nwas imposed, see supra note 9, stated that \"[the decision to impose the moratorium] was\nunanimous between Mr. Spencer, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Fouraker, the [ALPA] members, and myself.\"\n\n   22\n    The record does not indicate whether the Bankruptcy Trustee was present, or represented, at\nthe meeting.\n   23\n    The moratorium did not affect participants who were already receiving annuities or who had\nsubmitted their application for a lump-sum benefit by the close of business on January 18, 1991.\n\ftemporary moratorium has been placed in effect by [the TAC].\" Pursuant to the TAC's request,\n\nEastern mailed notice of the moratorium to all of its pilots on February 4, 1991.24 In this notice,\n\nEastern advised pilots that \"[q]uestions regarding the temporary moratorium should be addressed\n\nto the [TAC]\" at one of the following addresses: (1) the TAC, care of the O'Connor law firm; or\n\n(2) the TAC, care of Hawthorne.\n\n          White stated that, after Eastern's shutdown and the commencement of the moratorium, the\n\nprocedure for processing claims for benefits under the Plan remained the same except for two\n\nchanges: (1) the retiring pilot would contact Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department directly\n\nrather than go through the Chief Pilot; and (2) Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department would\n\ninform the actuary whether a participant had applied for benefits following the shutdown. If the\n\nparticipant had applied after the shutdown, the bank would not issue a benefit check.\n\n          On May 22, 1991, the TAC mailed a letter and a videotape to all Plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries. The letter and videotape were designed to inform these parties about the current status\n\nof the Plan and its plans for the future in light of the \"present liquidity issues confronting the\n\n[Plan]\"—that is, the state of the Plan after Eastern's shutdown and bankruptcy.\n\n          On June 25, 1991, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA modified the Plan by letter of\n\nagreement.25 This agreement modified the Plan in three significant ways. First, the Plan provided\n\nfor a periodic-payment option that enabled participants to receive their retirement benefit in\nsubstantially equal monthly payments that were made for life (or life expectancy). See § 6.11\n\n(\"Periodic Payments\"). These payments would be exempt from the ten percent additional tax\n\nassessed on early distributions from qualified retirement plans.26 Second, a new article (Article XV)\n\n   24\n     This mailing consisted of two documents: (1) a brief cover letter printed on Eastern\nstationery; and (2) a two-page notice about the moratorium signed by the TAC and addressed to\nall Eastern pilots.\n   25\n        This agreement is known as \"Document 91B.\"\n   26\n     Under the \"periodic payment\" option, a participant could elect to receive the actuarial\npresent value of his accrued benefit in the form of periodic monthly payments as described in\nI.R.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv), 26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv); under this option, the benefit amount was\ndetermined as of the date of receipt. Participants who were receiving an annuity or had an\noutstanding balance on a loan from the Fund were not eligible for this option. If the\n\fwas added in order to enable participants to take out loans from the Plan during this time of financial\n\nuncertainty.27 The amendment provided that the TAC would serve as administrator for these two\n\nprovisions; Eastern, however, retained its administrative authority for all other provisions of the\n\nPlan. See §§ 6.11(f), 15.1. Third, the Plan was amended to provide that the value of benefits\n\ndistributed from the Plan was to be determined at the time of distribution. Thus, the value of a\n\nparticipant's lump-sum benefit would no longer be determined as of the effective retirement date.\n\nSee § 6.2(e)(i).\n\n        On July 27, 1992, pending approval by the bankruptcy court, the Bankruptcy Trustee and\n\nALPA entered into a letter of agreement once again. Referred to as Document 91C, this proposed\n\namendment would make two fundamental changes to the Plan. First, the Fund would be divided into\n\na liquid portion (i.e., cash, marketable stocks, and bonds) and an illiquid portion (i.e., real estate,\n\nalternative investments, and working capital). Each Plan participant would have a percentage\n\ninterest in both the liquid and illiquid portions of the Fund rather than an interest in the Fund as a\n\nwhole. Second, the lump-sum option was modified to provide for a partial distribution—that is, an\n\nimmediate cash payment equal to the liquid portion of each eligible participant's account. A\n\nparticipant selecting this option also would receive extended payments over time as the real estate\n\nand other illiquid assets were sold. The modified lump-sum option had become feasible because of\n\nrecent favorable changes in the tax code for partial distributions.28\n\n\n\nperiodic-payment arrangement was discontinued or altered within five years after it started or\nbefore the participant reached age 59.5, whichever was later, the participant's subsequent\nelection of another form of benefit from the Plan would trigger the 10% penalty tax normally\nassociated with premature distributions, unless the participant was 55 or older when separating\nfrom Eastern. If the penalty tax was triggered, it would be applied retroactively to those amounts\npreviously withdrawn. See § 6.11.\n   27\n     Participants who were annuitants or periodic-payment recipients were not eligible to receive\nloans from the Plan. The maximum loan that could be made was the lesser of $50,000 or 25% of\nthe actuarial present value of the participant's accrued benefit at the time of loan. See § 15.4\n(\"Plan Loans\").\n   28\n     Effective January 1, 1993, partial distributions from a qualified pension plan could be rolled\nover into an individual retirement account (\"IRA\") without adverse tax consequences. See 26\nU.S.C. § 402(c)(4) (1993). Before this change, a participant could not roll over a partial\ndistribution into an IRA without significant tax liability. See 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5)(D) (1991).\n\f        On August 19, 1992, pursuant to its duties under section 10.2(c), the TAC sent a letter to all\n\nPlan participants to describe the modified lump-sum option and to explain why the moratorium had\n\nbeen imposed:\n\n        The lump sum option in the [Plan] has been modified by Document 91-C to address the\n        reality that the [Plan] has a substantial amount of high quality illiquid assets that cannot be\n        liquidated quickly without suffering a substantial discount in order to achieve a quick sale.\n        The [Plan] does not have sufficient cash and other liquid assets to allow eligible participants\n        to take their lump sum in cash. This is what caused the imposition of the moratorium in\n        January 1991.\n\n        On October 1, 1992, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA filed a joint motion in the\n\nBankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking approval of the amendment\n\nprovided by Document 91C. On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court granted their motion and\n\napproved the amendment to the Plan, effectively ending the moratorium. The operative date of the\n\nDocument 91C amendment was June 30, 1992.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        Harry Hunt worked as a pilot for Eastern for twenty-four years. He elected to retire effective\n\nMarch 1, 1991, and demands that he be paid a lump-sum benefit for the value of his interest in the\n\nPlan as of that date.29 On February 22, 1991, Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department received\n\nhis application for benefits, which was signed by Hunt on February 5, 1991. On April 22, 1991, the\n\nmanager of Eastern's Pension Administration Department, Ms. S.W. Boles,30 approved Hunt's\napplication and authorized payment of his benefits.31 Given Eastern's instruction to the actuary that\n\nit apply the moratorium to those applications submitted after January 18, 1991, the State Street Bank\n\n   29\n    The parties agree that the value of Hunt's accrued benefit in the Fund as of March 1, 1991,\nwas $352,748.74.\n   30\n    The record does not disclose the relationship between Eastern's Pension and Insurance\nDepartment and Eastern's Pension Administration Department. Given the facts before us, we\nassume that the latter department carried out the policies and directives of the former\ndepartment.\n   31\n     Hunt's application requested that his lump sum be rolled over into his IRA at Dean Witter\nReynolds, Inc. If a lump-sum distribution was rolled over into an IRA or other eligible\nretirement plan within 60 days, the lump-sum payment would not be included in gross income\nfor the taxable year in which paid. See I.R.C. § 402(a)(5), 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5) (1991).\n\fand Trust never made any payment to Hunt. Although Hunt is eligible to receive a modified\n\nlump-sum benefit and future payments in accordance with the Document 91C amendment, he has\n\nrefused to elect that option. In addition, Hunt did not select the periodic-payment option nor did he\n\ntake out a loan from the Plan.\n\n        Dissatisfied with the progress of his application, Hunt dispatched four letters, the first by\n\nhimself and the other three through two different attorneys. He alleges that these letters were sent\n\npursuant to the instructions in Eastern's February 4, 1991, letter to all Eastern pilots. On March 15,\n\n1991, Hunt wrote to Charles G. Dyer, the chairman of Hawthorne, to inquire about the status of his\n\npension.32 On March 20, 1991, through the first of three attorneys whom Hunt employed in this\n\ncontroversy,33 he wrote to O'Connor in order to request the most current statement of his account\n\nand the most recent financial statement for the Plan \"showing [its] assets and liabilities.\" On July\n\n15, 1991, through a second attorney, he wrote another letter to Dyer of Hawthorne. In that letter,\n\nhe requested a statement of \"the TAC's position on his application,\" copies of all amendments to the\n\nPlan affecting his benefits, an explanation if the TAC were to deny his application, and the name,\n\naddress, and the forms necessary to file a claim with the Pension Dispute Board if the TAC decided\n\nnot to pay his lump sum. Hunt also sent a copy of this letter to the then-chairman of the TAC.\n\nFinally, on August 19, 1991, the same attorney wrote on Hunt's behalf to O'Connor to request copies\n\nof the \"amendments to the Plan,\" an explanation of whether the TAC \"had the right to amend the\n\n   32\n     In this letter, Hunt expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with the moratorium, Hawthorne,\nand the TAC. He stated among other things: (1) \"I have just been informed ... that the proposed\nmoratorium could be extensive.\" THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY! (emphasis in\noriginal) (2) \"[Hawthorne] is administering a Plan that is already funded and in place. It would\nappear the delays are \"stalling tactics' to financially injure [those] participants who were working\non January 18.\" (3) \"The proposal that the [TAC] will adopt changes or amend the provisions of\nthe [Plan] after [Eastern] had ceased business is ridiculous. The Plan was established and funded\nlong before the demise of the Airline.\" (4) \"The possibility of offering partial payments or\n\"[Plan] loans' is completely unsatisfactory to me. If I want to borrow money, I go to a bank.\nBanks lend money, and retirement funds were established to provide retirement benefits to their\nparticipants. If the various members need cash then they should apply to a bank,—banks lend\nmoney!\"\n   33\n     The first lawyer whom Hunt employed wrote the letter of March 20, 1991. The second\nlawyer wrote the July 15 and August 19, 1991, letters described in the text above. The third\nlawyer employed by Hunt brought the instant law suit and prosecuted it in the district court and\non this appeal; a lawyer in his firm assisted him with this appeal.\n\f[Plan],\" and a statement disclosing the number of applications for lump-sum benefits filed since\n\nJanuary 18, 1991.34 Hunt complains that none of his letters were answered.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n        On February 21, 1992, Hunt filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\n\nNorthern District of Florida against the following parties: Eastern, ALPA, Hawthorne, Charles H.\n\nCopeland as chairman of the TAC, and O'Connor as partner and agent for the O'Connor law firm.\n\nThe complaint was a typical \"shotgun\" pleading.35 With the exception of Count I, Hunt made only\n\ngeneral references to \"ERISA,\" failing to indicate which provision of the statute served as his basis\n\nfor relief.\n\n        The complaint contained six counts or causes of action. Each incorporated the allegations,\n\nmostly factual, set out in the first twenty-four paragraphs of the complaint. In those paragraphs,\n\nHunt made essentially the following allegations:\n\n        he was a participant in the Plan;\n\n\n   34\n     On August 23, 1991, in response to a purported \"request\" by his Congressman, Hunt sent a\nletter to Mr. Stephen Mayle of the Office of Filings, Information, and Consumer Services of the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission. He made, inter alia, the following\nstatements: (1) \"I believe Mr. Dyer [of Hawthorne] and the [TAC], which is packed with\n[ALPA] [r]epresentatives, are trying to prevent these lump sum payouts by arbitrarily modifying\nthe retirement agreements so as to prevent the retiree from moving his account to other fund\nmanagers or IRA retirement programs of their choice.\" (2) \"I request your expeditious assistance\nin investigating Mr. Dyer's activities as the Fund Manager to determine if he is in violation of\nSecurity and Exchange Commission Rules relating to investment fund managers and request\nyour prompt reply regarding your findings in this matter.\"\n   35\n      See, e.g., Ebrahimi v. City of Huntsville Bd. of Educ., 114 F.3d 162, 164 (11th Cir.1997);\nAnderson v. District Bd. of Trustees, 77 F.3d 364, 366-67 (11th Cir.1996). As such, the\ncomplaint was not the model of clarity and precision necessary to enable the defendants to frame\na responsive pleading. The district court would have been within its rights had it stricken the\npleading on its own initiative and required a repleader. Ebrahimi, 114 F.3d 162 at ----;\nAnderson, 77 F.3d at 367 n. 5; Cesnik v. Edgewood Baptist Church, 88 F.3d 902, 907 n. 13\n(11th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 946, 136 L.Ed.2d 834 (1997). As we relate\ninfra, the court subsequently took such action when Hunt's attorney moved the court for leave to\nfile an amended complaint, which amounted to nothing more than a rehash of the original\ncomplaint. The court denied his motion with leave to file an amended complaint that did not\nsuffer from \"some of the same infirmities contained in his original complaint.\" Hunt's attorney\nthereafter filed an amended complaint, but it constituted no improvement over his original\npleading. Unfortunately, rather than striking the amended complaint from the record, the court\naccepted it. As a result, Hunt's claims remained ambiguous and in part inconsistent, the issues\nwere not properly delineated, and the trial yielded the erroneous decision we set aside today.\n\f        on February 5, 1991, he mailed to the Plan administrator's (Eastern's) Pension and Insurance\n        Department a \"Notice of Retirement Status, electing a lump sum payout of his benefits under\n        the [Plan], effective on his early retirement date of March 1, 1991\";\n\n        he inquired of Hawthorne on March 15, 1991, May 3, 1991, and May 7, 1991 as to when he\n        would receive his lump-sum payment for his accrued benefit;\n\n        Hawthorne replied that he would be paid between June 15, 1991, and June 30, 1991;\n\n        the Plan administrator had not paid his benefit because a moratorium had been placed on the\n        payment of lump-sum benefits;\n\n        the \"moratorium resulted from resolutions rendered by ALPA\"; and\n\n        he retained counsel in order to obtain his lump-sum benefit.36\n\n        Count I of the complaint, titled \"Failure to Provide Information,\" alleged that the defendants'\n\nfailure \"to respond within 30 days to repeated written requests made by Hunt since March 20, 1991,\n\nas required by 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c)(1)(B),\" rendered the defendants \"liable to Hunt in an amount up\n\nto $100 per day from the date of this failure to respond pursuant to [section] 1132(c)(1)(B).\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt requested \"judgment against Defendants for the applicable penalty and damages,\n\n... such further relief as the court deems appropriate and ... prejudgment interest, costs and\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees.\"\n\n        Count II, titled \"Action to Enforce Rights under [Plan],\" alleged that Hunt had properly\n\nsubmitted his request for a lump-sum benefit; that he was entitled to the benefit; and that the\n\n\"Defendants have failed to pay or direct payment of said benefits and have failed to provide any\n\ndisposition of Hunt's claim.\" Accordingly, Hunt asked the court to \"enter an order requiring\n\nDefendants to pay Hunt his benefits and award to him prejudgment interest, costs and reasonable\n\nattorneys' fees.\"\n\n        Count III, titled \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty,\" alleged in pertinent part:\n\n        the defendants were fiduciaries under ERISA;\n\n        \"ALPA has a duty not to interfere with Hunt's interest\";\n\n        \"[t]he value of Hunt's [Plan] account continues to decrease since his effective retirement\n\n   36\n    Hunt also alleged that he \"relied on [Hawthorne's] representations [that he would receive his\nbenefits between June 15 and 30, 1991] and on the terms of the Plan in establishing his business\nand activities following his retirement [from Eastern].\"\n\f       date\";\n\n       the defendants \"willfully and wantonly breached their fiduciary duty to Hunt by failing to\n       pay [his lump-sum benefit], by failing to respond to Hunt's requests for information, by\n       interfering with Hunt's rights to [his benefit], and by failing to discharge their duties solely\n       in the interest of the participants for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits in\n       accordance with the [Plan] documents\";\n\n       the decision to impose the moratorium on lump-sum benefits was \"arbitrary and capricious,\n       [was] contrary to the terms of the [Plan] and [was] contrary to law\"; and\n\n       \"[a]s a result of Defendants' breach of the fiduciary duties, Hunt has been damaged by failing\n       to receive his lump sum payout and the resulting payment of increased interest expense for\n       loans obtained pending payment.\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded \"compensatory and punitive damages against Defendants jointly and\n\nseverally and request[ed] entry of an order awarding to him prejudgment interest, costs and\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees.\"\n\n       Count IV, titled \"Recovery of Benefits,\" alleged that \"Hunt has been damaged by Defendants'\n\nfailure to pay Hunt the benefits to which he is entitled under the [Plan].\" Accordingly, Hunt\n\ndemanded \"judgment against Defendants jointly and severally for payment of his benefits under the\n\n[Plan], plus prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.\"\n\n       Count V, titled \"Estoppel,\" alleged in pertinent part:\n\n       \"Defendants represented to Hunt that he was fully vested, that the [Plan] was fully funded,\n       and that his benefits would be paid before June 30, 1991\";\n\n       \"Hunt relied on the terms of the [Plan] and on the representation of Defendants in\n       determining his retirement date and in establishing his business plan and financial affairs\n       upon retirement\"; and\n\n       \"Defendants should be estopped to deny payment and to refuse to process payment to Hunt.\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded \"judgment against Defendants jointly and severally for payment of\n\nhis benefits under the [Plan], plus prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.\"\n\n       Count VI, titled \"Declaratory Judgment,\" alleged that the defendants \"failure to pay to Hunt\n\nthe benefits to which he is entitled as set forth in the [Plan] have raised dispute regarding Hunt's\n\nentitlement (right) to immediate payment of the [Plan] benefits under the terms of the [Plan] and\n\nERISA\" and that \"Chapter 86 Fla. Stat.[ ] provides that such rights may be determined by the court.\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt requested that \"this court enter an order declaring his right to payment of his\n\flump sum [Plan] benefits under the terms of the [Plan] and pursuant to ERISA and awarding to Hunt\n\ncosts of this proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees.\"\n\n          The defendants, proceeding individually, responded to Hunt's complaint. Hawthorne and\n\nthe Bankruptcy Trustee, who appeared for Eastern, filed answers that denied liability and included\n\nthe affirmative defense that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief. The remaining\n\ndefendants, with the exception of Copeland, moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P.\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief;37 Copeland moved for dismissal on the ground that\n\nHunt had not served him with process as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j).38 Because Hunt had\n\n\"demonstrated neither good reason for Copeland's continued presence in this lawsuit nor good cause\n\nfor the lack of timely service upon Copeland,\" the court dismissed Copeland from the case.39\n\n          Before the court could address the question whether the complaint stated a claim for relief\n\nagainst any of the defendants, the Bankruptcy Trustee moved the district court on August 6, 1992,\n\nfor summary judgment on the grounds, among others, that Eastern was not a fiduciary under the Plan\n\nbecause its duties were purely ministerial; that Eastern lacked discretion to impose the moratorium;\n\nand that the moratorium was imposed at the TAC's direction. Although the Plan contained no\n\nprovision requiring Eastern to accept the TAC's decisions as binding, Eastern contended that it \"had\n\nno choice but to abide by\" the TAC's decision to impose a moratorium on the payment of lump-sum\n\nbenefits. Finally, Eastern contended that \"its sole obligation in the retirement benefits process is\nlimited to determining eligibility, here whether an applicant meets the age criteria.\" \"Once this is\n\ndone,\" Eastern argued, \"[it] has no role in deciding whether to pay an eligible participant benefits,\n\n\n   37\n        ALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.\n   38\n        Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j), now Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), provided in pertinent part:\n\n                  If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within\n                  120 days after the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such\n                  service was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made\n                  within that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without\n                  prejudice upon the court's own initiative with notice to such party or upon motion.\n\n   39\n        The district court issued its order dismissing Copeland from the case on January 4, 1993.\n\fwhat benefits an eligible participant is entitled to, or how those benefits will be distributed\"\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       On October 1, 1992, while this motion for summary judgment and the Rule 12(b)(6) motions\n\nto dismiss were still pending, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA jointly moved the bankruptcy court\n\nfor the entry of an order pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363 approving the Document 91C amendment to\n\nthe Plan. See supra part I.D. Their motion advised the bankruptcy court of the following:\n\n               On July 27, 1992, Eastern and ALPA entered into a letter of agreement to amend the\n       [Plan], conditioned on the approval of this Court. Under the agreement, designated as\n       \"Document 91C', the [Plan] would be amended to provide ... for the segregation of the assets\n       of the [Plan] into liquid and illiquid segments, and would modify the distribution of\n       lump-sum benefits under the [Plan].\n\n               Under Document 91C, Eastern would remain both the \"Sponsor' and the\n       \"Administrator' of the [Plan] for purposes of [ERISA]. Eastern and ALPA have been told\n       that one or more groups object to Document 91C, and may file suit challenging its\n       implementation. Because Eastern's ministerial role in the [Plan] is a continuing obligation\n       of the estate, and to provide a single forum to consider the objections to Document 91C, the\n       [Bankruptcy] Trustee and ALPA hereby jointly seek an Order from this Court approving\n       Document 91C under its authority to approve contracts made by the [Bankruptcy] Trustee\n       other than in the ordinary course of business. See 11 U.S.C. § 363.\n\n       On October 26, 1992, Hunt, acting through his attorney in the instant case, filed with the\n\nbankruptcy court an \"Objection to Joint Motion for Entry of Order Approving Amendment to\n\n[Plan].\" The essence of his objection was that \"[t]he movants have failed to provide any authority\n\nwhich would permit amendment of the [Plan] in such a manner that would alter or adversely impact\n\nHunt's ability to receive a lump sum payment upon his retirement.\" According to Hunt, section 13.1\n\nof the Plan precluded any amendment that would \"adversely affect the retirement benefits provided\n\nto the participant at the time of the modification.\" Alternatively, Hunt had \"no objection to any\n\namendment that excepts or exempts him, or that otherwise permits him to receive his lump sum\n\npayout.\"   Finally, Hunt contended that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the\n\nadministration of the Plan because \"Eastern's involvement in the [Plan], according to its own\n\nrepresentations, is merely ministerial.       The motion seeks to elevate and escalate Eastern's\n\ninvolvement in administering the Plan without providing plan participants with any means of\n\nparticipating in Eastern's administration.\"\n\n       On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the Bankruptcy Trustee's and\n\fALPA's joint motion for approval of the Document 91C amendment to the Plan. In addressing\n\nobjections of Plan participants such as Hunt, the court stated the following:\n\n                  It is clear from this record that the objections are not well-founded. The record does\n          support the relief that has been requested, which does give equitable treatment to inherent\n          competing interests to the [Plan]. In any situation such as this there are always competing\n          interests. And it is clear from this record that the proposal is equitable.\n\nThe bankruptcy court granted the joint motion. According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, neither Hunt\n\nnor any other objector appealed this ruling.\n\n          On December 4, 1992, following the bankruptcy court's approval of the Document 91C\n\namendment to the lump-sum benefit provision of the Plan, Hunt moved the district court for leave\n\nto file an amended complaint. The Bankruptcy Trustee, ALPA, and Hawthorne opposed Hunt's\n\nmotion in separate filings.40 The Bankruptcy Trustee and Hawthorne argued that Hunt's motion\n\nshould be denied on the ground that the bankruptcy court's rejection of Hunt's objection to the\n\napproval of the Document 91C amendment barred his claim for a lump-sum benefit. The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee also represented that Hunt \"had a full opportunity to address his concerns before\n\nthe bankruptcy court. Having failed in his efforts before the bankruptcy court, he [was] barred under\n\nthe doctrine of res judicata from collaterally attacking Document 91C before this [District] Court.\"41\n\nALPA objected to Hunt's proposed amended complaint on the ground that the claims Hunt proposed\n\nto assert against it were frivolous.\n\n          On February 1, 1993, the district court disposed of three of the pending motions. The first\ntwo were ALPA's alternative motions to dismiss Hunt's complaint for failure to state a claim for\n\nrelief and for summary judgment. The court granted both motions. It concluded that ALPA was not\n\nan administrator of the Plan and that Hunt's breach of fiduciary duty claim was improperly asserted;\n\nALPA, therefore, could not have been held liable for any of the relief Hunt sought in Counts I\n\nthrough IV. The court also rejected Hunt's Count V estoppel claim because the complaint failed to\n\n\n   40\n        Defendants Copeland and O'Connor did not respond to Hunt's motion.\n   41\n     According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, the bankruptcy court heard and rejected Hunt's\nobjection to the approval of the Document 91C amendment on November 13, 1992, and Hunt did\nnot appeal this ruling. Hunt did not contest this representation.\n\fallege that Hunt had relied on a representation made by ALPA.\n\n        The third motion disposed of was Hunt's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The\n\ncourt denied that motion \"because ... [the amended complaint Hunt tendered with his motion]\n\nsuffer[ed] from some of the same infirmities contained in his original complaint.\" The court did not\n\nspecify the infirmities in Hunt's original complaint; whatever they were, the court gave Hunt\n\ntwenty-two days to cure them and to \"file an appropriate amended complaint.\"\n\n                                                  C.\n\n        On February 24, 1993, Hunt filed an amended complaint. Without obtaining leave of court\n\nas required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 21, Hunt dropped from the case four of the defendants named in his\n\noriginal complaint: Eastern, ALPA, Copeland, and O'Connor.42 He replaced them with two new\n\ndefendants, the TAC and the Plan, which joined Hawthorne as the defendants in the case. The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee subsequently learned that Hunt had dropped Eastern from the case, and on April\n\n30, 1993, it obtained from Hunt and filed with the court a stipulation that recited:\n\n               Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiff ... Hunt\n        and defendant ... Eastern ... hereby agree and stipulate that the above captioned action shall\n\n\n\n\n   42\n      Fed.R.Civ.P. 21, \"Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of Parties,\" provides in pertinent part:\n\"Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own\ninitiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\" A plaintiff who has been\ngiven leave to file an amended complaint may drop a defendant from the case without obtaining\na Rule 21 order if the defendant has not responded to the original complaint with an answer. See\ngenerally 3 Moore's Federal Practice, §§ 15.10, 15.11 (3d ed.1997); 4 Moore's Federal Practice,\n§ 21.02[5][b] (3d ed.1997) (discussing the interrelationship of Rules 15 and 21 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure). ALPA and O'Connor did not answer Hunt's original complaint;\nALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and O'Connor filed a\nmotion to dismiss. Hunt, therefore, was not required to file a Rule 21 motion and obtain an order\ndismissing those defendants from the case. Eastern, however, answered Hunt's original\ncomplaint; consequently, Hunt could not drop Eastern from the case without moving the court\npursuant to Rule 21 for an order dismissing Eastern \"on such terms as are just.\" Hunt was free,\nhowever, to obtain Eastern's dismissal from the case by filing with the court a stipulation under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(ii). As we observe above and in part III.B, infra, Hunt eventually\nfollowed this route, obtaining Eastern's dismissal by entering into a stipulation providing for the\ndismissal of his claims against Eastern with prejudice.\n\n                We note that Hunt did not move the court pursuant to Rule 21 to add the TAC and\n        Plan as defendants. Neither party objected to being added, and thus the matter is not an\n        issue here.\n\f        be and hereby is dismissed with prejudice as to Eastern, each party to bear its own costs.43\n        Hunt's amended complaint contained seven counts. With the minor exceptions set out in the\n\nmargin, the first six counts of the amended complaint simply replicated the allegations and prayers\n\nfor relief contained in the original complaint. For example, as before, Count I was titled \"Failure\n\nto Provide Information\"; Count II was titled \"Action to Enforce Rights under [Plan]\"; Count III was\n\ntitled \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty\"; Count IV was titled \"Recovery of Benefits\"; Count V was titled\n\n\"Estoppel\"; and Count VI was titled \"Declaratory Judgment.\"44\n\n   43\n    The Bankruptcy Trustee's attorney and Hunt's attorney signed the stipulation on April 22,\n1993, and April 29, 1993, respectively.\n   44\n     The principal difference between the two complaints was that instead of seeking recovery\nfrom the parties named as defendants in the original complaint, the counts of the amended\ncomplaint sought relief only from the defendants named in the amended complaint. Other than\nthis difference, the \"amended\" Count I was an exact duplicate of the original Count I. Count II\nadded the following allegation, which was implicit in the allegations of the original Count II:\n\"These defendants have improperly, and without authority, interfered with Hunt's attempts to\nreceive payment through the imposition of a moratorium, or modification and amendment of the\n[Plan].\"\n\n                Count III, the breach of fiduciary duty claim, added the allegations listed below in\n        an attempt to circumvent the dismissal of this claim on the ground that an individual plan\n        participant lacks standing under ERISA to sue a plan fiduciary for money damages. That\n        Hunt lacked standing as a plan participant to bring a breach of fiduciary duty claim\n        against the TAC had previously been brought to the district court's attention, and the\n        court had informed his attorney that Hunt could not bring the claim for his own benefit,\n        as opposed to the benefit of all participants. As Hunt's attorney well knew, the right to\n        sue for breach of fiduciary duty belonged to all of the plan's participants as a group. See\n        Massachusetts Mut. Life. Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 140, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3089, 87\n        L.Ed.2d 96 (1985) (finding that recovery for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA §\n        409, 29 U.S.C. § 1109, \"inures to the benefit of the plan as a whole\"). In an effort to\n        shore up the original Count III and persuade the district court to accord him standing for\n        the breach of fiduciary claim, Hunt alleged:\n\n                       The [Plan] itself is effectively precluded from challenging the fiduciary\n               duties of these defendants in that these defendants are inextricably tied to the\n               [Plan] itself through their roles, activities, insured interests and administration of\n               the [Plan]. Hunt has no other recourse for the actions of these fiduciaries with\n               regard to his interest in the [Plan].\n\n                       Defendants have willfully and wantonly breached their fiduciary duty to\n               Hunt and to the [Plan] itself, by failing to pay [Plan] benefits to Hunt, by failing\n               to respond to Hunt's requests for information, by interfering with Hunt's rights to\n               these monies, and by failing to discharge their duties solely in the interest of the\n               participants for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits in accordance with the\n               [Plan] documents (emphasis added).\n\f        In the original complaint, twenty-four paragraphs preceded the presentation of the counts.\n\nThe amended complaint had twenty-five such paragraphs. These paragraphs, compared to their\n\ncounterparts in the original complaint, differed materially in the following way. After alleging in\n\nthe original complaint that the Document 91C amendment affecting Hunt's lump-sum benefit had\n\nbeen made by Eastern and ALPA, which were no longer parties in the case, Hunt changed his\n\nposition and alleged that the TAC, which \"renders decisions regarding administration of the [Plan],\"\n\nwas the party responsible for the moratorium rather than Eastern or ALPA. According to Hunt,\n\nEastern and ALPA were \"the only entities which can act to amend or modify the [Plan]\"; he\n\ntherefore implied that the moratorium allegedly imposed by the TAC constituted an unauthorized\n\namendment or modification of the Plan.\n\n        As noted, the amended complaint added a seventh count to those asserted in the original\n\ncomplaint. Count VII, titled \"Injunctive Relief,\" alleged essentially that the defendants had breached\n\ntheir duty to maintain sufficient \"reserves\" with which to pay Hunt's lump-sum benefit. It alleged\n\nfurther that\n\n               [n]o other parties will be prejudiced by enjoining the imposition of the moratorium,\n\n\n                The new Count III also added this allegation, which followed the replicated\n        allegation that the moratorium was \"arbitrary and capricious, [was] contrary to the terms\n        of the [Plan], and [was] contrary to law\":\n\n                       Alternatively, if the moratorium was imposed because of the [Plan's]\n               inability to pay lump sum benefits to retiring employees electing that option, then\n               these Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the [Plan] and to Hunt\n               through mismanagement and failure to take such action to ensure that the [Plan]\n               was adequately funded so as to pay the lump sum benefit option exercised by\n               Hunt.\n\n                Finally, the new Count III added this language to its prayer for compensatory and\n        punitive damages: \"[I]n the alternative, [Hunt] demands judgment for damages on behalf\n        of the [Plan] in an amount sufficient to fully fund the retirement benefits authorized\n        under the [Plan].\"\n\n                The sole addition of note to new Count IV was the allegation that the moratorium\n        and the Document 91C amendment to the lump-sum benefit provision, which the\n        bankruptcy court had approved, were \"arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and [ ] contrary\n        to the provisions of the [Plan].\" New Count V, the estoppel claim, added the allegation\n        that the defendants were estopped from enforcing against Hunt the moratorium or the\n        Document 91C amendment. Count VI, the declaratory judgment claim, was renewed\n        verbatim.\n\f          modification or amendment or payments made thereunder beyond keeping sufficient reserves\n          for the payment of Hunt's lump sum benefit; i.e., payments would continue under the [Plan],\n          but defendants would be enjoined from so depleting the liquid portion of the fund that Hunt's\n          total lump sum benefit could be paid.\n\nAccordingly, Hunt \"demand[ed] that [the] Court enter an order enjoining payment of benefits under\n\nthe [Plan] to current beneficiaries, at least to the extent that sufficient funds are retained to pay\n\nHunt's lump sum benefit, interest, costs and attorney's fees.\"\n\n          The TAC and the Plan jointly moved the court to dismiss the counts of the amended\n\ncomplaint on the ground that none stated a claim for relief.45 In part, they repeated the arguments\n\npreviously addressed to the sufficiency of Hunt's original complaint and advanced in the Bankruptcy\n\nTrustee's and ALPA's objections to Hunt's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. These\n\narguments included the claim that Hunt lacked standing to sue for breach of fiduciary duty and that\n\nthe moratorium and the bankruptcy court's approval of the Document 91C amendment foreclosed\n\nhis claim. As for Hunt's claim seeking the $100 per day statutory penalty, these defendants\n\ncontended that such penalties were assessable only against the administrator of the Plan, Eastern,\n\nwhich had been dismissed from the case with prejudice. Hawthorne answered the complaint with\n\na general denial of liability.\n\n          The district court disposed of the joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the\n\nfollowing manner: the court (1) denied the motion to dismiss Count I; (2) denied the motion to\n\ndismiss Count II; (3) dismissed Count III to the extent that it sought comprehensive and punitive\n\ndamages for Hunt, but held that he had standing to sue the TAC for breach of fiduciary duty on\n\nbehalf of the Plan's participants; (4) denied the motion to dismiss Count IV; (5) dismissed Count\n\nV after Hunt conceded that he had no case for estoppel; (6) dismissed Count VI on the ground of\n\nERISA preemption; and (7) denied the motion to dismiss Count VII, although the court was unable\n\nto discern—from what it described as an \"inartfully\" drafted pleading—whether Hunt stated a claim\n\nfor relief.\n\n          Following these rulings, the TAC and the Plan answered the amended complaint, denying\n\n\n   45\n        The TAC and the Plan were represented by the same counsel throughout this case.\n\fliability, and then jointly moved for summary judgment. Their motion essentially restated the\n\narguments presented in their motion to dismiss. Hawthorne also moved for summary judgment. It\n\ncontended, among other things, that Hunt's claim for the lump-sum benefit (Counts II and IV) could\n\nbe brought only against the Plan and a person or entity, such as the Plan administrator, possessing\n\nthe authority to order the payment of his benefit. Hawthorne argued that it had no such authority\n\nand, thus, could not provide the relief sought. In addition, Hawthorne contended that it could not\n\nbe held liable for breach of fiduciary duty (Count III) because the Plan, the appropriate plaintiff for\n\nsuch a cause of action, was not injured by the failure to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n       The court deferred ruling on these motions for summary judgment until the morning that the\n\ntrial of the case began. In the meantime, Hawthorne settled with Hunt and agreed to the entry of\n\njudgment in favor of Hunt on Count I in the sum of $10,000; all other counts against Hawthorne\n\nwere to be dismissed with prejudice. The court denied the only motion that was pending, the TAC's\n\nand the Plan's motion for summary judgment, and the trial commenced.\n\n                                                  D.\n\n       The case was tried to the court. Five counts from the amended complaint were at issue:\n\nHunt's claim for the $100 per day statutory penalty under Count I; his identical claims under Counts\n\nII and IV seeking judgment in the amount of the lump-sum benefit, prejudgment interest, costs, and\n\nattorneys' fees; his claim on behalf of the Plan participants for breach of fiduciary duty under Count\n\nIII; and his request that the TAC and the Plan be enjoined from paying benefits to other participants\n\nuntil they satisfied his claim under Count VII.\n\n       After considering the evidence adduced by the parties, the court, in an \"Order Directing\n\nEntry of Judgment,\" held as follows:\n\n       Count I. The court found that only designated plan administrators are subject to the $100\n\npenalty imposed by ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c), for failing to respond to a\n\nplan-participant's requests for information as required by the statute. Because Hunt had neither\n\nestablished that the TAC was the Plan administrator nor that it had assumed the\n\n\"information-providing function\" of the administrator, the TAC could not be held liable under\n\fsection 502(c).\n\n       Counts II and IV. The court first found that Hunt had properly applied for the lump-sum\n\nbenefit and that his application had been denied because of the moratorium the TAC had \"imposed\"\n\nunilaterally. The TAC had done so because it concluded that a \"moratorium was needed to maintain\n\nthe financial integrity of the [Plan] and to protect the economic interests of all plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries.\" The court then turned to the question whether the TAC had the authority to impose\n\nthe moratorium for such purpose. Although the Plan did not expressly give the TAC such authority,\n\nthe court assumed that the common law of trusts did so. Having made that determination, the court\n\naddressed the question whether Hunt or the TAC had the burden of proof regarding the need for the\n\nmoratorium: it concluded that the TAC had the burden.\n\n       With this ruling in hand, the court considered whether the TAC's proof established that \"its\n\naction was both prudent and necessary to protect the interests of all plan participants and their\n\nbeneficiaries.\" The court held that although the moratorium may have been justified, the TAC's\n\nproof was insufficient to carry the day. The court therefore gave Hunt judgment on Counts II and\n\nIV in the sum of $352,748.74 plus costs.\n\n       Count III. The court's findings on this claim are ambiguous. Hunt had alleged that \"if the\n\nmoratorium was imposed [by the TAC] because of the [Plan's] inability to pay lump sum benefits\n\nto retiring employees electing that option, then these Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties\n\nto the [Plan] and to Hunt through mismanagement and failure to take such action to ensure that the\n\n[Plan] was adequately funded so as to pay the lump sum benefit option exercised by Hunt.\" See\n\nsupra note 44. In other words, the TAC breached its fiduciary duty to the Plan's participants, and\n\ntherefore to Hunt, by imposing the moratorium because of its inability to pay the lump-sum benefits.\n\n       The court found no such breach: \"Hunt submitted neither evidence of mismanagement\n\nnor—assuming, for the sake of argument, that he proved a breach of fiduciary duty—evidence from\n\nwhich this court could fashion a remedy. Hunt having thus failed to satisfy his burden of proof on\n\nCount III, judgment will be entered in favor of the defendants.\"\n\n       Therefore, under the district court's analysis, whether the TAC had breached its fiduciary\n\fduty to the Plan participants, including Hunt, by imposing the moratorium turned on which party\n\nhad the burden of proof. On Counts II and IV, the court held that the TAC had the burden but failed\n\nto sustain it by showing that prudence required that a moratorium be imposed. On Count III, the\n\ncourt held that Hunt had the burden of proof but failed to show that the TAC had acted imprudently\n\nin imposing the moratorium.46\n\n        The district court's \"Order Directing Entry of Judgment\" makes no mention of the remaining\n\ncount (Count VII). After disposing of the other counts in the amended complaint by number,\n\nincluding Counts V and VI which were dismissed from the case prior to trial, the court instructed\n\nthe clerk of court in paragraph four of its order (\"paragraph 4\") how judgment should be entered:\n\n\"4. On the remaining counts [i.e., Counts II, IV, and VII], the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of\n\nHarry L. Hunt in the amount of $352,748.74 plus costs. The judgment shall be paid from the [Plan]\n\n[F]und.\" We read this language, and the final judgment entered by the clerk, as disposing of Count\n\nVII in favor of Hunt,47 although the court did not grant the injunctive relief the count requested.48\n\n        Following the entry of final judgment, the TAC and the Plan appealed the district court's\n\njudgment on Counts II and IV. Hunt cross-appealed the court's judgment on Count I but not Count\n\n\n   46\n     How the court could assume, \"for sake of argument, that [Hunt] proved a breach of fiduciary\nduty\" and then deny him relief on Count III is a question that the court's dispositive order does\nnot answer.\n   47\n     By treating the district court's final judgment as having terminated Count VII of Hunt's\namended complaint, we have a final judgment before us that is appealable under 28 U.S.C. §\n1291 because the judgment has adjudicated all claims against all parties. See, e.g., Penton v.\nPompano Constr. Co., 963 F.2d 321, 321-22 (11th Cir.1992). Hunt's amendment of his\ncomplaint, which deleted ALPA and O'Connor from the action, operated to dismiss those parties\nfrom the suit. See supra note 42. The amendment, however, did not operate to dismiss Eastern\nfrom the case. Id. Rather, Eastern was dismissed from the case, with prejudice, when Hunt and\nEastern executed a stipulation of dismissal and filed it with the court. See Oswalt v. Scripto,\nInc., 616 F.2d 191, 194-95 (5th Cir.1980). In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209\n(11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this circuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former\nFifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.\n   48\n     The district court, despite deciding sub silentio Count VII in Hunt's favor, granted him no\nrelief on this count. In their briefs, the parties have ignored Count VII altogether; like the\ndistrict court, they made no mention of it. Because of our disposition of Hunt's explicit claim for\nbenefits contained in Counts II and IV, Count VII falls by the wayside. That is to say, we vacate\nthe court's judgment on Count VII and direct the court to enter judgment in favor of the TAC and\nthe Plan on that count.\n\fIII. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the court's judgment on Counts II and IV, and affirm as\n\nto Count I.\n\n                                                   III.\n\n          Paragraph 4 of the district court's \"Order Directing Entry of Judgment,\" which gave Hunt\n\njudgment on Counts II, IV, and VII for the lump-sum benefit, presents several threshold issues that\n\nmust be resolved before we can consider the merits of his claim to that benefit. As stated previously,\n\nin paragraph 4, the court directed the clerk to \"enter judgment in favor of [Hunt] in the amount of\n\n$352,748.74 plus costs. The judgment shall be paid from the [Plan] [F]und.\"49\n\n          The first threshold question is whether the relief granted in paragraph 4 is legal or\n\nequitable;50 that is, does the relief granted constitute a money judgment or an in personam order\n\ndirecting the TAC or the Plan to pay Hunt a sum of money from the assets of the Plan's Fund. The\n\nanswer to this question is important because, as we explain below, the relief provided in an action\n\nto recover benefits under ERISA is equitable, not legal. More specifically, the relief consists of an\n\norder directing a person or entity having the necessary authority under the benefit plan to pay the\n\nparticipant the benefit that he seeks. Hunt sought such equitable relief in Count II of his amended\n\ncomplaint, asking the district court to enter \"an order requiring Defendants to pay Hunt his benefits.\"\n\nIn Count IV, Hunt sought legal relief, demanding \"judgment against Defendants ... jointly and\n\nseverally for payment of his benefits.\" In Count VII, titled \"Injunctive Relief,\" Hunt asked the court\nto \"enter an order enjoining payment of benefits ... to current beneficiaries, at least to the extent that\n\nsufficient funds are retained to pay Hunt's lump sum benefit.\"\n\n          Nothing in the language of paragraph 4 orders the TAC to do anything. If, however, we\n\nconstrue—that is, effectively rewrite—paragraph 4 so that it orders the TAC to pay the benefit from\n\nthe Fund,51 then we must decide whether the TAC has the authority under the Plan to effect payment;\n\n   49\n        We note that the final judgment entered by the clerk quoted this language verbatim.\n   50\n    If the relief granted in paragraph 4 is equitable, we have jurisdiction to review the grant\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). See supra note 47.\n   51\n   In his original complaint, of course, Hunt took the position that Eastern, as Plan\nadministrator, was the party having the authority to effect payment of the benefit he is seeking;\n\fif not, the TAC cannot provide the relief sought. Despite its representations to the contrary, Eastern,\n\nthe Plan administrator, obviously could effect payment if ordered to do so, see supra part I.C and\n\ninfra part III.B, but Hunt voluntarily dismissed it from the case with prejudice. Nor can the Plan as\n\nan entity provide any relief; the Plan alone is simply a written instrument executed by Eastern and\n\nALPA.\n\n        We turn now to these issues, taking them up in order.\n\n                                                   A.\n\n         Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA provides that \"[a] civil action may be brought by a\n\nparticipant or beneficiary ... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce\n\nhis rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the\n\nplan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). On its face, this language does not indicate whether a participant\n\nseeking to recover retirement benefits may obtain legal or equitable relief. Although the \"causes of\n\naction authorized by section 502(a)(1)(B) [of ERISA] are not explicitly denominated as equitable,\"\n\nsee Pane v. RCA Corp., 868 F.2d 631, 636 (3d Cir.1989),52 this circuit has treated actions to recover\n\nbenefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) as equitable in nature. See, e.g., Shannon v. Jack Eckerd Corp.,\n\n113 F.3d 208, 209-10 (11th Cir.1997) (denying appeal of district court's judgment ordering plan\n\nadministrator to pay benefits to plan participant); Godfrey v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., 89 F.3d\n\n755, 756-57 (11th Cir.1996) (affirming district court's issuance of \"an injunction ordering [Plan\nadministrator] to comply with ERISA and pay [participant] ... benefits\"). This position is consistent\n\nwith our view that participants suing under section 502(a)(1)(B) are not entitled to a jury trial. In\n\nBlake v. Unionmutual Stock Life Ins. Co. of America, we reasoned:\n\n\nthis was his reason for naming Eastern as a party defendant in his claims to recover his\nlump-sum benefit. Since eliminating Eastern from his amended complaint as a party defendant,\nHunt has taken the position that the TAC, not Eastern, is the entity having the authority to effect\npayment of the benefit.\n   52\n     In Pane, the Third Circuit aptly captured the distinction between legal and equitable relief in\nthe context of an action brought under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA: \"A legal remedy would\nresult in a money judgment enforceable only by execution, or other conventional common law\nprocess such as ejectment or replevin. An equitable remedy would result in a judgment\nenforceable in personam and by contempt.\" 868 F.2d at 635-36.\n\f        The nature of an action under section 502(a)(1)(B) is for the enforcement of the ERISA plan.\n        Although the plaintiffs assert that they are claiming money damages, in effect they are\n        claiming the benefits they are allegedly entitled to under the plan. Although ... a money\n        judgment would satisfy their demands, ... only an order for continuing benefits would be\n        sufficient. This is traditionally equitable relief....\n\n906 F.2d 1525, 1526 (11th Cir.1990). This view accords with the majority of circuits that have\n\nconsidered this issue.53 We therefore hold that Hunt's claim for legal relief (i.e., a money judgment)\n\nunder section 502(a)(1)(B) fails to state a claim. Accordingly, we dismiss Count IV of Hunt's\n\namended complaint, leaving only his claim for equitable relief in Count II to recover his lump-sum\n\nbenefit.\n\n           Given the equitable nature of Hunt's recovery-of-benefits claim under ERISA, we also find\n\nthat an in personam order enjoining the payment of benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) must be\n\ndirected to a person or entity other than the plan itself. While ERISA § 502(d)(1), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(d)(1), does state that \"[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued ... as an entity,\" nothing\n\nin ERISA permits the district court to issue an injunctive order solely against the plan.54 Rather, the\n\ncase law of this circuit demonstrates that an order enjoining the payment of benefits from an ERISA\n\nplan must issue against a party capable of providing the relief requested. See, e.g., Shannon, 113\n\n\n   53\n     See Wardle v. Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 627 F.2d 820,\n829 (7th Cir.1980) (\"We conclude that Congress' silence on the jury right issue reflects an\nintention that suits for pension benefits by disappointed applicants are equitable.\"), cert. denied,\n449 U.S. 1112, 101 S.Ct. 922, 66 L.Ed.2d 841 (1981); see also Sullivan v. LTV Aerospace and\nDefense Co., 82 F.3d 1251, 1258-59 (2d Cir.1996); Berry v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 761 F.2d 1003,\n1007 (4th Cir.1985); Turner v. CF & I Steel Corp., 770 F.2d 43, 47 (3d Cir.1985), cert. denied,\n474 U.S. 1058, 106 S.Ct. 800, 88 L.Ed.2d 776 (1986); In re Vorpahl, 695 F.2d 318, 321-22 (8th\nCir.1982); Calamia v. Spivey, 632 F.2d 1235, 1237 (5th Cir. Unit A 1980). Some district courts\nhave suggested that Firestone Tire & Rubber v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d\n80 (1989), calls these holdings into doubt. See, e.g., Hulcher v. United Behavioral Sys., 919\nF.Supp. 879, 885 (E.D.Va.1995) (holding that \"action to recover [ERISA] benefits under the\nsubject plan are legal in nature\" and that \"[p]laintiff is constitutionally entitled to trial by jury on\nany claim raised under § 1132(a)(1)(B)\"); Vaughn v. Owen Steel Co., 871 F.Supp. 247, 250-51\n(D.S.C.1994) (finding that section 502 claim under ERISA is analogous to state law contract\nclaim and must be tried before jury). None of the courts of appeals mentioned above, however,\nhave endorsed the reasoning of these district courts.\n   54\n     ERISA § 502(d)(2) states that \"[a]ny money judgment ... against an employee benefit plan\nshall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any\nother person unless liability against such person is established in his individual capacity.\" 29\nU.S.C. § 1132(d)(2). This provision contemplates legal relief and does not apply to an action to\nrecover benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B).\n\fF.3d at 209-10; Godfrey, 89 F.3d at 756-57; cf. Fisher v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 1073, 1074\n\n(5th Cir.1990) (affirming district court's dismissal of plaintiff's second amended complaint in part\n\nfor failure to name the plan administrator as an \"indispensable party\"). We therefore reject the\n\nnotion that an injunctive order to pay benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA can issue solely\n\nagainst an ERISA plan as an entity.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n         We next examine the district court's ruling in paragraph 4 that \"the clerk shall enter\n\njudgment in favor of Harry L. Hunt [on Counts II, IV, and VII]\" and that \"[t]he judgment shall be\n\npaid from the [Plan] fund.\" Because an injunctive order cannot issue against the Plan itself, we\n\nassume that we have discretion to construe—i.e., effectively rewrite—paragraph 4 so that it directs\n\nthe TAC to pay Hunt the lump-sum benefit from the Fund.\n\n        Our review of the record and the Plan,55 however, makes clear that the TAC has no authority\n\nunder the Plan to issue or deny payment of a lump-sum benefit to a participant. Rather, the TAC\n\nhas limited powers under the Plan56 and plays no role in the process of reviewing applications for\n\nretirement benefits. Unlike Eastern, the TAC's authority is primarily limited to the management and\n\nsupervision of the Fund's assets. Its \"overall supervisory responsibility\" is restricted to the\n\n\"administrative functions of the Fund,\" see § 2.13(b)(i) (\"Fund Administration\"), and its duty to the\n\nPlan is limited \"to maintain[ing] surveillance over the status and administration of the Plan and the\n[Fund],\" see § 10.2(b) (\"Rights and Duties of the [TAC]\").\n\n        In addition, as discussed in part I.B, supra, the TAC must exercise its limited powers in a\n\nmanner consistent with its obligations to ALPA. For example, before selecting and replacing\n\ninvestment advisors and trustees, the TAC must notify ALPA of its planned course of action and\n\n\n   55\n     Unless otherwise specified, the term \"Plan\" in part III refers to the written instrument in\neffect at the time Hunt's application was \"approved\" on April 22, 1991 (i.e., Documents 91 and\n91A).\n   56\n     We review the relevant provisions of the Plan here because a named fiduciary must\ndischarge its duties \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\ninsofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with [ERISA].\" ERISA §\n404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D).\n\fgive ALPA an opportunity to respond. See § 2.7(b) (\"Trust Agreement and Trustee\"). Similarly,\n\nbefore giving any notice or instruction to a trustee of the Fund, the TAC must serve a copy of the\n\ntrust direction on ALPA and give it fifteen days to object to the TAC's proposed direction. See §\n\n2.8 (\"Directions to Trustee(s)). In addition, the TAC must \"regularly and periodically suppl[y]\"\n\ninformation to ALPA about transactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status, documentation\n\nand Fund performance,\" see § 2.11 (\"Information and Accountability\"), and furnish to ALPA and\n\nPlan participants reports about the TAC's \"functions, actions, and decisions ... as are reasonable and\n\nappropriate,\" see § 10.2(c).\n\n        In stark contrast, the plain language of the Plan gives Eastern broad discretion as\n\nadministrator to make decisions for the Plan. The Supreme Court has stated that a plan administrator\n\nhas a \"statutory responsibility [under ERISA] ... to run the plan in accordance with the currently\n\noperative, governing plan documents.\" Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U.S. 73, 84,\n\n115 S.Ct. 1223, 1231, 131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995). Section 2.2(a) of the Plan confers upon Eastern\n\n\"those powers necessary to carry out the day to day operation of the Plan.\" Its responsibilities\n\ninclude the authority to \"initially determine all questions arising from the administration,\n\ninterpretation, and application of the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements and contracts,\n\nand such determination shall be binding upon all persons, except as otherwise provided by law, and\n\nfurther provided that each Participant shall be granted the same treatment under similar conditions.\"\nId. The Plan also charges Eastern with the responsibility for, inter alia, keeping records, see § 2.4\n\n(\"Records\"), preparing and distributing periodic Plan summaries, see § 2.5 (\"Plan Summary\"), and\n\nsending to each participant an annual statement reflecting the value of his investment in the Plan,\n\nsee § 2.6 (\"Annual Statement\").\n\n        More important, based on the record before us,57 we find that Eastern exercises ultimate\n\nauthority in determining whether a participant should receive payment of his benefit. The record\n\n   57\n    As stated in part I.C and note 12, supra, the Plan does not set forth the procedure for\nprocessing claims for retirement benefits. This account of the claims-processing procedure is\ntaken from the affidavit and deposition of Charles Dyer of Hawthorne and the affidavit of Brian\nWhite, who served as Director of the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department. Both accounts\nof Eastern's claims-processing procedure are virtually identical.\n\freveals that Eastern plays the central role in the process of reviewing applications for benefits. The\n\nPlan makes Eastern responsible for providing the benefit-application forms to participants. See §\n\n12.9(a) (\"Application for Benefits\").58 A pilot seeking a lump-sum payment must complete the\n\nnecessary paperwork and inform an Eastern management employee, the Chief Pilot, of his intention\n\nto retire. The Chief Pilot checks the pilot's eligibility under the Plan, and then informs the Eastern\n\nPension and Insurance Department about the pilot's decision to retire.59 The application is then\n\npresented to the Eastern Pension Administration Department, which must provide an authorizing\n\nsignature beneath a line that states: \"The above information is approved and the appropriate\n\nallocation from the Plan to provide the benefit payable is hereby authorized.\" If the application is\n\napproved, the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department contacts the Plan's actuary, which\n\ndetermines the precise amount of benefits to which the retiring participant is entitled. The actuary\n\nthen gives that information to the State Street Bank & Trust, which makes the distribution to the\n\nparticipant. Eastern is responsible for establishing and maintaining a procedure for giving the\n\nparticipant written notification if the application is denied. See § 2.3 (\"Notification of Denial of\n\nBenefits\"). If there is a legal dispute as to the proper recipient of a benefit, Eastern may withhold\n\npayment pending final determination of the proper beneficiary. See § 12.10 (\"Beneficiary Dispute\").\n\n          The facts of this case support our reading that Eastern, not the TAC, has the authority to\n\norder payment of retirement benefits. First, the record makes clear that Eastern retained its authority\n\nas administrator at all times during the events giving rise to this litigation. When Hunt's application\n\nwas \"approved\" by Eastern's Pension Administration Department on April 22, 1991, Eastern was\n\nlisted in the written instrument as the Plan administrator.60 When the Plan was amended effective\n\nJune 25, 1991, Eastern continued to serve as administrator for all aspects of the Plan, with the\n\n   58\n     Section 12.9 also states that each participant \"shall ... furnish the Administrator with such\ndocuments, evidence, data, or information in support of such application as the Administrator\nshall consider necessary or desirable.\"\n   59\n     As stated in part I.D, supra, after the moratorium began, the retiring participant would\ncontact Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department directly rather than go through the Chief\nPilot.\n   60\n        At this time, the Plan consisted of Document 91 and Document 91A.\n\fexception of the newly introduced periodic-payment option and the provision for Plan loans. See\n\n§ 6.11(f) (\"Periodic Payments\"), Article XV (\"Plan Loans\").61 Even after the Plan was amended\n\neffective June 30, 1992, with the bankruptcy court's approval of Document 91C, Eastern retained\n\nits authority as Plan administrator.\n\n          Second, the record demonstrates that Eastern, despite its representations to the contrary,\n\nmade the decision to honor the moratorium and ultimately prevented the State Street Bank and Trust\n\nfrom issuing a lump-sum payment to Hunt. As noted in part I.D, supra, the director of Eastern's\n\nPension and Insurance Department stated that the process for reviewing benefit claims after the\n\nshutdown \"basically remained the same, except that ... Eastern would inform Mercer [the Plan\n\nactuary] whether a participant had applied for benefits following shutdown, thus implicating the\n\nlump-sum moratorium.\" By this statement, Eastern effectively admits that it ratified the imposition\n\nof the moratorium and thus denied Hunt's application. In essence, Eastern's order to the actuary to\n\nhalt the processing of Hunt's application foreclosed the State Street Bank and Trust from issuing him\n\na benefit check.\n\n          Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Eastern challenged the legality\n\nof the moratorium after its imposition. Eastern's inaction is especially glaring when one considers\n\nthat Article XIII of the Plan, titled \"Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance,\" vests Eastern with\n\nthe exclusive authority to modify, suspend or discontinue a feature of the Plan:\n\n          Eastern expects to continue the Plan indefinitely, but necessarily reserves the right to\n          modify, suspend or terminate it at any time including, but without limiting the generality of\n          the foregoing, discontinuance of the contributions of Eastern under the Plan or modification,\n          suspension, or discontinuance in its entirety or with respect to any feature thereof.\n          However, any modification, suspension, or discontinuance shall not adversely affect the\n          retirement, death or termination benefits already provided at that time under the Plan for any\n          Participant, contingent annuitant, or beneficiary as of the date of such modification,\n          suspension, or discontinuance. In the event the Plan shall be discontinued, such action shall\n          be taken as shall insure to the extent possible the satisfaction of all liabilities to Participants,\n          contingent annuitants, and beneficiaries that have accrued under the Plan.\n\n§ 13.1 (\"General\") (emphasis added). Although this provision enumerates only one specific\n\napplication of this subsection (i.e., the discontinuation of Eastern's contributions), the phrases\n\n\n   61\n        This version of the Plan included the amendment referred to as Document 91B.\n\f\"including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing\" and \"with respect to any feature\n\nthereof\" would encompass other scenarios, such as the suspension of the lump-sum payment option.\n\nThus, if Eastern wanted to challenge the TAC's purportedly \"unilateral\" imposition of the\n\nmoratorium, the Plan certainly gave Eastern the authority to do so.62\n\n        It is clear that Eastern, not the TAC, bears ultimate responsibility for the denial of Hunt's\n\nlump-sum benefit. Hunt, however, in an obvious attempt to avoid the effect of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's approval of the Document 91C amendment, voluntarily dismissed Eastern with prejudice as\n\na party to this action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(ii) shortly after filing his amended\n\ncomplaint.63\n\n        Nevertheless, the district court ruled in paragraph 4 of its order that the TAC possessed the\n\nauthority to issue payment from the Fund. In so ruling, the district court implicitly rewrote the Plan\n\nto give the TAC that power. Although we recognize that the \"principal object of [ERISA] is to\n\nprotect plan participants and beneficiaries,\" Boggs v. Boggs,, --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1754, ----,\n\n138 L.Ed.2d 45, we agree with the First Circuit's admonition that \"courts have no right to torture\n\n   62\n     Hunt suggests that the moratorium on lump-sum payments was impermissible because it\nwas inconsistent with § 13.1's provision that \"any modification, suspension, or discontinuance\nshall not adversely affect the retirement, death or termination benefits already provided at that\ntime under the Plan for any Participant.\" We note, however, that the moratorium on lump-sum\npayments had no effect on Hunt's actual interest in the Plan—i.e., the total number of annuity\nunits in his accrued benefit; rather, the moratorium only changed the manner in which Hunt and\nother similarly situated participants could receive their benefits.\n                Given the Plan's status as a defined contribution plan, the value of a participant's\n        interest in the Plan fluctuates with the performance of the Fund's assets. See supra part\n        I.B. After all, the full name of the Plan is the \"Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for\n        Pilots\": a participant's interest in the Plan depends not only on the contributions made\n        but also on how the Fund's assets perform.\n   63\n     Eastern's dismissal from the case with prejudice operated as an adjudication on the merits in\nfavor of Eastern on all claims Hunt had brought against the company. Citibank, N.A. v. Data\nLease Fin. Corp., 904 F.2d 1498, 1501-02 (11th Cir.1990) (\"[A] stipulation of dismissal with\nprejudice ... at any stage of a judicial proceeding, normally constitutes a final judgment on the\nmerits which bars a later suit on the same cause of action.\") (citation omitted). This adjudication\nby dismissal would include, of course, Hunt's claims (1) that Eastern, as the administrator and as\na fiduciary under the Plan, breached its obligation to Hunt and other Plan participants by\ndeclaring, or ratifying the TAC's declaration of, the moratorium, and (2) that Eastern wrongfully\nrefused to pay Hunt the lump-sum benefit he seeks. In this appeal, the TAC and the Plan have\nnot argued that this disposition of Hunt's claims against Eastern had a preclusive effect on Hunt's\nclaims against them. Accordingly, we do not consider the issue.\n\flanguage in an attempt to force particular results.... To the exact contrary, straightforward language\n\nin an ERISA-regulated insurance policy should be given its natural meaning.\" Burnham v. Guardian\n\nLife Ins. Co., 873 F.2d 486, 489 (1st Cir.1989) (citation omitted). See also Hamilton v. Air Jamaica,\n\nLtd., 945 F.2d 74, 78 (3d Cir.1991) (\"While ERISA was enacted to provide security in employee\n\nbenefits, it protects only those benefits provided in the plan.... ERISA mandates no minimum\n\nsubstantive content for employee welfare benefit plans, and therefore a court has no authority to\n\ndraft the substantive content of such plans.\") (citation and quotation marks omitted), cert. denied,\n\n503 U.S. 938, 112 S.Ct. 1479, 117 L.Ed.2d 622 (1992); cf. Nachwalter v. Christie, 805 F.2d 956,\n\n960 (11th Cir.1986) (written employee benefit plans governed by ERISA may not be modified by\n\noral agreements). We therefore reject the district court's sub silentio revision of the Plan which\n\nenabled the court to direct the TAC to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n                                                  C.\n\n        Given the district court's view that the TAC denied Hunt's lump-sum benefit by issuing the\n\nmoratorium, however, we will assume arguendo that the TAC could order the State Street Bank and\n\nTrust to issue Hunt payment from the Fund. For the district court's theory of liability to make sense,\n\nthe TAC would necessarily have acted as de facto Plan administrator in Eastern's stead; as discussed\n\nabove, this theory is inconsistent with the Plan and clearly unsupported by the record. Yet, even if\n\nwe indulge the assumption that the TAC functioned as de facto administrator, we remain convinced\nthat the facts of this case justified the imposition of the moratorium and the concomitant denial of\n\nHunt's lump-sum benefit.64\n\n        When evaluating a plan administrator's decision to deny benefits, a district court must first\n\ndetermine the appropriate standard of review. Firestone v. Bruch holds that \"a denial of benefits\n\nchallenged under § 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan\n\ngives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility or to construe the\n\n\n   64\n     In its analysis, the district court assumed that the common law of trusts gave the TAC the\npower to impose the moratorium. We need not make this assumption for this hypothetical\nscenario, however, because Article XIII of the Plan clearly gives the administrator the authority\nto impose a moratorium.\n\fterms of the plan.\" 489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 956, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). We have\n\ninterpreted Firestone to mandate an arbitrary and capricious standard of review, which is often used\n\ninterchangeably with an abuse of discretion standard, if the administrator has discretionary authority\n\nto make eligibility determinations or to construe disputed terms of the plan. See Jett v. Blue Cross\n\nand Blue Shield of Ala., 890 F.2d 1137, 1139 (11th Cir.1989). To trigger this standard of review,\n\nthe language conferring discretion on the administrator must be \"express language unambiguous in\n\nits design.\" Kirwan v. Marriott Corp., 10 F.3d 784, 789 (11th Cir.1994) (internal citations omitted).\n\nIf the administrator suffers from a conflict of interest in rendering its determination, the district court\n\nshould apply a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard. See Firestone, 489 U.S. at 115, 109\n\nS.Ct. at 957; see also Marecek v. BellSouth Telecomm., 49 F.3d 702, 705 (11th Cir.1995).\n\n        The arbitrary and capricious standard is the appropriate standard of review in this case\n\nbecause the Plan contains express language conferring discretionary authority upon the administrator\n\nto construe its terms. Under section 2.2(a) (\"Administration\"), the administrator enjoys the authority\n\nto \"initially determine all questions arising from the administration, interpretation, and application\n\nof the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements and contracts, and such determination shall\n\nbe binding upon all persons, except as otherwise provided by law.\" We have held that comparable\n\nlanguage is sufficient to trigger review under the arbitrary and capricious standard. See Jett, 890\n\nF.2d at 1139 (\"[Plan administrator] has the exclusive right to interpret the provisions of th[is] Plan,\n\nso its decision is conclusive and binding.\"); Guy v. Southeastern Iron Workers' Welfare Fund, 877\n\nF.2d 37, 38-39 (11th Cir.1989) (\"[Administrator has] full power to construe the provisions of [the]\n\nTrust\"). Thus, we apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the TAC's \"decision\" as\n\nde facto administrator to deny Hunt's lump-sum benefit. We stress that our principal inquiry in this\n\nhypothetical situation is not whether the TAC was justified in imposing the moratorium, but whether\n\nthe TAC was justified in denying Hunt's application for a lump-sum benefit. Of course, our analysis\n\nof the latter issue necessarily implicates the former.\n\n        Under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the court seeks \"to determine whether\n\nthere was a reasonable basis for the [administrator's] decision, based upon the facts as known to the\n\fadministrator at the time the decision was made.\" Jett, 890 F.2d at 1139. The facts presented at trial\n\nbear out that the TAC acted reasonably in its decision as de facto administrator to impose the\n\nmoratorium on lump-sum payments. First, the record paints an extremely bleak picture for the Plan\n\nin January 1991. It is undisputed that the Plan was low on liquid assets as of the eighteenth of that\n\nmonth. Following the commencement of the Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding on March 9,\n\n1989, Eastern reduced and eventually stopped making contributions on behalf of its pilots.\n\nMoreover, between 1986 and 1990, the amount of lump-sum payments paid to retiring pilots\n\ndramatically increased; fewer than twenty-five pilots selected another benefit option after the\n\nlump-sum option became available in 1983. In 1986, roughly $52,000,000 was disbursed in\n\nlump-sum payments; that number grew to more than $200,000,000 in 1990.65 Between January 1\n\nand January 18, 1991, already $38,000,000 had been disbursed as lump-sum payments.66\n\n        This paucity of liquid assets was further exacerbated by the depressed performance of the\n\nPlan's substantial real estate holdings. Former Citicorp president William Spencer, a member of the\n\nTAC during the period in question, stated at trial that \"[t]he real estate which comprised a sizable\n\npart of the fund was in a funk, and ... unless some time was developed [so the real estate] could\n\nevolve, the hardships on all of the [Plan's] members would be very extreme.\" Another former TAC\n\nmember, former President Ford, stated in his deposition that the Plan could not have made lump-sum\n\npayments to all retiring pilots without subjecting its real estate holdings to a \"fire sale\" at prices far\nbelow market value. Both former TAC members agreed that holding a fire sale of such potentially\n\nvaluable assets would have been grossly imprudent. Hunt did not dispute the validity of this\n\ntestimony.\n\n        Second, the terms of the Plan make clear that the administrator owes an equal fiduciary duty\n\nto all Plan participants, including annuitants and those who have not elected any benefit option. The\n\n\n   65\n    The following amounts were distributed in lump-sum payments between 1986 and 1990:\n$52,091,000 (1986); $79,389,000 (1987); $107,954,000 (1988); $181,856,000 (1989); and\n$200,540,000 (1990).\n   66\n    At this rate, more than $60,000,000 would have been disbursed in lump-sum payments in\nJanuary 1991 alone.\n\fadministrator is required to treat all participants equally at all times in running the Plan. See § 2.2(a)\n\n(\"[T]he Administrator ... shall have those powers necessary to carry out the day to day operation of\n\nthe Plan ... and initially determine all questions arising from the administration, interpretation, and\n\napplication of the Plan ... provided that each Participant shall be granted the same treatment under\n\nsimilar conditions.\") (emphasis added). Moreover, as named fiduciary, the TAC bears a heavy\n\nobligation to ALPA. See supra part III.B (discussion of TAC's obligations to ALPA under §§ 2.7(b),\n\n2.8., and 2.11).\n\n        Hunt was one of approximately 2,500 pilots who were affected by Eastern's shutdown and\n\nthe moratorium. Like the hundreds of other Eastern pilots who failed to submit their benefit\n\napplications by the close of business on January 18, 1991, Hunt was unable to take advantage of the\n\noriginal lump-sum option that was in effect prior to Eastern's shutdown.\n\n        If the Plan administrator were to grant Hunt's lump-sum benefit application, however, it\n\nwould be arbitrarily favoring Hunt over all of the other pilots who, like Hunt, did not submit their\n\napplication before the imposition of the moratorium. As a fiduciary under ERISA, the administrator\n\nowes a responsibility to administer the plan \"in accordance with the documents and instruments\n\ngoverning the plan.\" ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D). The Plan plainly states that\n\nthe administrator is required to discharge its duties in a manner ensuring that \"each Participant shall\n\nbe granted the same treatment under similar conditions.\" See § 2.2 (\"Administration\") (emphasis\nadded). Given this fiduciary responsibility, the administrator, when faced with Hunt's benefit\n\napplication, made the reasonable decision to treat Hunt exactly like all of the other pilots in his\n\nposition—that is, to deny his lump-sum benefit despite its \"approval\" by Eastern's Pension\n\nAdministration Department. Therefore, even assuming arguendo that the TAC functioned as de\n\nfacto administrator, we would find that its \"denial\" of Hunt's lump-sum benefit was reasonable based\n\nupon the facts known by it at that time.67 Accordingly, in this hypothetical case, the TAC's \"denial\"\n\n   67\n    As indicated above, we have managed to locate ample information in the record to justify\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard of review the imposition of the moratorium. We\nwould agree, however, with the district court's assessment that the TAC presented its supporting\nevidence at trial in a wholly incoherent manner: \"[B]ecause the [TAC's data was] either\nincomplete or not adequately explained, this court was left to wonder what the numbers and\n\fof Hunt's lump-sum benefits would pass muster under the arbitrary and capricious standard of\n\nreview.68\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n        Hunt cross-appeals the district court's refusal to impose a statutory penalty on the TAC for\n\nits alleged failure to comply with Hunt's requests for information.69 Under section 502(c) of ERISA,\n\nan administrator who \"fails or refuses to comply with a request for any information which such\n\nadministrator is required by [ERISA] to furnish to a participant or beneficiary ... within 30 days after\n\nsuch request may ... be personally liable to such participant or beneficiary in the amount of up to\n\n$100 a day from the date of such failure or refusal.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).70 ERISA requires the\n\nadministrator to provide participants with, inter alia, the latest updated summary plan description,\n\nthe latest annual report, a statement to each participant indicating the total benefits accrued, and\n\n\"other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.\"71 See ERISA §§ 104(b)(4),\n\n105(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1024(b)(4), 1025(a)(1). The imposition of this penalty is committed to the\n\ndistrict court's discretion. ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).\n\n\nfigures really meant.\"\n   68\n     Although Hunt is not entitled to receive the total value of his accrued benefit in one full\nlump-sum payment, we assume that he remains eligible to elect the modified lump-sum option\navailable under Document 91C like all other similarly situated Eastern pilots affected by the\nshutdown and moratorium.\n   69\n     As stated in part II.A, supra, Hunt dispatched four letters allegedly in response to Eastern's\nFebruary 4, 1991, letter to all Eastern pilots. His March 15, 1991, letter to Dyer of Hawthorne\ninquired about the status of his pension. His March 20, 1991, letter to O'Connor requested the\nmost current statement of his account and the most recent financial statement for the Plan\n\"showing [its] assets and liabilities.\" His July 15, 1991, letter to Dyer requested a statement of\n\"the TAC's position on his application,\" copies of all amendments to the Plan affecting his\nbenefits, an explanation if the TAC were to deny his application, and the name, address, and the\nforms necessary to file a claim with the Pension Dispute Board if the TAC decided not to pay his\nlump-sum benefit. This letter also was sent to the then-chairman of the TAC. His August 19,\n1991, letter to O'Connor requested copies of the \"amendments to the [Plan],\" an explanation of\nwhether the TAC \"had the right to amend the [Plan],\" and a statement disclosing the number of\napplications for lump-sum benefits filed since January 18, 1991.\n   70\n     Section 502(a)(1)(A) of ERISA empowers participants and beneficiaries to sue \"for the\nrelief provided for in subsection(c) of [section 502].\" 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(A).\n   71\n    In the alternative, the TAC argued that Hunt did not request information that ERISA\nrequires an administrator to provide. Like the district court, we make no ruling on this issue.\n\f        The issue in this cross-appeal is whether the TAC should be considered an \"administrator\"\n\nfor purposes of section 502(c) of ERISA. The previous discussion shows that the Plan designated\n\nEastern as Plan administrator, whereas the TAC served as named fiduciary and as administrator of\n\nonly the periodic-payment and loan options.72 Hunt contends, however, that the TAC functioned\n\nas de facto administrator and thus should be held liable for failing to respond to his requests for\n\ninformation.\n\n        Hunt bases his claim on Law v. Ernst & Young, 956 F.2d 364 (1st Cir.1992), and Rosen v.\n\nTRW, Inc., 979 F.2d 191 (11th Cir.1992), in which we endorsed the analysis set forth in Law.73 In\n\nLaw, an ERISA-plan participant sued his former employer for failing to provide requested\n\ninformation about his benefits in a timely fashion; the plan documents in that case did not designate\n\nthe former employer as administrator. After reviewing the plan documents in question, the First\n\nCircuit held that if the company \"acted as the plan administrator in respect to dissemination of\n\ninformation concerning plan benefits, it may be properly treated as such for purposes of the liability\n\nprovided under [section 502(c) ].\" Law, 956 F.2d at 373; see also Rosen, 979 F.2d at 193-94 (\"We\n\nagree with the reasoning of the First Circuit and we hold that if a company is administrating the plan,\n\nthen it can be held liable for ERISA violations, regardless of the provisions of the plan document.\")\n\nThe Law court further reasoned that to refrain from imposing liability on such an entity simply\n\nbecause it is not named as plan administrator \"would cut off the remedy Congress intended to\n\ncreate.\" Law, 956 F.2d at 373. Finding \"a plethora of evidence\" showing that the company had\n\n\"controlled the provision of information,\" id. at 372, 373, the First Circuit affirmed the lower court's\n\njudgment for the statutory penalty. Id. at 374. In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized\n\ntwo facts in particular: (1) that the company, according to the plan documents, still exercised\n\nconsiderable control over plan administration; and (2) that the plaintiff's requests for information\n\n   72\n     See supra parts I.D and III.C. We note again that our discussion in part III.C merely\nassumes for the sake of argument that the TAC served as Plan administrator. Of course, neither\nthe Plan nor the record provides a legitimate basis for making that assumption.\n   73\n     Other circuits have concluded that, for the statutory penalty to apply, the administrator must\nbe the entity so designated in the plan documents. See Jones v. UOP, 16 F.3d 141, 144-45 (7th\nCir.1994); McKinsey v. Sentry Ins., 986 F.2d 401, 404-05 (10th Cir.1993).\n\fwere eventually answered by company employees on company stationery. Id. at 373-74.\n\n        Although Hunt states in his brief that \"Eastern had delegated, and TAC had assumed, the role\n\nof Plan Administrator,\" the record demonstrates that this statement is patently inaccurate. First, as\n\ndiscussed in parts I.D and III.C, supra, the record makes clear that with the exception of the\n\nperiodic-payment and loan options, which were added effective June 25, 1991,74 Eastern retained\n\nits authority as administrator of the Plan at all relevant times. In fact, a July 1991 letter sent from\n\nthe TAC to all plan participants regarding the periodic-payment and loan options makes this fact\n\nunambiguously clear: \"The [Plan's] Trust Administrative Committee is designated as Administrator\n\nof both of these new [Plan] provisions only. As in the past, Eastern retains administrative authority\n\nover all other provisions of the [Plan].\"75 Consequently, Eastern retained its responsibility under the\n\nPlan to provide information such as plan summaries and annual statements to all participants. See\n\n§§ 2.5, 2.6.\n\n        Second, Hunt's claim fails because he misinterprets Eastern's simple instructions to all\n\nparticipants in its February 4, 1991, letter. Hunt argues in his brief that this letter, which was sent\n\nby Eastern and printed on Eastern stationery, indicated that the \"TAC was the authority designated\n\nby the Plan Administrator for dissemination of information regarding the [Plan].\" This short letter,\n\nhowever, stated that \"[q]uestions regarding the temporary moratorium should be addressed to the\n\n[TAC]\" (emphasis added); it made no representation that the TAC was now responsible for\nproviding plan summaries, annual statements, amendments, and other such information to\n\nparticipants.76 Furthermore, with the exception of the TAC's responsibilities as administrator of the\n\n   74\n    Hunt did not participate in either the periodic-payment or loan option, so this issue is not\ngermane to his claim.\n   75\n     This letter was sent pursuant to the TAC's authority under § 10.2(c) \"[t]o furnish to ...\nParticipants such reports with respect to the functions, actions, and decisions of the [TAC] as are\nreasonable and appropriate.\"\n   76\n     Hunt's arguments on this claim reveal a profound misunderstanding about basic aspects of\nthe Plan. For example, he contends that the \"TAC further held themselves out to be the Plan\nAdministrator by claiming to be negotiating for, and selecting, an administrative services\nprovider.\" The Plan, however, charges the TAC, as named fiduciary, with the responsibility for\nselecting investment advisors and other administrative service personnel, provided that the TAC\nobtains ALPA's consent. See §§ 2.9, 2.13(c),(d).\n\fperiodic-payment and loan options, the record is devoid of evidence showing that the TAC had\n\nassumed any of Eastern's duties regarding the provision of information to participants. We therefore\n\nhold that Hunt has failed to support his contention that the TAC functioned as de facto Plan\n\nadministrator and that the district court properly declined to impose a penalty on the TAC pursuant\n\nto ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).\n\n                                                   V.\n\n        In light of the above, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court awarding $352,748.74\n\nplus costs to Hunt from the coffers of the Plan's Fund (Counts II and IV).77 We AFFIRM the\n\ndecision of the district court to deny Hunt the assessment of a statutory penalty under section 502(c)\n\nof ERISA (Count I).\n\n        COX, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n        I dissent from that part of the court's opinion that holds that an action for recovery of benefits\n\nunder ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B) cannot be maintained solely against an ERISA plan as an entity. I join\n\nthe remainder of the court's opinion, and, because the holding from which I dissent is an alternative\n\nholding, I concur in the result reached by the court.\n\n        In my view, ERISA allows an action to recover benefits to be brought solely against an\n\nERISA plan as a entity, with appropriate relief including a money judgment against the plan. The\n\nstatute clearly states that \"[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this subchapter as\n\nan entity.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(1). The statute then describes the mechanics of suing the plan. See\n\nid. (\"Service of summons, subpoena, or other legal process of a court upon a trustee or an\n\nadministrator of an employee benefit plan in his capacity as such shall constitute service upon the\n\nemployee benefit plan.\"). And finally, the statute provides that \"[a]ny money judgment under this\n\nsubchapter against an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an\n\nentity....\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(2). Although in the form of a money judgment, this relief is\n\n\n   77\n     Although the district court gave Hunt judgment on Count VII, it refused to give him the\nrelief he sought in that count. See supra note 48 and accompanying text. Nonetheless, for\ncompleteness, we reverse the court's judgment on Count VII as well as the court's judgment on\nCounts II and IV.\n\fequitable relief. See Calamia v. Spivey, 632 F.2d 1235, 1236-37 (5th Cir. Unit A 1980). In\n\nCalamia, the court explained that \"[s]ince Congress has the power to entrust enforcement of new\n\nrights to courts sitting as in equity, the first step in determining the legal or equitable nature of an\n\naction such as [a claim for benefits] is to examine the intent of Congress.\" Id. at 1237 (citation\n\nomitted). Finding congressional intent to be unclear, the court looked at how similar actions were\n\ntreated before the merger of law and equity. See id. In so doing, the court concluded that—because\n\nthe application of the arbitrary and capricious standard has traditionally been performed by\n\njudges—an action to recover benefits is equitable in nature. See id. See also Wardle v. Central\n\nStates, et al., 627 F.2d 820, 828-30 (7th Cir.1980).\n\n       Although our cases have not squarely addressed the issue, we have allowed actions asserting\n\nclaims for benefits under ERISA to proceed solely against ERISA plans. See Springer v. Wal-Mart\n\nAssociates' Group Health Plan, 908 F.2d 897 (11th Cir.1990); Guy v. Southeastern Iron Workers'\n\nWelfare Fund, 877 F.2d 37 (11th Cir.1989). Decisions from other circuits have explicitly held that\n\nclaimants may sue only their ERISA plan. See Gelardi v. Pertec Computer Corp., 761 F.2d 1323,\n\n1324 (9th Cir.1985) (\"ERISA permits suits to recover benefits only against the Plan as an entity\n\n....\"); and Lee v. Burkhart, 991 F.2d 1004, 1009 (2d Cir.1993) (quoting Gelardi ).\n\n       In short, the majority's holding that one seeking to recover benefits under an ERISA plan\n\ncannot proceed solely against his plan runs counter to the language of ERISA and is not supported\n\nby our prior decisions. We have allowed such actions to proceed against both the plan and the plan\n\nadministrator, without explicitly addressing the issue of who is the proper defendant. See Marecek\n\nv. BellSouth Telecomm., 49 F.3d 702 (11th Cir.1995). We also have allowed such actions to proceed\n\nagainst the administrator alone—again without explicitly addressing the issue. See Godfrey v.\n\nBellSouth Telecomm., 89 F.3d 755 (11th Cir.1996); Kirwan v. Marriott, 10 F.3d 784 (11th\n\nCir.1994); Jett v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, 890 F.2d 1137 (11th Cir.1989). But\n\nwhether an action for benefits may be maintained solely against the administrator, or against both\n\nthe plan and the administrator, are not issues presented by this case.\n\f",

Hunt is a retired Eastern Air Lines (\"Eastern\") pilot seeking to recover a lump-sum\n\nretirement benefit under the Eastern Air Lines Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for Pilots (the\n\n\"Plan\").1 Eastern, the Plan's administrator, which is a debtor before the Bankruptcy Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York, has refused to pay the benefit because the Plan has been amended,\n\nwith the approval of the bankruptcy court, to foreclose the lump-sum benefit Hunt seeks. As the\n\nPlan now stands, Hunt is entitled to receive only a modified lump-sum benefit: he may receive a\npartial distribution immediately and subsequent payments over time as the Plan's assets are\n\nliquidated.\n\n       Hunt rejected this modified lump-sum benefit, as well as other payment options provided\n\nunder the Plan, and sued Eastern; the Air Line Pilots Association (\"ALPA\"), the pilots' union;\n\nCharles H. Copeland, the Chairman of the Trust Administrative Committee (the \"TAC\"), the Plan's\n\nnamed fiduciary; Paul M.

Hunt brought his suit under the\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), Pub.L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829,\n\n29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461 (1994). His complaint, framed in six counts, asked for compensatory and\n\npunitive damages, injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring the defendants to pay his\n\nlump-sum benefit, statutory penalties, and attorneys' fees.\n\n       Eastern's Bankruptcy Trustee, in a motion for summary judgment, contended that Eastern\n\ncould not be held liable to Hunt because it had properly discharged its responsibilities as\n\nadministrator under the Plan. Later, when opposing Hunt's motion for leave to file an amended\n\ncomplaint, Eastern argued that Hunt's claim for a lump-sum benefit had been foreclosed by a\n\nbankruptcy court ruling against Hunt in Eastern's bankruptcy case. In an apparent attempt to avoid\n\nthe effect of this ruling, Hunt voluntarily dismissed Eastern from the case with prejudice and, with\n\nleave of court, filed an amended complaint against three defendants—Hawthorne, the TAC, and the\n\nPlan—that asserted essentially the same claims presented in his initial complaint.\n\n       The case was tried to the district court; by that time, the only defendants before the court\n\nwere the TAC and the Plan. Without referring to the bankruptcy court's ruling against Hunt, the\n\ncourt held that he was entitled to his lump-sum benefit and entered judgment for Hunt in the amount\n\nof that benefit. The judgment stated that the benefit was to be satisfied out of the Plan's fund of\n\nassets. The court rejected Hunt's remaining claims and entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n       The TAC and the Plan now appeal. Hunt cross-appeals the court's rejection of his claim\n\nrequesting the court to impose a statutory penalty on the defendants. We reverse the court's\n\njudgment against the TAC and the Plan, and affirm its judgment on the statutory-penalty claim.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       Hunt claims that, under ERISA and the provisions of the Plan, he is entitled to recover his\n\nretirement benefits in a lump sum. Unlike the typical scenario in which a participant in an employee\n\nbenefit plan sues to recover ERISA benefits, Hunt sought his lump-sum payment while the\n\nadministrator of the Plan, Eastern, was undergoing a highly publicized bankruptcy proceeding that\n\nultimately resulted in the company's demise. In addition to scrutinizing ERISA and the provisions\n\fand operation of the Plan, we must therefore consider the interrelationship between the Plan and\n\nEastern's bankruptcy in order to evaluate Hunt's claims for relief.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       ERISA is a \"comprehensive and reticulated statute\" that created a framework for the\n\nadministration and maintenance of private employee benefit plans.

Under ERISA § 3(21)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A), a fiduciary\nincludes not only those who \"exercise[ ] any discretionary authority or discretionary control\n\fdischarge their duties \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar\n\nas such documents and instruments are consistent with [ERISA],\" ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1104(a)(1)(D), \"for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their\n\nbeneficiaries,\" ERISA § 404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A).            Because both the plan\n\nadministrator and named fiduciary must discharge their duties in accordance with the written\n\ninstrument, we examine the provisions of the Plan in detail.3\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       The Plan is a variable benefit pension plan for Eastern pilots that was created in 1958\n\npursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between Eastern and ALPA. The parties rewrote the\n\nPlan in the 1970s to comply with ERISA and subsequently amended it in 1986.4\n\n       The Plan is a \"defined contribution plan.\"5 According to 26 U.S.C. § 414(i), a defined\n\ncontribution plan is a \"plan [that] provides for an individual account for each participant and for\n\nbenefits based solely on the amount contributed to the participant's account, and any income,\n\nexpenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be\n\nallocated to such participant's account.\" More simply, in the words of an ALPA newsletter sent to\n\nEastern pilots, a participant's interest in a defined contribution plan is \"determined solely by\n\n\nrespecting management of such plan or exercise[ ] any authority or control respecting\nmanagement or disposition of its assets,\" but also those who \"[have] discretionary authority or\ndiscretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\" The Supreme Court has referred\nto ERISA's definition of fiduciary as \"artificial.\" Mertens, 113 S.Ct. at 2068 n. 5, 508 U.S. at\n255 n. 5.\n   3\n    Given the seminal importance of the written instrument under ERISA, we are puzzled why\nthe parties made little more than a passing reference to the Plan documents in their briefs and at\noral argument.\n\n               For simplicity and clarity, we refer to the specific provisions of the Plan by citing\n       directly to the relevant section or subsection. In some instances, the title of the section or\n       subsection is noted parenthetically.\n   4\n   The original written instrument that established the Plan is known as \"Document 91.\" The\n1986 amendment is known as \"Document 91A.\"\n   5\n    Section 12.14 of the Plan, titled \"Plan Is Defined Contribution Plan,\" states: \"Since [the\nPlan's inception], the Plan has been and continues to be a defined contribution plan.\" This\nsection appears in Document 91C, an amendment to the Plan that will be discussed in part I.D,\ninfra.\n\fcontributions made in a beneficiary's name and the subsequent investment performance of those\n\ncontributions.\" The Plan requires that Eastern make contributions on behalf of each participant, see\n\n§ 4.1 (\"Eastern Contributions\"),6 for investment in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets. These\n\ninvestments constitute the Plan's \"Variable Fund\" (the \"Fund\"). See § 1.36 (\"Variable Fund\").7 As\n\na result, the value of a participant's interest in the Plan depends not only upon the funds contributed\n\nbut also on the investment return on the Fund's assets.

See § 5.1 (\"Fund\n\nValue\").\n\n       The Plan designates Eastern as the \"plan administrator.\" Eastern has \"those powers\n\nnecessary to carry out the day to day operation of the Plan.\" See § 2.2(a) (\"Administration\"). Those\n\npowers include the broad responsibility to \"initially determine all questions arising from the\n\nadministration, interpretation, and application of the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements\n\nand contracts and such determination shall be binding upon all persons, except as otherwise\n\nprovided by law, and further provided that each Participant shall be granted the same treatment\n\nunder similar conditions.\" Id. The Plan also charges Eastern with the responsibility for, inter alia,\n\nkeeping records, see § 2.4 (\"Records\"), preparing and distributing periodic Plan summaries, see §\n\n2.5 (\"Plan Summary\"), and sending to each participant an annual statement reflecting the value of\n\nhis investment in the Plan, see § 2.6 (\"Annual Statement\"). Section 13.1 of Article XIII, which is\n\ntitled \"Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance,\" grants Eastern the authority to unilaterally\n\n\n   6\n    According to the original agreement, Eastern was to contribute on behalf of each participant\nan amount equal to 11% of his compensation. On February 23, 1986, Eastern and ALPA signed\na collective bargaining agreement that adjusted Eastern's contribution level in two ways: (1) for\npilots employed before March 2, 1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 10% effective January 1,\n1988; (2) for pilots employed on or after March 2, 1986, Eastern's contribution was set at 3%. In\naddition, participants had the option of contributing up to 10% of their earnings as \"optional\nadditional contributions\" to augment their interest in the Plan. See § 4.2 (\"Optional Additional\nContributions\").\n   7\n    According to § 1.36, the Fund is \"the property of the Plan, ... all of which is held in trust\npursuant to Trust Agreement between the [TAC] and State Street Bank and Trust Company ...\nand any other trust created for such purpose by the [TAC].\"\n\fmodify, suspend, or discontinue any feature of the Plan, provided that any such action does not\n\n\"adversely affect\" any benefits \"already provided\" to a participant under the Plan. An exercise of\n\nthis authority, however, would not constitute an amendment to the Plan.8\n\n       The Plan designates the TAC, a small committee that monitors the management of the Plan's\n\nassets,9 as its \"named fiduciary.\" Under the Plan, the TAC has \"overall supervisory responsibility\n\nof the administrative functions of the Fund,\" see § 2.13(b)(i) (\"Fund Administration\"), and the duty\n\n\"to maintain surveillance over the status and administration of the Plan and the [Fund],\" see §\n\n10.2(b) (\"Rights and Duties of the [TAC]\"). It must \"regularly and periodically suppl[y]\"\n\ninformation to ALPA about \"transactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status,\n\ndocumentation and Fund performance,\" see § 2.11 (\"Information and Accountability\"), and furnish\n\nto ALPA and Plan participants reports about the TAC's \"functions, actions, and decisions ... as are\n\nreasonable and appropriate.\" See § 10.2(c). Furthermore, the TAC is charged with the responsibility\n\nof selecting and replacing investment advisors and trustees of the Fund's assets, see § 2.7(b) (\"Trust\n\nAgreement and Trustee\"), as well as giving directions and instructions to these trustees, see § 2.8\n\n(\"Directions to Trustee(s)\"). Before selecting or replacing investment advisors or trustees, however,\n\nthe TAC must notify ALPA of the TAC's planned course of action and give ALPA an opportunity\n\nto respond, see § 2.7(b), thus effectively giving ALPA a quasi-veto power over these decisions.\n\n   8\n    The Plan documents do not explicitly describe how the Plan may be formally amended. The\nclosest provision is § 14.1, which states that Eastern and ALPA must agree upon any\nmodification that is necessary for the Plan to qualify as a pension plan under ERISA. See § 14.1\n(\"Qualification of Plan\"). The record makes clear, however, that both Eastern and ALPA must\napprove any substantive amendment to the Plan, with the exception of an amendment made\npursuant to § 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 1113(e). See infra note 20.\n   9\n    The TAC initially consisted of two members selected by ALPA, two members selected by\nEastern, and three \"outside\" members chosen by ALPA and Eastern. By the time of the events\ninvolved in the present controversy, the Plan had been amended to provide that two members\nwere to be selected by ALPA, and five outside members would be appointed by the existing\nTAC members with ALPA's approval. TAC's outside members at this time included former\nPresident Gerald R. Ford; a former president of Citicorp, William I. Spencer; a former chairman\nof the board of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, George P. Jenkins; and a former dean of\nthe Harvard Business School, Lawrence E. Fouraker.\n\n               The compensation for the outside TAC members is paid by the Fund, see §\n       2.2(b)(iii), whereas the compensation for TAC members from ALPA is paid by ALPA,\n       see § 10.1(b)(ii).\n\fSimilarly, before giving any notice or instruction to a Fund trustee, the TAC must notify ALPA and\n\ngive it fifteen days to object. See § 2.8.\n\n        Pursuant to its authority under sections 2.7 and 2.13(d),10 the TAC hired Hawthorne as the\n\nPlan's principal investment advisor/manager for the time period relevant in this case. Hawthorne's\n\nduties are enumerated in a written \"investment advisor agreement\" between the TAC and\n\nHawthorne. According to the testimony of Hawthorne's chairman, Charles G. Dyer, Hawthorne\n\nassumed many of the TAC's administrative duties involving the Fund and its assets, including the\n\nscheduling of TAC meetings and the release of quarterly statements to participants about the value\n\nof the Fund's assets. In essence, Hawthorne served \"at the pleasure of the [TAC].\"\n\n                                                 C.\n\n        Since the Plan's inception, an Eastern pilot choosing normal or early retirement could elect\n\nto receive his benefits in the form of monthly annuity payments.11 Beginning in 1983, a retiring pilot\n\nalso could elect to receive his benefits in the form of a lump-sum payment.\n\n        Processing an application for a lump-sum benefit involved five steps.12 First, a pilot seeking\n\na lump-sum payment would complete the necessary paperwork and inform the Chief Pilot, an\n\nEastern management employee, of his intention to retire. Second, the Chief Pilot would check to\n\n   10\n     According to § 2.13(d), the TAC \"may delegate to any person, including, but not limited to,\nInvestment Advisors, all or any portion of the [TAC's] powers, duties and responsibilities to\nestablish and maintain a Fund Office, to maintain records and to prepare reports and\ndocumentation. The [TAC] shall make such delegations in writing and is authorized to pay\nreasonable fees, charges and costs of the person or persons providing such service.\" This\ndelegation of authority is consistent with ERISA. See ERISA § 402(c)(3), 29 U.S.C. §\n1102(c)(3).\n   11\n     The Plan provided participants with a panoply of annuity options. Retiring pilots selecting\nan annuity could choose from the post-retirement joint and survivor annuity, the contingent\nannuity, the level income option, the life annuity option, and the deferred payment option. See §\n6.2 (\"Available Forms of Payment\"). There also was a disability benefit option. See § 6.3\n(\"Disability Benefit\").\n   12\n     The Plan does not explicitly set forth the procedure for processing claims for retirement\nbenefits. The above account of the claims-processing procedure is taken from the deposition and\naffidavit of Charles Dyer of Hawthorne and from the affidavit of Brian P. White, who served as\nDirector of the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department. Both accounts of Eastern's\nclaims-processing procedure are virtually identical. After the trial, the district court, in\nfashioning its order directing the entry of judgment, relied exclusively on the account given in\nthe White affidavit.\n\fmake sure that the pilot met age criteria to qualify for normal or early retirement benefits under the\n\nPlan.13 Third, if the pilot met the age qualifications, the Chief Pilot would inform the Eastern\n\nPension and Insurance Department about the pilot's decision to retire. Fourth, the Eastern Pension\n\nand Insurance Department would contact the Plan's actuary, William M. Mercer, Inc., which would\n\ndetermine the precise amount of benefits to which the retiring pilot was entitled. Fifth, the actuary\n\nwould then give that information to the State Street Bank & Trust Company, a Plan trustee, which\n\nwould make the distribution to the pilot. The lump-sum payment would be equal to the entire\n\nactuarial present value14 of the pilot's accrued benefit15 as of his effective retirement date.16 See §\n\n6.2(e)(i) (\"Lump Sum Option\"). A pilot dissatisfied with the disposition of his application for\n\nbenefits could pursue administrative relief with the Pension Dispute Board pursuant to Article XI\n\n(\"Determination of Disputes\") of the Plan.17\n\n                                                  D.\n\n        In the late 1980s, Eastern was experiencing severe financial difficulties against the backdrop\n\nof a highly publicized labor dispute. On March 9, 1989, Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection\n\nunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 1101-1174, in the Bankruptcy Court for the\n\n\n   13\n    Normal retirement age under the Plan is 60. See § 1.22 (\"Normal Retirement Age\"). The\nminimum early retirement age is 50. See § 1.15 (\"Early Retirement Date\").\n   14\n    \"Actuarial present value\" is the current value of monthly benefits determined by the current\nvalue of an annuity unit at the most recent valuation. See § 1.6 (\"Actuarial Present Value\").\n   15\n     An \"accrued benefit\" is essentially the total number of \"annuity units\" credited to the\naccount of a participant. See § 1.2 (\"Accrued Benefit\"). An annuity unit is a unit of measure\nrepresenting a share in the Fund. See § 1.7 (\"Annuity Unit\").\n   16\n     \"Effective retirement date\" essentially means the normal retirement date or early retirement\ndate. See § 1.18 (\"Effective Retirement Date\"). The normal retirement date is the first day of the\nmonth coinciding with or otherwise next following a participant's 60th birthday. See § 1.23\n(\"Normal Retirement Date\"). The early retirement date is the first day of the month on which a\nparticipant elects to retire and receive a pension, provided that he is at least 50 years old. See §\n1.15(a) (\"Early Retirement Date\").\n   17\n    The Pension Dispute Board consisted of four members: two were selected by Eastern and\ntwo were selected by ALPA. The Board had the authority to hear and determine \"[a]ll disputes\nconcerning the application, interpretation or administration of the Plan in respect to individual\nemployees and their participation in or their benefits under the Plan.\" § 11.2 (\"Authority [of\nPension Dispute Board]\").\n\fSouthern District of New York. On March 20, 1990, Eastern and ALPA signed an interim letter of\n\nagreement, effective March 2, 1990, fixing Eastern's contribution to the Plan for all pilots at 3% of\n\ncompensation.18 On April 18, 1990, the bankruptcy court named Martin R. Shugrue as Bankruptcy\n\nTrustee of Eastern (the \"Bankruptcy Trustee\"). The Bankruptcy Trustee began liquidating certain\n\ncompany assets in an attempt to reorganize Eastern as a smaller carrier.19\n\n        On September 11, 1990, the Bankruptcy Trustee, proceeding under section 1113(e) of the\n\nBankruptcy Code, applied to the bankruptcy court for an order, which the court entered, approving\n\nan amendment to the Plan.20 Pursuant to this order, Eastern reduced its contribution to the Plan to\n\n0% for compensation earned by pilots after August 11, 1990, and provided for resumption of its\n\ncontribution of 3% for such compensation on or after June 1, 1991. This amendment also suspended\n\nthe Pension Dispute Board's powers effective August 11, 1991. ALPA objected to the Bankruptcy\n\nTrustee's action and appealed to the district court the bankruptcy court's order authorizing this\n\namendment. The record does not inform us of the district court's disposition of this appeal.\n\n        After Eastern's Chapter 11 filing, the Fund became increasingly illiquid due to three factors.\n\nFirst, because Eastern had suspended and eventually ceased making contributions to the Plan, the\n\nFund's sole source of cash was the return on its investments. Second, a substantial portion of the\n\nFund's assets were invested in real estate, which was depressed in value due to a nationwide real\n\nestate recession. Third, the lump-sum option for receiving benefits had become increasingly popular\n\nwith retiring pilots. In fact, the annual amount distributed in lump-sum payments had risen steadily\n\nfrom $52,000,000 in 1986 to more than $200,000,000 in 1990.\n\n   18\n   For Eastern pilots employed before March 2, 1986, Eastern had been contributing 10% of\ncompensation since January 1, 1988. See supra note 6.\n   19\n    The record indicates that the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department retained its\nauthority and continued to perform its responsibilities under the supervision of the Bankruptcy\nTrustee.\n   20\n     Section 1113(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 1113(e), states that the bankruptcy\ncourt, \"after notice and a hearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the\nterms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by a collective bargaining agreement.\"\nThe bankruptcy court may authorize such measures only if they occur \"during a period when the\ncollective bargaining agreement continues in effect,\" and \"if [such measures are] essential to the\ncontinuation of the debtor's business, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate.\"\n\f        On January 18, 1991, Eastern shut down its operations, effectively retiring the approximately\n\n2,500 pilots in its employ at the time. The same day, O'Connor of the O'Connor law firm, which\n\nserved as counsel to the TAC, contacted Brian P. White, Director of Eastern's Pension and Insurance\n\nDepartment, and told White that the TAC \"recommended\" that Eastern place a temporary\n\nmoratorium on lump-sum payments. White, in response, said that Eastern lacked the authority to\n\nimpose a moratorium. On January 19, 1991, O'Connor confirmed the recommendation by letter, a\n\ncopy of which he sent to ALPA, the TAC, and Hawthorne.\n\n        On January 27, 1991, according to the deposition testimony of former President Gerald R.\n\nFord, the TAC voted unanimously to impose the temporary moratorium.21 The record does not\n\ndisclose how the TAC planned to implement the moratorium.\n\n        On January 28, 1991, O'Connor, representatives of ALPA and Eastern and their respective\n\nattorneys,22 met to discuss the need to place a temporary moratorium on lump-sum payments. The\n\nrecord does not disclose whether at this meeting the parties discussed Article XIII of the Plan, which\n\ngives Eastern the power to \"modify, suspend ... or discontinu[e] ... any feature [of the Plan].\"\n\n        On February 1, 1991, the TAC issued a \"Certificate of Action of the [TAC of the Plan] Taken\n\nupon Unanimous Written Consent.\" In this document, the TAC stated that it, \"as named fiduciary\n\nof the [Plan], has decided to, and hereby does, impose a temporary moratorium upon the payment\n\nof benefits to all Eastern pilots who shall file requests for benefits after the close of business on\nJanuary 18, 1991.\"23 This Certificate also instructed O'Connor to \"notify [Eastern] of the [TAC's]\nrequest that Eastern, as [Plan] Administrator, promptly notify all Eastern pilots who shall file\n\nrequests for benefits after the close of business on January 18, 1991, that, until further notice, a\n\n\n   21\n    In his deposition, former President Ford, a member of the TAC at the time the moratorium\nwas imposed, see supra note 9, stated that \"[the decision to impose the moratorium] was\nunanimous between Mr. Spencer, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Fouraker, the [ALPA] members, and myself.\"\n\n   22\n    The record does not indicate whether the Bankruptcy Trustee was present, or represented, at\nthe meeting.\n   23\n    The moratorium did not affect participants who were already receiving annuities or who had\nsubmitted their application for a lump-sum benefit by the close of business on January 18, 1991.\n\ftemporary moratorium has been placed in effect by [the TAC].\" Pursuant to the TAC's request,\n\nEastern mailed notice of the moratorium to all of its pilots on February 4, 1991.24 In this notice,\n\nEastern advised pilots that \"[q]uestions regarding the temporary moratorium should be addressed\n\nto the [TAC]\" at one of the following addresses: (1) the TAC, care of the O'Connor law firm; or\n\n(2) the TAC, care of Hawthorne.\n\n          White stated that, after Eastern's shutdown and the commencement of the moratorium, the\n\nprocedure for processing claims for benefits under the Plan remained the same except for two\n\nchanges: (1) the retiring pilot would contact Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department directly\n\nrather than go through the Chief Pilot; and (2) Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department would\n\ninform the actuary whether a participant had applied for benefits following the shutdown. If the\n\nparticipant had applied after the shutdown, the bank would not issue a benefit check.\n\n          On May 22, 1991, the TAC mailed a letter and a videotape to all Plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries. The letter and videotape were designed to inform these parties about the current status\n\nof the Plan and its plans for the future in light of the \"present liquidity issues confronting the\n\n[Plan]\"—that is, the state of the Plan after Eastern's shutdown and bankruptcy.\n\n          On June 25, 1991, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA modified the Plan by letter of\n\nagreement.25 This agreement modified the Plan in three significant ways. First, the Plan provided\n\nfor a periodic-payment option that enabled participants to receive their retirement benefit in\nsubstantially equal monthly payments that were made for life (or life expectancy). See § 6.11\n\n(\"Periodic Payments\"). These payments would be exempt from the ten percent additional tax\n\nassessed on early distributions from qualified retirement plans.26 Second, a new article (Article XV)\n\n   24\n     This mailing consisted of two documents: (1) a brief cover letter printed on Eastern\nstationery; and (2) a two-page notice about the moratorium signed by the TAC and addressed to\nall Eastern pilots.\n   25\n        This agreement is known as \"Document 91B.\"\n   26\n     Under the \"periodic payment\" option, a participant could elect to receive the actuarial\npresent value of his accrued benefit in the form of periodic monthly payments as described in\nI.R.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv), 26 U.S.C. § 72(t)(2)(A)(iv); under this option, the benefit amount was\ndetermined as of the date of receipt. Participants who were receiving an annuity or had an\noutstanding balance on a loan from the Fund were not eligible for this option. If the\n\fwas added in order to enable participants to take out loans from the Plan during this time of financial\n\nuncertainty.27 The amendment provided that the TAC would serve as administrator for these two\n\nprovisions; Eastern, however, retained its administrative authority for all other provisions of the\n\nPlan. See §§ 6.11(f), 15.1. Third, the Plan was amended to provide that the value of benefits\n\ndistributed from the Plan was to be determined at the time of distribution. Thus, the value of a\n\nparticipant's lump-sum benefit would no longer be determined as of the effective retirement date.\n\nSee § 6.2(e)(i).\n\n        On July 27, 1992, pending approval by the bankruptcy court, the Bankruptcy Trustee and\n\nALPA entered into a letter of agreement once again. Referred to as Document 91C, this proposed\n\namendment would make two fundamental changes to the Plan. First, the Fund would be divided into\n\na liquid portion (i.e., cash, marketable stocks, and bonds) and an illiquid portion (i.e., real estate,\n\nalternative investments, and working capital). Each Plan participant would have a percentage\n\ninterest in both the liquid and illiquid portions of the Fund rather than an interest in the Fund as a\n\nwhole. Second, the lump-sum option was modified to provide for a partial distribution—that is, an\n\nimmediate cash payment equal to the liquid portion of each eligible participant's account. A\n\nparticipant selecting this option also would receive extended payments over time as the real estate\n\nand other illiquid assets were sold. The modified lump-sum option had become feasible because of\n\nrecent favorable changes in the tax code for partial distributions.28\n\n\n\nperiodic-payment arrangement was discontinued or altered within five years after it started or\nbefore the participant reached age 59.5, whichever was later, the participant's subsequent\nelection of another form of benefit from the Plan would trigger the 10% penalty tax normally\nassociated with premature distributions, unless the participant was 55 or older when separating\nfrom Eastern. If the penalty tax was triggered, it would be applied retroactively to those amounts\npreviously withdrawn. See § 6.11.\n   27\n     Participants who were annuitants or periodic-payment recipients were not eligible to receive\nloans from the Plan. The maximum loan that could be made was the lesser of $50,000 or 25% of\nthe actuarial present value of the participant's accrued benefit at the time of loan. See § 15.4\n(\"Plan Loans\").\n   28\n     Effective January 1, 1993, partial distributions from a qualified pension plan could be rolled\nover into an individual retirement account (\"IRA\") without adverse tax consequences. See 26\nU.S.C. § 402(c)(4) (1993). Before this change, a participant could not roll over a partial\ndistribution into an IRA without significant tax liability. See 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5)(D) (1991).\n\f        On August 19, 1992, pursuant to its duties under section 10.2(c), the TAC sent a letter to all\n\nPlan participants to describe the modified lump-sum option and to explain why the moratorium had\n\nbeen imposed:\n\n        The lump sum option in the [Plan] has been modified by Document 91-C to address the\n        reality that the [Plan] has a substantial amount of high quality illiquid assets that cannot be\n        liquidated quickly without suffering a substantial discount in order to achieve a quick sale.\n        The [Plan] does not have sufficient cash and other liquid assets to allow eligible participants\n        to take their lump sum in cash. This is what caused the imposition of the moratorium in\n        January 1991.\n\n        On October 1, 1992, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA filed a joint motion in the\n\nBankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking approval of the amendment\n\nprovided by Document 91C. On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court granted their motion and\n\napproved the amendment to the Plan, effectively ending the moratorium. The operative date of the\n\nDocument 91C amendment was June 30, 1992.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n                                                  A.\n\n        Harry Hunt worked as a pilot for Eastern for twenty-four years. He elected to retire effective\n\nMarch 1, 1991, and demands that he be paid a lump-sum benefit for the value of his interest in the\n\nPlan as of that date.29 On February 22, 1991, Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department received\n\nhis application for benefits, which was signed by Hunt on February 5, 1991. On April 22, 1991, the\n\nmanager of Eastern's Pension Administration Department, Ms. S.W. Boles,30 approved Hunt's\napplication and authorized payment of his benefits.31 Given Eastern's instruction to the actuary that\n\nit apply the moratorium to those applications submitted after January 18, 1991, the State Street Bank\n\n   29\n    The parties agree that the value of Hunt's accrued benefit in the Fund as of March 1, 1991,\nwas $352,748.74.\n   30\n    The record does not disclose the relationship between Eastern's Pension and Insurance\nDepartment and Eastern's Pension Administration Department. Given the facts before us, we\nassume that the latter department carried out the policies and directives of the former\ndepartment.\n   31\n     Hunt's application requested that his lump sum be rolled over into his IRA at Dean Witter\nReynolds, Inc. If a lump-sum distribution was rolled over into an IRA or other eligible\nretirement plan within 60 days, the lump-sum payment would not be included in gross income\nfor the taxable year in which paid. See I.R.C. § 402(a)(5), 26 U.S.C. § 402(a)(5) (1991).\n\fand Trust never made any payment to Hunt. Although Hunt is eligible to receive a modified\n\nlump-sum benefit and future payments in accordance with the Document 91C amendment, he has\n\nrefused to elect that option. In addition, Hunt did not select the periodic-payment option nor did he\n\ntake out a loan from the Plan.\n\n        Dissatisfied with the progress of his application, Hunt dispatched four letters, the first by\n\nhimself and the other three through two different attorneys. He alleges that these letters were sent\n\npursuant to the instructions in Eastern's February 4, 1991, letter to all Eastern pilots. On March 15,\n\n1991, Hunt wrote to Charles G. Dyer, the chairman of Hawthorne, to inquire about the status of his\n\npension.32 On March 20, 1991, through the first of three attorneys whom Hunt employed in this\n\ncontroversy,33 he wrote to O'Connor in order to request the most current statement of his account\n\nand the most recent financial statement for the Plan \"showing [its] assets and liabilities.\" On July\n\n15, 1991, through a second attorney, he wrote another letter to Dyer of Hawthorne. In that letter,\n\nhe requested a statement of \"the TAC's position on his application,\" copies of all amendments to the\n\nPlan affecting his benefits, an explanation if the TAC were to deny his application, and the name,\n\naddress, and the forms necessary to file a claim with the Pension Dispute Board if the TAC decided\n\nnot to pay his lump sum. Hunt also sent a copy of this letter to the then-chairman of the TAC.\n\nFinally, on August 19, 1991, the same attorney wrote on Hunt's behalf to O'Connor to request copies\n\nof the \"amendments to the Plan,\" an explanation of whether the TAC \"had the right to amend the\n\n   32\n     In this letter, Hunt expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with the moratorium, Hawthorne,\nand the TAC. He stated among other things: (1) \"I have just been informed ... that the proposed\nmoratorium could be extensive.\" THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY! (emphasis in\noriginal) (2) \"[Hawthorne] is administering a Plan that is already funded and in place. It would\nappear the delays are \"stalling tactics' to financially injure [those] participants who were working\non January 18.\" (3) \"The proposal that the [TAC] will adopt changes or amend the provisions of\nthe [Plan] after [Eastern] had ceased business is ridiculous. The Plan was established and funded\nlong before the demise of the Airline.\" (4) \"The possibility of offering partial payments or\n\"[Plan] loans' is completely unsatisfactory to me. If I want to borrow money, I go to a bank.\nBanks lend money, and retirement funds were established to provide retirement benefits to their\nparticipants. If the various members need cash then they should apply to a bank,—banks lend\nmoney!\"\n   33\n     The first lawyer whom Hunt employed wrote the letter of March 20, 1991. The second\nlawyer wrote the July 15 and August 19, 1991, letters described in the text above. The third\nlawyer employed by Hunt brought the instant law suit and prosecuted it in the district court and\non this appeal; a lawyer in his firm assisted him with this appeal.\n\f[Plan],\" and a statement disclosing the number of applications for lump-sum benefits filed since\n\nJanuary 18, 1991.34 Hunt complains that none of his letters were answered.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n        On February 21, 1992, Hunt filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the\n\nNorthern District of Florida against the following parties: Eastern, ALPA, Hawthorne, Charles H.\n\nCopeland as chairman of the TAC, and O'Connor as partner and agent for the O'Connor law firm.\n\nThe complaint was a typical \"shotgun\" pleading.35 With the exception of Count I, Hunt made only\n\ngeneral references to \"ERISA,\" failing to indicate which provision of the statute served as his basis\n\nfor relief.\n\n        The complaint contained six counts or causes of action. Each incorporated the allegations,\n\nmostly factual, set out in the first twenty-four paragraphs of the complaint. In those paragraphs,\n\nHunt made essentially the following allegations:\n\n        he was a participant in the Plan;\n\n\n   34\n     On August 23, 1991, in response to a purported \"request\" by his Congressman, Hunt sent a\nletter to Mr. Stephen Mayle of the Office of Filings, Information, and Consumer Services of the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission. He made, inter alia, the following\nstatements: (1) \"I believe Mr. Dyer [of Hawthorne] and the [TAC], which is packed with\n[ALPA] [r]epresentatives, are trying to prevent these lump sum payouts by arbitrarily modifying\nthe retirement agreements so as to prevent the retiree from moving his account to other fund\nmanagers or IRA retirement programs of their choice.\" (2) \"I request your expeditious assistance\nin investigating Mr. Dyer's activities as the Fund Manager to determine if he is in violation of\nSecurity and Exchange Commission Rules relating to investment fund managers and request\nyour prompt reply regarding your findings in this matter.\"\n   35\n      See, e.g., Ebrahimi v.

As we relate\ninfra, the court subsequently took such action when Hunt's attorney moved the court for leave to\nfile an amended complaint, which amounted to nothing more than a rehash of the original\ncomplaint. The court denied his motion with leave to file an amended complaint that did not\nsuffer from \"some of the same infirmities contained in his original complaint.\" Hunt's attorney\nthereafter filed an amended complaint, but it constituted no improvement over his original\npleading. Unfortunately, rather than striking the amended complaint from the record, the court\naccepted it. As a result, Hunt's claims remained ambiguous and in part inconsistent, the issues\nwere not properly delineated, and the trial yielded the erroneous decision we set aside today.\n\f        on February 5, 1991, he mailed to the Plan administrator's (Eastern's) Pension and Insurance\n        Department a \"Notice of Retirement Status, electing a lump sum payout of his benefits under\n        the [Plan], effective on his early retirement date of March 1, 1991\";\n\n        he inquired of Hawthorne on March 15, 1991, May 3, 1991, and May 7, 1991 as to when he\n        would receive his lump-sum payment for his accrued benefit;\n\n        Hawthorne replied that he would be paid between June 15, 1991, and June 30, 1991;\n\n        the Plan administrator had not paid his benefit because a moratorium had been placed on the\n        payment of lump-sum benefits;\n\n        the \"moratorium resulted from resolutions rendered by ALPA\"; and\n\n        he retained counsel in order to obtain his lump-sum benefit.36\n\n        Count I of the complaint, titled \"Failure to Provide Information,\" alleged that the defendants'\n\nfailure \"to respond within 30 days to repeated written requests made by Hunt since March 20, 1991,\n\nas required by 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c)(1)(B),\" rendered the defendants \"liable to Hunt in an amount up\n\nto $100 per day from the date of this failure to respond pursuant to [section] 1132(c)(1)(B).\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt requested \"judgment against Defendants for the applicable penalty and damages,\n\n... such further relief as the court deems appropriate and ... prejudgment interest, costs and\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees.\"\n\n        Count II, titled \"Action to Enforce Rights under [Plan],\" alleged that Hunt had properly\n\nsubmitted his request for a lump-sum benefit; that he was entitled to the benefit; and that the\n\n\"Defendants have failed to pay or direct payment of said benefits and have failed to provide any\n\ndisposition of Hunt's claim.\" Accordingly, Hunt asked the court to \"enter an order requiring\n\nDefendants to pay Hunt his benefits and award to him prejudgment interest, costs and reasonable\n\nattorneys' fees.\"\n\n        Count III, titled \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty,\" alleged in pertinent part:\n\n        the defendants were fiduciaries under ERISA;\n\n        \"ALPA has a duty not to interfere with Hunt's interest\";\n\n        \"[t]he value of Hunt's [Plan] account continues to decrease since his effective retirement\n\n   36\n    Hunt also alleged that he \"relied on [Hawthorne's] representations [that he would receive his\nbenefits between June 15 and 30, 1991] and on the terms of the Plan in establishing his business\nand activities following his retirement [from Eastern].\"\n\f       date\";\n\n       the defendants \"willfully and wantonly breached their fiduciary duty to Hunt by failing to\n       pay [his lump-sum benefit], by failing to respond to Hunt's requests for information, by\n       interfering with Hunt's rights to [his benefit], and by failing to discharge their duties solely\n       in the interest of the participants for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits in\n       accordance with the [Plan] documents\";\n\n       the decision to impose the moratorium on lump-sum benefits was \"arbitrary and capricious,\n       [was] contrary to the terms of the [Plan] and [was] contrary to law\"; and\n\n       \"[a]s a result of Defendants' breach of the fiduciary duties, Hunt has been damaged by failing\n       to receive his lump sum payout and the resulting payment of increased interest expense for\n       loans obtained pending payment.\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded \"compensatory and punitive damages against Defendants jointly and\n\nseverally and request[ed] entry of an order awarding to him prejudgment interest, costs and\n\nreasonable attorneys' fees.\"\n\n       Count IV, titled \"Recovery of Benefits,\" alleged that \"Hunt has been damaged by Defendants'\n\nfailure to pay Hunt the benefits to which he is entitled under the [Plan].\" Accordingly, Hunt\n\ndemanded \"judgment against Defendants jointly and severally for payment of his benefits under the\n\n[Plan], plus prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.\"\n\n       Count V, titled \"Estoppel,\" alleged in pertinent part:\n\n       \"Defendants represented to Hunt that he was fully vested, that the [Plan] was fully funded,\n       and that his benefits would be paid before June 30, 1991\";\n\n       \"Hunt relied on the terms of the [Plan] and on the representation of Defendants in\n       determining his retirement date and in establishing his business plan and financial affairs\n       upon retirement\"; and\n\n       \"Defendants should be estopped to deny payment and to refuse to process payment to Hunt.\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt demanded \"judgment against Defendants jointly and severally for payment of\n\nhis benefits under the [Plan], plus prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.\"\n\n       Count VI, titled \"Declaratory Judgment,\" alleged that the defendants \"failure to pay to Hunt\n\nthe benefits to which he is entitled as set forth in the [Plan] have raised dispute regarding Hunt's\n\nentitlement (right) to immediate payment of the [Plan] benefits under the terms of the [Plan] and\n\nERISA\" and that \"Chapter 86 Fla. Stat.[ ] provides that such rights may be determined by the court.\"\n\nAccordingly, Hunt requested that \"this court enter an order declaring his right to payment of his\n\flump sum [Plan] benefits under the terms of the [Plan] and pursuant to ERISA and awarding to Hunt\n\ncosts of this proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees.\"\n\n          The defendants, proceeding individually, responded to Hunt's complaint. Hawthorne and\n\nthe Bankruptcy Trustee, who appeared for Eastern, filed answers that denied liability and included\n\nthe affirmative defense that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief. The remaining\n\ndefendants, with the exception of Copeland, moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P.\n\n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief;37 Copeland moved for dismissal on the ground that\n\nHunt had not served him with process as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j).38 Because Hunt had\n\n\"demonstrated neither good reason for Copeland's continued presence in this lawsuit nor good cause\n\nfor the lack of timely service upon Copeland,\" the court dismissed Copeland from the case.39\n\n          Before the court could address the question whether the complaint stated a claim for relief\n\nagainst any of the defendants, the Bankruptcy Trustee moved the district court on August 6, 1992,\n\nfor summary judgment on the grounds, among others, that Eastern was not a fiduciary under the Plan\n\nbecause its duties were purely ministerial; that Eastern lacked discretion to impose the moratorium;\n\nand that the moratorium was imposed at the TAC's direction. Although the Plan contained no\n\nprovision requiring Eastern to accept the TAC's decisions as binding, Eastern contended that it \"had\n\nno choice but to abide by\" the TAC's decision to impose a moratorium on the payment of lump-sum\n\nbenefits. Finally, Eastern contended that \"its sole obligation in the retirement benefits process is\nlimited to determining eligibility, here whether an applicant meets the age criteria.\" \"Once this is\n\ndone,\" Eastern argued, \"[it] has no role in deciding whether to pay an eligible participant benefits,\n\n\n   37\n        ALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.\n   38\n        Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j), now Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), provided in pertinent part:\n\n                  If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within\n                  120 days after the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such\n                  service was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made\n                  within that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without\n                  prejudice upon the court's own initiative with notice to such party or upon motion.\n\n   39\n        The district court issued its order dismissing Copeland from the case on January 4, 1993.\n\fwhat benefits an eligible participant is entitled to, or how those benefits will be distributed\"\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       On October 1, 1992, while this motion for summary judgment and the Rule 12(b)(6) motions\n\nto dismiss were still pending, the Bankruptcy Trustee and ALPA jointly moved the bankruptcy court\n\nfor the entry of an order pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363 approving the Document 91C amendment to\n\nthe Plan. See supra part I.D. Their motion advised the bankruptcy court of the following:\n\n               On July 27, 1992, Eastern and ALPA entered into a letter of agreement to amend the\n       [Plan], conditioned on the approval of this Court. Under the agreement, designated as\n       \"Document 91C', the [Plan] would be amended to provide ... for the segregation of the assets\n       of the [Plan] into liquid and illiquid segments, and would modify the distribution of\n       lump-sum benefits under the [Plan].\n\n               Under Document 91C, Eastern would remain both the \"Sponsor' and the\n       \"Administrator' of the [Plan] for purposes of [ERISA]. Eastern and ALPA have been told\n       that one or more groups object to Document 91C, and may file suit challenging its\n       implementation. Because Eastern's ministerial role in the [Plan] is a continuing obligation\n       of the estate, and to provide a single forum to consider the objections to Document 91C, the\n       [Bankruptcy] Trustee and ALPA hereby jointly seek an Order from this Court approving\n       Document 91C under its authority to approve contracts made by the [Bankruptcy] Trustee\n       other than in the ordinary course of business. See 11 U.S.C. § 363.\n\n       On October 26, 1992, Hunt, acting through his attorney in the instant case, filed with the\n\nbankruptcy court an \"Objection to Joint Motion for Entry of Order Approving Amendment to\n\n[Plan].\" The essence of his objection was that \"[t]he movants have failed to provide any authority\n\nwhich would permit amendment of the [Plan] in such a manner that would alter or adversely impact\n\nHunt's ability to receive a lump sum payment upon his retirement.\" According to Hunt, section 13.1\n\nof the Plan precluded any amendment that would \"adversely affect the retirement benefits provided\n\nto the participant at the time of the modification.\" Alternatively, Hunt had \"no objection to any\n\namendment that excepts or exempts him, or that otherwise permits him to receive his lump sum\n\npayout.\"   Finally, Hunt contended that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the\n\nadministration of the Plan because \"Eastern's involvement in the [Plan], according to its own\n\nrepresentations, is merely ministerial.       The motion seeks to elevate and escalate Eastern's\n\ninvolvement in administering the Plan without providing plan participants with any means of\n\nparticipating in Eastern's administration.\"\n\n       On November 13, 1992, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the Bankruptcy Trustee's and\n\fALPA's joint motion for approval of the Document 91C amendment to the Plan. In addressing\n\nobjections of Plan participants such as Hunt, the court stated the following:\n\n                  It is clear from this record that the objections are not well-founded. The record does\n          support the relief that has been requested, which does give equitable treatment to inherent\n          competing interests to the [Plan]. In any situation such as this there are always competing\n          interests. And it is clear from this record that the proposal is equitable.\n\nThe bankruptcy court granted the joint motion. According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, neither Hunt\n\nnor any other objector appealed this ruling.\n\n          On December 4, 1992, following the bankruptcy court's approval of the Document 91C\n\namendment to the lump-sum benefit provision of the Plan, Hunt moved the district court for leave\n\nto file an amended complaint. The Bankruptcy Trustee, ALPA, and Hawthorne opposed Hunt's\n\nmotion in separate filings.40 The Bankruptcy Trustee and Hawthorne argued that Hunt's motion\n\nshould be denied on the ground that the bankruptcy court's rejection of Hunt's objection to the\n\napproval of the Document 91C amendment barred his claim for a lump-sum benefit. The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee also represented that Hunt \"had a full opportunity to address his concerns before\n\nthe bankruptcy court. Having failed in his efforts before the bankruptcy court, he [was] barred under\n\nthe doctrine of res judicata from collaterally attacking Document 91C before this [District] Court.\"41\n\nALPA objected to Hunt's proposed amended complaint on the ground that the claims Hunt proposed\n\nto assert against it were frivolous.\n\n          On February 1, 1993, the district court disposed of three of the pending motions. The first\ntwo were ALPA's alternative motions to dismiss Hunt's complaint for failure to state a claim for\n\nrelief and for summary judgment. The court granted both motions. It concluded that ALPA was not\n\nan administrator of the Plan and that Hunt's breach of fiduciary duty claim was improperly asserted;\n\nALPA, therefore, could not have been held liable for any of the relief Hunt sought in Counts I\n\nthrough IV. The court also rejected Hunt's Count V estoppel claim because the complaint failed to\n\n\n   40\n        Defendants Copeland and O'Connor did not respond to Hunt's motion.\n   41\n     According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, the bankruptcy court heard and rejected Hunt's\nobjection to the approval of the Document 91C amendment on November 13, 1992, and Hunt did\nnot appeal this ruling. Hunt did not contest this representation.\n\fallege that Hunt had relied on a representation made by ALPA.\n\n        The third motion disposed of was Hunt's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The\n\ncourt denied that motion \"because ... [the amended complaint Hunt tendered with his motion]\n\nsuffer[ed] from some of the same infirmities contained in his original complaint.\" The court did not\n\nspecify the infirmities in Hunt's original complaint; whatever they were, the court gave Hunt\n\ntwenty-two days to cure them and to \"file an appropriate amended complaint.\"\n\n                                                  C.\n\n        On February 24, 1993, Hunt filed an amended complaint. Without obtaining leave of court\n\nas required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 21, Hunt dropped from the case four of the defendants named in his\n\noriginal complaint: Eastern, ALPA, Copeland, and O'Connor.42 He replaced them with two new\n\ndefendants, the TAC and the Plan, which joined Hawthorne as the defendants in the case. The\n\nBankruptcy Trustee subsequently learned that Hunt had dropped Eastern from the case, and on April\n\n30, 1993, it obtained from Hunt and filed with the court a stipulation that recited:\n\n               Pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiff ... Hunt\n        and defendant ... Eastern ... hereby agree and stipulate that the above captioned action shall\n\n\n\n\n   42\n      Fed.R.Civ.P. 21, \"Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of Parties,\" provides in pertinent part:\n\"Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own\ninitiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.\" A plaintiff who has been\ngiven leave to file an amended complaint may drop a defendant from the case without obtaining\na Rule 21 order if the defendant has not responded to the original complaint with an answer. See\ngenerally 3 Moore's Federal Practice, §§ 15.10, 15.11 (3d ed.1997); 4 Moore's Federal Practice,\n§ 21.02[5][b] (3d ed.1997) (discussing the interrelationship of Rules 15 and 21 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure). ALPA and O'Connor did not answer Hunt's original complaint;\nALPA filed alternative motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and O'Connor filed a\nmotion to dismiss. Hunt, therefore, was not required to file a Rule 21 motion and obtain an order\ndismissing those defendants from the case. Eastern, however, answered Hunt's original\ncomplaint; consequently, Hunt could not drop Eastern from the case without moving the court\npursuant to Rule 21 for an order dismissing Eastern \"on such terms as are just.\" Hunt was free,\nhowever, to obtain Eastern's dismissal from the case by filing with the court a stipulation under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(ii). As we observe above and in part III.B, infra, Hunt eventually\nfollowed this route, obtaining Eastern's dismissal by entering into a stipulation providing for the\ndismissal of his claims against Eastern with prejudice.\n\n                We note that Hunt did not move the court pursuant to Rule 21 to add the TAC and\n        Plan as defendants. Neither party objected to being added, and thus the matter is not an\n        issue here.\n\f        be and hereby is dismissed with prejudice as to Eastern, each party to bear its own costs.43\n        Hunt's amended complaint contained seven counts. With the minor exceptions set out in the\n\nmargin, the first six counts of the amended complaint simply replicated the allegations and prayers\n\nfor relief contained in the original complaint. For example, as before, Count I was titled \"Failure\n\nto Provide Information\"; Count II was titled \"Action to Enforce Rights under [Plan]\"; Count III was\n\ntitled \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty\"; Count IV was titled \"Recovery of Benefits\"; Count V was titled\n\n\"Estoppel\"; and Count VI was titled \"Declaratory Judgment.\"44\n\n   43\n    The Bankruptcy Trustee's attorney and Hunt's attorney signed the stipulation on April 22,\n1993, and April 29, 1993, respectively.\n   44\n     The principal difference between the two complaints was that instead of seeking recovery\nfrom the parties named as defendants in the original complaint, the counts of the amended\ncomplaint sought relief only from the defendants named in the amended complaint. Other than\nthis difference, the \"amended\" Count I was an exact duplicate of the original Count I. Count II\nadded the following allegation, which was implicit in the allegations of the original Count II:\n\"These defendants have improperly, and without authority, interfered with Hunt's attempts to\nreceive payment through the imposition of a moratorium, or modification and amendment of the\n[Plan].\"\n\n                Count III, the breach of fiduciary duty claim, added the allegations listed below in\n        an attempt to circumvent the dismissal of this claim on the ground that an individual plan\n        participant lacks standing under ERISA to sue a plan fiduciary for money damages. That\n        Hunt lacked standing as a plan participant to bring a breach of fiduciary duty claim\n        against the TAC had previously been brought to the district court's attention, and the\n        court had informed his attorney that Hunt could not bring the claim for his own benefit,\n        as opposed to the benefit of all participants. As Hunt's attorney well knew, the right to\n        sue for breach of fiduciary duty belonged to all of the plan's participants as a group. See\n        Massachusetts Mut. Life. Ins. Co. v.

In an effort to\n        shore up the original Count III and persuade the district court to accord him standing for\n        the breach of fiduciary claim, Hunt alleged:\n\n                       The [Plan] itself is effectively precluded from challenging the fiduciary\n               duties of these defendants in that these defendants are inextricably tied to the\n               [Plan] itself through their roles, activities, insured interests and administration of\n               the [Plan]. Hunt has no other recourse for the actions of these fiduciaries with\n               regard to his interest in the [Plan].\n\n                       Defendants have willfully and wantonly breached their fiduciary duty to\n               Hunt and to the [Plan] itself, by failing to pay [Plan] benefits to Hunt, by failing\n               to respond to Hunt's requests for information, by interfering with Hunt's rights to\n               these monies, and by failing to discharge their duties solely in the interest of the\n               participants for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits in accordance with the\n               [Plan] documents (emphasis added).\n\f        In the original complaint, twenty-four paragraphs preceded the presentation of the counts.\n\nThe amended complaint had twenty-five such paragraphs. These paragraphs, compared to their\n\ncounterparts in the original complaint, differed materially in the following way. After alleging in\n\nthe original complaint that the Document 91C amendment affecting Hunt's lump-sum benefit had\n\nbeen made by Eastern and ALPA, which were no longer parties in the case, Hunt changed his\n\nposition and alleged that the TAC, which \"renders decisions regarding administration of the [Plan],\"\n\nwas the party responsible for the moratorium rather than Eastern or ALPA. According to Hunt,\n\nEastern and ALPA were \"the only entities which can act to amend or modify the [Plan]\"; he\n\ntherefore implied that the moratorium allegedly imposed by the TAC constituted an unauthorized\n\namendment or modification of the Plan.\n\n        As noted, the amended complaint added a seventh count to those asserted in the original\n\ncomplaint. Count VII, titled \"Injunctive Relief,\" alleged essentially that the defendants had breached\n\ntheir duty to maintain sufficient \"reserves\" with which to pay Hunt's lump-sum benefit. It alleged\n\nfurther that\n\n               [n]o other parties will be prejudiced by enjoining the imposition of the moratorium,\n\n\n                The new Count III also added this allegation, which followed the replicated\n        allegation that the moratorium was \"arbitrary and capricious, [was] contrary to the terms\n        of the [Plan], and [was] contrary to law\":\n\n                       Alternatively, if the moratorium was imposed because of the [Plan's]\n               inability to pay lump sum benefits to retiring employees electing that option, then\n               these Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to the [Plan] and to Hunt\n               through mismanagement and failure to take such action to ensure that the [Plan]\n               was adequately funded so as to pay the lump sum benefit option exercised by\n               Hunt.\n\n                Finally, the new Count III added this language to its prayer for compensatory and\n        punitive damages: \"[I]n the alternative, [Hunt] demands judgment for damages on behalf\n        of the [Plan] in an amount sufficient to fully fund the retirement benefits authorized\n        under the [Plan].\"\n\n                The sole addition of note to new Count IV was the allegation that the moratorium\n        and the Document 91C amendment to the lump-sum benefit provision, which the\n        bankruptcy court had approved, were \"arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and [ ] contrary\n        to the provisions of the [Plan].\" New Count V, the estoppel claim, added the allegation\n        that the defendants were estopped from enforcing against Hunt the moratorium or the\n        Document 91C amendment. Count VI, the declaratory judgment claim, was renewed\n        verbatim.\n\f          modification or amendment or payments made thereunder beyond keeping sufficient reserves\n          for the payment of Hunt's lump sum benefit; i.e., payments would continue under the [Plan],\n          but defendants would be enjoined from so depleting the liquid portion of the fund that Hunt's\n          total lump sum benefit could be paid.\n\nAccordingly, Hunt \"demand[ed] that [the] Court enter an order enjoining payment of benefits under\n\nthe [Plan] to current beneficiaries, at least to the extent that sufficient funds are retained to pay\n\nHunt's lump sum benefit, interest, costs and attorney's fees.\"\n\n          The TAC and the Plan jointly moved the court to dismiss the counts of the amended\n\ncomplaint on the ground that none stated a claim for relief.45 In part, they repeated the arguments\n\npreviously addressed to the sufficiency of Hunt's original complaint and advanced in the Bankruptcy\n\nTrustee's and ALPA's objections to Hunt's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. These\n\narguments included the claim that Hunt lacked standing to sue for breach of fiduciary duty and that\n\nthe moratorium and the bankruptcy court's approval of the Document 91C amendment foreclosed\n\nhis claim. As for Hunt's claim seeking the $100 per day statutory penalty, these defendants\n\ncontended that such penalties were assessable only against the administrator of the Plan, Eastern,\n\nwhich had been dismissed from the case with prejudice. Hawthorne answered the complaint with\n\na general denial of liability.\n\n          The district court disposed of the joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the\n\nfollowing manner: the court (1) denied the motion to dismiss Count I; (2) denied the motion to\n\ndismiss Count II; (3) dismissed Count III to the extent that it sought comprehensive and punitive\n\ndamages for Hunt, but held that he had standing to sue the TAC for breach of fiduciary duty on\n\nbehalf of the Plan's participants; (4) denied the motion to dismiss Count IV; (5) dismissed Count\n\nV after Hunt conceded that he had no case for estoppel; (6) dismissed Count VI on the ground of\n\nERISA preemption; and (7) denied the motion to dismiss Count VII, although the court was unable\n\nto discern—from what it described as an \"inartfully\" drafted pleading—whether Hunt stated a claim\n\nfor relief.\n\n          Following these rulings, the TAC and the Plan answered the amended complaint, denying\n\n\n   45\n        The TAC and the Plan were represented by the same counsel throughout this case.\n\fliability, and then jointly moved for summary judgment. Their motion essentially restated the\n\narguments presented in their motion to dismiss. Hawthorne also moved for summary judgment. It\n\ncontended, among other things, that Hunt's claim for the lump-sum benefit (Counts II and IV) could\n\nbe brought only against the Plan and a person or entity, such as the Plan administrator, possessing\n\nthe authority to order the payment of his benefit. Hawthorne argued that it had no such authority\n\nand, thus, could not provide the relief sought. In addition, Hawthorne contended that it could not\n\nbe held liable for breach of fiduciary duty (Count III) because the Plan, the appropriate plaintiff for\n\nsuch a cause of action, was not injured by the failure to pay Hunt his lump-sum benefit.\n\n       The court deferred ruling on these motions for summary judgment until the morning that the\n\ntrial of the case began. In the meantime, Hawthorne settled with Hunt and agreed to the entry of\n\njudgment in favor of Hunt on Count I in the sum of $10,000; all other counts against Hawthorne\n\nwere to be dismissed with prejudice. The court denied the only motion that was pending, the TAC's\n\nand the Plan's motion for summary judgment, and the trial commenced.\n\n                                                  D.\n\n       The case was tried to the court. Five counts from the amended complaint were at issue:\n\nHunt's claim for the $100 per day statutory penalty under Count I; his identical claims under Counts\n\nII and IV seeking judgment in the amount of the lump-sum benefit, prejudgment interest, costs, and\n\nattorneys' fees; his claim on behalf of the Plan participants for breach of fiduciary duty under Count\n\nIII; and his request that the TAC and the Plan be enjoined from paying benefits to other participants\n\nuntil they satisfied his claim under Count VII.\n\n       After considering the evidence adduced by the parties, the court, in an \"Order Directing\n\nEntry of Judgment,\" held as follows:\n\n       Count I. The court found that only designated plan administrators are subject to the $100\n\npenalty imposed by ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c), for failing to respond to a\n\nplan-participant's requests for information as required by the statute. Because Hunt had neither\n\nestablished that the TAC was the Plan administrator nor that it had assumed the\n\n\"information-providing function\" of the administrator, the TAC could not be held liable under\n\fsection 502(c).\n\n       Counts II and IV. The court first found that Hunt had properly applied for the lump-sum\n\nbenefit and that his application had been denied because of the moratorium the TAC had \"imposed\"\n\nunilaterally. The TAC had done so because it concluded that a \"moratorium was needed to maintain\n\nthe financial integrity of the [Plan] and to protect the economic interests of all plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries.\" The court then turned to the question whether the TAC had the authority to impose\n\nthe moratorium for such purpose. Although the Plan did not expressly give the TAC such authority,\n\nthe court assumed that the common law of trusts did so. Having made that determination, the court\n\naddressed the question whether Hunt or the TAC had the burden of proof regarding the need for the\n\nmoratorium: it concluded that the TAC had the burden.\n\n       With this ruling in hand, the court considered whether the TAC's proof established that \"its\n\naction was both prudent and necessary to protect the interests of all plan participants and their\n\nbeneficiaries.\" The court held that although the moratorium may have been justified, the TAC's\n\nproof was insufficient to carry the day. The court therefore gave Hunt judgment on Counts II and\n\nIV in the sum of $352,748.74 plus costs.\n\n       Count III. The court's findings on this claim are ambiguous. Hunt had alleged that \"if the\n\nmoratorium was imposed [by the TAC] because of the [Plan's] inability to pay lump sum benefits\n\nto retiring employees electing that option, then these Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties\n\nto the [Plan] and to Hunt through mismanagement and failure to take such action to ensure that the\n\n[Plan] was adequately funded so as to pay the lump sum benefit option exercised by Hunt.\" See\n\nsupra note 44. In other words, the TAC breached its fiduciary duty to the Plan's participants, and\n\ntherefore to Hunt, by imposing the moratorium because of its inability to pay the lump-sum benefits.\n\n       The court found no such breach: \"Hunt submitted neither evidence of mismanagement\n\nnor—assuming, for the sake of argument, that he proved a breach of fiduciary duty—evidence from\n\nwhich this court could fashion a remedy. Hunt having thus failed to satisfy his burden of proof on\n\nCount III, judgment will be entered in favor of the defendants.\"\n\n       Therefore, under the district court's analysis, whether the TAC had breached its fiduciary\n\fduty to the Plan participants, including Hunt, by imposing the moratorium turned on which party\n\nhad the burden of proof. On Counts II and IV, the court held that the TAC had the burden but failed\n\nto sustain it by showing that prudence required that a moratorium be imposed. On Count III, the\n\ncourt held that Hunt had the burden of proof but failed to show that the TAC had acted imprudently\n\nin imposing the moratorium.46\n\n        The district court's \"Order Directing Entry of Judgment\" makes no mention of the remaining\n\ncount (Count VII). After disposing of the other counts in the amended complaint by number,\n\nincluding Counts V and VI which were dismissed from the case prior to trial, the court instructed\n\nthe clerk of court in paragraph four of its order (\"paragraph 4\") how judgment should be entered:\n\n\"4. On the remaining counts [i.e., Counts II, IV, and VII], the clerk shall enter judgment in favor of\n\nHarry L. Hunt in the amount of $352,748.74 plus costs. The judgment shall be paid from the [Plan]\n\n[F]und.\" We read this language, and the final judgment entered by the clerk, as disposing of Count\n\nVII in favor of Hunt,47 although the court did not grant the injunctive relief the count requested.48\n\n        Following the entry of final judgment, the TAC and the Plan appealed the district court's\n\njudgment on Counts II and IV. Hunt cross-appealed the court's judgment on Count I but not Count\n\n\n   46\n     How the court could assume, \"for sake of argument, that [Hunt] proved a breach of fiduciary\nduty\" and then deny him relief on Count III is a question that the court's dispositive order does\nnot answer.\n   47\n     By treating the district court's final judgment as having terminated Count VII of Hunt's\namended complaint, we have a final judgment before us that is appealable under 28 U.S.C. §\n1291 because the judgment has adjudicated all claims against all parties.

The amendment, however, did not operate to dismiss Eastern\nfrom the case. Id.

In their briefs, the parties have ignored Count VII altogether; like the\ndistrict court, they made no mention of it. Because of our disposition of Hunt's explicit claim for\nbenefits contained in Counts II and IV, Count VII falls by the wayside. That is to say, we vacate\nthe court's judgment on Count VII and direct the court to enter judgment in favor of the TAC and\nthe Plan on that count.\n\fIII. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the court's judgment on Counts II and IV, and affirm as\n\nto Count I.\n\n                                                   III.\n\n          Paragraph 4 of the district court's \"Order Directing Entry of Judgment,\" which gave Hunt\n\njudgment on Counts II, IV, and VII for the lump-sum benefit, presents several threshold issues that\n\nmust be resolved before we can consider the merits of his claim to that benefit. As stated previously,\n\nin paragraph 4, the court directed the clerk to \"enter judgment in favor of [Hunt] in the amount of\n\n$352,748.74 plus costs. The judgment shall be paid from the [Plan] [F]und.\"49\n\n          The first threshold question is whether the relief granted in paragraph 4 is legal or\n\nequitable;50 that is, does the relief granted constitute a money judgment or an in personam order\n\ndirecting the TAC or the Plan to pay Hunt a sum of money from the assets of the Plan's Fund. The\n\nanswer to this question is important because, as we explain below, the relief provided in an action\n\nto recover benefits under ERISA is equitable, not legal. More specifically, the relief consists of an\n\norder directing a person or entity having the necessary authority under the benefit plan to pay the\n\nparticipant the benefit that he seeks. Hunt sought such equitable relief in Count II of his amended\n\ncomplaint, asking the district court to enter \"an order requiring Defendants to pay Hunt his benefits.\"\n\nIn Count IV, Hunt sought legal relief, demanding \"judgment against Defendants ... jointly and\n\nseverally for payment of his benefits.\" In Count VII, titled \"Injunctive Relief,\" Hunt asked the court\nto \"enter an order enjoining payment of benefits ... to current beneficiaries, at least to the extent that\n\nsufficient funds are retained to pay Hunt's lump sum benefit.\"\n\n          Nothing in the language of paragraph 4 orders the TAC to do anything. If, however, we\n\nconstrue—that is, effectively rewrite—paragraph 4 so that it orders the TAC to pay the benefit from\n\nthe Fund,51 then we must decide whether the TAC has the authority under the Plan to effect payment;\n\n   49\n        We note that the final judgment entered by the clerk quoted this language verbatim.\n   50\n    If the relief granted in paragraph 4 is equitable, we have jurisdiction to review the grant\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). See supra note 47.\n   51\n   In his original complaint, of course, Hunt took the position that Eastern, as Plan\nadministrator, was the party having the authority to effect payment of the benefit he is seeking;\n\fif not, the TAC cannot provide the relief sought. Despite its representations to the contrary, Eastern,\n\nthe Plan administrator, obviously could effect payment if ordered to do so, see supra part I.C and\n\ninfra part III.B, but Hunt voluntarily dismissed it from the case with prejudice. Nor can the Plan as\n\nan entity provide any relief; the Plan alone is simply a written instrument executed by Eastern and\n\nALPA.\n\n        We turn now to these issues, taking them up in order.\n\n                                                   A.\n\n         Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA provides that \"[a] civil action may be brought by a\n\nparticipant or beneficiary ... to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce\n\nhis rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the\n\nplan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). On its face, this language does not indicate whether a participant\n\nseeking to recover retirement benefits may obtain legal or equitable relief. Although the \"causes of\n\naction authorized by section 502(a)(1)(B) [of ERISA] are not explicitly denominated as equitable,\"\n\nsee Pane v.

This position is consistent\n\nwith our view that participants suing under section 502(a)(1)(B) are not entitled to a jury trial. In\n\nBlake v. Unionmutual Stock Life Ins. Co. of America, we reasoned:\n\n\nthis was his reason for naming Eastern as a party defendant in his claims to recover his\nlump-sum benefit. Since eliminating Eastern from his amended complaint as a party defendant,\nHunt has taken the position that the TAC, not Eastern, is the entity having the authority to effect\npayment of the benefit.\n   52\n     In Pane, the Third Circuit aptly captured the distinction between legal and equitable relief in\nthe context of an action brought under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA: \"A legal remedy would\nresult in a money judgment enforceable only by execution, or other conventional common law\nprocess such as ejectment or replevin.

Accordingly, we dismiss Count IV of Hunt's\n\namended complaint, leaving only his claim for equitable relief in Count II to recover his lump-sum\n\nbenefit.\n\n           Given the equitable nature of Hunt's recovery-of-benefits claim under ERISA, we also find\n\nthat an in personam order enjoining the payment of benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) must be\n\ndirected to a person or entity other than the plan itself. While ERISA § 502(d)(1), 29 U.S.C. §\n\n1132(d)(1), does state that \"[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued ... as an entity,\" nothing\n\nin ERISA permits the district court to issue an injunctive order solely against the plan.54 Rather, the\n\ncase law of this circuit demonstrates that an order enjoining the payment of benefits from an ERISA\n\nplan must issue against a party capable of providing the relief requested.

Hunt [on Counts II, IV, and VII]\" and that \"[t]he judgment shall be\n\npaid from the [Plan] fund.\" Because an injunctive order cannot issue against the Plan itself, we\n\nassume that we have discretion to construe—i.e., effectively rewrite—paragraph 4 so that it directs\n\nthe TAC to pay Hunt the lump-sum benefit from the Fund.\n\n        Our review of the record and the Plan,55 however, makes clear that the TAC has no authority\n\nunder the Plan to issue or deny payment of a lump-sum benefit to a participant. Rather, the TAC\n\nhas limited powers under the Plan56 and plays no role in the process of reviewing applications for\n\nretirement benefits. Unlike Eastern, the TAC's authority is primarily limited to the management and\n\nsupervision of the Fund's assets. Its \"overall supervisory responsibility\" is restricted to the\n\n\"administrative functions of the Fund,\" see § 2.13(b)(i) (\"Fund Administration\"), and its duty to the\n\nPlan is limited \"to maintain[ing] surveillance over the status and administration of the Plan and the\n[Fund],\" see § 10.2(b) (\"Rights and Duties of the [TAC]\").\n\n        In addition, as discussed in part I.B, supra, the TAC must exercise its limited powers in a\n\nmanner consistent with its obligations to ALPA. For example, before selecting and replacing\n\ninvestment advisors and trustees, the TAC must notify ALPA of its planned course of action and\n\n\n   55\n     Unless otherwise specified, the term \"Plan\" in part III refers to the written instrument in\neffect at the time Hunt's application was \"approved\" on April 22, 1991 (i.e., Documents 91 and\n91A).\n   56\n     We review the relevant provisions of the Plan here because a named fiduciary must\ndischarge its duties \"in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan\ninsofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with [ERISA].\" ERISA §\n404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D).\n\fgive ALPA an opportunity to respond. See § 2.7(b) (\"Trust Agreement and Trustee\"). Similarly,\n\nbefore giving any notice or instruction to a trustee of the Fund, the TAC must serve a copy of the\n\ntrust direction on ALPA and give it fifteen days to object to the TAC's proposed direction. See §\n\n2.8 (\"Directions to Trustee(s)). In addition, the TAC must \"regularly and periodically suppl[y]\"\n\ninformation to ALPA about transactional detail, cash flow reports, investment status, documentation\n\nand Fund performance,\" see § 2.11 (\"Information and Accountability\"), and furnish to ALPA and\n\nPlan participants reports about the TAC's \"functions, actions, and decisions ... as are reasonable and\n\nappropriate,\" see § 10.2(c).\n\n        In stark contrast, the plain language of the Plan gives Eastern broad discretion as\n\nadministrator to make decisions for the Plan.

Section 2.2(a) of the Plan confers upon Eastern\n\n\"those powers necessary to carry out the day to day operation of the Plan.\" Its responsibilities\n\ninclude the authority to \"initially determine all questions arising from the administration,\n\ninterpretation, and application of the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements and contracts,\n\nand such determination shall be binding upon all persons, except as otherwise provided by law, and\n\nfurther provided that each Participant shall be granted the same treatment under similar conditions.\"\nId. The Plan also charges Eastern with the responsibility for, inter alia, keeping records, see § 2.4\n\n(\"Records\"), preparing and distributing periodic Plan summaries, see § 2.5 (\"Plan Summary\"), and\n\nsending to each participant an annual statement reflecting the value of his investment in the Plan,\n\nsee § 2.6 (\"Annual Statement\").\n\n        More important, based on the record before us,57 we find that Eastern exercises ultimate\n\nauthority in determining whether a participant should receive payment of his benefit. The record\n\n   57\n    As stated in part I.C and note 12, supra, the Plan does not set forth the procedure for\nprocessing claims for retirement benefits. This account of the claims-processing procedure is\ntaken from the affidavit and deposition of Charles Dyer of Hawthorne and the affidavit of Brian\nWhite, who served as Director of the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department. Both accounts\nof Eastern's claims-processing procedure are virtually identical.\n\freveals that Eastern plays the central role in the process of reviewing applications for benefits. The\n\nPlan makes Eastern responsible for providing the benefit-application forms to participants. See §\n\n12.9(a) (\"Application for Benefits\").58 A pilot seeking a lump-sum payment must complete the\n\nnecessary paperwork and inform an Eastern management employee, the Chief Pilot, of his intention\n\nto retire. The Chief Pilot checks the pilot's eligibility under the Plan, and then informs the Eastern\n\nPension and Insurance Department about the pilot's decision to retire.59 The application is then\n\npresented to the Eastern Pension Administration Department, which must provide an authorizing\n\nsignature beneath a line that states: \"The above information is approved and the appropriate\n\nallocation from the Plan to provide the benefit payable is hereby authorized.\" If the application is\n\napproved, the Eastern Pension and Insurance Department contacts the Plan's actuary, which\n\ndetermines the precise amount of benefits to which the retiring participant is entitled. The actuary\n\nthen gives that information to the State Street Bank & Trust, which makes the distribution to the\n\nparticipant. Eastern is responsible for establishing and maintaining a procedure for giving the\n\nparticipant written notification if the application is denied. See § 2.3 (\"Notification of Denial of\n\nBenefits\"). If there is a legal dispute as to the proper recipient of a benefit, Eastern may withhold\n\npayment pending final determination of the proper beneficiary. See § 12.10 (\"Beneficiary Dispute\").\n\n          The facts of this case support our reading that Eastern, not the TAC, has the authority to\n\norder payment of retirement benefits. First, the record makes clear that Eastern retained its authority\n\nas administrator at all times during the events giving rise to this litigation. When Hunt's application\n\nwas \"approved\" by Eastern's Pension Administration Department on April 22, 1991, Eastern was\n\nlisted in the written instrument as the Plan administrator.60 When the Plan was amended effective\n\nJune 25, 1991, Eastern continued to serve as administrator for all aspects of the Plan, with the\n\n   58\n     Section 12.9 also states that each participant \"shall ... furnish the Administrator with such\ndocuments, evidence, data, or information in support of such application as the Administrator\nshall consider necessary or desirable.\"\n   59\n     As stated in part I.D, supra, after the moratorium began, the retiring participant would\ncontact Eastern's Pension and Insurance Department directly rather than go through the Chief\nPilot.\n   60\n        At this time, the Plan consisted of Document 91 and Document 91A.\n\fexception of the newly introduced periodic-payment option and the provision for Plan loans. See\n\n§ 6.11(f) (\"Periodic Payments\"), Article XV (\"Plan Loans\").61 Even after the Plan was amended\n\neffective June 30, 1992, with the bankruptcy court's approval of Document 91C, Eastern retained\n\nits authority as Plan administrator.\n\n          Second, the record demonstrates that Eastern, despite its representations to the contrary,\n\nmade the decision to honor the moratorium and ultimately prevented the State Street Bank and Trust\n\nfrom issuing a lump-sum payment to Hunt. As noted in part I.D, supra, the director of Eastern's\n\nPension and Insurance Department stated that the process for reviewing benefit claims after the\n\nshutdown \"basically remained the same, except that ... Eastern would inform Mercer [the Plan\n\nactuary] whether a participant had applied for benefits following shutdown, thus implicating the\n\nlump-sum moratorium.\" By this statement, Eastern effectively admits that it ratified the imposition\n\nof the moratorium and thus denied Hunt's application. In essence, Eastern's order to the actuary to\n\nhalt the processing of Hunt's application foreclosed the State Street Bank and Trust from issuing him\n\na benefit check.\n\n          Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Eastern challenged the legality\n\nof the moratorium after its imposition. Eastern's inaction is especially glaring when one considers\n\nthat Article XIII of the Plan, titled \"Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance,\" vests Eastern with\n\nthe exclusive authority to modify, suspend or discontinue a feature of the Plan:\n\n          Eastern expects to continue the Plan indefinitely, but necessarily reserves the right to\n          modify, suspend or terminate it at any time including, but without limiting the generality of\n          the foregoing, discontinuance of the contributions of Eastern under the Plan or modification,\n          suspension, or discontinuance in its entirety or with respect to any feature thereof.\n          However, any modification, suspension, or discontinuance shall not adversely affect the\n          retirement, death or termination benefits already provided at that time under the Plan for any\n          Participant, contingent annuitant, or beneficiary as of the date of such modification,\n          suspension, or discontinuance. In the event the Plan shall be discontinued, such action shall\n          be taken as shall insure to the extent possible the satisfaction of all liabilities to Participants,\n          contingent annuitants, and beneficiaries that have accrued under the Plan.\n\n§ 13.1 (\"General\") (emphasis added). Although this provision enumerates only one specific\n\napplication of this subsection (i.e., the discontinuation of Eastern's contributions), the phrases\n\n\n   61\n        This version of the Plan included the amendment referred to as Document 91B.\n\f\"including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing\" and \"with respect to any feature\n\nthereof\" would encompass other scenarios, such as the suspension of the lump-sum payment option.\n\nThus, if Eastern wanted to challenge the TAC's purportedly \"unilateral\" imposition of the\n\nmoratorium, the Plan certainly gave Eastern the authority to do so.62\n\n        It is clear that Eastern, not the TAC, bears ultimate responsibility for the denial of Hunt's\n\nlump-sum benefit. Hunt, however, in an obvious attempt to avoid the effect of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's approval of the Document 91C amendment, voluntarily dismissed Eastern with prejudice as\n\na party to this action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(ii) shortly after filing his amended\n\ncomplaint.63\n\n        Nevertheless, the district court ruled in paragraph 4 of its order that the TAC possessed the\n\nauthority to issue payment from the Fund. In so ruling, the district court implicitly rewrote the Plan\n\nto give the TAC that power.

See supra part\n        I.B. After all, the full name of the Plan is the \"Variable Benefit Retirement Plan for\n        Pilots\": a participant's interest in the Plan depends not only on the contributions made\n        but also on how the Fund's assets perform.\n   63\n     Eastern's dismissal from the case with prejudice operated as an adjudication on the merits in\nfavor of Eastern on all claims Hunt had brought against the company.

For the district court's theory of liability to make sense,\n\nthe TAC would necessarily have acted as de facto Plan administrator in Eastern's stead; as discussed\n\nabove, this theory is inconsistent with the Plan and clearly unsupported by the record.

Under section 2.2(a) (\"Administration\"), the administrator enjoys the authority\n\nto \"initially determine all questions arising from the administration, interpretation, and application\n\nof the Plan pursuant to all applicable law, agreements and contracts, and such determination shall\n\nbe binding upon all persons, except as otherwise provided by law.\" We have held that comparable\n\nlanguage is sufficient to trigger review under the arbitrary and capricious standard. See Jett, 890\n\nF.2d at 1139 (\"[Plan administrator] has the exclusive right to interpret the provisions of th[is] Plan,\n\nso its decision is conclusive and binding.\"); Guy v. Southeastern Iron Workers' Welfare Fund, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524724\"><a href=\"/opinion/524724/james-guy-counterclaim-v-southeastern-iron-workers-welfare-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38-39 (11th Cir.1989) (\"[Administrator has] full power to construe the provisions of [the]\n\nTrust\"). Thus, we apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the TAC's \"decision\" as\n\nde facto administrator to deny Hunt's lump-sum benefit. We stress that our principal inquiry in this\n\nhypothetical situation is not whether the TAC was justified in imposing the moratorium, but whether\n\nthe TAC was justified in denying Hunt's application for a lump-sum benefit. Of course, our analysis\n\nof the latter issue necessarily implicates the former.\n\n        Under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the court seeks \"to determine whether\n\nthere was a reasonable basis for the [administrator's] decision, based upon the facts as known to the\n\fadministrator at the time the decision was made.\" Jett, 890 F.2d at 1139. The facts presented at trial\n\nbear out that the TAC acted reasonably in its decision as de facto administrator to impose the\n\nmoratorium on lump-sum payments. First, the record paints an extremely bleak picture for the Plan\n\nin January 1991. It is undisputed that the Plan was low on liquid assets as of the eighteenth of that\n\nmonth. Following the commencement of the Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding on March 9,\n\n1989, Eastern reduced and eventually stopped making contributions on behalf of its pilots.\n\nMoreover, between 1986 and 1990, the amount of lump-sum payments paid to retiring pilots\n\ndramatically increased; fewer than twenty-five pilots selected another benefit option after the\n\nlump-sum option became available in 1983. In 1986, roughly $52,000,000 was disbursed in\n\nlump-sum payments; that number grew to more than $200,000,000 in 1990.65 Between January 1\n\nand January 18, 1991, already $38,000,000 had been disbursed as lump-sum payments.66\n\n        This paucity of liquid assets was further exacerbated by the depressed performance of the\n\nPlan's substantial real estate holdings. Former Citicorp president William Spencer, a member of the\n\nTAC during the period in question, stated at trial that \"[t]he real estate which comprised a sizable\n\npart of the fund was in a funk, and ... unless some time was developed [so the real estate] could\n\nevolve, the hardships on all of the [Plan's] members would be very extreme.\" Another former TAC\n\nmember, former President Ford, stated in his deposition that the Plan could not have made lump-sum\n\npayments to all retiring pilots without subjecting its real estate holdings to a \"fire sale\" at prices far\nbelow market value. Both former TAC members agreed that holding a fire sale of such potentially\n\nvaluable assets would have been grossly imprudent. Hunt did not dispute the validity of this\n\ntestimony.\n\n        Second, the terms of the Plan make clear that the administrator owes an equal fiduciary duty\n\nto all Plan participants, including annuitants and those who have not elected any benefit option. The\n\n\n   65\n    The following amounts were distributed in lump-sum payments between 1986 and 1990:\n$52,091,000 (1986); $79,389,000 (1987); $107,954,000 (1988); $181,856,000 (1989); and\n$200,540,000 (1990).\n   66\n    At this rate, more than $60,000,000 would have been disbursed in lump-sum payments in\nJanuary 1991 alone.\n\fadministrator is required to treat all participants equally at all times in running the Plan. See § 2.2(a)\n\n(\"[T]he Administrator ... shall have those powers necessary to carry out the day to day operation of\n\nthe Plan ... and initially determine all questions arising from the administration, interpretation, and\n\napplication of the Plan ... provided that each Participant shall be granted the same treatment under\n\nsimilar conditions.\") (emphasis added). Moreover, as named fiduciary, the TAC bears a heavy\n\nobligation to ALPA. See supra part III.B (discussion of TAC's obligations to ALPA under §§ 2.7(b),\n\n2.8., and 2.11).\n\n        Hunt was one of approximately 2,500 pilots who were affected by Eastern's shutdown and\n\nthe moratorium. Like the hundreds of other Eastern pilots who failed to submit their benefit\n\napplications by the close of business on January 18, 1991, Hunt was unable to take advantage of the\n\noriginal lump-sum option that was in effect prior to Eastern's shutdown.\n\n        If the Plan administrator were to grant Hunt's lump-sum benefit application, however, it\n\nwould be arbitrarily favoring Hunt over all of the other pilots who, like Hunt, did not submit their\n\napplication before the imposition of the moratorium. As a fiduciary under ERISA, the administrator\n\nowes a responsibility to administer the plan \"in accordance with the documents and instruments\n\ngoverning the plan.\" ERISA § 404(a)(1)(D), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(D). The Plan plainly states that\n\nthe administrator is required to discharge its duties in a manner ensuring that \"each Participant shall\n\nbe granted the same treatment under similar conditions.\" See § 2.2 (\"Administration\") (emphasis\nadded). Given this fiduciary responsibility, the administrator, when faced with Hunt's benefit\n\napplication, made the reasonable decision to treat Hunt exactly like all of the other pilots in his\n\nposition—that is, to deny his lump-sum benefit despite its \"approval\" by Eastern's Pension\n\nAdministration Department. Therefore, even assuming arguendo that the TAC functioned as de\n\nfacto administrator, we would find that its \"denial\" of Hunt's lump-sum benefit was reasonable based\n\nupon the facts known by it at that time.67 Accordingly, in this hypothetical case, the TAC's \"denial\"\n\n   67\n    As indicated above, we have managed to locate ample information in the record to justify\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard of review the imposition of the moratorium. We\nwould agree, however, with the district court's assessment that the TAC presented its supporting\nevidence at trial in a wholly incoherent manner: \"[B]ecause the [TAC's data was] either\nincomplete or not adequately explained, this court was left to wonder what the numbers and\n\fof Hunt's lump-sum benefits would pass muster under the arbitrary and capricious standard of\n\nreview.68\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n        Hunt cross-appeals the district court's refusal to impose a statutory penalty on the TAC for\n\nits alleged failure to comply with Hunt's requests for information.69 Under section 502(c) of ERISA,\n\nan administrator who \"fails or refuses to comply with a request for any information which such\n\nadministrator is required by [ERISA] to furnish to a participant or beneficiary ... within 30 days after\n\nsuch request may ... be personally liable to such participant or beneficiary in the amount of up to\n\n$100 a day from the date of such failure or refusal.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).70 ERISA requires the\n\nadministrator to provide participants with, inter alia, the latest updated summary plan description,\n\nthe latest annual report, a statement to each participant indicating the total benefits accrued, and\n\n\"other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.\"71 See ERISA §§ 104(b)(4),\n\n105(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1024(b)(4), 1025(a)(1). The imposition of this penalty is committed to the\n\ndistrict court's discretion. ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).\n\n\nfigures really meant.\"\n   68\n     Although Hunt is not entitled to receive the total value of his accrued benefit in one full\nlump-sum payment, we assume that he remains eligible to elect the modified lump-sum option\navailable under Document 91C like all other similarly situated Eastern pilots affected by the\nshutdown and moratorium.\n   69\n     As stated in part II.A, supra, Hunt dispatched four letters allegedly in response to Eastern's\nFebruary 4, 1991, letter to all Eastern pilots. His March 15, 1991, letter to Dyer of Hawthorne\ninquired about the status of his pension. His March 20, 1991, letter to O'Connor requested the\nmost current statement of his account and the most recent financial statement for the Plan\n\"showing [its] assets and liabilities.\" His July 15, 1991, letter to Dyer requested a statement of\n\"the TAC's position on his application,\" copies of all amendments to the Plan affecting his\nbenefits, an explanation if the TAC were to deny his application, and the name, address, and the\nforms necessary to file a claim with the Pension Dispute Board if the TAC decided not to pay his\nlump-sum benefit. This letter also was sent to the then-chairman of the TAC. His August 19,\n1991, letter to O'Connor requested copies of the \"amendments to the [Plan],\" an explanation of\nwhether the TAC \"had the right to amend the [Plan],\" and a statement disclosing the number of\napplications for lump-sum benefits filed since January 18, 1991.\n   70\n     Section 502(a)(1)(A) of ERISA empowers participants and beneficiaries to sue \"for the\nrelief provided for in subsection(c) of [section 502].\" 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(A).\n   71\n    In the alternative, the TAC argued that Hunt did not request information that ERISA\nrequires an administrator to provide. Like the district court, we make no ruling on this issue.\n\f        The issue in this cross-appeal is whether the TAC should be considered an \"administrator\"\n\nfor purposes of section 502(c) of ERISA. The previous discussion shows that the Plan designated\n\nEastern as Plan administrator, whereas the TAC served as named fiduciary and as administrator of\n\nonly the periodic-payment and loan options.72 Hunt contends, however, that the TAC functioned\n\nas de facto administrator and thus should be held liable for failing to respond to his requests for\n\ninformation.\n\n        Hunt bases his claim on Law v.

After reviewing the plan documents in question, the First\n\nCircuit held that if the company \"acted as the plan administrator in respect to dissemination of\n\ninformation concerning plan benefits, it may be properly treated as such for purposes of the liability\n\nprovided under [section 502(c) ].\" Law, 956 F.2d at 373; see also Rosen, 979 F.2d at 193-94 (\"We\n\nagree with the reasoning of the First Circuit and we hold that if a company is administrating the plan,\n\nthen it can be held liable for ERISA violations, regardless of the provisions of the plan document.\")\n\nThe Law court further reasoned that to refrain from imposing liability on such an entity simply\n\nbecause it is not named as plan administrator \"would cut off the remedy Congress intended to\n\ncreate.\" Law, 956 F.2d at 373. Finding \"a plethora of evidence\" showing that the company had\n\n\"controlled the provision of information,\" id. at 372, 373, the First Circuit affirmed the lower court's\n\njudgment for the statutory penalty. Id. at 374. In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized\n\ntwo facts in particular: (1) that the company, according to the plan documents, still exercised\n\nconsiderable control over plan administration; and (2) that the plaintiff's requests for information\n\n   72\n     See supra parts I.D and III.C. We note again that our discussion in part III.C merely\nassumes for the sake of argument that the TAC served as Plan administrator. Of course, neither\nthe Plan nor the record provides a legitimate basis for making that assumption.\n   73\n     Other circuits have concluded that, for the statutory penalty to apply, the administrator must\nbe the entity so designated in the plan documents.

Id. at 373-74.\n\n        Although Hunt states in his brief that \"Eastern had delegated, and TAC had assumed, the role\n\nof Plan Administrator,\" the record demonstrates that this statement is patently inaccurate. First, as\n\ndiscussed in parts I.D and III.C, supra, the record makes clear that with the exception of the\n\nperiodic-payment and loan options, which were added effective June 25, 1991,74 Eastern retained\n\nits authority as administrator of the Plan at all relevant times. In fact, a July 1991 letter sent from\n\nthe TAC to all plan participants regarding the periodic-payment and loan options makes this fact\n\nunambiguously clear: \"The [Plan's] Trust Administrative Committee is designated as Administrator\n\nof both of these new [Plan] provisions only. As in the past, Eastern retains administrative authority\n\nover all other provisions of the [Plan].\"75 Consequently, Eastern retained its responsibility under the\n\nPlan to provide information such as plan summaries and annual statements to all participants. See\n\n§§ 2.5, 2.6.\n\n        Second, Hunt's claim fails because he misinterprets Eastern's simple instructions to all\n\nparticipants in its February 4, 1991, letter. Hunt argues in his brief that this letter, which was sent\n\nby Eastern and printed on Eastern stationery, indicated that the \"TAC was the authority designated\n\nby the Plan Administrator for dissemination of information regarding the [Plan].\" This short letter,\n\nhowever, stated that \"[q]uestions regarding the temporary moratorium should be addressed to the\n\n[TAC]\" (emphasis added); it made no representation that the TAC was now responsible for\nproviding plan summaries, annual statements, amendments, and other such information to\n\nparticipants.76 Furthermore, with the exception of the TAC's responsibilities as administrator of the\n\n   74\n    Hunt did not participate in either the periodic-payment or loan option, so this issue is not\ngermane to his claim.\n   75\n     This letter was sent pursuant to the TAC's authority under § 10.2(c) \"[t]o furnish to ...\nParticipants such reports with respect to the functions, actions, and decisions of the [TAC] as are\nreasonable and appropriate.\"\n   76\n     Hunt's arguments on this claim reveal a profound misunderstanding about basic aspects of\nthe Plan. For example, he contends that the \"TAC further held themselves out to be the Plan\nAdministrator by claiming to be negotiating for, and selecting, an administrative services\nprovider.\" The Plan, however, charges the TAC, as named fiduciary, with the responsibility for\nselecting investment advisors and other administrative service personnel, provided that the TAC\nobtains ALPA's consent. See §§ 2.9, 2.13(c),(d).\n\fperiodic-payment and loan options, the record is devoid of evidence showing that the TAC had\n\nassumed any of Eastern's duties regarding the provision of information to participants. We therefore\n\nhold that Hunt has failed to support his contention that the TAC functioned as de facto Plan\n\nadministrator and that the district court properly declined to impose a penalty on the TAC pursuant\n\nto ERISA § 502(c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).\n\n                                                   V.\n\n        In light of the above, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court awarding $352,748.74\n\nplus costs to Hunt from the coffers of the Plan's Fund (Counts II and IV).77 We AFFIRM the\n\ndecision of the district court to deny Hunt the assessment of a statutory penalty under section 502(c)\n\nof ERISA (Count I).\n\n        COX, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n        I dissent from that part of the court's opinion that holds that an action for recovery of benefits\n\nunder ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B) cannot be maintained solely against an ERISA plan as an entity. I join\n\nthe remainder of the court's opinion, and, because the holding from which I dissent is an alternative\n\nholding, I concur in the result reached by the court.\n\n        In my view, ERISA allows an action to recover benefits to be brought solely against an\n\nERISA plan as a entity, with appropriate relief including a money judgment against the plan. The\n\nstatute clearly states that \"[a]n employee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this subchapter as\n\nan entity.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(1). The statute then describes the mechanics of suing the plan. See\n\nid. (\"Service of summons, subpoena, or other legal process of a court upon a trustee or an\n\nadministrator of an employee benefit plan in his capacity as such shall constitute service upon the\n\nemployee benefit plan.\"). And finally, the statute provides that \"[a]ny money judgment under this\n\nsubchapter against an employee benefit plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an\n\nentity....\" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(2). Although in the form of a money judgment, this relief is\n\n\n   77\n     Although the district court gave Hunt judgment on Count VII, it refused to give him the\nrelief he sought in that count. See supra note 48 and accompanying text. Nonetheless, for\ncompleteness, we reverse the court's judgment on Count VII as well as the court's judgment on\nCounts II and IV.\n\fequitable relief.
