Six Unknown Named\nAgents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). Upon de novo review,\nMumid v. Abraham Lincoln High Sch., 618 F.3d 789, 793 (8th Cir. 2010), we affirm.\n\n      Webb seeks damages from multiple employees at United States Medical Center\nfor Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri (“MCFP-Springfield”): security officer\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., Chief Judge, United States District\nCourt for the Western District of Missouri.\n\fJeff Sims; unit-team manager Scott Klinzing; unit-team counselor Darrell Bradley;\nmedical practitioners Mark Pearson and Thomas Hare; and warden William Hedrick.\nWebb claims violations of the First and Eighth Amendments, alleging that Pearson\nacted with deliberate indifference when he approved of Webb’s transfer from MCFP-\nSpringfield in 2003, all the defendants conspired to transfer him from MCFP-\nSpringfield in 2003 and 2004 in retaliation for engaging in protected conduct, Sims\nand Bradley retaliated against him by transferring him to administrative segregation,\nand Hedrick failed to respond to Webb’s complaints of retaliation and inadequate\nmedical care.2\n\n       Webb failed to create a genuine issue of fact on his claim that Pearson acted\nwith deliberate indifference when he approved of Webb’s transfer from MCFP-\nSpringfield in 2003. To establish deliberate indifference, Webb must demonstrate that\n“he suffered objectively serious medical needs, and the officials actually knew of but\ndeliberately disregarded those needs.” Johnson v. Hamilton, 452 F.3d 967, 972-73\n(8th Cir. 2006). Webb has asserted no facts from which to infer that Pearson knew of\nWebb’s allegedly serious medical need. The facts that Webb does allege—that\nPearson relied on outdated medical information and never reexamined Webb before\nauthorizing his transfer—prove the opposite. At most, the facts Webb alleges support\na claim that Pearson acted negligently in failing to reexamine Webb before transfer,\nbut negligence alone is not actionable under the Eighth Amendment. Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976).\n\n       As to Webb’s retaliation Bivens claims, we agree with the district court that\nretaliation for engaging in protected conduct was not a “but for” factor in Webb’s\ntransfers from MCFP-Springfield. In raising a retaliatory transfer claim Webb\n“face[s] a substantial burden in attempting to prove that the actual motivating factor\n\n\n      2\n       Webb made additional claims in his complaint, but he pursues only these four\non appeal.\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffor his transfer was the impermissible retaliation.” Goff v. Burton, 7 F.3d 734, 737\n(8th Cir. 1993) (quotations omitted). Even at summary judgment, “the burden is on\nthe prisoner to prove that but for an unconstitutional, retaliatory motive the transfer\nwould have not occurred.” Sisneros v. Nix, 95 F.3d 749, 752 (8th Cir. 1996) (quoting\nGoff, 7 F.3d at 738)). Here, there is record evidence that Webb was returned to his\npermanent medical facility in 2003 and 2004 because he no longer needed the medical\ncare at MCFP-Springfield. Even if retaliation was one factor in the decision to\ntransfer Webb, Webb has not shown that his transfer would not have occurred “but\nfor” the retaliation. See Kind v. Frank, 329 F.3d 979, 981 (8th Cir. 2003) (finding\nretaliation not a “but for” cause of transfer where record demonstrated that inmate was\ndisciplined and transferred due to pattern of misbehavior); Ponchik v. Bogan, 929\nF.2d 419, 420 (8th Cir. 1991) (rejecting retaliatory-transfer claim even where\nretaliation was clearly factor in transfer).3\n\n       Similarly, Webb’s claim against Sims and Bradley fails because retaliation was\nnot a “but for” factor in Webb’s placement in administrative segregation pending\ninvestigation. Webb alleges that he was placed in administrative segregation because\nSims, assisted by Bradley, fabricated an incident report in retaliation for Webb filing\nadministrative grievances. Webb has not alleged, however, any facts to indicate that\nSims or Bradley had personal involvement in his placement in administrative\nsegregation, and both men deny any connection. Regardless of whether the two\nfabricated the disciplinary charge against Webb, neither was responsible for Webb’s\nplacement in administrative segregation pending investigation. See Griggs v. Norris,\n\n\n\n      3\n         Moreover, Webb had not engaged in protected activity before his 2004\ntransfer. Webb alleges that he was transferred in 2004 after providing legal assistance\nto another inmate. However, “an inmate simply does not have the right to provide his\nfellow inmates with legal assistance,” and a transfer based on such assistance “would\nnot constitute the violation of a protected right.” Gassler v. Rayl, 862 F.2d 706, 708\n(8th Cir. 1988).\n\n                                         -3-\n\f297 F. App’x 553, 555 (8th Cir. 2008) (unpublished per curium); accord White v.\nBledsloe, 368 F. App’x 273, 275 (3d Cir. 2010) (unpublished per curium).4\n\n       Finally, Webb’s retaliation and deliberate indifference claims against Hedrick\nfail because Bivens liability cannot be established solely on a theory of respondeat\nsuperior. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1948 (2009). Webb alleges that Hedrick\nretaliated against Webb when Hedrick failed to respond to Webb’s multiple\ncomplaints of retaliation by Hedrick’s staff. Under Bivens, however, Hedrick’s\ninaction must itself have had a retaliatory motivation, see id. at 1948-49, and Webb\nhas produced no evidence to suggest Hedrick had the requisite intent. Webb also\nalleges that Hedrick acted with deliberate indifference when he did not respond to\nWebb’s complaints of inadequate medical care. As a non-medical professional,\nhowever, Hedrick is not personally liable for his medical staff’s treatment decisions,\nsee Meloy v. Bachmeier, 302 F.3d 845, 849 (8th Cir. 2002), and under Bivens, he\ncannot be held vicariously liable for their actions, see Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1948.5\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n      4\n       To the extent Webb argues that his placement in administrative segregation\nbased on a false disciplinary charge constituted cruel and unusual punishment, he\nmisunderstands the Eighth Amendment requirement. The prohibition against cruel\nand unusual punishment is focused on the conditions of the administrative\nsegregation, not on the reasons for placement there. See Brown v. Nix, 33 F.3d 951,\n954-55 (8th Cir. 1994). Webb does not allege that the conditions of the administrative\nsegregation were unconstitutional.\n      5\n       The Appellees also argue that Webb’s claims are barred because he failed to\nexhaust his administrative remedies. Because we uphold the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on the merits, we do not answer this question.\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f",
