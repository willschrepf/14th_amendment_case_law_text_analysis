Hiring Practices</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1965 Union Carbide opened a plant in Mobile County, Alabama for the manufacture of \"molecular sieves,\" a product that strains and filters liquid or gaseous molecules.  The work force at the plant is composed primarily of residents in the vicinity of Mobile, Alabama, an area which is approximately 26% black.  When the plant began operations, the work force consisted of 35 whites and 1 black.  Nevertheless, within nine years the plant hired 84 black and 259 white employees.  Furthermore, blacks serve in both salaried and wage-earning positions at the Union Carbide plant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Carbide continually accepts employment applications irrespective of the existence of current vacancies.  The personnel files keep a record of applicants; whenever a position becomes available, the applications from the \"active\" file are reviewed for employment consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  If the files contain an insufficient number of applications, Union Carbide places advertisements in the local newspaper.  Then the plant conducts short screening interviews to determine the applicants' basic vocational interests and to answer any questions relating to the job openings.  Following the initial interview, selected applicants are requested to return for an in-depth interview with three or four other plant employees usually two engineers and one foreman.  The applicant also tours the plant to view the working conditions.  According to Mr. James W. Garner, manager of employee relations, the plant prefers applicants who are \"more likely to be long term Carbide employees (and) who want the kind of work and opportunities that (the plant has) to offer.\"  Three members of the personnel department discuss the qualifications of each applicant and decide which of the applicants are most qualified for the particular job opening.  An offer is then extended to the candidates deemed to be most qualified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that the Union Carbide hiring practices were discriminatory and violative of the Civil Rights Act, Title VII.  Nevertheless, the employment practices of Union Carbide appear to be fair in form that is, reasonably directed to secure the best qualified candidate for the position available.  Although perhaps fair in form, the hiring and promotional practices must also be fair in operation.  In Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348, 355 (5th Cir. 1972), Chief Judge Brown stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"It is clearly not enough under Title VII that the procedures utilized by employers are fair in form.  These procedures must in fact be fair in operation.  Likewise, the intent of employers who utilize such discriminatory procedures is not controlling since 'Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.'  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S.  (424) at 432, 91 S.Ct.  (849) at 854, 28 L.Ed.2d (158) at 165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>\"It is therefore clear that employment practices which operate to discriminate against people because of their race, color, religion, sex or national origin, violate Title VII, even though the practices are fair on their face and even though the employer had no subjective intention to discriminate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the consequences of Union Carbide's employment practices is thus critical to a disposition of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigants proposed separate methods to analyze the hiring data.  The appellants suggested that the total number of applications filed by black persons is the critical factor to be considered.  Their statistical analysis showed that blacks filed approximately 50% of all applications but secured only 26% of new hourly positions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <pre>-------------------------------------\nYear          Hirees      Applicants\n-------------------------------------\n           Black  White  Black  White\n-------------------------------------\n1971        10        7    572   587\n1972        25       48   1177  1071\n1973        19       68   1114  1018\n-------------------------------------\n    Total   54      123   2863  2676\n-------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>At least one witness, however, cast suspicion on the reliability of appellants' approach, comparing it to \"trying to measure jellyfish with a rubber band (because) you don't know where all the applicants come from . . .  (and) how many are duplicated.  (S)ome applicants fill six applications a year out.  We have even had three or four in one month from a particular applicant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Carbide, offering an alternative method of analysis, urged that the employment record should be proportionate to the composition of the local work force.  Since 1970 approximately 33% of all employees hired by Union Carbide have been black.  Operating its plant in an area where the labor force is approximately 26% black, Union Carbide presents convincing statistics tending to negate the existence of a discriminatory effect of its hiring practices and procedures:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <pre>-----------------------------------\n   Year         Hirees      % Black\n-----------------------------------\n            Blacks  Whites\n            -----------------------\n1965-1969       37     166    18%\n    1970         5       9    35%\n    1971        10       7    58%\n    1972        25      48    34%\n    1973        19      68    21%\n-----------------------------------\n     Total      96     298    24%\n-----------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adopting Union Carbide's method of analysis, the district court concluded that the employer \" . . .  has truly equal access to jobs at its Chickasaw plant by blacks and whites and the Court finds that this has in fact produced an employee population with substantially the same proportion of blacks represented as are in the Mobile area work force.\"  The district court's recognition of the employer's method of analysis as more reliable and indicative of racial discrimination is supported by testimony that appellants' alternative analysis is subject to suspect data, such as the duplication of employment applications.  Additionally, the trial court's finding that Union Carbide's method is more reliable is supported by the practice of other federal courts.  On many occasions federal courts have compared the composition of the company's work force to the composition of the labor force in the surrounding area.  E. g., Jones v. Tri-County Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 512 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1975); Morrow v. Crisler, 479 F.2d 960 (5th Cir. 1973), rehearing, 491 F.2d 1053, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 895, 95 S.Ct. 173, 42 L.Ed.2d 139 (1974); NAACP v. Beecher, 371 F.Supp. 507, 515 (D.Mass.Mod.) aff'd 504 F.2d 1017 (1st Cir. 1974), cert denied, 421 U.S. 910, 95 S.Ct. 1561, 43 L.Ed.2d 775; Crockett v. Green, 388 F.Supp. 912, 917 (E.D.Wis.1975); Fowler v. Schwartzwalder, 351 F.Supp. 721 (D.Minn.1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the standard of review in this circuit there must be \"requisite subsidiary facts to undergird the ultimate facts.\"  Causey v. Ford Motor Co., 516 F.2d 416, 420-21 (5th Cir. 1975).  We conclude that the record presents sufficient underpinnings to support the ultimate finding that Union Carbide did not engage in discriminatory hiring practices.2. Promotional Practices</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even an employer who exhibits nondiscriminatory hiring practices can fall short in its system of promotion, Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348, 355-59 (5th Cir. 1972) (Brown, C. J.), and that appears to be the situation in the instant case.  Although the employer's affirmative action hiring program has resulted in the employment of blacks in close proportion to the composition of the area labor force, the system of promotion has failed to provide equal access to the most preferred positions at the Chickasaw plant.  For this reason we REVERSE and REMAND on the issue of Union Carbide's promotional practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">( a) System of promotion.  The plant uses a seniority system to promote employees within the rank of \"hourly personnel.\"  When there is an hourly position available, current employees can bid for the job.  The senior employee satisfying the minimum qualifications for the position will secure the job.  According to Mr. Garner, \"(the plant) can't hire anybody outside the plant who makes a high test score or promote a person to that job who makes a higher test score . . . .  (W)e promote the most senior qualified employees.\"  Job candidates demonstrate that they are qualified by passing the examinations prepared and administered by the Employee Relations Manager and a plant foreman or supervisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The plant provides training programs designed to prepare employees for the exams, the passing of which is essential to secure a better hourly wage position.  Thus, assuming the requisite seniority, completion of a training program and passing the company's exam are the keys to advancement within the hourly ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of \"non-exempt salaried personnel\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the system of promotion is somewhat different.  The personnel department posts a notice of the particular job opening and accepts applications for the position.  After the initial screening process, applicants are referred to the department supervisor under whose direction the selected applicant would work.  The ultimate employment decision is made by the responsible department supervisor, with personnel's concurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third category, \"exempt salaried employees,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> is not derived from job posting or seniority bidding, but is the product of Carbide recruitment.  Chemical engineers and other technical and supervisory personnel, for example, are exempt salaried employees.  To fill the engineering positions Carbide representatives approach the colleges and universities to conduct job interviews.  When the plant hires new foremen, the superintendents and supervisors evaluate all employees in the particular division and select the most qualified individuals for advancement from the hourly wage to salaried positions.  The ultimate decision, however, is not based on uniform procedures or objective standards.  Instead, the selection of one candidate over another depends on highly subjective criteria which shift in importance from case to case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Statistical evidence of racial discrimination.  As mentioned earlier, the original work force at the Chickasaw plant was composed of 35 whites and 1 black.  Six of the 35 whites are presently employed by Union Carbide: one is plant manager, one is an area supervisor, two are first line supervisors, and two are group leaders.  Only the plant manager began his employment in that capacity; the other five white Carbide employees began in low priority wage-earning positions but were promoted through successive promotions.  In contract, the first black employee began as an oiler and is currently a warehouseman; both jobs are low priority wage-earning positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blacks continue to dominate the ranks of menial employment at Union Carbide's plant in grossly disproportionate numbers.  For example, 40% of the oiler and helper-trade employees are black; blacks constitute only 19.2% of the total work force.  Only 7.1% of the plant's maintenance department is black, exclusive of members of the oiler/helper trades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <pre>--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Starting\n                            Hourly\n                             Wage    White  Black  Total  % Black of Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMAINTENANCE\n-------------------------\nGroup Leader Maintenance    $4.97        3    0        3          0%\nGroup Leader Electrical     $4.97        1    0        1          0%\nElectrician \"A\"/ Maint.\nMach.                       $4.61       16    2       18        11.1%\nUtitlity Maint.

The contrast between the black population of the Mobile area (approximately 28%) and the percentage of blacks in supervisory or salaried positions (below 10%) constitutes a substantial statistical discrepancy and, thus, establishes a prima facie case of unlawful racial discrimination.  After the prima facie case is established, the burden of persuasion shifts to the corporation whereby it must show the statistical discrepancy results from causes other than racial discrimination.

Union Carbide contends that the employment statistics are the result of a nondiscriminatory system of promotion.  For promotion within the hourly wage category, the employer relies on ostensibly nondiscriminatory data the candidates' seniority and the successful completion of comprehensive tests designed and administered by the employer.  In this employment category, we conclude that the district court's no-discrimination finding has inadequate factual underpinning in the record and should be REVERSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Carbide failed to establish that the qualification exams were \" job related;\" that is, there must be a correlation between test scores and actual job performance.  Crockett v. Green, 388 F.Supp. 912, 919-20 (E.D.Wis.1975).  Additionally, the employer failed to show that the admission standards for its training program were objective and nondiscriminatory.  Because the training programs are a springboard to occupational advancement, the admission standards are clearly relevant to an analysis of the plant's promotional practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Promotion within the ranks of salaried personnel is based upon the supervisors' subjective evaluation of a job candidate, without definite qualification factors being considered in a fixed ratio.  Mr. Garner described the basic process for promoting an hourly wage earner to a salaried supervisory position:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>Q Mr. Garner, would you please describe the process of selecting first line maintenance and production supervisors?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>A When there is a vacancy, an increased need for a first line supervisor in production, the positions are first approved by top management, who in this case would be the Plant Manager . . . . (Then the responsible Production Superintendent requests) his Area Supervisor to evaluate our employees for this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>And the Area Foremen send out memos, or by any means, ask Foremen and Employee Relations Departments, Superintendents and general management to recommend anyone they feel would be qualified for the position.  Evaluations are made . . .  (by) anyone who had the opportunity to evaluate their performance in a Temporary Foreman's job or in a work capacity that they were being considered for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>These evaluations and reports are turned in to the Production Superintendent and in group meetings, we discuss applicants applicants meaning from within the company at this time, we used to go outside and a group decision is reached on who would be the best candidate for the position.  At times, depending on the circumstances, we might choose to have a period of time of several months to try out Temporary Foremen who have not tried out before; or it might be the case that we have already have done this as the year went along and that might not be necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>But, after the compilation of all of the results of the questionnaires or comments and evaluations, then a group decision is made of who is going to be offered that job.  That person is then interviewed, it could be by more than one person, by four managers myself, the Plant Manager, the Engineering and Construction Manager and Mr. Portzer, our Production Manager.  And if all agree that that is the right person for the right job at that time, an offer is made to that individual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Q Then the final decision is made by no one particular person?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>A That is correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The questionnaires and evaluation forms used by Union Carbide require the interviewer's subjective opinion concerning the candidates' \" adaptability,\" \"bearing, demeanor, manner,\" \"verbal expression,\" \" appearance,\" \"maturity,\" \"drive,\" and \"social behavior.\"  Such high-level subjectivity subjects the ultimate promotion decision to the intolerable occurrence of conscious or unconscious prejudice.

Causey v. Ford Motor Co.,516 F.2d 416, 420-21 (5th Cir. 1975).

The ranks of the non-exempt salaried personnel are composed of workers who are not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act and are entitled to overtime compensation.

One is for \"active\" applicants; the other is for \"inactive\" applicants.  The manager of personnel relations, James Garner, described the initial screening process whereby an applicant is placed in either the active or inactive file:</p>\n        <p>Q Will you testify, please, what kind of factors you consider or Mr. Krogen considers when he is making that decision (to classify an application \"active\" or \"inactive\")?</p>\n        <p>A First I would like to say that race is not on the application when we receive it.</p>\n        <p>Q We understand that.</p>\n        <p>A We don't know if it is black or white, or what the case may be.  It does have male or female on the application.  It does have the age and the date of the application.  But when I review an application I just as a matter of routine go down the application because that's the way it was printed, and I don't look for any specific information.  First I just go down to the date of it, whether the person is male or female, the weight, any physical limitations, if they know anybody at the plant, what job they are applying for, educational level, because that's next in line, and then the companies that they worked for, what kind of experience they had, how long they stayed on the job, were there any lapses of time.  And then I turn it over to the rear to see the other experience that he or she had and the kind of work experience under clerical or production that they check off.  And that's about it.</p>\n        <p>Q Okay.  Once a decision is made to put the application in the inactive file how long will your office retain that application form?</p>\n        <p>A Two years.</p>\n        <p>Q Just two years?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>Q Now, if the application is put in the active file First of all if it goes in the active file if the person is not hired as long as his application is in the active file and he is unsuccessful tell us exactly</p>\n        <p>A We haven't established whether we are hiring or not hiring.  Let's say we don't have an opening.  You haven't hired the person because</p>\n        <p>Q Well, assume you hired him.  Do you put his application somewhere else?</p>\n        <p>A It goes in our employee records file.</p>\n        <p>Q So regardless of the status of your hiring process, whether you are interviewing or whether there is vacancies or not, as long as an application is in the active file he is not yet hired?</p>\n        <p>A That's correct.</p>\n        <p>Q Now, you said that you sent some sort of notice to people who had their applications put in the inactive file.  I am going to show you a couple of samples of the letters that you received from your files and ask you to identify for us what these various letters mean?  You don't tell the person when you write him that your application has gone in the inactive file?  You tell him something different?</p>\n        <p>A They should get the idea that they are not being considered for employment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> On direct examination counsel for the appellants attempts to establish the factors considered relevant to an employment decision:</p>\n        <p>Q (W)hat are the factors that you consider most important in reaching your (employment) decision?</p>\n        <p>A I am not sure I can answer that adequately.  For instance, a person should not have had a criminal record.  There are just so many factors I don't know if I could spell out or say that you do not use this factor or do use this factor.  In personnel there are so many factors to use based on each individual's background and experience, and what they want, that I am not sure I can answer that in any meaningful way.</p>\n        <p>Q It is always based on the background and the experience of the interviewer or evaluator</p>\n        <p>A That would leave that person to reach conclusion.  Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>Q So that you really couldn't identify them in concrete terms as if you were preparing an outline or guide of the hiring process?</p>\n        <p>A I guess you could say that's true.</p>\n        <p>Q Based on a whole lot of factors that sort of have been accumulated in your experience as a personnel officer over the years?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>The following testimony describing the attributes of a chemical operator sought to further define the general and perhaps abstract term \"most qualified\":</p>\n        <p>Q What are the qualifications that the company requires of people who apply for or are considered for chemical operators or chemical operator trainees, since they have to go through it?</p>\n        <p>A Well, physically they have to be able to perform the job, because the job is not one routine job.  The jobs rotate, and on one side you might have 8 jobs or 10 jobs and on the other side 10 to 12 jobs and approximately every two weeks you rotate off that job to another job, and many of them are quite laborous tasks involved and takes a person with physical strength to move 300 pound drums or operate forklifts or lift 50 pound bags and things of this nature, so they have to have the physical qualifications to perform the jobs.</p>\n        <p>Q You don't have any absolute physical requirements in terms of weight or size or sex?</p>\n        <p>A No sir.</p>\n        <p>Q Is this a judgment call on the part of the people who are making the decisions?</p>\n        <p>A Based on experience we know that a very tall and skinny person is going to have a time with drums and we know that a really short stocky person might a difficult time raising heavy boxes and it would cause back strain and things like this.  So it is just from experience.</p>\n        <p>Q And you don't give them a medical examination and a physical test to see if they can lift something?</p>\n        <p>A No.</p>\n        <p>Q All right.  What else beside physical qualifications do you require of a chemical operator?</p>\n        <p>A They have to have a mental ability to be able to perform the tasks that are required, that are more complex, due to the technical nature of our plant, and because of the number of jobs they would be operating.  And this you try to some extent to evaluate in an interview, and you can gather this from the past duties they performed on the job to some extent.</p>\n        <p>Q Just the past duties they have had in other jobs, is that what you said, is the way you determine mental ability?</p>\n        <p>A Well, from conversations and just an interviewing technique you try to determine if the person seems to have an aptitude that they could perform the functions.</p>\n        <p>Q Does their formal education count for anything in that evaluation?</p>\n        <p>A That's difficult to say because a person with a sixth grade education we have evaluated scores of the chemical operator trainees, and a person with a sixth grade education might make more than somebody with two years of college, so it is difficult to look at the educational background and try to determine if they are going to make good or bad on it.  So that's why we don't require a high school education.</p>\n        <p>Q But you are not using the aptitude test anymore?</p>\n        <p>A That's right.</p>\n        <p>Q So it is just the interviewer's opinion based on a conversation?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>Q Besides the physical and mental abilities do you have any other kinds of qualifications that you can tell us about?</p>\n        <p>A We would like the person to have a background that would indicate the person would be a stable, dependable employee, and one that would be with us a long time, because it takes quite a period of time to train this individual and we try to make this determination, if the person is going to be with us and be satisfied with a job over an extended period of time.</p>\n        <p>Q How do you make decisions or conclusions about the stability of the person's background?  Tell us how that is done.</p>\n        <p>A We try to look at their employment history to determine how many jobs they had had in the past years; if they had any length of time that is unaccounted for, that you are not sure what the person did during that period of time.  But their past experience is a good indication, I believe, of what they will do in the future.</p>\n        <p>Q * * * (Y)ou did say you have no strict educational minimums such as a high school diploma?</p>\n        <p>A That's correct.</p>\n        <p>Q Do you have any age minimum?</p>\n        <p>A Minimum?  Well, because of the number of applicants we have who we can get that are mature people we don't hire very many people now around the age of 19.  We prefer older people if we can find the people in our active files at that time that are older, more mature people that appear more safety conscious on the job.</p>\n        <p>Q 19 years,  as a general rule, is the cut off?</p>\n        <p>A I guess you could make that general statement.</p>\n        <p>Q Are there any particular kind of prior experience that the company favors towards applicants for chemical operator?</p>\n        <p>A Well, of course, if I can find somebody with chemical operator experience that's great.  If you can find someone with industrial experience, someone that's been on the job several years, shown stability that's good.  But if you find a person that has been working with a service station or with a carpenter or with someone for a good number of years that showed stability you would consider these people also.</p>\n        <p>Q Mr. Garner, why is prior industrial experience considered a desirable qualification?</p>\n        <p>A Well, I guess about the same reason prior legal experience would be good for an attorney.  It would require less training for that person who probably knows already what the job entails, and a clerical type person might get on the job and after six months say, \"The job is not for me, it is too hard.\"  So a person with industrial experience knows what the job calls for.</p>\n        <p>Q * * * (W)hat about the factor of getting along with people well?  Is that an important qualification for people applying at Carbide?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.  Very important.</p>\n        <p>Q And how do you judge whether or not people get along well when they come through your hiring process?</p>\n        <p>A Sometimes not very well.  We will, of course, check references from previous employers.  That's the best way to tell.  Or if they know of people in the plant we can ask that person in their opinion what kind of record this person had, if they know them.  We try to check references.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The qualification test must be \"job related\" or designed to reliably predict whether the applicant possesses the reasonably necessary job skills.

Hiring Practices</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1965 Union Carbide opened a plant in Mobile County, Alabama for the manufacture of \"molecular sieves,\" a product that strains and filters liquid or gaseous molecules.  The work force at the plant is composed primarily of residents in the vicinity of Mobile, Alabama, an area which is approximately 26% black.  When the plant began operations, the work force consisted of 35 whites and 1 black.  Nevertheless, within nine years the plant hired 84 black and 259 white employees.  Furthermore, blacks serve in both salaried and wage-earning positions at the Union Carbide plant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Carbide continually accepts employment applications irrespective of the existence of current vacancies.  The personnel files keep a record of applicants; whenever a position becomes available, the applications from the \"active\" file are reviewed for employment consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  If the files contain an insufficient number of applications, Union Carbide places advertisements in the local newspaper.  Then the plant conducts short screening interviews to determine the applicants' basic vocational interests and to answer any questions relating to the job openings.  Following the initial interview, selected applicants are requested to return for an in-depth interview with three or four other plant employees usually two engineers and one foreman.  The applicant also tours the plant to view the working conditions.  According to Mr. James W. Garner, manager of employee relations, the plant prefers applicants who are \"more likely to be long term Carbide employees (and) who want the kind of work and opportunities that (the plant has) to offer.\"  Three members of the personnel department discuss the qualifications of each applicant and decide which of the applicants are most qualified for the particular job opening.  An offer is then extended to the candidates deemed to be most qualified.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that the Union Carbide hiring practices were discriminatory and violative of the Civil Rights Act, Title VII.  Nevertheless, the employment practices of Union Carbide appear to be fair in form that is, reasonably directed to secure the best qualified candidate for the position available.  Although perhaps fair in form, the hiring and promotional practices must also be fair in operation.  In Rowe v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"302358\"><a href=\"/opinion/302358/4-fair-emplpraccas-445-4-empl-prac-dec-p-7689-jake-rowe-v-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 355 (5th Cir. 1972), Chief Judge Brown stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"It is clearly not enough under Title VII that the procedures utilized by employers are fair in form.  These procedures must in fact be fair in operation.  Likewise, the intent of employers who utilize such discriminatory procedures is not controlling since 'Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.'  Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S.  (424) at 432, 91 S.Ct.  (849) at 854, 28 L.Ed.2d (158) at 165.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>\"It is therefore clear that employment practices which operate to discriminate against people because of their race, color, religion, sex or national origin, violate Title VII, even though the practices are fair on their face and even though the employer had no subjective intention to discriminate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the consequences of Union Carbide's employment practices is thus critical to a disposition of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigants proposed separate methods to analyze the hiring data.  The appellants suggested that the total number of applications filed by black persons is the critical factor to be considered.  Their statistical analysis showed that blacks filed approximately 50% of all applications but secured only 26% of new hourly positions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <pre>-------------------------------------\nYear          Hirees      Applicants\n-------------------------------------\n           Black  White  Black  White\n-------------------------------------\n1971        10        7    572   587\n1972        25       48   1177  1071\n1973        19       68   1114  1018\n-------------------------------------\n    Total   54      123   2863  2676\n-------------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>At least one witness, however, cast suspicion on the reliability of appellants' approach, comparing it to \"trying to measure jellyfish with a rubber band (because) you don't know where all the applicants come from . . .  (and) how many are duplicated.  (S)ome applicants fill six applications a year out.  We have even had three or four in one month from a particular applicant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Carbide, offering an alternative method of analysis, urged that the employment record should be proportionate to the composition of the local work force.  Since 1970 approximately 33% of all employees hired by Union Carbide have been black.  Operating its plant in an area where the labor force is approximately 26% black, Union Carbide presents convincing statistics tending to negate the existence of a discriminatory effect of its hiring practices and procedures:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <pre>-----------------------------------\n   Year         Hirees      % Black\n-----------------------------------\n            Blacks  Whites\n            -----------------------\n1965-1969       37     166    18%\n    1970         5       9    35%\n    1971        10       7    58%\n    1972        25      48    34%\n    1973        19      68    21%\n-----------------------------------\n     Total      96     298    24%\n-----------------------------------</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adopting Union Carbide's method of analysis, the district court concluded that the employer \" . . .  has truly equal access to jobs at its Chickasaw plant by blacks and whites and the Court finds that this has in fact produced an employee population with substantially the same proportion of blacks represented as are in the Mobile area work force.\"  The district court's recognition of the employer's method of analysis as more reliable and indicative of racial discrimination is supported by testimony that appellants' alternative analysis is subject to suspect data, such as the duplication of employment applications.  Additionally, the trial court's finding that Union Carbide's method is more reliable is supported by the practice of other federal courts.  On many occasions federal courts have compared the composition of the company's work force to the composition of the labor force in the surrounding area.  E. g., Jones v. Tri-County Elec.

We conclude that the record presents sufficient underpinnings to support the ultimate finding that Union Carbide did not engage in discriminatory hiring practices.2. Promotional Practices</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even an employer who exhibits nondiscriminatory hiring practices can fall short in its system of promotion, Rowe v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"302358\"><a href=\"/opinion/302358/4-fair-emplpraccas-445-4-empl-prac-dec-p-7689-jake-rowe-v-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 355-59 (5th Cir. 1972) (Brown, C. J.), and that appears to be the situation in the instant case.  Although the employer's affirmative action hiring program has resulted in the employment of blacks in close proportion to the composition of the area labor force, the system of promotion has failed to provide equal access to the most preferred positions at the Chickasaw plant.  For this reason we REVERSE and REMAND on the issue of Union Carbide's promotional practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">( a) System of promotion.  The plant uses a seniority system to promote employees within the rank of \"hourly personnel.\"  When there is an hourly position available, current employees can bid for the job.  The senior employee satisfying the minimum qualifications for the position will secure the job.  According to Mr. Garner, \"(the plant) can't hire anybody outside the plant who makes a high test score or promote a person to that job who makes a higher test score . . . .  (W)e promote the most senior qualified employees.\"  Job candidates demonstrate that they are qualified by passing the examinations prepared and administered by the Employee Relations Manager and a plant foreman or supervisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The plant provides training programs designed to prepare employees for the exams, the passing of which is essential to secure a better hourly wage position.  Thus, assuming the requisite seniority, completion of a training program and passing the company's exam are the keys to advancement within the hourly ranks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of \"non-exempt salaried personnel\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> the system of promotion is somewhat different.  The personnel department posts a notice of the particular job opening and accepts applications for the position.  After the initial screening process, applicants are referred to the department supervisor under whose direction the selected applicant would work.  The ultimate employment decision is made by the responsible department supervisor, with personnel's concurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A third category, \"exempt salaried employees,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> is not derived from job posting or seniority bidding, but is the product of Carbide recruitment.  Chemical engineers and other technical and supervisory personnel, for example, are exempt salaried employees.  To fill the engineering positions Carbide representatives approach the colleges and universities to conduct job interviews.  When the plant hires new foremen, the superintendents and supervisors evaluate all employees in the particular division and select the most qualified individuals for advancement from the hourly wage to salaried positions.  The ultimate decision, however, is not based on uniform procedures or objective standards.  Instead, the selection of one candidate over another depends on highly subjective criteria which shift in importance from case to case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Statistical evidence of racial discrimination.  As mentioned earlier, the original work force at the Chickasaw plant was composed of 35 whites and 1 black.  Six of the 35 whites are presently employed by Union Carbide: one is plant manager, one is an area supervisor, two are first line supervisors, and two are group leaders.  Only the plant manager began his employment in that capacity; the other five white Carbide employees began in low priority wage-earning positions but were promoted through successive promotions.  In contract, the first black employee began as an oiler and is currently a warehouseman; both jobs are low priority wage-earning positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Blacks continue to dominate the ranks of menial employment at Union Carbide's plant in grossly disproportionate numbers.  For example, 40% of the oiler and helper-trade employees are black; blacks constitute only 19.2% of the total work force.

The contrast between the black population of the Mobile area (approximately 28%) and the percentage of blacks in supervisory or salaried positions (below 10%) constitutes a substantial statistical discrepancy and, thus, establishes a prima facie case of unlawful racial discrimination.  After the prima facie case is established, the burden of persuasion shifts to the corporation whereby it must show the statistical discrepancy results from causes other than racial discrimination.

Union Carbide contends that the employment statistics are the result of a nondiscriminatory system of promotion.  For promotion within the hourly wage category, the employer relies on ostensibly nondiscriminatory data the candidates' seniority and the successful completion of comprehensive tests designed and administered by the employer.  In this employment category, we conclude that the district court's no-discrimination finding has inadequate factual underpinning in the record and should be REVERSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Union Carbide failed to establish that the qualification exams were \" job related;\" that is, there must be a correlation between test scores and actual job performance.

Additionally, the employer failed to show that the admission standards for its training program were objective and nondiscriminatory.

(by) anyone who had the opportunity to evaluate their performance in a Temporary Foreman's job or in a work capacity that they were being considered for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>These evaluations and reports are turned in to the Production Superintendent and in group meetings, we discuss applicants applicants meaning from within the company at this time, we used to go outside and a group decision is reached on who would be the best candidate for the position.

That person is then interviewed, it could be by more than one person, by four managers myself, the Plant Manager, the Engineering and Construction Manager and Mr. Portzer, our Production Manager.

The ranks of the non-exempt salaried personnel are composed of workers who are not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act and are entitled to overtime compensation.  Essentially, non-exempt salaried employees are secretaries, technicians and service personnel.  Exempt salaried employees are not protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act and are not entitled to overtime compensation.  They fill supervisory positions such as foremen and superintendents</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Two personnel files are maintained.  One is for \"active\" applicants; the other is for \"inactive\" applicants.  The manager of personnel relations, James Garner, described the initial screening process whereby an applicant is placed in either the active or inactive file:</p>\n        <p>Q Will you testify, please, what kind of factors you consider or Mr. Krogen considers when he is making that decision (to classify an application \"active\" or \"inactive\")?</p>\n        <p>A First I would like to say that race is not on the application when we receive it.</p>\n        <p>Q We understand that.</p>\n        <p>A We don't know if it is black or white, or what the case may be.  It does have male or female on the application.  It does have the age and the date of the application.  But when I review an application I just as a matter of routine go down the application because that's the way it was printed, and I don't look for any specific information.  First I just go down to the date of it, whether the person is male or female, the weight, any physical limitations, if they know anybody at the plant, what job they are applying for, educational level, because that's next in line, and then the companies that they worked for, what kind of experience they had, how long they stayed on the job, were there any lapses of time.  And then I turn it over to the rear to see the other experience that he or she had and the kind of work experience under clerical or production that they check off.  And that's about it.</p>\n        <p>Q Okay.  Once a decision is made to put the application in the inactive file how long will your office retain that application form?</p>\n        <p>A Two years.</p>\n        <p>Q Just two years?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>Q Now, if the application is put in the active file First of all if it goes in the active file if the person is not hired as long as his application is in the active file and he is unsuccessful tell us exactly</p>\n        <p>A We haven't established whether we are hiring or not hiring.  Let's say we don't have an opening.  You haven't hired the person because</p>\n        <p>Q Well, assume you hired him.  Do you put his application somewhere else?</p>\n        <p>A It goes in our employee records file.</p>\n        <p>Q So regardless of the status of your hiring process, whether you are interviewing or whether there is vacancies or not, as long as an application is in the active file he is not yet hired?</p>\n        <p>A That's correct.</p>\n        <p>Q Now, you said that you sent some sort of notice to people who had their applications put in the inactive file.  I am going to show you a couple of samples of the letters that you received from your files and ask you to identify for us what these various letters mean?  You don't tell the person when you write him that your application has gone in the inactive file?  You tell him something different?</p>\n        <p>A They should get the idea that they are not being considered for employment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> On direct examination counsel for the appellants attempts to establish the factors considered relevant to an employment decision:</p>\n        <p>Q (W)hat are the factors that you consider most important in reaching your (employment) decision?</p>\n        <p>A I am not sure I can answer that adequately.  For instance, a person should not have had a criminal record.  There are just so many factors I don't know if I could spell out or say that you do not use this factor or do use this factor.  In personnel there are so many factors to use based on each individual's background and experience, and what they want, that I am not sure I can answer that in any meaningful way.</p>\n        <p>Q It is always based on the background and the experience of the interviewer or evaluator</p>\n        <p>A That would leave that person to reach conclusion.  Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>Q So that you really couldn't identify them in concrete terms as if you were preparing an outline or guide of the hiring process?</p>\n        <p>A I guess you could say that's true.</p>\n        <p>Q Based on a whole lot of factors that sort of have been accumulated in your experience as a personnel officer over the years?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>The following testimony describing the attributes of a chemical operator sought to further define the general and perhaps abstract term \"most qualified\":</p>\n        <p>Q What are the qualifications that the company requires of people who apply for or are considered for chemical operators or chemical operator trainees, since they have to go through it?</p>\n        <p>A Well, physically they have to be able to perform the job, because the job is not one routine job.  The jobs rotate, and on one side you might have 8 jobs or 10 jobs and on the other side 10 to 12 jobs and approximately every two weeks you rotate off that job to another job, and many of them are quite laborous tasks involved and takes a person with physical strength to move 300 pound drums or operate forklifts or lift 50 pound bags and things of this nature, so they have to have the physical qualifications to perform the jobs.</p>\n        <p>Q You don't have any absolute physical requirements in terms of weight or size or sex?</p>\n        <p>A No sir.</p>\n        <p>Q Is this a judgment call on the part of the people who are making the decisions?</p>\n        <p>A Based on experience we know that a very tall and skinny person is going to have a time with drums and we know that a really short stocky person might a difficult time raising heavy boxes and it would cause back strain and things like this.  So it is just from experience.</p>\n        <p>Q And you don't give them a medical examination and a physical test to see if they can lift something?</p>\n        <p>A No.</p>\n        <p>Q All right.  What else beside physical qualifications do you require of a chemical operator?</p>\n        <p>A They have to have a mental ability to be able to perform the tasks that are required, that are more complex, due to the technical nature of our plant, and because of the number of jobs they would be operating.  And this you try to some extent to evaluate in an interview, and you can gather this from the past duties they performed on the job to some extent.</p>\n        <p>Q Just the past duties they have had in other jobs, is that what you said, is the way you determine mental ability?</p>\n        <p>A Well, from conversations and just an interviewing technique you try to determine if the person seems to have an aptitude that they could perform the functions.</p>\n        <p>Q Does their formal education count for anything in that evaluation?</p>\n        <p>A That's difficult to say because a person with a sixth grade education we have evaluated scores of the chemical operator trainees, and a person with a sixth grade education might make more than somebody with two years of college, so it is difficult to look at the educational background and try to determine if they are going to make good or bad on it.  So that's why we don't require a high school education.</p>\n        <p>Q But you are not using the aptitude test anymore?</p>\n        <p>A That's right.</p>\n        <p>Q So it is just the interviewer's opinion based on a conversation?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.</p>\n        <p>Q Besides the physical and mental abilities do you have any other kinds of qualifications that you can tell us about?</p>\n        <p>A We would like the person to have a background that would indicate the person would be a stable, dependable employee, and one that would be with us a long time, because it takes quite a period of time to train this individual and we try to make this determination, if the person is going to be with us and be satisfied with a job over an extended period of time.</p>\n        <p>Q How do you make decisions or conclusions about the stability of the person's background?  Tell us how that is done.</p>\n        <p>A We try to look at their employment history to determine how many jobs they had had in the past years; if they had any length of time that is unaccounted for, that you are not sure what the person did during that period of time.  But their past experience is a good indication, I believe, of what they will do in the future.</p>\n        <p>Q * * * (Y)ou did say you have no strict educational minimums such as a high school diploma?</p>\n        <p>A That's correct.</p>\n        <p>Q Do you have any age minimum?</p>\n        <p>A Minimum?  Well, because of the number of applicants we have who we can get that are mature people we don't hire very many people now around the age of 19.  We prefer older people if we can find the people in our active files at that time that are older, more mature people that appear more safety conscious on the job.</p>\n        <p>Q 19 years,  as a general rule, is the cut off?</p>\n        <p>A I guess you could make that general statement.</p>\n        <p>Q Are there any particular kind of prior experience that the company favors towards applicants for chemical operator?</p>\n        <p>A Well, of course, if I can find somebody with chemical operator experience that's great.  If you can find someone with industrial experience, someone that's been on the job several years, shown stability that's good.  But if you find a person that has been working with a service station or with a carpenter or with someone for a good number of years that showed stability you would consider these people also.</p>\n        <p>Q Mr. Garner, why is prior industrial experience considered a desirable qualification?</p>\n        <p>A Well, I guess about the same reason prior legal experience would be good for an attorney.  It would require less training for that person who probably knows already what the job entails, and a clerical type person might get on the job and after six months say, \"The job is not for me, it is too hard.\"  So a person with industrial experience knows what the job calls for.</p>\n        <p>Q * * * (W)hat about the factor of getting along with people well?  Is that an important qualification for people applying at Carbide?</p>\n        <p>A Yes sir.  Very important.</p>\n        <p>Q And how do you judge whether or not people get along well when they come through your hiring process?</p>\n        <p>A Sometimes not very well.  We will, of course, check references from previous employers.  That's the best way to tell.  Or if they know of people in the plant we can ask that person in their opinion what kind of record this person had, if they know them.  We try to check references.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The qualification test must be \"job related\" or designed to reliably predict whether the applicant possesses the reasonably necessary job skills.
