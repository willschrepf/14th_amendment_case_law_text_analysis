STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       MARTIN, Chief Justice.\n\n\n       When assessing a challenge to the constitutionality of legislation, this Court’s\n\nduty is to determine whether the General Assembly has complied with the\n\nconstitution. If constitutional requirements are met, the wisdom of the legislation is\n\na question for the General Assembly. E.g., In re Hous. Bonds, 307 N.C. 52, 57, 296\n\nS.E.2d 281, 284 (1982). In performing our task, we begin with a presumption that\n\nthe laws duly enacted by the General Assembly are valid. Baker v. Martin, 330 N.C.\n\n331, 334, 410 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1991). North Carolina courts have the authority and\n\nresponsibility to declare a law unconstitutional,1 but only when the violation is plain\n\nand clear. State ex rel. Martin v. Preston, 325 N.C. 438, 449, 385 S.E.2d 473, 478\n\n(1989). Stated differently, a law will be declared invalid only if its unconstitutionality\n\nis demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. Baker, 330 N.C. at 334-35, 410 S.E.2d at\n\n889.\n\n       In this case plaintiffs challenge the Opportunity Scholarship Program, which\n\nallows a small number of students2 in lower-income families to receive scholarships\n\nfrom the State to attend private school.          According to the most recent figures\n\npublished by the Department of Public Instruction, a large percentage of economically\n\n\n\n\n       1 See N.C. Const. art. IV, § 1; Bayard v. Singleton, 1 N.C. 5 (1787) (recognizing the\ncourts’ power of judicial review and declaring unconstitutional an act of the legislature\ninfringing upon the right to a trial by jury).\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\f                                       HART V. STATE\n\n                                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\ndisadvantaged students in North Carolina are not grade level proficient with respect\n\nto the subjects tested on the State’s end-of-year assessments.3 Disagreement exists\n\nas to the innovations and reforms necessary to address this and other educational\n\nissues in our state. Our state and country benefit from the debate between those with\n\ndiffering viewpoints in this quintessentially political dialogue. Such discussions\n\ninform the legislative process. But the role of judges is distinguishable, as we neither\n\nparticipate in this dialogue nor assess the wisdom of legislation.                Just as the\n\nlegislative and executive branches of government are expected to operate within their\n\nconstitutionally defined spheres, so must the courts. See In re Alamance Cty. Court\n\nFacils., 329 N.C. 84, 94, 405 S.E.2d 125, 130 (1991) (“Just as the inherent power of\n\nthe judiciary is plenary within its branch, it is curtailed by the constitutional\n\ndefinition of the judicial branch and the other branches of government.”).4 Our\n\nconstitutionally assigned role is limited to a determination of whether the legislation\n\n\n       2 In the first year of the Opportunity Scholarship Program, 2300 students were\nselected to participate. The average daily membership in our State’s public and charter\nschools is approximately 1.5 million students. N.C. Dep’t of Pub. Instruction, Facts and\nFigures     2012-13,      http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/docs/fbs/resources/data/factsfigures/2012-\n13figures.pdf (last visited July 21, 2015) (reporting a combined average daily membership of\n1,492,793 in public and charter schools during calendar year 2012-13).\n\n       3N.C.

Instruction, 2013-14 School Report Cards, NC School Report\nCards, http://www.ncpublicschools.org/src/ (last visited July 21, 2015).\n\n       4  This foundational principle of constitutional law is well established in North\nCarolina. See N.C. Const. art I, § 6 (“The legislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers\nof the State government shall be forever separate and distinct from each other.”); see also id.\nart. II (describing the legislative sphere of authority); id. art. III (describing the executive\nsphere of authority); id. art.

STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nis plainly and clearly prohibited by the constitution. Because no prohibition in the\n\nconstitution or in our precedent forecloses the General Assembly’s enactment of the\n\nchallenged legislation here, the trial court’s order declaring the legislation\n\nunconstitutional is reversed.\n\n\n                                     *       *       *\n\n\n                                             I\n\n\n      Under the provisions of the Opportunity Scholarship Program,5 the State\n\nEducational Assistance Authority (the Authority) makes applications available each\n\nyear “to eligible students for the award of scholarship grants to attend any nonpublic\n\nschool.” N.C.G.S. § 115C-562.2(a) (2014). An “[e]ligible student” is defined as “a\n\nstudent who has not yet received a high school diploma” and who, in addition to\n\nmeeting other specified criteria, “[r]esides in a household with an income level not in\n\nexcess of one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) of the amount required for the\n\nstudent to qualify for the federal free or reduced-price lunch program.” Id. § 115C-\n\n\n\n\n      5  The Opportunity Scholarship Program was ratified by the General Assembly and\nsigned into law by the Governor in July 2013 as part of the “Current Operations and Capital\nImprovements Appropriations Act of 2013”—the State’s budget bill for fiscal years 2013-14\nand 2014-15. Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 2013, ch.\n360, sec. 8.29, 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws 995, 1064-69. The program was amended in August of\n2014 to its present form, The Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations\nAct of 2014, ch. 100, sec. 8.25, 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws (Reg. Sess. 2014) 328, 371-73, and is\ncodified as amended in Part 2A to Article 39 of Chapter 115C of the General Statutes,\nN.C.G.S. §§ 115C-562.1 through -562.7 (2013 & Supp. 2014).\n\n                                            -5-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n562.1(3) (2013). A “[n]onpublic school” is any school that meets the requirements of\n\neither Part 1 (“Private Church Schools and Schools of Religious Charter”) or Part 2\n\n(“Qualified Nonpublic Schools”) of Article 39 of Chapter 115C of the General Statutes.\n\nId. § 115C-562.1(5) (2013).\n\n\n      The Authority awards scholarships to the program’s applicants, with\n\npreference given first to previous scholarship recipients, and then to students in\n\nlower-income families and students entering kindergarten or the first grade. Id.\n\n§ 115C-562.2(a). Subject to certain restrictions, students selected to participate in\n\nthe program may receive a scholarship grant of up to $4,200 to attend any nonpublic\n\nschool. Id. § 115C-562.2(b) (2014). Once a student has been selected for the program\n\nand has chosen a school to attend, the Authority remits the grant funds to the\n\nnonpublic school for endorsement, and the parent or guardian “restrictively\n\nendorse[s] the scholarship grant funds awarded to the eligible student to the\n\nnonpublic school for deposit into the account of [that] school.” Id. § 115C-562.6 (2013).\n\n\n      A nonpublic school that accepts a scholarship recipient for admission must\n\ncomply with the requirements of N.C.G.S. § 115C-562.5(a), which include:\n\n(1) providing the Authority with documentation of the tuition and fees charged to the\n\nstudent; (2) providing the Authority with a criminal background check conducted on\n\nthe highest ranking staff member at the school; (3) providing the parent or guardian\n\nof the student with an annual progress report, including standardized test scores;\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n(4) administering at least one nationally standardized test or equivalent measure for\n\neach student in grades three or higher that measures achievement in the areas of\n\nEnglish grammar, reading, spelling, and mathematics; (5) providing the Authority\n\nwith graduation rates of scholarship program students; and (6) contracting with a\n\ncertified public accountant to perform a financial review for each school year in which\n\nthe nonpublic school accepts more than $300,000 in scholarship grants. Id. § 115C-\n\n562.5(a)(1)-(6) (2014).     Nonpublic schools enrolling more than twenty-five\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program students must report the aggregate standardized\n\ntest performance of the scholarship students to the Authority. Id. § 115C-562.5(c)\n\n(2014). Furthermore, all nonpublic schools that accept scholarship program students\n\nare prohibited from charging additional fees based on a student’s status as a\n\nscholarship recipient, id. § 115C-562.5(b) (2014), and from discriminating with\n\nrespect to the student’s race, color, or national origin, id. § 115C-562.5(c1) (2014); see\n\nalso 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (2012). Nonpublic schools that fail to comply with these\n\nstatutory requirements are ineligible to participate in the program. N.C.G.S. § 115C-\n\n562.5(d) (2014).\n\n\n      The Opportunity Scholarship Program also subjects the Authority to certain\n\nreporting requirements.      Each year, the Authority must provide demographic\n\ninformation and program data to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight\n\nCommittee. Id. § 115C-562.7(b) (2014). The Authority is also required to select an\n\nindependent research organization to prepare an annual report on “[l]earning gains\n\n                                           -7-\n\f                                       HART V. STATE\n\n                                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nor losses of students receiving scholarship grants” and on the “[c]ompetitive effects\n\non public school performance on standardized tests as a result of the scholarship\n\ngrant program.” Id. § 115C-562.7(c) (2014). Following submission of these reports to\n\nthe Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee and the Department of Public\n\nInstruction, “[t]he Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee shall review\n\n[the] reports from the Authority and shall make ongoing recommendations to the\n\nGeneral Assembly as needed regarding improving administration and accountability\n\nfor nonpublic schools accepting students receiving scholarship grants.” Id.\n\n\n       The Opportunity Scholarship Program is funded by appropriations from\n\ngeneral revenues to the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina,\n\nwhich provides administrative support for the Authority. In fiscal year 2014-15, the\n\nGeneral Assembly appropriated a total of $10,800,000 to the program.\n\n\n                                              II\n\n\n       On 11 December 2013, plaintiff Alice Hart and twenty-four other taxpayers\n\nfiled a complaint in Superior Court, Wake County, challenging the constitutionality\n\nof the Opportunity Scholarship Program under the Constitution of North Carolina.6\n\n\n\n\n       6 Although plaintiffs generally represent a cross section of individuals who currently\ninteract or have previously interacted with our state’s public schools, plaintiffs’ complaint in\nthe present action was made in their capacity as taxpayers of the state.\n\n                                              -8-\n\f                                       HART V. STATE\n\n                                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs’ amended complaint asserted five claims for relief, all of which\n\npresented facial challenges under the North Carolina Constitution. First, plaintiffs\n\nalleged that the Opportunity Scholarship Program “appropriates revenue paid by\n\nNorth Carolina taxpayers to private schools for primary and secondary education” in\n\nviolation of Article IX, Sections 2(1) and 6, and Article I, Section 15. Second, plaintiffs\n\nalleged that the law “appropriates revenue paid by North Carolina taxpayers to\n\nprivate schools for the ostensible purpose of primary and secondary education\n\nwithout those funds being supervised by the Board of Education” in violation of\n\nArticle IX, Section 5. Third, plaintiffs alleged that the law creates “a non-uniform\n\nsystem of schools for primary and secondary education” in violation of Article IX,\n\nSection 2(1). Fourth, plaintiffs alleged that in “transfer[ring] revenue paid by North\n\nCarolina taxpayers to private schools without any accountability or requirements\n\nensuring that students will actually receive an education,” the law “does not\n\naccomplish any public purpose” in violation of Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7). Fifth,\n\nplaintiffs alleged that in “transfer[ring] revenue paid by North Carolina taxpayers to\n\nprivate schools that are permitted to discriminate against students and applicants on\n\nthe basis of race, color, religion, or national origin,”7 the law serves no public purpose\n\nand therefore violates Article V, Section 2(1), and Article I, Section 19. Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n       7 Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning a nonpublic school’s ability to discriminate based\non race, color, or national origin were rendered moot by the passage of N.C.G.S. § 115C-\n562.5(c1). See ch. 100, sec. 8.25(d), 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws (Reg. Sess. 2014) at 371.\n\n                                             -9-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nrequested a declaration that the scholarship program is unconstitutional under the\n\nchallenged provisions, as well as a permanent injunction to prevent implementation\n\nand enforcement of the legislation.\n\n\n       On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court entered an order and\n\nfinal judgment on 28 August 2014, allowing plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment\n\non all claims, denying defendants’ and intervenor-defendants’ motions for summary\n\njudgment,8 and declaring the Opportunity Scholarship Program unconstitutional on\n\nits face. The trial court permanently enjoined implementation of the Opportunity\n\nScholarship Program legislation, including the disbursement of public funds.\n\n\n       Defendants appealed, and this Court, on its own initiative, certified the appeal\n\nfor immediate review prior to a determination in the Court of Appeals.9 For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we reverse the trial court’s order and final judgment declaring the\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program unconstitutional and dissolve the injunction\n\npreventing further implementation and enforcement of the challenged legislation.\n\n\n\n\n       8 For purposes of this opinion, we will refer to defendants and intervenor-defendants\ncollectively as “defendants.”\n\n       We also certified the companion case of Richardson v. State, No. 384A14, for\n       9\n\nimmediate review, which we decide today in a separate opinion.\n\n                                           -10-\n\f                                       HART V.

Accordingly, our review of the\n\nconstitutional questions presented is de novo. Piedmont Triad Reg’l Water Auth. v.\n\nSumner Hills Inc., 353 N.C. 343, 348, 543 S.E.2d 844, 848 (2001); see Craig v. New\n\nHanover Cty. Bd. of Educ., 363 N.C. 334, 337, 678 S.E.2d 351, 354 (2009).\n\n\n      In exercising our de novo review, we apply well-settled principles to assess the\n\nconstitutionality of legislative acts. At the outset, the North Carolina Constitution is\n\nnot a grant of power, but a limit on the otherwise plenary police power of the State.\n\nSee, e.g., Preston, 325 N.C. at 448-49, 385 S.E.2d at 478.

In plaintiffs’ view, however,\n\neven when the General Assembly explicitly intends, as it did here, to appropriate\n\nmoney for educational scholarships to nonpublic schools, the plain text of Article IX,\n\nSection 6 prohibits that option and requires that any and all funds for education be\n\nappropriated exclusively for our public school system.\n\n\n      Entitled “State school fund,” Article IX, Section 6 provides:\n\n                     The proceeds of all lands that have been or hereafter\n             may be granted by the United States to this State, and not\n             otherwise appropriated by this State or the United States;\n             all moneys, stocks, bonds, and other property belonging to\n             the State for purposes of public education; the net proceeds\n             of all sales of the swamp lands belonging to the State; and\n             all other grants, gifts, and devises that have been or\n             hereafter may be made to the State, and not otherwise\n             appropriated by the State or by the terms of the grant, gift,\n             or devise, shall be paid into the State Treasury and,\n             together with so much of the revenue of the State as may\n             be set apart for that purpose, shall be faithfully\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n             appropriated and used exclusively for establishing and\n             maintaining a uniform system of free public schools.\n\nN.C. Const. art. IX, § 6.\n\n\n      The manifest purpose of this section is to protect the “State school fund” in\n\norder to preserve and support the public school system, not to limit the State’s ability\n\nto spend on education generally. Section 6 accomplishes this purpose by identifying\n\nsources of funding for the State school fund and mandating that funds derived by the\n\nState from these sources be “faithfully appropriated for establishing and maintaining\n\nin this State a system of free public schools.” City of Greensboro v. Hodgin, 106 N.C.\n\n182, 186-87, 11 S.E. 586, 587-88 (1890) (quoting a previous version of the provision).\n\nThe first four clauses of Section 6 identify non-revenue sources of funding, two of\n\nwhich appear to be mandatory and two of which appear to be within the discretion of\n\nthe General Assembly to otherwise appropriate as it sees fit. The fifth clause (the\n\nrevenue clause) states that a portion of the State’s revenue “may be set apart for that\n\npurpose”—meaning for the purpose of “establishing and maintaining a uniform\n\nsystem of free public schools.” This clause recognizes that the General Assembly may\n\nchoose to designate a portion of the State’s general tax revenue as an additional\n\nsource of funding for the State school fund.\n\n\n      Thus, within constitutional limits, the General Assembly determines how\n\nmuch of the revenue of the State will be appropriated for the purpose of “establishing\n\nand maintaining a uniform system of free public schools.” Insofar as the General\n\n                                          -14-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nAssembly appropriates a portion of the State’s general revenues for the public schools,\n\nSection 6 mandates that those funds be faithfully used for that purpose. Article IX,\n\nSection 6 does not, however, prohibit the General Assembly from appropriating\n\ngeneral revenue to support other educational initiatives. See Preston, 325 N.C. at\n\n448-49, 385 S.E.2d at 478 (“All power which is not expressly limited by the people in\n\nour State Constitution remains with the people, and an act of the people through\n\ntheir representatives in the legislature is valid unless prohibited by that\n\nConstitution.” (citations omitted)). Because the Opportunity Scholarship Program\n\nwas funded from general revenues, not from sources of funding that Section 6\n\nreserves for our public schools, plaintiffs are not entitled to relief under this provision.\n\n\n       Faithful appropriation and use of educational funds was a very real concern to\n\nthe framers of our constitution. Before the introduction of Article IX, Section 6 in the\n\n1868 Constitution, the Literary Fund, which was devoted to funding public education,\n\nwas routinely threatened to be used during the Civil War to pay for other expenses\n\nand was almost completely depleted by the war’s end. See M.C.S. Noble, A History of\n\nthe Public Schools of North Carolina 242-49, 272 (1930); Milton Ready, The Tar Heel\n\nState: A History of North Carolina 263 (2005). The framers of the 1868 Constitution\n\nsought to constitutionalize the State’s obligation to protect the State school fund. In\n\nso doing, our framers chose not to limit the State from appropriating general revenue\n\nto fund alternative educational initiatives. Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary are\n\nwithout merit.\n\n                                           -15-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      Given our disposition of plaintiffs’ claim under Article IX, Section 6, we agree\n\nwith defendants that plaintiffs are likewise not entitled to relief under Article IX,\n\nSection 5. Under Article IX, Section 5, “[t]he State Board of Education shall supervise\n\nand administer the free public school system and the educational funds provided for\n\nits support.” N.C. Const. art. IX, § 5 (emphasis added). Because public funds may be\n\nspent on educational initiatives outside of the uniform system of free public schools,\n\nplaintiffs’ contention that funding for the Opportunity Scholarship Program should\n\nhave gone to the public schools—and therefore been brought under the supervision\n\nand administration of the State Board of Education—is without merit.\n\n\n      The final issue under Article IX presented by defendants’ appeal is whether\n\nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program legislation violates Article IX, Section 2(1).\n\nUnder Section 2(1), “[t]he General Assembly shall provide by taxation and otherwise\n\nfor a general and uniform system of free public schools, which shall be maintained at\n\nleast nine months in every year, and wherein equal opportunities shall be provided\n\nfor all students.” Id. art. IX, § 2(1). Plaintiffs contend that “[i]f the uniformity clause\n\nhas any substance, it means that the State cannot create an alternate system of\n\npublicly funded private schools standing apart from the system of free public schools\n\nmandated by the Constitution.”\n\n\n      Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Opportunity Scholarship Program is\n\ninaccurate. The Opportunity Scholarship Program legislation does not create “an\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nalternate system of publicly funded private schools.” Rather, this legislation provides\n\nmodest scholarships to lower-income students for use at nonpublic schools of their\n\nchoice. Furthermore, we have previously stated that the uniformity clause requires\n\nthat provision be made for public schools of like kind throughout the state. Wake\n\nCares, Inc. v. Wake Cty. Bd. of Educ., 363 N.C. 165, 171-72, 675 S.E.2d 345, 350\n\n(2009). The uniformity clause applies exclusively to the public school system and\n\ndoes not prohibit the General Assembly from funding educational initiatives outside\n\nof that system. Accordingly, the Opportunity Scholarship Program does not violate\n\nArticle IX, Section 2(1).\n\n\n                                           B\n\n\n      The next question presented by defendants’ appeal is whether the\n\nappropriation of general revenues to fund educational scholarships for lower-income\n\nstudents is for a public purpose under Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7).\n\n\n      Defendants contend that providing lower-income students the opportunity to\n\nattend private school “satisfies the State’s legitimate objective of encouraging the\n\neducation of its citizens.” Defendants maintain that, in satisfying this objective,\n\nappropriations directed to the Opportunity Scholarship Program are made for a\n\npublic purpose. Plaintiffs contend that the program does not accomplish a public\n\npurpose because the program appropriates taxpayer money for educational\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nscholarships to private schools without regard to whether the schools satisfy\n\nsubstantive education standards.\n\n\n      Under Article V, Section 2(1), “[t]he power of taxation shall be exercised in a\n\njust and equitable manner, for public purposes only, and shall never be surrendered,\n\nsuspended, or contracted away.”       N.C. Const. art. V, § 2(1).   Under Article V,\n\nSection 2(7), “[t]he General Assembly may enact laws whereby the State, any county,\n\ncity or town, and any other public corporation may contract with and appropriate\n\nmoney to any person, association, or corporation for the accomplishment of public\n\npurposes only.” Id. art. V, § 2(7). Because “[t]he power to appropriate money from\n\nthe public treasury is no greater than the power to levy the tax which put the money\n\nin the treasury,” we subject both legislative powers to the public purpose\n\nrequirement. Mitchell v. N.C. Indus. Dev. Fin. Auth., 273 N.C. 137, 143, 159 S.E.2d\n\n745, 749-50 (1968).\n\n\n      At the outset, we note that “the fundamental concept underlying the public\n\npurpose doctrine” is that “the ultimate gain must be the public’s, not that of an\n\nindividual or private entity.” Maready v. City of Winston-Salem, 342 N.C. 708, 719,\n\n467 S.E.2d 615, 622 (1996).          Thus, in resolving challenges to legislative\n\nappropriations under the public purpose clause, this Court’s inquiry is discrete—we\n\nask whether the legislative purpose behind the appropriation is public or private. See\n\nid. at 716, 467 S.E.2d at 620-21; Mitchell, 273 N.C. at 144, 159 S.E.2d at 750. If the\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\npurpose is public, then the wisdom, expediency, or necessity of the appropriation is a\n\nlegislative decision, not a judicial decision. See Maready, 342 N.C. at 714, 467 S.E.2d\n\nat 619.    Accordingly, our public purpose analysis does not turn on whether the\n\nappropriation will, in the words of plaintiffs, “accomplish” a public purpose.\n\n\n      Likewise, sustaining a legislative appropriation under the public purpose\n\nclause does not require a concurrent assessment of whether other constitutional\n\ninfirmities exist that might render the legislation unconstitutional. If the challenged\n\nappropriation is constitutionally infirm on other grounds, proper redress is under the\n\napplicable constitutional provisions, not the public purpose clause. Thus, plaintiffs’\n\ncontentions that the Opportunity Scholarship Program runs afoul of Article I,\n\nSections 15 and 19, due to scholarships being remitted to allegedly “unaccountable”\n\nschools or schools that discriminate on the basis of religion, are inapposite to the\n\npublic purpose analysis.11\n\n\n      Our inquiry under Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7), therefore, is whether the\n\nappropriations made by the General Assembly to fund the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram are for a public rather than private purpose. In addressing this question,\n\nwe are mindful of the general proposition articulated by this Court over forty-five\n\nyears ago: “Unquestionably, the education of residents of this State is a recognized\n\n\n\n      11 The independent applicability of Article I, Sections 15 and 19, in this case is\ndiscussed in Part III(C) of our opinion.\n\n                                          -19-\n\f                                    HART V.

Bank of Statesville, 276 N.C. 576, 587, 174 S.E.2d 551,\n\n559 (1970) (citing Jamison v. City of Charlotte, 239 N.C. 682, 696, 80 S.E.2d 904, 914\n\n(1954); Green v. Kitchin, 229 N.C. 450, 455, 50 S.E.2d 545, 549 (1948)).\n\n\n      In determining whether a specific appropriation is for a public purpose, “[t]he\n\nterm ‘public purpose’ is not to be narrowly construed.” Madison Cablevision, Inc. v.\n\nCity of Morganton, 325 N.C. 634, 646, 386 S.E.2d 200, 207 (1989) (citing Briggs v.\n\nCity of Raleigh, 195 N.C. 223, 226, 141 S.E. 597, 599 (1928)). We have also specifically\n\n“declined to ‘confine public purpose by judicial definition[, leaving] “each case to be\n\ndetermined by its own peculiar circumstances as from time to time it arises.” ’ ”\n\nMaready, 342 N.C. at 716, 467 S.E.2d at 620 (alteration in original) (quoting Stanley\n\nv. Dep’t of Conservation & Dev., 284 N.C. 15, 33, 199 S.E.2d 641, 653 (1973)). Indeed,\n\n“[a] slide-rule definition to determine public purpose for all time cannot be\n\nformulated; the concept expands with the population, economy, scientific knowledge,\n\nand changing conditions.” Id. (quoting Mitchell, 273 N.C. at 144, 159 S.E.2d at 750).\n\nAlthough the initial determination of the General Assembly in passing the law is\n\ngiven “great weight” by this Court, Madison Cablevision, 325 N.C. at 644-45, 386\n\nS.E.2d at 206, “the ultimate responsibility for the public purpose determination rests,\n\nof course, with this Court,” id. at 645, 386 S.E.2d at 206. “[T]wo guiding principles\n\nhave been established for determining that a particular undertaking by [the State] is\n\nfor a public purpose: (1) it involves a reasonable connection with the convenience and\n\n                                          -20-\n\f                                     HART V.

Here, the provision of\n\nmonetary assistance to lower-income families so that their children have additional\n\neducational opportunities is well within the scope of permissible governmental action\n\nand is intimately related to the needs of our state’s citizenry.

Bank of Statesville, for example, we\n\napproved the use of revenue bond proceeds to “make loans to meritorious North\n\nCarolinians of slender means” for the purpose of “minimiz[ing] the number of\n\nqualified persons whose education or training is interrupted or abandoned for lack of\n\nfunds.” 276 N.C. at 587, 174 S.E.2d at 559. Observing that “[t]he people of North\n\nCarolina constitute our State’s greatest resource,” we held that “bond proceeds are\n\nused for a public purpose when used to make such loans.” Id.\n\n\n        Similarly, in Hughey v. Cloninger we addressed the legality of an appropriation\n\nmade by the Gaston County Board of Commissioners to a private school for dyslexic\n\nchildren. 297 N.C. 86, 88, 95, 253 S.E.2d 898, 900, 903 (1979). Although we held that\n\nthe Board of Commissioners lacked statutory authority to make such an\n\nappropriation, we stated, albeit in obiter dictum, that had there been statutory\n\nauthority, such an appropriation “would have presented no ‘public purpose’\n\ndifficulties as it is well established that both appropriations and expenditures of\n\npublic funds for the education of the citizens of North Carolina are for a public\n\npurpose.”    Id. at 95, 253 S.E.2d at 903-04.         We therefore conclude that the\n\nappropriations made to the Opportunity Scholarship Program involve a “reasonable\n\nconnection with the convenience and necessity of the [State].” Maready, 342 N.C. at\n\n722, 467 S.E.2d at 624 (quoting Madison Cablevision, 325 N.C. at 646, 386 S.E.2d at\n\n207).\n\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\f                                    HART V.

Assistance Auth., 276 N.C. at 588, 174 S.E.2d at 560 (“[T]he\n\nfact that the individual obtains a private benefit cannot be considered sufficient\n\nground to defeat the execution of ‘a paramount public purpose.’ ” (quoting Clayton v.\n\nKervick, 52 N.J. 138, 155, 244 A.2d 281, 290 (1968))).\n\n\n      The promotion of education generally, and educational opportunity in\n\nparticular, is of paramount public importance to our state.         Indeed, borrowing\n\nlanguage from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, our constitution preserves the ethic\n\nof educational opportunity, declaring that “[r]eligion, morality, and knowledge being\n\nnecessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools, libraries, and\n\nthe means of education shall forever be encouraged.”         N.C.

Accordingly, the appropriations\n\nmade by the General Assembly for the Opportunity Scholarship Program were for a\n\npublic purpose under Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7).\n\n\n                                             C\n\n\n       The next issue presented by defendants’ appeal concerns the independent\n\napplicability, if any, of Article I, Section 15 to plaintiffs’ claims. Article I, Section 15\n\ndeclares: “The people have a right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of\n\nthe State to guard and maintain that right.”               N.C. Const. art. I, § 15.   This\n\nconstitutional provision states a general proposition concerning the right to the\n\nprivilege of education, the substance of which is detailed in Article IX. Article I,\n\nSection 15 is not an independent restriction on the State. See generally John V. Orth\n\n& Paul Martin Newby, The North Carolina State Constitution 62-63 (2d ed. 2013).\n\n\n       Plaintiffs rely on Article I, Section 15 and Leandro v. State, 346 N.C. 336, 488\n\nS.E.2d 249 (1997), a case challenging the adequacy of public school funding, for the\n\nproposition that “public funds spent for education must go to institutions that will\n\nprovide meaningful educational services—specifically, to institutions with a\n\nsufficient curriculum and competent teachers.” Because the Opportunity Scholarship\n\n                                           -24-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nProgram legislation does not require that participating nonpublic schools meet the\n\nsound basic education standard announced in Leandro, 346 N.C. at 347, 488 S.E.2d\n\nat 255, or impose regulatory standards approximating those placed on our public\n\nschools in Chapter 115C of the General Statutes, plaintiffs contend that the\n\nscholarship program accomplishes no public purpose and is constitutionally\n\ninadequate.12\n\n\n      As stated above, Article I, Section 15 has no effect on our disposition with\n\nrespect to plaintiffs’ public purpose claim. In its order and final judgment, however,\n\nthe trial court purported to grant independent relief to plaintiffs under Article I,\n\nSection 15, concluding that the Opportunity Scholarship Program legislation fails to\n\n“ ‘guard and maintain’ the right of the people to the privilege of education” by\n\n“appropriating taxpayer funds to educational institutions that are not required to\n\nmeet educational standards” and by “expending public funds so that children can\n\nattend private schools.” To the extent that plaintiffs rely on Article I, Section 15 as\n\n\n\n\n      12 Plaintiffs acknowledge that at least some nonpublic schools may be able to provide\nscholarship students a meaningful education. Even so, plaintiffs contend that “[t]he State\nhas an affirmative obligation to ensure that public funds are used to accomplish a public\npurpose” and that, without built-in accountability standards, the State cannot ensure that\nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program will accomplish its intended purposes as to each\nscholarship recipient. In making this argument, plaintiffs would require the State to\ndemonstrate that the program operates constitutionally in all circumstances, rather than\naccepting the burden of showing that there is no set of circumstances under which the law\ncould operate in a constitutional manner.\n\n                                           -25-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nan independent basis of relief, we agree with defendants that such reliance is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n\n      It is axiomatic that the responsibility Leandro places on the State to deliver a\n\nsound basic education has no applicability outside of the education delivered in our\n\npublic schools. In Leandro we stated that a public school education that “does not\n\nserve the purpose of preparing students to participate and compete in the society in\n\nwhich they live and work is devoid of substance and is constitutionally inadequate.”\n\n346 N.C. at 345, 488 S.E.2d at 254. We concluded that “Article I, Section 15 and\n\nArticle IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution combine to guarantee every\n\nchild of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public\n\nschools.” Id. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255 (emphases added). Thus, Leandro does not\n\nstand for the proposition that Article I, Section 15 independently restricts the State\n\noutside of the public school context.\n\n\n      Furthermore, our constitution specifically envisions that children in our state\n\nmay be educated by means outside of the public school system. See N.C. Const.\n\nart. IX, § 3 (“The General Assembly shall provide that every child of appropriate age\n\nand of sufficient mental and physical ability shall attend the public schools, unless\n\neducated by other means.” (emphasis added)); see also Delconte, 313 N.C. at 385, 400-\n\n01, 329 S.E.2d at 638, 646-47 (concluding that home school instruction did not violate\n\ncompulsory attendance statutes and noting that a contrary holding would raise a\n\n\n                                          -26-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nserious constitutional question under the North Carolina Constitution). Thus, even\n\nif Article I, Section 15 could serve as an independent basis of relief, there is no merit\n\nin the argument that a legislative program designed to increase educational\n\nopportunity in our state is one that fails to “guard and maintain” the “right to the\n\nprivilege of education.”\n\n\n      The final issue presented by defendants’ appeal concerns plaintiffs’ Article I,\n\nSection 19 religious discrimination claim. Article I, Section 19 declares, in pertinent\n\npart, “[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any\n\nperson be subjected to discrimination by the State because of race, color, religion, or\n\nnational origin.” N.C. Const. art. I, § 19 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs couch their\n\nreligious discrimination claim, both for justiciability purposes and with respect to the\n\nmerits of the claim, in terms of the public purpose doctrine. In short, plaintiffs\n\ncontend that the Opportunity Scholarship Program accomplishes no public purpose\n\nbecause it allows funding for educational scholarships to schools that may\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of religion. Again, our analysis of the public purpose\n\ndoctrine made clear that Article I, Section 19, like Article I, Section 15, has no effect\n\non our disposition with respect to plaintiffs’ public purpose claim.\n\n\n      With respect to the independent applicability of Article I, Section 19 as a stand-\n\nalone claim, defendants have maintained throughout this litigation that such a claim\n\nis not justiciable in this case because plaintiffs, as taxpayers of the state, lack\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nstanding. Specifically, defendants contend that plaintiffs have suffered no injury in\n\nfact because they are not in the class of persons against which the program allegedly\n\ndiscriminates. We agree and therefore hold that plaintiffs’ Article I, Section 19 claim\n\nmust be dismissed.\n\n\n      Generally, “a taxpayer has standing to bring an action against appropriate\n\ngovernment officials for the alleged misuse or misappropriation of public funds.”\n\nGoldston v. State, 361 N.C. 26, 33, 637 S.E.2d 876, 881 (2006). Yet, “[a] taxpayer, as\n\nsuch, does not have standing to attack the constitutionality of any and all legislation.”\n\nNicholson v. State Educ. Assistance Auth., 275 N.C. 439, 447, 168 S.E.2d 401, 406\n\n(1969) (citations omitted). “[A] person who is seeking to raise the question as to the\n\nvalidity of a discriminatory statute has no standing for that purpose unless he belongs\n\nto the class which is prejudiced by the statute.” In re Martin, 286 N.C. 66, 75, 209\n\nS.E.2d 766, 773 (1974) (quoting 16 Am. Jur. 2d Constitutional Law § 123 (1964)).\n\nHere plaintiffs are taxpayers of the state, not eligible students alleged to have\n\nsuffered religious discrimination as a result of the admission or educational practices\n\nof a nonpublic school participating in the Opportunity Scholarship Program. Because\n\neligible students are capable of raising an Article I, Section 19 discrimination claim\n\non their own behalf should the circumstances warrant such action, plaintiffs have no\n\nstanding to assert a direct discrimination claim on the students’ behalf.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f                                   HART V. STATE\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n                                          IV\n\n\n      “The General Assembly has the right to experiment with new modes of dealing\n\nwith old evils, except as prevented by the Constitution.” Redev. Comm’n v. Sec. Nat’l\n\nBank of Greensboro, 252 N.C. 595, 612, 114 S.E.2d 688, 700 (1960); see also New State\n\nIce Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311, 52 S. Ct. 371, 386-87 (1932) (Brandeis &\n\nStone, JJ., dissenting) (indicating that an individual state may serve as a laboratory\n\nof democracy and experiment with new legislation in order to meet changing social\n\nand economic needs).    In this case the General Assembly seeks to improve the\n\neducational outcomes of children in lower-income families. The mode selected by the\n\nGeneral Assembly to effectuate this policy objective is the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram.\n\n\n      When, as here, the challenged legislation comports with the constitution, the\n\nwisdom of the enactment is a decision for the General Assembly. As this Court has\n\npreviously recognized, “[i]t may be that the measure may prove eventually to be a\n\ndisappointment, and is ill advised, but the wisdom of the enactment is a legislative\n\nand not a judicial question.” Sec. Nat’l Bank of Greensboro, 252 N.C. at 612, 114\n\nS.E.2d at 700. To the extent that plaintiffs disagree with the General Assembly’s\n\neducational policy decision as expressed in the Opportunity Scholarship Program,\n\ntheir remedy is with the legislature, not the courts. Our review is limited to a\n\ndetermination of whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that the program legislation\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\f                                    HART V.

Accordingly, the trial court erred in declaring the Opportunity\n\nScholarship Program unconstitutional. We therefore reverse the trial court’s order\n\nand final judgment.\n\n\n      REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n      Justice HUDSON dissenting.\n\n\n\n      Because the Opportunity Scholarship Program provides for the spending of\n\ntaxpayer money on private schools without incorporating any standards for\n\ndetermining whether students receive a sound basic—or indeed, any—education, I\n\nconclude that the program violates the North Carolina Constitution in two respects.\n\nAs a result, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n      First, the Opportunity Scholarship Program (also known as the “voucher\n\nprogram”) violates the requirements of Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7) that public\n\nfunds be spent for public purposes only. “The power of taxation shall be exercised in\n\na just and equitable manner, for public purposes only, and shall never be\n\nsurrendered, suspended, or contracted away.” N.C. Const. art. V, § 2(1). Additionally,\n\n“[t]he General Assembly may enact laws whereby the State, any county, city or town,\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                 HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nand any other public corporation may contract with and appropriate money to any\n\nperson, association, or corporation for the accomplishment of public purposes only.”\n\nId. § 2(7). Second, in so doing, the spending authorized under the voucher program\n\nalso violates Article I, Section 15, which states: “The people have a right to the\n\nprivilege of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that\n\nright.” Id. art. I, § 15.\n\n       In its order the trial court includes the following among the “Undisputed\n\nMaterial Facts”:\n\n              4.     Private schools that receive scholarship funds are (1)\n              not required to be accredited by the State Board of\n              Education or any other state or national institution; (2) not\n              required to employ teachers or principals who are licensed\n              or have any particular credentials, degrees, experience, or\n              expertise in education; (3) not subject to any requirements\n              regarding the curriculum that they teach; (4) not required\n              to provide a minimum amount of instructional time; and\n              (5) not prohibited from discriminating against applicants\n              or students on the basis of religion. See N.C. Gen. Stat. §\n              115C-562.1 et seq.\n\n                      ....\n\n              6.    Of the 5,556 scholarship applicants, 3,804\n              applicants identified 446 private schools they planned to\n              attend. Of those 446 schools, 322 are religious schools and\n              117 are independent schools. Of the 322 religious schools\n              scholarship recipients planned to attend, 128 are\n              accredited by some organization and 194 are not accredited\n              by any organization. Of the 117 independent schools\n              scholarship recipients planned to attend, 58 are accredited\n              by some organization and 59 are not accredited by any\n              organization.\n\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\f                                   HART V.

The Court concludes from the record beyond a\n             reasonable doubt that the [Opportunity Scholarship\n             Program] Legislation funds private schools with taxpayer\n             dollars as an alternative to the public school system in\n             direct contravention of Article [I], Section[ ] 15 . . . and\n             Article V, Sections 2(1) and (7) of the North Carolina\n             Constitution. The legislation unconstitutionally\n\n                   ....\n\n                   b.     appropriates public funds for education in a\n                   manner that does not accomplish a public purpose,\n                   in violation of Article V, Sections 2(1) and (7), in\n                   particular by appropriating funds to private primary\n                   and secondary schools without regard to whether\n                   these schools satisfy substantive educational\n                   standards: appropriating taxpayer funds to\n                   unaccountable schools does not accomplish a public\n                   purpose;\n\n                   ....\n\n                   e.      fails to “guard and maintain” the right of the\n                   people to the privilege of education in violation of\n                   Article I, Section 15 by appropriating taxpayer funds\n                   to educational institutions that are not required to\n                   meet educational standards, including curriculum\n                   and requirements that teachers and principals be\n                   certified[.]\n\n                   ....\n\n             4.    The General Assembly fails the children of North\n             Carolina when they are sent with taxpayer money to\n             private schools that have no legal obligation to teach them\n             anything.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nAs noted above, these facts are undisputed, and in my view, these conclusions are\n\ncorrect.\n\n      In Madison Cablevision, Inc. v. City of Morganton this Court articulated a two-\n\npart test for determining if a spending statute complies with the requirements of the\n\nNorth Carolina Constitution as found in Article V, Section 2(1), which is quoted above\n\nand known as the “public purpose” clause. 325 N.C. 634, 646, 386 S.E.2d 200, 207\n\n(1989). As noted by the majority, while “[t]he initial responsibility for determining\n\nwhat is and what is not a public purpose rests with the legislature” and “its\n\ndeterminations are entitled to great weight,” “the ultimate responsibility for the\n\npublic purpose determination rests, of course, with this Court.” Id. at 644-45, 386\n\nS.E.2d at 206 (internal citations omitted). Further, in Stanley v. Department of\n\nConservation and Development this Court articulated the following principle\n\nregarding public purpose expenditures: “In determining what is a public purpose the\n\ncourts look not only to the ends sought to be attained but also ‘to the means to be\n\nused.’ ” 284 N.C. 15, 34, 199 S.E.2d 641, 653 (1973) (citations omitted), abrogated in\n\npart on other grounds by Madison Cablevision, 325 N.C. at 647-48, 386 S.E.2d at 208,\n\nand superseded by constitutional amendment, N.C. Const. art V, §§ 2(7), 9. Therefore,\n\nI conclude that the majority’s assertion that “our public purpose analysis does not\n\nturn on whether the appropriation will . . . ‘accomplish’ a public purpose” is contrary\n\nto our precedent.   It is precisely this determination that we are called upon to\n\nundertake here. To that end, this Court has articulated “[t]wo guiding principles” for\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                 HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\ndetermining whether an expenditure of tax funds is for a public purpose. Madison\n\nCablevision, 325 N.C. at 646, 386 S.E.2d at 207 (citations omitted) (involving\n\noperation of a public enterprise by a municipality). A governmental expenditure\n\nsatisfies the public purpose clause if: “(1) it involves a reasonable connection with the\n\nconvenience and necessity of the particular [jurisdiction], and (2) the activity benefits\n\nthe public generally, as opposed to special interests or persons.” Id.\n\n      Defendants assert, and I agree with the majority, that our courts have long\n\nheld that education generally serves a public purpose.              See, e.g., State Educ.\n\nAssistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, 276 N.C. 576, 587, 174 S.E.2d 551, 559 (1970)\n\n(“Unquestionably, the education of residents of this State is a recognized object of\n\nState government.     Hence, provision therefor is for a public purpose.” (citations\n\nomitted)). I further agree with the majority that, in principle, “the provision of\n\nmonetary assistance to lower-income families so that their children have greater\n\neducational opportunities is well within the scope of permissible governmental action\n\nand is intimately related to the needs of our state’s citizenry.”\n\n      Nonetheless, I cannot agree that the spending of taxpayer funds on private\n\nschool education through the Opportunity Scholarship Program here serves “public\n\npurposes only” as our constitution requires. N.C. Const. art. V, § 2(1). In Leandro v.\n\nState this Court concluded that “the right to education provided in the state\n\nconstitution is a right to a sound basic education. An education that does not serve\n\nthe purpose of preparing students to participate and compete in the society in which\n\n                                          -34-\n\f                                   HART V. STATE\n\n                                HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nthey live and work is devoid of substance and is constitutionally inadequate.” 346\n\nN.C. 336, 345, 488 S.E.2d 249, 254 (1997). We went on to say in Hoke County Board\n\nof Education v. State that a sound basic education should include an “effective\n\ninstructional program” taught by “competent, certified, well-trained” teachers and led\n\nby “well-trained competent” principals. 358 N.C. 605, 636, 599 S.E.2d 365, 389\n\n(2004). Admittedly, this is the standard we have set for our public schools, not our\n\nprivate ones, and it is conceivable that we would set a less comprehensive substantive\n\nstandard for private schools. However, a large gap opens between Leandro-required\n\nstandards and no standards at all, which is what we have here. When taxpayer\n\nmoney is used, the total absence of standards cannot be constitutional.\n\n      Before the legislature created the Opportunity Scholarship Program, taxpayer\n\nmoney had not been used to directly finance any part of a private school education.\n\nThe expenditure of public taxpayer funds brings the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram squarely within the requirements of Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7). As\n\nthe trial court noted, the schools that may receive Opportunity Scholarship Program\n\nmoney have no required teacher training or credentials and no required curriculum\n\nor other means of measuring whether the education received by students at these\n\nschools prepares them “to participate and compete in the society in which they live\n\nand work.” Leandro, 346 N.C. at 345, 488 S.E.2d at 254. As we have observed in\n\nState Education Assistance Authority v. Bank of Statesville, “[t]he people of North\n\nCarolina constitute our State’s greatest resource.” 276 N.C. at 587, 174 S.E.2d at\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                 HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\n559.   Educating our citizens plants the seeds for their participation, and when we\n\nare able to reap the rewards of having an educated citizenry, we can see that our\n\npeople are our greatest resource. See, e.g., Saine v. State, 210 N.C. App. 594, 604-05,\n\n709 S.E.2d 379, 388 (2011) (“Educating North Carolinians certainly promotes the\n\nwelfare of our State, particularly at a time when unemployment is high and many\n\njobs that have historically not required education beyond a high school diploma, or\n\nits equivalent, are rapidly disappearing.”). Therefore, while students enrolled in\n\nprivate schools may be receiving a fine education, if taxpayer money is spent on a\n\nprivate school education that does not prepare them to function in and to contribute\n\nto our state’s society, that spending cannot be for “public purposes only.” In my view,\n\nspending on private schools through the Opportunity Scholarship Program, which\n\nincludes no means to measure the quality of the education, cannot satisfy the second\n\nprong of the Madison Cablevision test. The main constitutional flaw in this program\n\nis that it provides no framework at all for evaluating any of the participating schools’\n\ncontribution to public purposes; such a huge omission is a constitutional black hole\n\ninto which the entire program should disappear.\n\n       I am not persuaded by any of defendants’ arguments that the program, as\n\ncreated, contains standards that are constitutionally relevant or adequate.\n\nDefendants assert that “layers” of accountability standards are built into the\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program. I find none of these arguments convincing. First,\n\ndefendants argue that the “educational marketplace” will regulate the quality of the\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                 HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\neducation provided by participating schools. Defendants assert that parents will not\n\nsend their children to schools that do not provide a solid education or adequately\n\nprepare students for college or beyond. This may be true, but marketplace standards\n\nare not a measure of constitutionality. To the contrary, this Court must insulate\n\nconstitutional standards from the whims of the marketplace. See Maready v. City of\n\nWinston-Salem, 342 N.C. 708, 739, 467 S.E.2d 615, 634 (1996) (Orr, J., dissenting)\n\n(“While economic times have changed and will continue to change, the philosophy\n\nthat constitutional interpretation and application are subject to the whims of\n\n‘everybody’s doing it’ cannot be sustained.”).\n\n      In a related argument, both intervenor legislative officers and intervenor\n\nparents contend that, because parents choose the private schools, the program is\n\n“directly accountable to the parents.” This argument serves only to underscore that\n\nthe program serves the private interests of the particular families and not the public\n\ngood. While families are surely entitled to choose schools for their children according\n\nto their interests, a program like the Opportunity Scholarship Program that spends\n\ntaxpayer money must, to be constitutional, serve “public purposes only.”\n\n      Second, defendants look to the statutory requirements governing all private\n\nand nonpublic schools in North Carolina. These standards relate to attendance,\n\nhealth, and safety, and also require standardized testing at certain intervals. See\n\nN.C.G.S. §§ 115C-547 to -562 (2013).        Here, however, we are not considering\n\nstandards for private schools that receive no public funding. Those schools are not\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\ngoverned by the same constitutional requirements as schools receiving public\n\nfunding; they need not serve “public purposes only.”         When considering these\n\nstatutory standards in a public purpose context, it is clear that they do not help\n\nmeasure whether the students enrolled are receiving an education that prepares\n\nthem to function in our state’s society. Even the requirement regarding standardized\n\ntesting falls short: that provision simply mandates that all private schools\n\n“administer, at least once in each school year, a nationally standardized test . . . to\n\nall students enrolled or regularly attending grades three, six, and nine.” Id. § 115C-\n\n549; see also id. § 115C-557. A similar testing requirement exists for eleventh grade\n\nstudents. Id. § 115C-550; see also id. § 115C-558. These testing standards do not\n\nspecify that students take any particular test, nor do they require any minimum\n\nresult. When a wide range of testing options are available and administered, it can\n\nbe difficult to compare results across schools (a tool which is regularly used to\n\ndetermine the efficacy of our public schools). While the regulations governing private\n\nschools do require comparisons with public school populations, these provisions\n\nimpose no consequences, regardless of test results. Moreover, the standards require\n\nno accreditation of schools and no particular training or certification of teachers. As\n\na result, these standards fail to ensure that spending on these schools through public\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program funds is for any public purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\f                                   HART V. STATE\n\n                                HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\n      Third, defendants point to statutes regulating schools participating in the\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program. In addition to the above requirements for private\n\nand nonpublic schools, schools wishing to participate in the program must also:\n\n            (1) Provide to the [State Education Assistance] Authority\n                documentation for required tuition and fees charged to\n                the student by the nonpublic school.\n\n            (2) Provide to the Authority a criminal background check\n                conducted for the staff member with the highest\n                decision-making authority, as defined by the bylaws,\n                articles of incorporation, or other governing document,\n                to ensure that person has not been convicted of any\n                crime listed in G.S. 115C-332.\n\n            (3) Provide to the parent or guardian of an eligible student,\n                whose tuition and fees are paid in whole or in part with\n                a scholarship grant, an annual written explanation of\n                the student’s progress, including the student’s scores on\n                standardized achievement tests.\n\n            (4) Administer, at least once in each school year, a\n               nationally standardized test or other nationally\n               standardized equivalent measurement selected by the\n               chief administrative officer of the nonpublic school to all\n               eligible students whose tuition and fees are paid in\n               whole or in part with a scholarship grant enrolled in\n               grades three and higher. The nationally standardized\n               test or other equivalent measurement selected must\n               measure achievement in the areas of English grammar,\n               reading, spelling, and mathematics. Test performance\n               data shall be submitted to the Authority by July 15 of\n               each year. Test performance data reported to the\n               Authority under this subdivision is not a public record\n               under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.\n\n            (5) Provide to the Authority graduation rates of the\n               students receiving scholarship grants in a manner\n               consistent with nationally recognized standards.\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\f                                       HART V. STATE\n\n                                    HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\n\n              (6) Contract with a certified public accountant to perform a\n                  financial review, consistent with generally accepted\n                  accounting principles, for each school year in which the\n                  school accepts students receiving more than three\n                  hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in scholarship\n                  grants awarded under this Part.\n\nId. § 115C-562.5(a) (2014). Like the standards referenced above for private schools\n\nin general, none of these additional requirements relates to the quality of education\n\nreceived by enrolled students. Simply mandating that a report card be sent home to\n\nparents provides no guarantee that the education received is sufficient. And the same\n\nproblems exist as articulated above regarding the requirements to administer\n\nstandardized tests.\n\n       Finally, defendants point out the Opportunity Scholarship Program is required\n\nby statute to report to the General Assembly.            Under Section 115C-562.7, the\n\nprogram’s overseers must report annually to the legislature specific administrative\n\nstatistics (relating to enrollment numbers, student demographics, and funds\n\nreceived), as well as “[l]earning gains or losses of students receiving scholarship\n\ngrants.” Id. § 115C-562.7 (2014). While the data will allow the legislature insight\n\ninto   the   successes   of   the   program,    such    reporting   does   not   determine\n\nconstitutionality. First, the legislature is under no obligation to act on the reports.\n\nSecond, as we held long ago in Madison Cablevision, it is ultimately up to this Court\n\nto determine if public spending serves a public purpose. 325 N.C. at 644-45, 386\n\nS.E.2d at 206. Legislative oversight does not automatically make a controversial\n\n\n                                            -40-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                  HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nprogram constitutional, particularly when, as here, the law creating and governing\n\nthe program mandates no action.\n\n      Defendants themselves admit that the program lacks the standards outlined\n\nin Hoke County for the employment of certified teachers and principals and for\n\ncurriculum. Hoke Cty. Bd. of Educ., 358 N.C. at 636, 599 S.E.2d at 389. Despite this\n\nconcession, they argue that because this is a facial challenge to the statute, plaintiffs\n\nmust show that the program is unconstitutional under all conceivable facts and\n\ncircumstances. See, e.g., Martin v. N.C. Hous. Corp., 277 N.C. 29, 44, 175 S.E.2d 665,\n\n673 (1970). To that end, defendants argue that even if substantive standards were\n\nrequired under our state constitution, some of the participating private schools would\n\nmeet those standards.      This argument falls short, however, because our state\n\nconstitution mandates that every child obtaining an education paid for by public\n\nfunds receive an education that prepares him to succeed in society, and because we\n\nare analyzing the statutory framework of the program, not the merits of a specific\n\nschool. N.C. Const. art. I, § 15; id. art. IX, § 2(1); Leandro, 346 N.C. at 351, 488 S.E.2d\n\nat 257 (concluding that our state constitution “requires that all children have the\n\nopportunity for a sound basic education” (emphasis added)). While I acknowledge\n\nthat “[w]e seldom uphold facial challenges because it is the role of the legislature,\n\nrather than this Court, to balance disparate interests and find a workable\n\ncompromise among them,” it is important to remember that we must also “measure\n\nthe balance struck in the statute against the minimum standards required by the\n\n\n                                           -41-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nconstitution.” Beaufort Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Beaufort Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 363 N.C.\n\n500, 502, 681 S.E.2d 278, 280-81 (2009) (citation omitted). Here those minimum\n\nstandards require that children receiving a publicly funded education obtain an\n\neducation that serves a public purpose. The statute at issue here creates a program\n\nthat fails to incorporate any requirement to determine, much less ensure, that any,\n\nlet alone all, children enrolled are receiving a real education; as such, the statute\n\ncannot survive a facial challenge.\n\n       Private schools are free to provide whatever education they deem fit within\n\nthe governing statutes’ requirements. When parents send their children to any\n\nprivate school of their choosing on their own dime, as they are free to do, that\n\neducation need not satisfy our constitutional demand that it be a for a public purpose.\n\nHowever, when public funds are spent to enable a private school education, that\n\nspending must satisfy the public purpose clause of our constitution by preparing\n\nstudents to contribute to society. Without meaningful standards meant to ensure\n\nthat this or any minimum threshold is met, public funds cannot be spent\n\nconstitutionally through this Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n\n      As stated above, I would not necessarily impose the same detailed\n\nrequirements on our private schools receiving public funds as are imposed on purely\n\npublic schools by Leandro and its progeny. I do conclude that such spending must\n\ninclude some standards by which to measure compliance with the public purpose\n\ndoctrine; the complete lack of any such standards in North Carolina’s voucher\n\n\n                                         -42-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                   HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nprogram makes determining such compliance impossible. It is instructive that all\n\nother states that have adopted similar programs have included substantive\n\nrequirements.     Although other states certainly are not bound by constitutional\n\nobligations identical to ours, examining their similar programs and the substantive\n\nstandards imposed on participating schools exposes the woeful lack of oversight in\n\nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program here. For example, compared with ten similar\n\nprograms across the country, North Carolina’s program falls painfully short. As\n\nopposed to other jurisdictions’ legislative requirements for participating private\n\nschools in the categories of state approval or accreditation, state-required curriculum,\n\nrequired teacher qualifications, required participation in a state testing program, and\n\nrequired number of instructional days or hours, the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram fails to incorporate any of those mandates. In comparison, six of the ten\n\nother jurisdictions have requirements in all those areas; nine out of ten have\n\nrequirements in at least four of the five areas; and all ten have requirements in at\n\nleast one of these areas.13 For example, in Indiana (which has the largest state wide\n\nvoucher program in the country), participating schools must be accredited, Ind. Code.\n\n§ 20-51-1-6(a)(3) (2010); Ind. Code. Ann. § 20-51-1-4.7(4) (West 2013), and must teach\n\nsubjects prescribed by the State, Ind. Code. Ann. § 20-51-4-1(f)(9) (West 2011). These\n\n\n\n\n       13 According to the brief filed by amici curiae Education Scholars, the other\njurisdictions include Arizona, Cleveland, the District of Columbia, Indiana, Louisiana,\nMaine, Milwaukee, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin.\n\n                                            -43-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                 HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nschools must participate in state wide testing. Id. § 20-51-1-4.7(5) (West 2013). In\n\nLouisiana participating schools must be approved by a state board, and approval is\n\ncontingent on a showing that the quality of the curriculum is at least as high as that\n\nmandated for similarly situated public schools. La. Stat. Ann. § 17:11 (2001); id. §\n\n17:4021(A) (West Supp. 2012). Even in Arizona, the least regulated jurisdiction\n\nbehind North Carolina identified by amici, participating schools must educate\n\nstudents in reading, grammar, math, social studies, and science.        Ariz. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 15-2402(B)(1) (West Supp. 2011). As summarized above, North Carolina’s\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program lacks any kind of substantive oversight,\n\ncurriculum standards, or instructional requirements.          Schools receiving public\n\nfunding through the program are essentially free to employ whomever they desire to\n\nteach whatever they desire. This is a perfectly acceptable scheme for truly private\n\nschools, but it fails utterly to satisfy the constitutionally mandated educational\n\nstandards required when public funds are spent on education.\n\n      This failure brings me to the second constitutional flaw in the Opportunity\n\nScholarship Program: the breach of the State’s duty to guard and maintain the right\n\nto the privilege of education as set forth in Article I, Section 15, which is part of our\n\nconstitution’s Declaration of Rights. Notwithstanding this constitutional provision’s\n\nclear statement that the people of our State have “a right to . . . education” and that\n\nit is the State’s duty “to guard and maintain that right,” N.C. Const. art. I, § 15, the\n\nmajority indicates that this constitutional provision merely states a “general\n\n\n                                          -44-\n\f                                    HART V.

The majority has not, however,\n\ncited any decision from this Court in support of this proposition, and I believe the\n\nmajority’s assertion is inconsistent with this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.\n\n      In Leandro this Court concluded that Article I, Section 15 and Article IX,\n\nSection 2 of the North Carolina Constitution worked together in combination to\n\n“guarantee every child of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education\n\nin our public schools.” 346 N.C. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255. In other words, this Court\n\ngave Article I, Section 15, considered in conjunction with other constitutional\n\nprovisions, substantive effect. As such, the plain language of Article I, Section 15 and\n\nthis Court’s decision in Leandro regarding the interplay between Article I, Section 15\n\nand Article IX, Section 2 makes me unable to accept the majority’s statements\n\nregarding the substantive import of this constitutional provision. See John V. Orth\n\n& Paul Martin Newby, The North Carolina State Constitution 62-63 (2d ed. 2013)\n\n(citing Leandro as an example in which, along with other constitutional provisions,\n\nArticle I, Section 15 was given substantive effect by this Court and stating that “[i]n\n\naddition to the substantive component, this section may also secure other rights, the\n\nviolation of which could subject a local school board to suit without the benefit of\n\ngovernmental immunity or insurance coverage”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -45-\n\f                                    HART V.

I must conclude that by creating this program, the\n\nState’s legislature has completely abrogated the duty to “guard and maintain [the]\n\nright” to an education. N.C. Const. art I, § 15. As the trial court concluded, “[t]he\n\nGeneral Assembly fails the children of North Carolina when they are sent with\n\ntaxpayer money to private schools that have no legal obligation to teach them\n\nanything.” This failure violates the duty set forth in Article I, Section 15.\n\n      This Court’s duty to the people of our State, as expressed in several clauses of\n\nour constitution, is to ensure that if taxpayer money is spent on private education,\n\nthe expenditure is for an education that can prepare our children to participate and\n\nthrive in our state’s society.

Comm’rs, 174 N.C. 469, 472, 93\n\nS.E. 1001, 1002 (1917)).\n\n      The Supreme Court of the United States made the following prescient\n\nobservation regarding education more than sixty years ago. These words remain\n\nequally valid now.\n\n                    Today, education is perhaps the most important\n             function of state and local governments. Compulsory\n             school attendance laws and the great expenditures for\n             education both demonstrate our recognition of the\n             importance of education to our democratic society. It is\n             required in the performance of our most basic public\n             responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the\n             very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal\n             instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in\n             preparing him for later professional training, and in\n             helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In\n             these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\n             expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of\n             an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has\n             undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made\n\n\n                                           -47-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                  Beasley, J., dissenting\n\n\n\n             available to all on equal terms.\n\nBrown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S. Ct. 686, 691, 98 L. Ed. 873, 880 (1954),\n\nadditional proceedings at 349 U.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083 (1955). Central\n\nto the Court’s decision was the understanding that “[w]e must consider public\n\neducation in the light of its full development and its present place in American life.”\n\nBrown, 347 U.S. at 492, 74 S. Ct. at 691, 98 L. Ed. 2d at 880.\n\n      Free public education historically has been, and today remains, vital to\n\nAmerican life. Its diminishment in quality or its concentration among a few invites\n\ndespots to power and risks oppressing the rest.             With continued necessity for\n\npreserving and promoting free public education clearly in view, I turn to the\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program.\n\n      The Court correctly explains that our circumspect inquiry is constrained to the\n\nfacial challenge presented in view of established principles of constitutional\n\ninterpretation. Nonetheless, the majority’s opinion should not be read so broadly as\n\nto set an impossible standard for a facial challenge to legislation, particularly when\n\nthe legislation stands to affect the education of the children of North Carolina.\n\nBeaufort Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Beaufort Cty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 363 N.C. 500, 502, 681\n\nS.E.2d 278, 280-81 (2009) (“This Court will only measure the balance struck in the\n\nstatute against the minimum standards required by the constitution.”). It is well\n\nestablished that, subject to the constitution, it is for the General Assembly to\n\n“establish minimum educational requirements and standards.” Delconte v. State, 313\n\n\n                                           -48-\n\f                                    HART V.

But those standards must\n\ncomport with the constitutional minimum, and it has long been beyond dispute that\n\nthis Court has jurisdiction to determine whether legislation meets the minimum\n\nallowed by our Constitution. E.g., Bayard v. Singleton, 1 N.C. 5 (1787).\n\n      This Court already has articulated “the minimum standards required by the\n\nconstitution,” Beaufort Bd. of Educ., 363 N.C. at 502, 681 S.E.2d at 281, when the\n\nGeneral Assembly purports to provide for public education.             In Leandro we\n\n“address[ed] plaintiff-parties’ constitutional challenge to the state’s public education\n\nsystem.” 346 N.C. at 345, 488 S.E.2d at 254. We explained that the North Carolina\n\nConstitution guarantees every child the right to a sound basic education, and we\n\ndefined the mandate for public education by explaining that\n\n             [f]or purposes of our Constitution, a “sound basic\n             education” is one that will provide the student with at\n             least: (1) sufficient ability to read, write, and speak the\n             English language and a sufficient knowledge of\n             fundamental mathematics and physical science to enable\n             the student to function in a complex and rapidly changing\n             society; (2) sufficient fundamental knowledge of geography,\n             history, and basic economic and political systems to enable\n             the student to make informed choices with regard to issues\n             that affect the student personally or affect the student's\n             community, state, and nation; (3) sufficient academic and\n             vocational skills to enable the student to successfully\n             engage in post-secondary education or vocational training;\n\n\n                                           -49-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Beasley, J., dissenting\n\n\n\n              and (4) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable\n              the student to compete on an equal basis with others in\n              further formal education or gainful employment in\n              contemporary society.\n\nId. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255 (citations omitted).\n\n       Although Leandro concerned public schools, this Court has established that\n\nthe particular type of building in which the education occurs is immaterial. See\n\nDelconte, 313 N.C. 384, 329 S.E.2d 636 (allowing home schools). It is the opportunity\n\nfor a constitutionally permissible minimum quality of education that is essential. If\n\nthe General Assembly appropriates public funds14 for public education, whether that\n\neducation occurs in public schools or nonpublic schools receiving public funds, the\n\nGeneral Assembly is limited to doing so only for the constitutionally permissible\n\npublic purpose of providing a “sound basic education.” When public funds are used\n\nfor nonpublic initiatives to fulfill the constitutional public education mandate, the\n\nappropriation may violate the public purpose clause, especially if the grant recipients\n\nare chosen because the public school system fails to meet their educational needs.\n\n       In denying relief for plaintiffs under North Carolina Constitution Article IX,\n\nSections 2(1), 5, and 6, the majority posits that these sections constitutionally protect\n\n\n       14 The General Assembly is conspicuously careful to avoid acknowledging that the\ngrants at issue are public funds. See, e.g., N.C.G.S. § 115C-555 (2013) (“For the purposes of\nthis Article, scholarship grant funds awarded pursuant to Part 2A of this Article to eligible\nstudents attending a nonpublic school shall not be considered funding from the State of North\nCarolina.”) (emphasis added); id. § 115C-562.1(6) (2013) (defining “Scholarship grants” as\n“Grants awarded annually by the Authority to eligible students”). The majority correctly\nnotes that the program is funded through appropriations from the general revenue of the\nBoard of Governors of The University of North Carolina.\n\n                                             -50-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Beasley, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nfunds designated for education but do not limit the General Assembly’s designation\n\nof other public funds for additional nonpublic education initiatives.            In setting\n\neducation policy, the danger posed by the General Assembly in designating general\n\nfunds for nonpublic education and a non-public purpose is that it effectively\n\nundermines the support the legislature is constitutionally obligated to provide to the\n\npublic school system. Because the Opportunity Scholarship Program circumvents the\n\nmission of public schools to successfully offer a sound basic education to all students,\n\nthe General Assembly has failed to meet the mandated minimum standard.\n\n       Given North Carolina’s history of public education and the State’s continued\n\nefforts to address shortcomings to deliver on its constitutional mandate, the General\n\nAssembly’s decision to pursue vouchers at this time and in this way is vexing.15 The\n\nmajority notes that the purpose of the grants is to address grade level deficiencies of\n\na “large percentage of economically disadvantaged students,” but as shown below, it\n\nis unclear whether or how this program truly addresses those children’s needs. While\n\nevery member of this Court fully recognizes the legislature’s responsibility to\n\nimplement education policy and its right to pursue novel approaches, Redev. Comm’n\n\nv. Sec. Nat’l Bank of Greensboro, 252 N.C. 595, 612, 114 S.E.2d 688, 700 (1960), this\n\n\n\n       15 There may be instances when the use of public funds for nonpublic schools can serve\na public purpose. While public schools are supposed to accommodate all students’ educational\nneeds, some circumstances exist in which the public purpose may be best met by funding a\nnonpublic educational situation, such as the education of children with disabilities under\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Chapter 115C, Subchapter IV, Article 9. This issue,\nhowever, is not before our Court at this time.\n\n                                             -51-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                  Beasley, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nCourt should not permit the State to lessen its obligation to the children of North\n\nCarolina.\n\n      In endeavoring to provide its citizens with a sound basic education, North\n\nCarolina has long embraced a complex variety of educational initiatives, including\n\npublic schools, secular and sectarian private schools, and home schools. See generally\n\nM.C.S. Noble, A History of the Public Schools of North Carolina (1930) (discussing\n\nthe history of public education in North Carolina, including the development of\n\ncurricula, religious instruction in public schools, teachers’ qualifications, and\n\nsegregated schools); see also Delconte, 313 N.C. at 397-400, 329 S.E.2d at 645-46\n\n(summarizing the development of public education legislation). Our legislature has\n\nmet the standard with varying degrees of success. It is worth observing that our\n\nGeneral Assembly previously embraced vouchers for approximately a decade as a\n\nmeans to avoid the State’s obligation under the U.S. Constitution to desegregate\n\npublic schools as required by the Supreme Court of the United States in its seminal\n\nBrown v. Board decisions. See Milton Ready, The Tar Heel State: A History of North\n\nCarolina 349 (2005) (describing the “Pearsall Plan” as “a stubbornly conservative\n\nstrategy that eventually satisfied no one”); id. at 355-56 (explaining that beginning\n\nin the 1960s and 1970s, “[s]ophisticated racial and segregationist appeals . . . . took\n\non a more abstract form” and “[m]any of the newer strategies came wrapped in terms\n\nas local control, vouchers, charter schools, tax cuts, distributive welfare, and limited\n\ngovernment interference in the private affairs of ordinary citizens”); see also Hawkins\n\n\n                                           -52-\n\f                                    HART V.

E.g., Everett v. Pitt Cty. Bd. of Educ., 788 F.3d 132 (4th Cir. 2015). Even\n\nthose victories, however, are tempered by a different reality:\n\n             The rapid rate of de facto resegregation in our public school\n             system in recent decades is well-documented. As one\n             scholar put it, “Schools are more segregated today than\n             they have been for decades, and segregation is rapidly\n             increasing.” Erwin Chemerinsky, Separate and Unequal:\n             American Public Education Today, 52 Am.

STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n562.1(3) (2013). A “[n]onpublic school” is any school that meets the requirements of\n\neither Part 1 (“Private Church Schools and Schools of Religious Charter”) or Part 2\n\n(“Qualified Nonpublic Schools”) of Article 39 of Chapter 115C of the General Statutes.\n\nId. § 115C-562.1(5) (2013).\n\n\n      The Authority awards scholarships to the program’s applicants, with\n\npreference given first to previous scholarship recipients, and then to students in\n\nlower-income families and students entering kindergarten or the first grade. Id.\n\n§ 115C-562.2(a). Subject to certain restrictions, students selected to participate in\n\nthe program may receive a scholarship grant of up to $4,200 to attend any nonpublic\n\nschool. Id. § 115C-562.2(b) (2014). Once a student has been selected for the program\n\nand has chosen a school to attend, the Authority remits the grant funds to the\n\nnonpublic school for endorsement, and the parent or guardian “restrictively\n\nendorse[s] the scholarship grant funds awarded to the eligible student to the\n\nnonpublic school for deposit into the account of [that] school.” Id. § 115C-562.6 (2013).\n\n\n      A nonpublic school that accepts a scholarship recipient for admission must\n\ncomply with the requirements of N.C.G.S. § 115C-562.5(a), which include:\n\n(1) providing the Authority with documentation of the tuition and fees charged to the\n\nstudent; (2) providing the Authority with a criminal background check conducted on\n\nthe highest ranking staff member at the school; (3) providing the parent or guardian\n\nof the student with an annual progress report, including standardized test scores;\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f                                     HART V.

Id. § 115C-\n\n562.5(a)(1)-(6) (2014).     Nonpublic schools enrolling more than twenty-five\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program students must report the aggregate standardized\n\ntest performance of the scholarship students to the Authority. Id. § 115C-562.5(c)\n\n(2014). Furthermore, all nonpublic schools that accept scholarship program students\n\nare prohibited from charging additional fees based on a student’s status as a\n\nscholarship recipient, id. § 115C-562.5(b) (2014), and from discriminating with\n\nrespect to the student’s race, color, or national origin, id. § 115C-562.5(c1) (2014); see\n\nalso 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (2012). Nonpublic schools that fail to comply with these\n\nstatutory requirements are ineligible to participate in the program. N.C.G.S. § 115C-\n\n562.5(d) (2014).\n\n\n      The Opportunity Scholarship Program also subjects the Authority to certain\n\nreporting requirements.      Each year, the Authority must provide demographic\n\ninformation and program data to the Joint Legislative Education Oversight\n\nCommittee. Id. § 115C-562.7(b) (2014). The Authority is also required to select an\n\nindependent research organization to prepare an annual report on “[l]earning gains\n\n                                           -7-\n\f                                       HART V.

Following submission of these reports to\n\nthe Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee and the Department of Public\n\nInstruction, “[t]he Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee shall review\n\n[the] reports from the Authority and shall make ongoing recommendations to the\n\nGeneral Assembly as needed regarding improving administration and accountability\n\nfor nonpublic schools accepting students receiving scholarship grants.” Id.\n\n\n       The Opportunity Scholarship Program is funded by appropriations from\n\ngeneral revenues to the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina,\n\nwhich provides administrative support for the Authority. In fiscal year 2014-15, the\n\nGeneral Assembly appropriated a total of $10,800,000 to the program.\n\n\n                                              II\n\n\n       On 11 December 2013, plaintiff Alice Hart and twenty-four other taxpayers\n\nfiled a complaint in Superior Court, Wake County, challenging the constitutionality\n\nof the Opportunity Scholarship Program under the Constitution of North Carolina.6\n\n\n\n\n       6 Although plaintiffs generally represent a cross section of individuals who currently\ninteract or have previously interacted with our state’s public schools, plaintiffs’ complaint in\nthe present action was made in their capacity as taxpayers of the state.\n\n                                              -8-\n\f                                       HART V. STATE\n\n                                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs’ amended complaint asserted five claims for relief, all of which\n\npresented facial challenges under the North Carolina Constitution. First, plaintiffs\n\nalleged that the Opportunity Scholarship Program “appropriates revenue paid by\n\nNorth Carolina taxpayers to private schools for primary and secondary education” in\n\nviolation of Article IX, Sections 2(1) and 6, and Article I, Section 15. Second, plaintiffs\n\nalleged that the law “appropriates revenue paid by North Carolina taxpayers to\n\nprivate schools for the ostensible purpose of primary and secondary education\n\nwithout those funds being supervised by the Board of Education” in violation of\n\nArticle IX, Section 5. Third, plaintiffs alleged that the law creates “a non-uniform\n\nsystem of schools for primary and secondary education” in violation of Article IX,\n\nSection 2(1). Fourth, plaintiffs alleged that in “transfer[ring] revenue paid by North\n\nCarolina taxpayers to private schools without any accountability or requirements\n\nensuring that students will actually receive an education,” the law “does not\n\naccomplish any public purpose” in violation of Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7). Fifth,\n\nplaintiffs alleged that in “transfer[ring] revenue paid by North Carolina taxpayers to\n\nprivate schools that are permitted to discriminate against students and applicants on\n\nthe basis of race, color, religion, or national origin,”7 the law serves no public purpose\n\nand therefore violates Article V, Section 2(1), and Article I, Section 19. Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n       7 Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning a nonpublic school’s ability to discriminate based\non race, color, or national origin were rendered moot by the passage of N.C.G.S. § 115C-\n562.5(c1). See ch. 100, sec. 8.25(d), 2013 N.C. Sess. Laws (Reg. Sess. 2014) at 371.\n\n                                             -9-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nrequested a declaration that the scholarship program is unconstitutional under the\n\nchallenged provisions, as well as a permanent injunction to prevent implementation\n\nand enforcement of the legislation.\n\n\n       On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court entered an order and\n\nfinal judgment on 28 August 2014, allowing plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment\n\non all claims, denying defendants’ and intervenor-defendants’ motions for summary\n\njudgment,8 and declaring the Opportunity Scholarship Program unconstitutional on\n\nits face. The trial court permanently enjoined implementation of the Opportunity\n\nScholarship Program legislation, including the disbursement of public funds.\n\n\n       Defendants appealed, and this Court, on its own initiative, certified the appeal\n\nfor immediate review prior to a determination in the Court of Appeals.9 For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we reverse the trial court’s order and final judgment declaring the\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program unconstitutional and dissolve the injunction\n\npreventing further implementation and enforcement of the challenged legislation.\n\n\n\n\n       8 For purposes of this opinion, we will refer to defendants and intervenor-defendants\ncollectively as “defendants.”\n\n       We also certified the companion case of Richardson v.

In plaintiffs’ view, however,\n\neven when the General Assembly explicitly intends, as it did here, to appropriate\n\nmoney for educational scholarships to nonpublic schools, the plain text of Article IX,\n\nSection 6 prohibits that option and requires that any and all funds for education be\n\nappropriated exclusively for our public school system.\n\n\n      Entitled “State school fund,” Article IX, Section 6 provides:\n\n                     The proceeds of all lands that have been or hereafter\n             may be granted by the United States to this State, and not\n             otherwise appropriated by this State or the United States;\n             all moneys, stocks, bonds, and other property belonging to\n             the State for purposes of public education; the net proceeds\n             of all sales of the swamp lands belonging to the State; and\n             all other grants, gifts, and devises that have been or\n             hereafter may be made to the State, and not otherwise\n             appropriated by the State or by the terms of the grant, gift,\n             or devise, shall be paid into the State Treasury and,\n             together with so much of the revenue of the State as may\n             be set apart for that purpose, shall be faithfully\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f                                    HART V.

Const. art. IX, § 6.\n\n\n      The manifest purpose of this section is to protect the “State school fund” in\n\norder to preserve and support the public school system, not to limit the State’s ability\n\nto spend on education generally. Section 6 accomplishes this purpose by identifying\n\nsources of funding for the State school fund and mandating that funds derived by the\n\nState from these sources be “faithfully appropriated for establishing and maintaining\n\nin this State a system of free public schools.” City of Greensboro v. Hodgin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3669560\"><a href=\"/opinion/3923024/greensboro-v-hodgin/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186-87, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3669560\"><a href=\"/opinion/3923024/greensboro-v-hodgin/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587-88 (1890) (quoting a previous version of the provision).\n\nThe first four clauses of Section 6 identify non-revenue sources of funding, two of\n\nwhich appear to be mandatory and two of which appear to be within the discretion of\n\nthe General Assembly to otherwise appropriate as it sees fit. The fifth clause (the\n\nrevenue clause) states that a portion of the State’s revenue “may be set apart for that\n\npurpose”—meaning for the purpose of “establishing and maintaining a uniform\n\nsystem of free public schools.” This clause recognizes that the General Assembly may\n\nchoose to designate a portion of the State’s general tax revenue as an additional\n\nsource of funding for the State school fund.\n\n\n      Thus, within constitutional limits, the General Assembly determines how\n\nmuch of the revenue of the State will be appropriated for the purpose of “establishing\n\nand maintaining a uniform system of free public schools.” Insofar as the General\n\n                                          -14-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nAssembly appropriates a portion of the State’s general revenues for the public schools,\n\nSection 6 mandates that those funds be faithfully used for that purpose. Article IX,\n\nSection 6 does not, however, prohibit the General Assembly from appropriating\n\ngeneral revenue to support other educational initiatives. See Preston, 325 N.C. at\n\n448-49, 385 S.E.2d at 478 (“All power which is not expressly limited by the people in\n\nour State Constitution remains with the people, and an act of the people through\n\ntheir representatives in the legislature is valid unless prohibited by that\n\nConstitution.” (citations omitted)). Because the Opportunity Scholarship Program\n\nwas funded from general revenues, not from sources of funding that Section 6\n\nreserves for our public schools, plaintiffs are not entitled to relief under this provision.\n\n\n       Faithful appropriation and use of educational funds was a very real concern to\n\nthe framers of our constitution. Before the introduction of Article IX, Section 6 in the\n\n1868 Constitution, the Literary Fund, which was devoted to funding public education,\n\nwas routinely threatened to be used during the Civil War to pay for other expenses\n\nand was almost completely depleted by the war’s end. See M.C.S. Noble, A History of\n\nthe Public Schools of North Carolina 242-49, 272 (1930); Milton Ready, The Tar Heel\n\nState: A History of North Carolina 263 (2005). The framers of the 1868 Constitution\n\nsought to constitutionalize the State’s obligation to protect the State school fund. In\n\nso doing, our framers chose not to limit the State from appropriating general revenue\n\nto fund alternative educational initiatives. Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary are\n\nwithout merit.\n\n                                           -15-\n\f                                     HART V. STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      Given our disposition of plaintiffs’ claim under Article IX, Section 6, we agree\n\nwith defendants that plaintiffs are likewise not entitled to relief under Article IX,\n\nSection 5. Under Article IX, Section 5, “[t]he State Board of Education shall supervise\n\nand administer the free public school system and the educational funds provided for\n\nits support.” N.C. Const. art. IX, § 5 (emphasis added). Because public funds may be\n\nspent on educational initiatives outside of the uniform system of free public schools,\n\nplaintiffs’ contention that funding for the Opportunity Scholarship Program should\n\nhave gone to the public schools—and therefore been brought under the supervision\n\nand administration of the State Board of Education—is without merit.\n\n\n      The final issue under Article IX presented by defendants’ appeal is whether\n\nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program legislation violates Article IX, Section 2(1).\n\nUnder Section 2(1), “[t]he General Assembly shall provide by taxation and otherwise\n\nfor a general and uniform system of free public schools, which shall be maintained at\n\nleast nine months in every year, and wherein equal opportunities shall be provided\n\nfor all students.” Id. art. IX, § 2(1). Plaintiffs contend that “[i]f the uniformity clause\n\nhas any substance, it means that the State cannot create an alternate system of\n\npublicly funded private schools standing apart from the system of free public schools\n\nmandated by the Constitution.”\n\n\n      Plaintiffs’ characterization of the Opportunity Scholarship Program is\n\ninaccurate. The Opportunity Scholarship Program legislation does not create “an\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nalternate system of publicly funded private schools.” Rather, this legislation provides\n\nmodest scholarships to lower-income students for use at nonpublic schools of their\n\nchoice. Furthermore, we have previously stated that the uniformity clause requires\n\nthat provision be made for public schools of like kind throughout the state. Wake\n\nCares, Inc. v. Wake Cty.

The uniformity clause applies exclusively to the public school system and\n\ndoes not prohibit the General Assembly from funding educational initiatives outside\n\nof that system. Accordingly, the Opportunity Scholarship Program does not violate\n\nArticle IX, Section 2(1).\n\n\n                                           B\n\n\n      The next question presented by defendants’ appeal is whether the\n\nappropriation of general revenues to fund educational scholarships for lower-income\n\nstudents is for a public purpose under Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7).\n\n\n      Defendants contend that providing lower-income students the opportunity to\n\nattend private school “satisfies the State’s legitimate objective of encouraging the\n\neducation of its citizens.” Defendants maintain that, in satisfying this objective,\n\nappropriations directed to the Opportunity Scholarship Program are made for a\n\npublic purpose. Plaintiffs contend that the program does not accomplish a public\n\npurpose because the program appropriates taxpayer money for educational\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f                                    HART V.

Const. art. V, § 2(1).   Under Article V,\n\nSection 2(7), “[t]he General Assembly may enact laws whereby the State, any county,\n\ncity or town, and any other public corporation may contract with and appropriate\n\nmoney to any person, association, or corporation for the accomplishment of public\n\npurposes only.” Id. art. V, § 2(7). Because “[t]he power to appropriate money from\n\nthe public treasury is no greater than the power to levy the tax which put the money\n\nin the treasury,” we subject both legislative powers to the public purpose\n\nrequirement.

Thus, in resolving challenges to legislative\n\nappropriations under the public purpose clause, this Court’s inquiry is discrete—we\n\nask whether the legislative purpose behind the appropriation is public or private. See\n\nid. at 716, 467 S.E.2d at 620-21; Mitchell, 273 N.C. at 144, 159 S.E.2d at 750. If the\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\npurpose is public, then the wisdom, expediency, or necessity of the appropriation is a\n\nlegislative decision, not a judicial decision. See Maready, 342 N.C. at 714, 467 S.E.2d\n\nat 619.    Accordingly, our public purpose analysis does not turn on whether the\n\nappropriation will, in the words of plaintiffs, “accomplish” a public purpose.\n\n\n      Likewise, sustaining a legislative appropriation under the public purpose\n\nclause does not require a concurrent assessment of whether other constitutional\n\ninfirmities exist that might render the legislation unconstitutional. If the challenged\n\nappropriation is constitutionally infirm on other grounds, proper redress is under the\n\napplicable constitutional provisions, not the public purpose clause. Thus, plaintiffs’\n\ncontentions that the Opportunity Scholarship Program runs afoul of Article I,\n\nSections 15 and 19, due to scholarships being remitted to allegedly “unaccountable”\n\nschools or schools that discriminate on the basis of religion, are inapposite to the\n\npublic purpose analysis.11\n\n\n      Our inquiry under Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7), therefore, is whether the\n\nappropriations made by the General Assembly to fund the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram are for a public rather than private purpose. In addressing this question,\n\nwe are mindful of the general proposition articulated by this Court over forty-five\n\nyears ago: “Unquestionably, the education of residents of this State is a recognized\n\n\n\n      11 The independent applicability of Article I, Sections 15 and 19, in this case is\ndiscussed in Part III(C) of our opinion.\n\n                                          -19-\n\f                                    HART V.

Article I, Section 15\n\ndeclares: “The people have a right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of\n\nthe State to guard and maintain that right.”               N.C. Const. art. I, § 15.   This\n\nconstitutional provision states a general proposition concerning the right to the\n\nprivilege of education, the substance of which is detailed in Article IX. Article I,\n\nSection 15 is not an independent restriction on the State. See generally John V. Orth\n\n& Paul Martin Newby, The North Carolina State Constitution 62-63 (2d ed. 2013).\n\n\n       Plaintiffs rely on Article I, Section 15 and Leandro v.

STATE\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nProgram legislation does not require that participating nonpublic schools meet the\n\nsound basic education standard announced in Leandro, 346 N.C. at 347, 488 S.E.2d\n\nat 255, or impose regulatory standards approximating those placed on our public\n\nschools in Chapter 115C of the General Statutes, plaintiffs contend that the\n\nscholarship program accomplishes no public purpose and is constitutionally\n\ninadequate.12\n\n\n      As stated above, Article I, Section 15 has no effect on our disposition with\n\nrespect to plaintiffs’ public purpose claim. In its order and final judgment, however,\n\nthe trial court purported to grant independent relief to plaintiffs under Article I,\n\nSection 15, concluding that the Opportunity Scholarship Program legislation fails to\n\n“ ‘guard and maintain’ the right of the people to the privilege of education” by\n\n“appropriating taxpayer funds to educational institutions that are not required to\n\nmeet educational standards” and by “expending public funds so that children can\n\nattend private schools.” To the extent that plaintiffs rely on Article I, Section 15 as\n\n\n\n\n      12 Plaintiffs acknowledge that at least some nonpublic schools may be able to provide\nscholarship students a meaningful education. Even so, plaintiffs contend that “[t]he State\nhas an affirmative obligation to ensure that public funds are used to accomplish a public\npurpose” and that, without built-in accountability standards, the State cannot ensure that\nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program will accomplish its intended purposes as to each\nscholarship recipient. In making this argument, plaintiffs would require the State to\ndemonstrate that the program operates constitutionally in all circumstances, rather than\naccepting the burden of showing that there is no set of circumstances under which the law\ncould operate in a constitutional manner.\n\n                                           -25-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nan independent basis of relief, we agree with defendants that such reliance is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n\n      It is axiomatic that the responsibility Leandro places on the State to deliver a\n\nsound basic education has no applicability outside of the education delivered in our\n\npublic schools. In Leandro we stated that a public school education that “does not\n\nserve the purpose of preparing students to participate and compete in the society in\n\nwhich they live and work is devoid of substance and is constitutionally inadequate.”\n\n346 N.C. at 345, 488 S.E.2d at 254. We concluded that “Article I, Section 15 and\n\nArticle IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution combine to guarantee every\n\nchild of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public\n\nschools.” Id. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255 (emphases added). Thus, Leandro does not\n\nstand for the proposition that Article I, Section 15 independently restricts the State\n\noutside of the public school context.\n\n\n      Furthermore, our constitution specifically envisions that children in our state\n\nmay be educated by means outside of the public school system. See N.C. Const.\n\nart. IX, § 3 (“The General Assembly shall provide that every child of appropriate age\n\nand of sufficient mental and physical ability shall attend the public schools, unless\n\neducated by other means.” (emphasis added)); see also Delconte, 313 N.C. at 385, 400-\n\n01, 329 S.E.2d at 638, 646-47 (concluding that home school instruction did not violate\n\ncompulsory attendance statutes and noting that a contrary holding would raise a\n\n\n                                          -26-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nserious constitutional question under the North Carolina Constitution). Thus, even\n\nif Article I, Section 15 could serve as an independent basis of relief, there is no merit\n\nin the argument that a legislative program designed to increase educational\n\nopportunity in our state is one that fails to “guard and maintain” the “right to the\n\nprivilege of education.”\n\n\n      The final issue presented by defendants’ appeal concerns plaintiffs’ Article I,\n\nSection 19 religious discrimination claim. Article I, Section 19 declares, in pertinent\n\npart, “[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any\n\nperson be subjected to discrimination by the State because of race, color, religion, or\n\nnational origin.” N.C. Const. art. I, § 19 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs couch their\n\nreligious discrimination claim, both for justiciability purposes and with respect to the\n\nmerits of the claim, in terms of the public purpose doctrine. In short, plaintiffs\n\ncontend that the Opportunity Scholarship Program accomplishes no public purpose\n\nbecause it allows funding for educational scholarships to schools that may\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of religion. Again, our analysis of the public purpose\n\ndoctrine made clear that Article I, Section 19, like Article I, Section 15, has no effect\n\non our disposition with respect to plaintiffs’ public purpose claim.\n\n\n      With respect to the independent applicability of Article I, Section 19 as a stand-\n\nalone claim, defendants have maintained throughout this litigation that such a claim\n\nis not justiciable in this case because plaintiffs, as taxpayers of the state, lack\n\n\n                                          -27-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nstanding. Specifically, defendants contend that plaintiffs have suffered no injury in\n\nfact because they are not in the class of persons against which the program allegedly\n\ndiscriminates. We agree and therefore hold that plaintiffs’ Article I, Section 19 claim\n\nmust be dismissed.\n\n\n      Generally, “a taxpayer has standing to bring an action against appropriate\n\ngovernment officials for the alleged misuse or misappropriation of public funds.”\n\nGoldston v.

In this case the General Assembly seeks to improve the\n\neducational outcomes of children in lower-income families.

Const. art. V, § 2(1). Additionally,\n\n“[t]he General Assembly may enact laws whereby the State, any county, city or town,\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\f                                     HART V.

Second, in so doing, the spending authorized under the voucher program\n\nalso violates Article I, Section 15, which states: “The people have a right to the\n\nprivilege of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that\n\nright.” Id. art. I, § 15.\n\n       In its order the trial court includes the following among the “Undisputed\n\nMaterial Facts”:\n\n              4.     Private schools that receive scholarship funds are (1)\n              not required to be accredited by the State Board of\n              Education or any other state or national institution; (2) not\n              required to employ teachers or principals who are licensed\n              or have any particular credentials, degrees, experience, or\n              expertise in education; (3) not subject to any requirements\n              regarding the curriculum that they teach; (4) not required\n              to provide a minimum amount of instructional time; and\n              (5) not prohibited from discriminating against applicants\n              or students on the basis of religion. See N.C. Gen. Stat. §\n              115C-562.1 et seq.\n\n                      ....\n\n              6.    Of the 5,556 scholarship applicants, 3,804\n              applicants identified 446 private schools they planned to\n              attend.

Therefore,\n\nI conclude that the majority’s assertion that “our public purpose analysis does not\n\nturn on whether the appropriation will . . . ‘accomplish’ a public purpose” is contrary\n\nto our precedent.   It is precisely this determination that we are called upon to\n\nundertake here.

Admittedly, this is the standard we have set for our public schools, not our\n\nprivate ones, and it is conceivable that we would set a less comprehensive substantive\n\nstandard for private schools. However, a large gap opens between Leandro-required\n\nstandards and no standards at all, which is what we have here. When taxpayer\n\nmoney is used, the total absence of standards cannot be constitutional.\n\n      Before the legislature created the Opportunity Scholarship Program, taxpayer\n\nmoney had not been used to directly finance any part of a private school education.\n\nThe expenditure of public taxpayer funds brings the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram squarely within the requirements of Article V, Sections 2(1) and 2(7). As\n\nthe trial court noted, the schools that may receive Opportunity Scholarship Program\n\nmoney have no required teacher training or credentials and no required curriculum\n\nor other means of measuring whether the education received by students at these\n\nschools prepares them “to participate and compete in the society in which they live\n\nand work.” Leandro, 346 N.C. at 345, 488 S.E.2d at 254. As we have observed in\n\nState Education Assistance Authority v. Bank of Statesville, “[t]he people of North\n\nCarolina constitute our State’s greatest resource.” 276 N.C. at 587, 174 S.E.2d at\n\n\n                                         -35-\n\f                                    HART V.

Educating our citizens plants the seeds for their participation, and when we\n\nare able to reap the rewards of having an educated citizenry, we can see that our\n\npeople are our greatest resource.

Therefore, while students enrolled in\n\nprivate schools may be receiving a fine education, if taxpayer money is spent on a\n\nprivate school education that does not prepare them to function in and to contribute\n\nto our state’s society, that spending cannot be for “public purposes only.” In my view,\n\nspending on private schools through the Opportunity Scholarship Program, which\n\nincludes no means to measure the quality of the education, cannot satisfy the second\n\nprong of the Madison Cablevision test. The main constitutional flaw in this program\n\nis that it provides no framework at all for evaluating any of the participating schools’\n\ncontribution to public purposes; such a huge omission is a constitutional black hole\n\ninto which the entire program should disappear.\n\n       I am not persuaded by any of defendants’ arguments that the program, as\n\ncreated, contains standards that are constitutionally relevant or adequate.\n\nDefendants assert that “layers” of accountability standards are built into the\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program.

First,\n\ndefendants argue that the “educational marketplace” will regulate the quality of the\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f                                    HART V.

Defendants assert that parents will not\n\nsend their children to schools that do not provide a solid education or adequately\n\nprepare students for college or beyond. This may be true, but marketplace standards\n\nare not a measure of constitutionality. To the contrary, this Court must insulate\n\nconstitutional standards from the whims of the marketplace.

While families are surely entitled to choose schools for their children according\n\nto their interests, a program like the Opportunity Scholarship Program that spends\n\ntaxpayer money must, to be constitutional, serve “public purposes only.”\n\n      Second, defendants look to the statutory requirements governing all private\n\nand nonpublic schools in North Carolina. These standards relate to attendance,\n\nhealth, and safety, and also require standardized testing at certain intervals. See\n\nN.C.G.S. §§ 115C-547 to -562 (2013).        Here, however, we are not considering\n\nstandards for private schools that receive no public funding.

STATE\n\n                                HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\ngoverned by the same constitutional requirements as schools receiving public\n\nfunding; they need not serve “public purposes only.”         When considering these\n\nstatutory standards in a public purpose context, it is clear that they do not help\n\nmeasure whether the students enrolled are receiving an education that prepares\n\nthem to function in our state’s society. Even the requirement regarding standardized\n\ntesting falls short: that provision simply mandates that all private schools\n\n“administer, at least once in each school year, a nationally standardized test . . . to\n\nall students enrolled or regularly attending grades three, six, and nine.” Id. § 115C-\n\n549; see also id. § 115C-557. A similar testing requirement exists for eleventh grade\n\nstudents. Id. § 115C-550; see also id. § 115C-558. These testing standards do not\n\nspecify that students take any particular test, nor do they require any minimum\n\nresult. When a wide range of testing options are available and administered, it can\n\nbe difficult to compare results across schools (a tool which is regularly used to\n\ndetermine the efficacy of our public schools). While the regulations governing private\n\nschools do require comparisons with public school populations, these provisions\n\nimpose no consequences, regardless of test results. Moreover, the standards require\n\nno accreditation of schools and no particular training or certification of teachers. As\n\na result, these standards fail to ensure that spending on these schools through public\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program funds is for any public purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\f                                   HART V.

In addition to the above requirements for private\n\nand nonpublic schools, schools wishing to participate in the program must also:\n\n            (1) Provide to the [State Education Assistance] Authority\n                documentation for required tuition and fees charged to\n                the student by the nonpublic school.\n\n            (2) Provide to the Authority a criminal background check\n                conducted for the staff member with the highest\n                decision-making authority, as defined by the bylaws,\n                articles of incorporation, or other governing document,\n                to ensure that person has not been convicted of any\n                crime listed in G.S. 115C-332.\n\n            (3) Provide to the parent or guardian of an eligible student,\n                whose tuition and fees are paid in whole or in part with\n                a scholarship grant, an annual written explanation of\n                the student’s progress, including the student’s scores on\n                standardized achievement tests.\n\n            (4) Administer, at least once in each school year, a\n               nationally standardized test or other nationally\n               standardized equivalent measurement selected by the\n               chief administrative officer of the nonpublic school to all\n               eligible students whose tuition and fees are paid in\n               whole or in part with a scholarship grant enrolled in\n               grades three and higher.

Like the standards referenced above for private schools\n\nin general, none of these additional requirements relates to the quality of education\n\nreceived by enrolled students. Simply mandating that a report card be sent home to\n\nparents provides no guarantee that the education received is sufficient. And the same\n\nproblems exist as articulated above regarding the requirements to administer\n\nstandardized tests.\n\n       Finally, defendants point out the Opportunity Scholarship Program is required\n\nby statute to report to the General Assembly.            Under Section 115C-562.7, the\n\nprogram’s overseers must report annually to the legislature specific administrative\n\nstatistics (relating to enrollment numbers, student demographics, and funds\n\nreceived), as well as “[l]earning gains or losses of students receiving scholarship\n\ngrants.” Id. § 115C-562.7 (2014). While the data will allow the legislature insight\n\ninto   the   successes   of   the   program,    such    reporting   does   not   determine\n\nconstitutionality. First, the legislature is under no obligation to act on the reports.\n\nSecond, as we held long ago in Madison Cablevision, it is ultimately up to this Court\n\nto determine if public spending serves a public purpose. 325 N.C. at 644-45, 386\n\nS.E.2d at 206.

To that end, defendants argue that even if substantive standards were\n\nrequired under our state constitution, some of the participating private schools would\n\nmeet those standards.      This argument falls short, however, because our state\n\nconstitution mandates that every child obtaining an education paid for by public\n\nfunds receive an education that prepares him to succeed in society, and because we\n\nare analyzing the statutory framework of the program, not the merits of a specific\n\nschool.

While I acknowledge\n\nthat “[w]e seldom uphold facial challenges because it is the role of the legislature,\n\nrather than this Court, to balance disparate interests and find a workable\n\ncompromise among them,” it is important to remember that we must also “measure\n\nthe balance struck in the statute against the minimum standards required by the\n\n\n                                           -41-\n\f                                     HART V.

Here those minimum\n\nstandards require that children receiving a publicly funded education obtain an\n\neducation that serves a public purpose. The statute at issue here creates a program\n\nthat fails to incorporate any requirement to determine, much less ensure, that any,\n\nlet alone all, children enrolled are receiving a real education; as such, the statute\n\ncannot survive a facial challenge.\n\n       Private schools are free to provide whatever education they deem fit within\n\nthe governing statutes’ requirements. When parents send their children to any\n\nprivate school of their choosing on their own dime, as they are free to do, that\n\neducation need not satisfy our constitutional demand that it be a for a public purpose.\n\nHowever, when public funds are spent to enable a private school education, that\n\nspending must satisfy the public purpose clause of our constitution by preparing\n\nstudents to contribute to society. Without meaningful standards meant to ensure\n\nthat this or any minimum threshold is met, public funds cannot be spent\n\nconstitutionally through this Opportunity Scholarship Program.\n\n      As stated above, I would not necessarily impose the same detailed\n\nrequirements on our private schools receiving public funds as are imposed on purely\n\npublic schools by Leandro and its progeny. I do conclude that such spending must\n\ninclude some standards by which to measure compliance with the public purpose\n\ndoctrine; the complete lack of any such standards in North Carolina’s voucher\n\n\n                                         -42-\n\f                                      HART V. STATE\n\n                                   HUDSON, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nprogram makes determining such compliance impossible. It is instructive that all\n\nother states that have adopted similar programs have included substantive\n\nrequirements.     Although other states certainly are not bound by constitutional\n\nobligations identical to ours, examining their similar programs and the substantive\n\nstandards imposed on participating schools exposes the woeful lack of oversight in\n\nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program here. For example, compared with ten similar\n\nprograms across the country, North Carolina’s program falls painfully short. As\n\nopposed to other jurisdictions’ legislative requirements for participating private\n\nschools in the categories of state approval or accreditation, state-required curriculum,\n\nrequired teacher qualifications, required participation in a state testing program, and\n\nrequired number of instructional days or hours, the Opportunity Scholarship\n\nProgram fails to incorporate any of those mandates. In comparison, six of the ten\n\nother jurisdictions have requirements in all those areas; nine out of ten have\n\nrequirements in at least four of the five areas; and all ten have requirements in at\n\nleast one of these areas.13 For example, in Indiana (which has the largest state wide\n\nvoucher program in the country), participating schools must be accredited, Ind. Code.\n\n§ 20-51-1-6(a)(3) (2010); Ind. Code. Ann. § 20-51-1-4.7(4) (West 2013), and must teach\n\nsubjects prescribed by the State, Ind. Code. Ann. § 20-51-4-1(f)(9) (West 2011). These\n\n\n\n\n       13 According to the brief filed by amici curiae Education Scholars, the other\njurisdictions include Arizona, Cleveland, the District of Columbia, Indiana, Louisiana,\nMaine, Milwaukee, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin.\n\n                                            -43-\n\f                                    HART V.

In\n\nLouisiana participating schools must be approved by a state board, and approval is\n\ncontingent on a showing that the quality of the curriculum is at least as high as that\n\nmandated for similarly situated public schools. La. Stat. Ann. § 17:11 (2001); id. §\n\n17:4021(A) (West Supp. 2012). Even in Arizona, the least regulated jurisdiction\n\nbehind North Carolina identified by amici, participating schools must educate\n\nstudents in reading, grammar, math, social studies, and science.        Ariz. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 15-2402(B)(1) (West Supp. 2011). As summarized above, North Carolina’s\n\nOpportunity Scholarship Program lacks any kind of substantive oversight,\n\ncurriculum standards, or instructional requirements.          Schools receiving public\n\nfunding through the program are essentially free to employ whomever they desire to\n\nteach whatever they desire. This is a perfectly acceptable scheme for truly private\n\nschools, but it fails utterly to satisfy the constitutionally mandated educational\n\nstandards required when public funds are spent on education.\n\n      This failure brings me to the second constitutional flaw in the Opportunity\n\nScholarship Program: the breach of the State’s duty to guard and maintain the right\n\nto the privilege of education as set forth in Article I, Section 15, which is part of our\n\nconstitution’s Declaration of Rights. Notwithstanding this constitutional provision’s\n\nclear statement that the people of our State have “a right to . . . education” and that\n\nit is the State’s duty “to guard and maintain that right,” N.C. Const. art. I, § 15, the\n\nmajority indicates that this constitutional provision merely states a “general\n\n\n                                          -44-\n\f                                    HART V.

The majority has not, however,\n\ncited any decision from this Court in support of this proposition, and I believe the\n\nmajority’s assertion is inconsistent with this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.\n\n      In Leandro this Court concluded that Article I, Section 15 and Article IX,\n\nSection 2 of the North Carolina Constitution worked together in combination to\n\n“guarantee every child of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education\n\nin our public schools.” 346 N.C. at 347, 488 S.E.2d at 255. In other words, this Court\n\ngave Article I, Section 15, considered in conjunction with other constitutional\n\nprovisions, substantive effect. As such, the plain language of Article I, Section 15 and\n\nthis Court’s decision in Leandro regarding the interplay between Article I, Section 15\n\nand Article IX, Section 2 makes me unable to accept the majority’s statements\n\nregarding the substantive import of this constitutional provision. See John V. Orth\n\n& Paul Martin Newby, The North Carolina State Constitution 62-63 (2d ed. 2013)\n\n(citing Leandro as an example in which, along with other constitutional provisions,\n\nArticle I, Section 15 was given substantive effect by this Court and stating that “[i]n\n\naddition to the substantive component, this section may also secure other rights, the\n\nviolation of which could subject a local school board to suit without the benefit of\n\ngovernmental immunity or insurance coverage”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -45-\n\f                                    HART V.

I must conclude that by creating this program, the\n\nState’s legislature has completely abrogated the duty to “guard and maintain [the]\n\nright” to an education. N.C. Const. art I, § 15. As the trial court concluded, “[t]he\n\nGeneral Assembly fails the children of North Carolina when they are sent with\n\ntaxpayer money to private schools that have no legal obligation to teach them\n\nanything.” This failure violates the duty set forth in Article I, Section 15.\n\n      This Court’s duty to the people of our State, as expressed in several clauses of\n\nour constitution, is to ensure that if taxpayer money is spent on private education,\n\nthe expenditure is for an education that can prepare our children to participate and\n\nthrive in our state’s society. When the General Assembly fails to ensure that these\n\nconstitutional requirements are satisfied, this Court must exercise its responsibility\n\nto do otherwise.

It is\n             required in the performance of our most basic public\n             responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the\n             very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal\n             instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in\n             preparing him for later professional training, and in\n             helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In\n             these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\n             expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of\n             an education.

Because the Opportunity Scholarship Program circumvents the\n\nmission of public schools to successfully offer a sound basic education to all students,\n\nthe General Assembly has failed to meet the mandated minimum standard.\n\n       Given North Carolina’s history of public education and the State’s continued\n\nefforts to address shortcomings to deliver on its constitutional mandate, the General\n\nAssembly’s decision to pursue vouchers at this time and in this way is vexing.15 The\n\nmajority notes that the purpose of the grants is to address grade level deficiencies of\n\na “large percentage of economically disadvantaged students,” but as shown below, it\n\nis unclear whether or how this program truly addresses those children’s needs.

While public schools are supposed to accommodate all students’ educational\nneeds, some circumstances exist in which the public purpose may be best met by funding a\nnonpublic educational situation, such as the education of children with disabilities under\nNorth Carolina General Statutes Chapter 115C, Subchapter IV, Article 9. This issue,\nhowever, is not before our Court at this time.\n\n                                             -51-\n\f                                    HART V. STATE\n\n                                  Beasley, J., dissenting\n\n\n\nCourt should not permit the State to lessen its obligation to the children of North\n\nCarolina.\n\n      In endeavoring to provide its citizens with a sound basic education, North\n\nCarolina has long embraced a complex variety of educational initiatives, including\n\npublic schools, secular and sectarian private schools, and home schools. See generally\n\nM.C.S. Noble, A History of the Public Schools of North Carolina (1930) (discussing\n\nthe history of public education in North Carolina, including the development of\n\ncurricula, religious instruction in public schools, teachers’ qualifications, and\n\nsegregated schools); see also Delconte, 313 N.C. at 397-400, 329 S.E.2d at 645-46\n\n(summarizing the development of public education legislation). Our legislature has\n\nmet the standard with varying degrees of success. It is worth observing that our\n\nGeneral Assembly previously embraced vouchers for approximately a decade as a\n\nmeans to avoid the State’s obligation under the U.S. Constitution to desegregate\n\npublic schools as required by the Supreme Court of the United States in its seminal\n\nBrown v. Board decisions. See Milton Ready, The Tar Heel State: A History of North\n\nCarolina 349 (2005) (describing the “Pearsall Plan” as “a stubbornly conservative\n\nstrategy that eventually satisfied no one”); id. at 355-56 (explaining that beginning\n\nin the 1960s and 1970s, “[s]ophisticated racial and segregationist appeals . . . . took\n\non a more abstract form” and “[m]any of the newer strategies came wrapped in terms\n\nas local control, vouchers, charter schools, tax cuts, distributive welfare, and limited\n\ngovernment interference in the private affairs of ordinary citizens”); see also Hawkins\n\n\n                                           -52-\n\f                                    HART V.

Even\n\nthose victories, however, are tempered by a different reality:\n\n             The rapid rate of de facto resegregation in our public school\n             system in recent decades is well-documented. As one\n             scholar put it, “Schools are more segregated today than\n             they have been for decades, and segregation is rapidly\n             increasing.” Erwin Chemerinsky, Separate and Unequal:\n             American Public Education Today, 52 Am. U. L. Rev. 1461,\n             1461 (2003) (footnote omitted); see also Lia B. Epperson,\n             Resisting Retreat: The Struggle for Equity in Educational\n             Opportunity in the Post–Brown Era, 66 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 131,\n             145 (2004) (“American public schools have been steadily\n             resegregating for more than a decade, dismantling the\n             integrative successes of hundreds of districts that\n             experienced significant levels of integration in the wake of\n             Brown and its progeny. Such racial isolation in public\n             schools is worse today than at any time in the last thirty\n             years.”).\n\nId. at 150-51 (Wynn, J., dissenting).\n\n      For now, as noted by the majority, the program is available only to lower-\n\nincome families. This availability assumes that private schools are available within\n\na feasible distance, that these families win the grant lottery, and that their children\n\ngain admission to the nonpublic school of their choice. With additional costs for\n\ntransportation, tuition, books, and, at times, school uniforms, for the poorest of these\n\nfamilies, the “opportunity” advertised in the Opportunity Scholarship Program is\n\n\n\n                                           -53-\n\f                                      HART V.
