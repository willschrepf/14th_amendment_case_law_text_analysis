On appeal, the\n 5   defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh PA challenges the District\n 6   Court’s ruling that it had a duty to defend the plaintiffs under the applicable insurance policy,\n 7   and that consequential damages, including reputational damages, are available solely for an\n 8   insurer’s breach of its duty to defend under Connecticut law. We conclude that the District\n 9   Court properly determined that National Union breached its duty to defend. However, because\n10   we conclude that the latter question regarding the availability of consequential damages has not\n11   been decided under Connecticut law and is appropriate for certification, we certify this question\n12   to the Supreme Court of Connecticut and stay resolution of this appeal and cross-appeal.\n\n13                                                 PETER M. NOLIN, Sandak Hennessey & Greco, LLP\n14                                                 (Stephanie A. McLaughlin, on the brief), Stamford,\n15                                                 Conn., for Plaintiffs-Appellees-Cross-Appellants.\n\n16                                                 DENNIS O. BROWN, Gordon & Rees LLP (Joseph R.\n17                                                 Geoghegan, on the brief), Hartford, Conn., for\n18                                                 Defendant-Counter-Claimant-Appellant-Cross-\n19                                                 Appellee.\n20\n\n21   LOHIER, Circuit Judge:\n\n22          This appeal requires us to consider whether consequential damages, which are\n\n23   traditionally available for breach of contract claims, are also available for a claim of breach of a\n\n24   duty to defend an insured under Connecticut law, and if so, whether they may include damages\n\n25   for harm to reputation. The defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh PA\n\n26   (“National Union”) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District\n\n27   of Connecticut (Droney, J.) awarding the plaintiffs consequential damages, following a jury trial,\n\n28   for National Union’s breach of its duty to defend the plaintiffs in a securities arbitration. The\n\n\n\n            *\n            The Honorable J. Garvan Murtha of the United States District Court for the District of\n     Vermont, sitting by designation.\n\n                                                       2\n\f 1   District Court found that National Union had breached its duty to defend and concluded that, in\n\n 2   addition to being liable for the defense costs and underlying settlement, which it had already\n\n 3   paid, National Union could also be liable for consequential damages for the breach of the duty to\n\n 4   defend, including damages for injury to professional reputation and loss of future earning\n\n 5   potential. On appeal, National Union challenges the District Court’s determination that it\n\n 6   breached its duty to defend, and also argues that consequential damages are not available in the\n\n 7   context of an insurer’s breach of a duty to defend.\n\n 8           The Connecticut courts have said very little either way about whether consequential\n\n 9   damages are available solely for such a breach. Nor have they determined whether reputational\n\n10   damages, specifically, are compensable in an action predicated on an insurer’s breach of its duty\n\n11   to defend. Although no case in Connecticut has awarded consequential damages solely for a\n\n12   breach of a duty to defend, we hesitate to prohibit recovery of such damages, which are generally\n\n13   permitted under contract law, when Connecticut has not clearly addressed the issue. Similarly,\n\n14   absent a precedential decision from the Connecticut courts, we are reluctant to foreclose claims\n\n15   for reputational damages in actions similar to this one. Accordingly, we certify the following\n\n16   two questions to the Supreme Court of Connecticut and stay resolution of this appeal and cross-\n\n17   appeal in the interim:1\n\n18           (1) Does Connecticut law permit a policyholder to recover consequential damages in a\n\n19   breach of contract action against an insurer predicated on the insurer’s breach of its duty to\n\n20   defend?\n\n\n             1\n              National Union and the plaintiffs raise other issues in their appeal and cross-appeal,\n     respectively, that are not relevant to the question certified in this opinion, but that this panel will\n     consider once the Supreme Court of Connecticut has either provided us with guidance or\n     declined certification.\n\n                                                        3\n\f 1          (2) If consequential damages are available, may such damages include damages for harm\n\n 2   to reputation and loss of income?\n\n 3                                            BACKGROUND\n\n 4          Plaintiffs Bruce Ryan, Russell Newton, and Robert Fitzpatrick were executives of Merit\n\n 5   Capital Associates, Inc. (“Merit”), a securities broker-dealer. All three were insured by National\n\n 6   Union under a Securities Broker/Dealer Professional Liability Insurance Policy (the “Policy”),\n\n 7   which covered losses up to $1 million for each loss and $2 million in the aggregate for the period\n\n 8   from August 23, 1999 to September 23, 2001. In August 2001 Michael Sowell, Merit’s former\n\n 9   client, filed a securities arbitration claim before the National Association of Securities Dealers\n\n10   (“NASD”) against the plaintiffs and David Gwynn, a registered representative working for\n\n11   Merit. In his Amended Statement of Claim (the “Sowell Claim”), Sowell claimed approximately\n\n12   $1 million in damages arising from Gwynn’s mismanagement of his Merit account, which was\n\n13   opened in May 1998. Sowell alleged that Gwynn had “churned” his account by trading\n\n14   excessively for the sole purpose of generating commissions, fraudulently and negligently\n\n15   managed the account, and unlawfully solicited investments for some sham charter school\n\n16   businesses owned by Gwynn. He also alleged that the other Merit executives had negligently\n\n17   supervised Gwynn.\n\n18          Plaintiffs submitted the Sowell Claim to National Union, seeking a defense and coverage\n\n19   under the Policy, which included three exclusions relevant to this appeal. First, exclusion (f)\n\n20   exempted coverage for losses arising out of wrongful acts or interrelated wrongful acts occurring\n\n21   prior to August 23, 1999. Second, exclusion (s) precluded coverage of discretionary accounts.\n\n22   Third, exclusion (t) barred coverage of claims involving entities outside of Merit.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\f 1          Several months after initiating an investigation to confirm Sowell’s allegation that he had\n\n 2   given Gwynn discretionary control over his account, and after also arranging for separate\n\n 3   counsel to represent Gwynn, National Union withdrew its defense. Although it subsequently\n\n 4   received documents showing that Sowell’s account was in fact not discretionary, National Union\n\n 5   continued to deny the plaintiffs a defense. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs obtained replacement\n\n 6   counsel, and Gwynn proceeded pro se in the NASD arbitration, although he borrowed funds to\n\n 7   retain counsel to pursue coverage under the Policy. A few days before the arbitration, Gwynn,\n\n 8   through counsel, again sought coverage from National Union, warning the insurer that he might\n\n 9   allow the arbitration panel to enter a default judgment against him and assign his claims against\n\n10   National Union to Sowell.\n\n11          By the time National Union provided Gwynn with defense counsel, it was too late.\n\n12   Although he had not agreed to a default judgment, Gwynn had already appeared pro se at the\n\n13   arbitration and compromised the plaintiffs’ defense. The arbitration panel found Gwynn and the\n\n14   plaintiffs jointly and severally liable and awarded Sowell $1.125 million in damages. Gwynn\n\n15   and the plaintiffs requested that National Union settle with Sowell before the arbitration award\n\n16   was confirmed. When National Union failed to respond, the plaintiffs commenced this action\n\n17   alleging that National Union had breached its duties to defend and indemnify, acted in bad faith,\n\n18   and violated various provisions of Connecticut law not relevant to the question certified in this\n\n19   opinion. The plaintiffs sought to recover their “costs connected with the Sowell arbitration,\n\n20   damages related to regulatory proceedings initiated as a result of the Sowell arbitration award,\n\n21   and damage to the plaintiffs’ reputations, earning potential, ability to conduct business and\n\n22   obtain certain licenses.” S.P.A. 5. Soon after the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, National Union\n\n23   negotiated a $1 million settlement with Sowell, as part of which Sowell agreed to vacate the\n\n                                                      5\n\f1    arbitration award and enter into a covenant not to sue National Union, the plaintiffs, or Gwynn.\n\n2    National Union then filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs seeking to recover these costs and\n\n3    alleging unjust enrichment, among other claims.\n\n4           Arguing that it had no duty to defend because Sowell’s allegations clearly fell within\n\n5    exclusions (s), (f), and (t) of the Policy, National Union moved for summary judgment to dismiss\n\n6    the plaintiffs’ claims. The District Court denied the motion because it concluded that those\n\n7    exclusions did not preclude coverage under the Policy for all of the claims in the underlying\n\n 8   Sowell Claim.2\n\n 9          The plaintiffs’ claims then proceeded to a jury trial. During the trial, the court\n\n10   determined that National Union had breached its duty to defend the Sowell Claim and granted\n\n11   the plaintiffs’ motion for judgment as a matter of law on National Union’s counterclaim of unjust\n\n12   enrichment. The court further concluded that by breaching its duty to defend, National Union\n\n13   was liable to indemnify the plaintiffs.\n\n14          The District Court found that National Union had already paid the plaintiffs’ attorneys’\n\n15   fees incurred in defending the Sowell arbitration and also paid to settle the arbitration.\n\n16   Accordingly, the only remaining issues for the jury to determine were: (1) whether the plaintiffs\n\n17   had proven that they had suffered “reasonably foreseeable” consequential damages from\n\n18   National Union’s breach of its duty to defend, and (2) whether National Union had acted in bad\n\n19   faith and, therefore, whether the plaintiffs were entitled to compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n20   The plaintiffs contended that they had suffered consequential damages “in the form of injury to\n\n\n\n            2\n                Although it may have been able to do so, National Union did not argue before the\n     District Court that the claims in the underlying Sowell Claim were segregable for the purposes of\n     its duty to defend.\n\n                                                       6\n\f 1   their professional reputations and future earning potential, as well as continued costs in\n\n 2   addressing regulatory proceedings.” J.A. 584. They relied on evidence from an expert who\n\n 3   testified that broker/dealers who have paid significant sanctions have trouble finding work, and\n\n 4   on testimony from plaintiff Newton, who described his professional difficulties following the\n\n 5   Sowell award.\n\n 6           In response, National Union argued that consequential damages were not available under\n\n 7   Connecticut law. The District Court rejected National Union’s argument and charged the jury\n\n 8   that it could award consequential damages to the plaintiffs above the limits set forth in the\n\n 9   Policy. The jury found that National Union had not acted in bad faith and thus awarded only\n\n10   consequential damages in the amounts of $350,000 for Ryan, $325,000 for Newton, $200,000 for\n\n11   Fitzpatrick, and $0 for Merit. In a post-trial motion, National Union insisted that consequential\n\n12   damages should be denied as a matter of law, as the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the\n\n13   damages were foreseeable and had failed to provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury’s\n\n14   damages calculation. The District Court denied the motion and entered judgment in favor of the\n\n15   plaintiffs.\n\n16           This appeal followed.\n\n17                                             DISCUSSION\n\n18           On appeal, National Union argues principally that it had no duty to defend the Sowell\n\n19   Claim, and that, even if it had breached its duty, consequential damages are not available under\n\n20   Connecticut law for such a breach. With respect to both issues, “[w]e review de novo the district\n\n21   court’s interpretation of [state] law.” Amerex Grp., Inc. v. Lexington Ins. Co., 678 F.3d 193,\n\n22   199 (2d Cir. 2012). We conclude that National Union had a duty to defend the Sowell Claim and\n\n\n\n                                                      7\n\f 1   that it breached that duty when it declined to defend the action as a whole.3 See Sec. Ins. Co. of\n\n 2   Hartford v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 826 A.2d 107, 120 (Conn. 2003) (“An insurer must bear\n\n 3   the entire cost of defense when there is no reasonable means of prorating the costs of defense\n\n 4   between the covered and the not-covered items. . . .” (alteration and quotation mark omitted));\n\n 5   Lancia v. State Nat’l Ins. Co., 41 A.3d 308, 314 (Conn. App. Ct. 2012). As we explain below,\n\n 6   however, we certify the question of whether consequential damages are available under\n\n 7   Connecticut law for an insurer’s breach of its duty to defend and, if so, whether the insured may\n\n 8   recover reputational damages.\n\n 9          1. Duty To Defend\n\n10          National Union relies on exclusion (f) of the Policy to contend that it had no duty to\n\n11   defend the Sowell Claim.4 This exclusion states:\n\n12          The Insurer shall not be liable for Loss in connection with any Claim made\n13          against an Insured:\n\n\n\n            3\n               On appeal, the plaintiffs do not contest the District Court’s finding that exclusion (t) of\n     the Policy applied to Sowell’s claims relating to Gwynn’s charter school businesses. For its part,\n     National Union has abandoned the argument that exclusion (s) (which relates to discretionary\n     control) absolves it of the duty to defend Sowell’s thirteen claims of churning, fraud, negligence,\n     and violation of various NASD rules.\n            4\n               National Union could not have appealed the denial of its motion for summary\n     judgment, because such a denial is not a final judgment and is not ordinarily appealable. See 28\n     U.S.C. § 1291. Thus, insofar as National Union appeals the District Court’s denial of National\n     Union’s summary judgment motion, that appeal is improper. See Pahuta v. Massey-Ferguson,\n     Inc., 170 F.3d 125, 132 (2d Cir. 1999). The District Court entered its final judgment on the\n     applicability of exclusion (f) when it disposed of the plaintiffs’ Rule 50 motion, concluding that\n     “because a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for\n     National Union on the issue of breach of duty to defend, judgment as a matter of law is entered\n     for the plaintiffs on that count against National Union.” J.A. 533. Accordingly, we construe\n     National Union’s appeal as an appeal from the District Court’s ruling on the plaintiffs’ Rule 50\n     motion, rather than as an appeal from its denial of summary judgment. Because we conclude\n     below that the District Court ruling on that legal question was correct, we affirm the court’s\n     entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on that issue.\n                                                       8\n\f 1          f) alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to any Wrongful Act\n 2          occurring prior to [August 23, 1999] or arising out of any subsequent Interrelated\n 3          Wrongful Act .\n\n 4   J.A. 725-26.\n\n 5          Under Connecticut law, “‘[i]t is well established . . . that a liability insurer has a duty to\n\n 6   defend its insured . . . if the pleadings allege a covered occurrence, even though facts outside the\n\n 7   four corners of those pleadings indicate that the claim may be meritless or not covered.’”\n\n 8   Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Litchfield Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 876 A.2d 1139, 1144 (Conn. 2005) (first\n\n 9   two alterations in original) (quoting QSP, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 773 A.2d 906, 914\n\n10   (Conn. 2001)). Connecticut also requires that the insurer “‘provide a defense when it has actual\n\n11   knowledge of facts establishing a reasonable possibility of coverage,’” even if such facts lie\n\n12   outside the “four corners of the complaint.” Id. at 1146 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Am. Honda\n\n13   Motor Co., 575 N.E.2d 90, 93 (N.Y. 1991)). In determining whether a claim falls within the\n\n14   scope of an insurance policy, the Supreme Court of Connecticut “construes broad policy\n\n15   language in favor of imposing a duty to defend on the insurer,” id. at 1145, and requires a\n\n16   defense “[i]f an allegation of the complaint falls even possibly within the coverage,” id. at 1144\n\n17   (emphasis in original) (quotation mark omitted).\n\n18          With these principles in mind, we affirm the District Court’s determination that National\n\n19   Union had a duty to defend the Sowell Claim. Although the Sowell Claim alleges that Gwynn’s\n\n20   investment relationship with Sowell began in February 1998, several allegations of wrongful acts\n\n21   are either undated or occurred after August 23, 1999. For example, Sowell’s claim of churning\n\n22   did not identify when Gwynn conducted his “excessive, in-and-out trading in technology stocks”\n\n23   or his “trad[ing] extensively on margin,” J.A. 992, and whenever Sowell alleged that certain\n\n24   misconduct occurred “during this timeframe,” he referenced dates after August 1999. More\n\n                                                       9\n\f 1   particularly, Sowell claimed that when his account experienced significant gains in December\n\n 2   1999 and early 2000, it was “[d]uring this timeframe” that Gwynn had refused his requests “to\n\n 3   sell at least half of his stock and put the profits in cash” and instead “continued [the] hyperactive\n\n4    trading.” J.A. 993. Sowell also alleged that when his account began losing value from April\n\n5    2000 to 2001, he attempted “during this timeframe” to contact Gwynn, who advised him “that\n\n6    the account was fine” and “not to watch the account.” J.A. 993-94. Similarly, Sowell did not\n\n7    identify a time frame for the negligence, fraud, and failure to supervise causes of action –\n\n8    although these presumably occurred after Sowell opened his account in 1998, but before he filed\n\n9    his complaint in 2001. Given the ambiguity in the timing of the alleged wrongful acts within the\n\n10   four corners of the complaint, it is possible that these claims were based on conduct that\n\n11   occurred after August 1999.\n\n12          National Union argues that exclusion (f) nonetheless precludes coverage because all of\n\n13   the alleged losses “arose out of” two alleged primary wrongful acts that occurred prior to August\n\n14   23, 1999: (1) Gwynn directing Sowell to sign a power of attorney and give Gwynn discretionary\n\n15   control over the account, and (2) Gwynn’s improper solicitation of investments for charter\n\n16   school businesses. We disagree. For the reasons discussed above, given our duty to construe a\n\n17   policy governed by Connecticut law broadly in favor of imposing a duty to defend, it is not clear\n\n18   from the face of the Sowell Claim that all of the alleged losses “arose out of” these two wrongful\n\n19   acts within the meaning of the Policy. Cf. U.S. Auto. Ass’n v. Kaschel, 851 A.2d 1257, 1261\n\n20   (Conn. App. Ct. 2004) (finding that injuries arose out of an automobile accident because the\n\n21   “accident was the operative event giving rise to the injuries”). Therefore, the Sowell Claim’s\n\n22   allegations possibly fell within the scope of the Policy’s coverage. Furthermore, National Union\n\n23   did not contest that it received information that Gwynn did not in fact have discretionary control\n\n24   over Sowell’s account.\n                                                      10\n\f 1          Accordingly, the District Court properly determined that National Union had a duty to\n\n 2   defend the Sowell Claim, and that it breached that duty. Because we conclude that National\n\n 3   Union breached its duty to defend, we now address whether Connecticut law permits the\n\n 4   plaintiffs to recover consequential damages for National Union’s breach of that duty.\n\n 5          2. Consequential Damages\n\n 6          The parties rely on competing interpretations of Missionaries of the Company of Mary,\n\n 7   Inc. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 230 A.2d 21 (Conn. 1967), in arguing their respective\n\n 8   positions on the availability of consequential damages for breach of a duty to defend. The\n\n 9   plaintiff insured in Missionaries sued the insurer for breaching its duties to defend and indemnify\n\n10   the plaintiff in a negligence action brought by a person who had been injured on the plaintiff’s\n\n11   property. Missionaries, 230 A.2d at 22. After determining that the insurer had breached its duty\n\n12   to defend the plaintiff, the Supreme Court of Connecticut reasoned that the plaintiff was entitled\n\n13   to recover the amount of the settlement between the plaintiff and the injured party, without\n\n14   having to prove a causal relationship between the breach and the negative result of the\n\n15   negligence action that “flowed from” the breach. Id. at 26. Thus the court established that\n\n16   “[w]here an insurer is guilty of a breach of its contract to defend, it is liable to pay to the insured\n\n17   not only his reasonable expenses in conducting his own defense but, in the absence of fraud or\n\n18   collusion, the amount of a judgment obtained against the insured up to the limit of liability fixed\n\n19   by its policy.” Keithan v. Mass. Bonding & Ins. Co., 267 A.2d 660, 666 (Conn. 1970) (citing\n\n20   Missionaries, 230 A.2d at 26).\n\n21          The court in Missionaries reached this conclusion despite the possibility that the injury\n\n22   that occurred on the plaintiff’s property fell within an exclusion from the insurer’s duty to\n\n23   indemnify. Missionaries, 230 A.2d at 25. It appears to have concluded that the insurer, having\n                                                       11\n\f 1   breached its duty to defend, was estopped from invoking the indemnity coverage exclusion:\n\n 2   “[t]he defendant, after breaking the contract by its unqualified refusal to defend, should not\n\n 3   thereafter be permitted to seek the protection of that contract in avoidance of its indemnity\n\n 4   provisions.” Id. at 26.\n\n 5          Pointing to the absence of any subsequent case law permitting a policyholder to recover\n\n 6   consequential damages for its insurer’s breach of a duty to defend under Connecticut law,\n\n7    National Union urges us to conclude that the measure of damages applied in Missionaries is the\n\n 8   only permissible measure for damages in cases involving a breach of a duty to defend. The\n\n 9   plaintiffs respond that a breach of a duty to defend is really no more than a breach of a\n\n10   contractual duty, and that neither Missionaries nor any of the cases cited by National Union\n\n11   expressly precludes the availability of traditional contract remedies, including consequential\n\n12   damages.\n\n13          Connecticut courts have offered virtually no guidance on this issue. In L.F. Pace & Sons,\n\n14   Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 514 A.2d 766 (Conn. App. Ct. 1986), a Connecticut\n\n15   intermediate appellate court declined to distinguish insurance claims from other contract claims\n\n16   as they relate to the recovery of consequential damages. See id. at 772-74 (affirming jury award\n\n17   of consequential damages for breach of implied contract to act as surety). And in City of West\n\n18   Haven v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., CIV. No. N-87-68 (PCD), 1989 WL 190242 (D. Conn.\n\n19   June 1, 1989), a federal district court in Connecticut suggested in dictum that consequential\n\n20   damages may be available based on the facts of that case. The court cited a treatise for the\n\n21   proposition that “[d]amages for wrongful refusal to defend a claim include the negotiated or\n\n22   adjudicated amount of the claim, the insured’s expenses in resisting the claim and any additional\n\n23   loss legally traceable to the breach in order that the insured may be made whole.” Id. at *2\n                                                     12\n\f 1   (emphasis added) (quoting 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 4689).5 At issue in City\n\n 2   of West Haven, however, was the recovery of attorneys’ fees for the duty to defend action, which\n\n 3   the court regarded as a form of punitive or exemplary damages. Id.\n\n 4          National Union asserts that City of West Haven supports its narrow interpretation of\n\n 5   Missionaries by limiting the award of attorneys’ fees to situations in which “the breach of\n\n 6   contract is motivated by bad faith, malice or reckless indifference.” Id. We find this argument\n\n 7   unpersuasive, if for no other reason than that the court in City of West Haven determined that\n\n 8   Missionaries was irrelevant because the plaintiff in that case had withdrawn its request for\n\n 9   similar attorneys’ fees. Id. In short, no Connecticut decision appears to answer the specific\n\n10   dispositive question presented by this appeal.\n\n11          Nor do the policy considerations underlying Missionaries compel a decision one way or\n\n12   the other on the availability of consequential damages. We recognize that what appears to be the\n\n13   estoppel rule adopted in Missionaries reflects a preference under Connecticut law for an insurer\n\n14   to provide a defense for claims that are even potentially covered by the relevant policy, under a\n\n15   reservation of rights. See Missionaries, 230 A.2d at 26. The estoppel rule prompts insurers to\n\n16   err on the side of providing a defense. See Keithan, 267 A.2d at 666-67. But contract remedies,\n\n17   which would ordinarily include consequential damages, see Sullivan v. Thorndike, 934 A.2d\n\n18   827, 833 (Conn. App. Ct. 2007), would also encourage insurers to defend the insured. And the\n\n19   breach of a duty to defend seems fundamentally to be a breach of a contractual duty. Indeed,\n\n20   courts in other states have relied on traditional breach of contract principles to express a similar\n\n\n\n\n            5\n              The treatise upon which City of West Haven relied for this proposition, Insurance Law\n     and Practice, itself cites a federal district court case that merely recites the rule in Missionaries.\n     See United Servs. Auto. Ass’n v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., 350 F. Supp. 869 (D. Conn. 1972).\n                                                         13\n\f 1   preference to motivate insurers to provide a defense. See, e.g., Bainbridge, Inc. v. Travelers Cas.\n\n 2   Co. of Conn., 159 P.3d 748, 751 (Colo. App. 2006) (“Generally, the appropriate course of action\n\n 3   for an insurer who believes it has no duty to defend is to provide a defense . . . under a\n\n 4   reservation of its rights to seek reimbursement, or to file a declaratory judgment action after the\n\n5    underlying case has been adjudicated.”); Newhouse v. Citizens Sec. Mut. Ins. Co., 501 N.W.2d\n\n6    1, 6 (Wis. 1993) (“The best approach is for the insurance company to defend under a reservation\n\n7    of rights.”).\n\n8            In sum, Connecticut cases are silent on the availability of these damages in duty to\n\n9    defend cases, a lone federal district court in Connecticut addressed the issue only in dicta, and\n\n10   policy considerations underlying Missionaries fail to provide a decisive answer. Under these\n\n11   circumstances, we are unable to conclude with confidence that Missionaries precludes\n\n12   consequential damages arising out of a breach of the duty to defend.\n\n13           3. Reputational Damages\n\n14           Even if consequential damages are available, it is not clear that Connecticut law permits\n\n15   plaintiffs to recover reputational damages for breach of a contractual duty to defend.\n\n16   Connecticut appellate courts have not addressed whether such reputational damages are available\n\n17   in a breach of contract action.6 It is true that some courts in other jurisdictions have held that\n\n18   reputational damages arising from a breach of contract are typically not compensable, as they are\n\n19   “too speculative and could not reasonably be presumed to have been contemplated by the parties\n\n20   when they formed the contract.” Rice v. Community Health Ass'n, 203 F.3d 283, 288 (4th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n             6\n              At least one Connecticut trial court has suggested that recovery for loss of reputation\n     arising out of a breach of contract is ordinarily not allowed. See Sutera v. Estate of Washton,\n     No. 556177, 2003 WL 1478788, at *8 (Conn. Super. Ct. Mar. 14, 2003).\n                                                       14\n\f1    2000); see Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd., 377 F.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 2004); Smith v. Positive Prods.,\n\n 2   419 F. Supp. 2d 437, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); O'Leary v. Sterling Extruder Corp., 533 F. Supp.\n\n 3   1205, 1209-10 (D. Wis. 1982). But here, the District Court specifically instructed the jury that it\n\n4    should award consequential damages only if the plaintiff proved those damages would have been\n\n5    contemplated by the parties at the time they agreed to the Policy. Without more guidance from\n\n6    the Connecticut courts on this important issue, we are reluctant to decide one way or the other\n\n7    whether a plaintiff can recover reputational damages in such actions under Connecticut law, even\n\n8    when a jury finds that the damages are not speculative and were contemplated at the time the\n\n9    contract was formed.\n\n10          4. Certification\n\n11          Under the rules of this Court and Connecticut law, we may certify a question to the\n\n12   Supreme Court of Connecticut “if the answer may be determinative of an issue” in a pending\n\n13   case before us “and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or\n\n14   statute.” See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 51-199b(d); 2d Cir. Local R. 27.2. We conclude that\n\n15   certification is warranted in this case for at least three reasons. First, “no Connecticut court has\n\n16   ever provided an authoritative answer” to the dispositive questions in this appeal, Caruso v.\n\n17   Siemens Bus. Commc’ns Sys., Inc., 392 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir. 2004), and there is no statute that\n\n18   addresses the issues. We have “long recognized that state courts should be accorded the first\n\n19   opportunity to decide significant issues of state law through the certification process.” Parrot v.\n\n20   Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 338 F.3d 140, 144 (2d Cir. 2003). Second, an answer to the\n\n21   questions we certify will be determinative of the principal issues on appeal. Third, “[i]nsurance\n\n22   is an important industry in Connecticut,” Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. TD Banknorth Ins. Agency\n\n23   Inc., 644 F.3d 166, 172 (2d Cir. 2011), and the availability of consequential damages in this\n                                                      15\n\f 1   context implicates significant public policy considerations such that “Connecticut has a strong\n\n 2   interest in deciding the issue[s] certified rather than having the only precedent on point be that of\n\n 3   the federal court,” Parrot, 338 F.3d at 145 (alteration in original) (quotation mark omitted); see\n\n 4   Arrowood Indem. Co. v. King, 605 F.3d 62, 79-80 (2d Cir. 2010) (“The case for certification to\n\n 5   the Connecticut Supreme Court is especially compelling when the uncertainty pertains to an\n\n 6   insurance dispute, given the ‘established preeminence’ of that court in the field of insurance\n\n 7   law.”). Under these circumstances, it would be prudent and “in the interest of simplicity,\n\n 8   directness and economy of judicial action” to certify the questions presented by this case. Conn.\n\n 9   R. App. P. § 82-3.\n\n10                                            CONCLUSION\n\n11          For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully certify the following questions to the\n\n12   Supreme Court of Connecticut:\n\n13          (1) Does Connecticut law permit a policyholder to recover consequential damages in a\n\n14   breach of contract action against an insurer predicated on the insurer’s breach of its duty to\n\n15   defend?\n\n16          (2) If consequential damages are available, may such damages include damages for harm\n\n17   to reputation and loss of income?\n\n18          The Supreme Court of Connecticut may reformulate this question and address any\n\n19   additional questions that it deems pertinent to this appeal. See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 51-199b(k);\n\n20   Conn. R. App. P. § 82-3.\n\n21          It is hereby Ordered that the Clerk of Court transmit to the Clerk of the Supreme Court of\n\n22   Connecticut a Certificate, together with this decision and a complete set of the briefs,\n\n23   appendices, and record filed in this Court by the parties.

This panel will\n\n2   retain jurisdiction to consider all issues that remain on this appeal and cross-appeal (including\n\n3   issues not discussed in this opinion) once the Supreme Court of Connecticut has either provided\n\n4   us with its guidance or declined certification.\n\n5                                            CERTIFICATE\n\n6          The foregoing is hereby certified to the Supreme Court of Connecticut pursuant to\n\n7   Connecticut General Statute § 51-199b and Second Circuit Local Rule 27.2, as ordered by the\n\n8   United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      17\n\f",

On appeal, the\n 5   defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh PA challenges the District\n 6   Court’s ruling that it had a duty to defend the plaintiffs under the applicable insurance policy,\n 7   and that consequential damages, including reputational damages, are available solely for an\n 8   insurer’s breach of its duty to defend under Connecticut law. We conclude that the District\n 9   Court properly determined that National Union breached its duty to defend. However, because\n10   we conclude that the latter question regarding the availability of consequential damages has not\n11   been decided under Connecticut law and is appropriate for certification, we certify this question\n12   to the Supreme Court of Connecticut and stay resolution of this appeal and cross-appeal.\n\n13                                                 PETER M. NOLIN, Sandak Hennessey & Greco, LLP\n14                                                 (Stephanie A.

The defendant National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh PA\n\n26   (“National Union”) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District\n\n27   of Connecticut (Droney, J.) awarding the plaintiffs consequential damages, following a jury trial,\n\n28   for National Union’s breach of its duty to defend the plaintiffs in a securities arbitration. The\n\n\n\n            *\n            The Honorable J. Garvan Murtha of the United States District Court for the District of\n     Vermont, sitting by designation.\n\n                                                       2\n\f 1   District Court found that National Union had breached its duty to defend and concluded that, in\n\n 2   addition to being liable for the defense costs and underlying settlement, which it had already\n\n 3   paid, National Union could also be liable for consequential damages for the breach of the duty to\n\n 4   defend, including damages for injury to professional reputation and loss of future earning\n\n 5   potential. On appeal, National Union challenges the District Court’s determination that it\n\n 6   breached its duty to defend, and also argues that consequential damages are not available in the\n\n 7   context of an insurer’s breach of a duty to defend.\n\n 8           The Connecticut courts have said very little either way about whether consequential\n\n 9   damages are available solely for such a breach. Nor have they determined whether reputational\n\n10   damages, specifically, are compensable in an action predicated on an insurer’s breach of its duty\n\n11   to defend. Although no case in Connecticut has awarded consequential damages solely for a\n\n12   breach of a duty to defend, we hesitate to prohibit recovery of such damages, which are generally\n\n13   permitted under contract law, when Connecticut has not clearly addressed the issue. Similarly,\n\n14   absent a precedential decision from the Connecticut courts, we are reluctant to foreclose claims\n\n15   for reputational damages in actions similar to this one. Accordingly, we certify the following\n\n16   two questions to the Supreme Court of Connecticut and stay resolution of this appeal and cross-\n\n17   appeal in the interim:1\n\n18           (1) Does Connecticut law permit a policyholder to recover consequential damages in a\n\n19   breach of contract action against an insurer predicated on the insurer’s breach of its duty to\n\n20   defend?\n\n\n             1\n              National Union and the plaintiffs raise other issues in their appeal and cross-appeal,\n     respectively, that are not relevant to the question certified in this opinion, but that this panel will\n     consider once the Supreme Court of Connecticut has either provided us with guidance or\n     declined certification.\n\n                                                        3\n\f 1          (2) If consequential damages are available, may such damages include damages for harm\n\n 2   to reputation and loss of income?\n\n 3                                            BACKGROUND\n\n 4          Plaintiffs Bruce Ryan, Russell Newton, and Robert Fitzpatrick were executives of Merit\n\n 5   Capital Associates, Inc. (“Merit”), a securities broker-dealer. All three were insured by National\n\n 6   Union under a Securities Broker/Dealer Professional Liability Insurance Policy (the “Policy”),\n\n 7   which covered losses up to $1 million for each loss and $2 million in the aggregate for the period\n\n 8   from August 23, 1999 to September 23, 2001. In August 2001 Michael Sowell, Merit’s former\n\n 9   client, filed a securities arbitration claim before the National Association of Securities Dealers\n\n10   (“NASD”) against the plaintiffs and David Gwynn, a registered representative working for\n\n11   Merit. In his Amended Statement of Claim (the “Sowell Claim”), Sowell claimed approximately\n\n12   $1 million in damages arising from Gwynn’s mismanagement of his Merit account, which was\n\n13   opened in May 1998. Sowell alleged that Gwynn had “churned” his account by trading\n\n14   excessively for the sole purpose of generating commissions, fraudulently and negligently\n\n15   managed the account, and unlawfully solicited investments for some sham charter school\n\n16   businesses owned by Gwynn. He also alleged that the other Merit executives had negligently\n\n17   supervised Gwynn.\n\n18          Plaintiffs submitted the Sowell Claim to National Union, seeking a defense and coverage\n\n19   under the Policy, which included three exclusions relevant to this appeal. First, exclusion (f)\n\n20   exempted coverage for losses arising out of wrongful acts or interrelated wrongful acts occurring\n\n21   prior to August 23, 1999. Second, exclusion (s) precluded coverage of discretionary accounts.\n\n22   Third, exclusion (t) barred coverage of claims involving entities outside of Merit.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\f 1          Several months after initiating an investigation to confirm Sowell’s allegation that he had\n\n 2   given Gwynn discretionary control over his account, and after also arranging for separate\n\n 3   counsel to represent Gwynn, National Union withdrew its defense. Although it subsequently\n\n 4   received documents showing that Sowell’s account was in fact not discretionary, National Union\n\n 5   continued to deny the plaintiffs a defense. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs obtained replacement\n\n 6   counsel, and Gwynn proceeded pro se in the NASD arbitration, although he borrowed funds to\n\n 7   retain counsel to pursue coverage under the Policy. A few days before the arbitration, Gwynn,\n\n 8   through counsel, again sought coverage from National Union, warning the insurer that he might\n\n 9   allow the arbitration panel to enter a default judgment against him and assign his claims against\n\n10   National Union to Sowell.\n\n11          By the time National Union provided Gwynn with defense counsel, it was too late.\n\n12   Although he had not agreed to a default judgment, Gwynn had already appeared pro se at the\n\n13   arbitration and compromised the plaintiffs’ defense. The arbitration panel found Gwynn and the\n\n14   plaintiffs jointly and severally liable and awarded Sowell $1.125 million in damages. Gwynn\n\n15   and the plaintiffs requested that National Union settle with Sowell before the arbitration award\n\n16   was confirmed. When National Union failed to respond, the plaintiffs commenced this action\n\n17   alleging that National Union had breached its duties to defend and indemnify, acted in bad faith,\n\n18   and violated various provisions of Connecticut law not relevant to the question certified in this\n\n19   opinion. The plaintiffs sought to recover their “costs connected with the Sowell arbitration,\n\n20   damages related to regulatory proceedings initiated as a result of the Sowell arbitration award,\n\n21   and damage to the plaintiffs’ reputations, earning potential, ability to conduct business and\n\n22   obtain certain licenses.” S.P.A. 5. Soon after the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, National Union\n\n23   negotiated a $1 million settlement with Sowell, as part of which Sowell agreed to vacate the\n\n                                                      5\n\f1    arbitration award and enter into a covenant not to sue National Union, the plaintiffs, or Gwynn.\n\n2    National Union then filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs seeking to recover these costs and\n\n3    alleging unjust enrichment, among other claims.\n\n4           Arguing that it had no duty to defend because Sowell’s allegations clearly fell within\n\n5    exclusions (s), (f), and (t) of the Policy, National Union moved for summary judgment to dismiss\n\n6    the plaintiffs’ claims. The District Court denied the motion because it concluded that those\n\n7    exclusions did not preclude coverage under the Policy for all of the claims in the underlying\n\n 8   Sowell Claim.2\n\n 9          The plaintiffs’ claims then proceeded to a jury trial. During the trial, the court\n\n10   determined that National Union had breached its duty to defend the Sowell Claim and granted\n\n11   the plaintiffs’ motion for judgment as a matter of law on National Union’s counterclaim of unjust\n\n12   enrichment. The court further concluded that by breaching its duty to defend, National Union\n\n13   was liable to indemnify the plaintiffs.\n\n14          The District Court found that National Union had already paid the plaintiffs’ attorneys’\n\n15   fees incurred in defending the Sowell arbitration and also paid to settle the arbitration.\n\n16   Accordingly, the only remaining issues for the jury to determine were: (1) whether the plaintiffs\n\n17   had proven that they had suffered “reasonably foreseeable” consequential damages from\n\n18   National Union’s breach of its duty to defend, and (2) whether National Union had acted in bad\n\n19   faith and, therefore, whether the plaintiffs were entitled to compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n20   The plaintiffs contended that they had suffered consequential damages “in the form of injury to\n\n\n\n            2\n                Although it may have been able to do so, National Union did not argue before the\n     District Court that the claims in the underlying Sowell Claim were segregable for the purposes of\n     its duty to defend.\n\n                                                       6\n\f 1   their professional reputations and future earning potential, as well as continued costs in\n\n 2   addressing regulatory proceedings.” J.A. 584. They relied on evidence from an expert who\n\n 3   testified that broker/dealers who have paid significant sanctions have trouble finding work, and\n\n 4   on testimony from plaintiff Newton, who described his professional difficulties following the\n\n 5   Sowell award.\n\n 6           In response, National Union argued that consequential damages were not available under\n\n 7   Connecticut law. The District Court rejected National Union’s argument and charged the jury\n\n 8   that it could award consequential damages to the plaintiffs above the limits set forth in the\n\n 9   Policy. The jury found that National Union had not acted in bad faith and thus awarded only\n\n10   consequential damages in the amounts of $350,000 for Ryan, $325,000 for Newton, $200,000 for\n\n11   Fitzpatrick, and $0 for Merit. In a post-trial motion, National Union insisted that consequential\n\n12   damages should be denied as a matter of law, as the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the\n\n13   damages were foreseeable and had failed to provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury’s\n\n14   damages calculation. The District Court denied the motion and entered judgment in favor of the\n\n15   plaintiffs.\n\n16           This appeal followed.\n\n17                                             DISCUSSION\n\n18           On appeal, National Union argues principally that it had no duty to defend the Sowell\n\n19   Claim, and that, even if it had breached its duty, consequential damages are not available under\n\n20   Connecticut law for such a breach. With respect to both issues, “[w]e review de novo the district\n\n21   court’s interpretation of [state] law.” Amerex Grp., Inc. v. Lexington Ins.

We conclude that National Union had a duty to defend the Sowell Claim and\n\n\n\n                                                      7\n\f 1   that it breached that duty when it declined to defend the action as a whole.3 See Sec.

App. Ct. 2012). As we explain below,\n\n 6   however, we certify the question of whether consequential damages are available under\n\n 7   Connecticut law for an insurer’s breach of its duty to defend and, if so, whether the insured may\n\n 8   recover reputational damages.\n\n 9          1. Duty To Defend\n\n10          National Union relies on exclusion (f) of the Policy to contend that it had no duty to\n\n11   defend the Sowell Claim.4 This exclusion states:\n\n12          The Insurer shall not be liable for Loss in connection with any Claim made\n13          against an Insured:\n\n\n\n            3\n               On appeal, the plaintiffs do not contest the District Court’s finding that exclusion (t) of\n     the Policy applied to Sowell’s claims relating to Gwynn’s charter school businesses. For its part,\n     National Union has abandoned the argument that exclusion (s) (which relates to discretionary\n     control) absolves it of the duty to defend Sowell’s thirteen claims of churning, fraud, negligence,\n     and violation of various NASD rules.\n            4\n               National Union could not have appealed the denial of its motion for summary\n     judgment, because such a denial is not a final judgment and is not ordinarily appealable. See 28\n     U.S.C. § 1291. Thus, insofar as National Union appeals the District Court’s denial of National\n     Union’s summary judgment motion, that appeal is improper. See Pahuta v. Massey-Ferguson,\n     Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762266\"><a href=\"/opinion/762266/david-j-pahuta-jr-v-massey-ferguson-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 (2d Cir. 1999). The District Court entered its final judgment on the\n     applicability of exclusion (f) when it disposed of the plaintiffs’ Rule 50 motion, concluding that\n     “because a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for\n     National Union on the issue of breach of duty to defend, judgment as a matter of law is entered\n     for the plaintiffs on that count against National Union.” J.A. 533. Accordingly, we construe\n     National Union’s appeal as an appeal from the District Court’s ruling on the plaintiffs’ Rule 50\n     motion, rather than as an appeal from its denial of summary judgment. Because we conclude\n     below that the District Court ruling on that legal question was correct, we affirm the court’s\n     entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on that issue.\n                                                       8\n\f 1          f) alleging, arising out of, based upon or attributable to any Wrongful Act\n 2          occurring prior to [August 23, 1999] or arising out of any subsequent Interrelated\n 3          Wrongful Act .\n\n 4   J.A. 725-26.\n\n 5          Under Connecticut law, “‘[i]t is well established . . . that a liability insurer has a duty to\n\n 6   defend its insured . . . if the pleadings allege a covered occurrence, even though facts outside the\n\n 7   four corners of those pleadings indicate that the claim may be meritless or not covered.’”\n\n 8   Hartford Cas.

Connecticut also requires that the insurer “‘provide a defense when it has actual\n\n11   knowledge of facts establishing a reasonable possibility of coverage,’” even if such facts lie\n\n12   outside the “four corners of the complaint.” Id. at 1146 (quoting Fitzpatrick v.

In determining whether a claim falls within the\n\n14   scope of an insurance policy, the Supreme Court of Connecticut “construes broad policy\n\n15   language in favor of imposing a duty to defend on the insurer,” id. at 1145, and requires a\n\n16   defense “[i]f an allegation of the complaint falls even possibly within the coverage,” id. at 1144\n\n17   (emphasis in original) (quotation mark omitted).\n\n18          With these principles in mind, we affirm the District Court’s determination that National\n\n19   Union had a duty to defend the Sowell Claim. Although the Sowell Claim alleges that Gwynn’s\n\n20   investment relationship with Sowell began in February 1998, several allegations of wrongful acts\n\n21   are either undated or occurred after August 23, 1999. For example, Sowell’s claim of churning\n\n22   did not identify when Gwynn conducted his “excessive, in-and-out trading in technology stocks”\n\n23   or his “trad[ing] extensively on margin,” J.A. 992, and whenever Sowell alleged that certain\n\n24   misconduct occurred “during this timeframe,” he referenced dates after August 1999. More\n\n                                                       9\n\f 1   particularly, Sowell claimed that when his account experienced significant gains in December\n\n 2   1999 and early 2000, it was “[d]uring this timeframe” that Gwynn had refused his requests “to\n\n 3   sell at least half of his stock and put the profits in cash” and instead “continued [the] hyperactive\n\n4    trading.” J.A. 993. Sowell also alleged that when his account began losing value from April\n\n5    2000 to 2001, he attempted “during this timeframe” to contact Gwynn, who advised him “that\n\n6    the account was fine” and “not to watch the account.” J.A. 993-94. Similarly, Sowell did not\n\n7    identify a time frame for the negligence, fraud, and failure to supervise causes of action –\n\n8    although these presumably occurred after Sowell opened his account in 1998, but before he filed\n\n9    his complaint in 2001. Given the ambiguity in the timing of the alleged wrongful acts within the\n\n10   four corners of the complaint, it is possible that these claims were based on conduct that\n\n11   occurred after August 1999.\n\n12          National Union argues that exclusion (f) nonetheless precludes coverage because all of\n\n13   the alleged losses “arose out of” two alleged primary wrongful acts that occurred prior to August\n\n14   23, 1999: (1) Gwynn directing Sowell to sign a power of attorney and give Gwynn discretionary\n\n15   control over the account, and (2) Gwynn’s improper solicitation of investments for charter\n\n16   school businesses. We disagree. For the reasons discussed above, given our duty to construe a\n\n17   policy governed by Connecticut law broadly in favor of imposing a duty to defend, it is not clear\n\n18   from the face of the Sowell Claim that all of the alleged losses “arose out of” these two wrongful\n\n19   acts within the meaning of the Policy. Cf. U.S. Auto. Ass’n v. Kaschel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261\n\n20   (Conn. App. Ct. 2004) (finding that injuries arose out of an automobile accident because the\n\n21   “accident was the operative event giving rise to the injuries”). Therefore, the Sowell Claim’s\n\n22   allegations possibly fell within the scope of the Policy’s coverage. Furthermore, National Union\n\n23   did not contest that it received information that Gwynn did not in fact have discretionary control\n\n24   over Sowell’s account.\n                                                      10\n\f 1          Accordingly, the District Court properly determined that National Union had a duty to\n\n 2   defend the Sowell Claim, and that it breached that duty. Because we conclude that National\n\n 3   Union breached its duty to defend, we now address whether Connecticut law permits the\n\n 4   plaintiffs to recover consequential damages for National Union’s breach of that duty.\n\n 5          2. Consequential Damages\n\n 6          The parties rely on competing interpretations of Missionaries of the Company of Mary,\n\n 7   Inc. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Conn. 1967), in arguing their respective\n\n 8   positions on the availability of consequential damages for breach of a duty to defend. The\n\n 9   plaintiff insured in Missionaries sued the insurer for breaching its duties to defend and indemnify\n\n10   the plaintiff in a negligence action brought by a person who had been injured on the plaintiff’s\n\n11   property. Missionaries, 230 A.2d at 22. After determining that the insurer had breached its duty\n\n12   to defend the plaintiff, the Supreme Court of Connecticut reasoned that the plaintiff was entitled\n\n13   to recover the amount of the settlement between the plaintiff and the injured party, without\n\n14   having to prove a causal relationship between the breach and the negative result of the\n\n15   negligence action that “flowed from” the breach. Id. at 26. Thus the court established that\n\n16   “[w]here an insurer is guilty of a breach of its contract to defend, it is liable to pay to the insured\n\n17   not only his reasonable expenses in conducting his own defense but, in the absence of fraud or\n\n18   collusion, the amount of a judgment obtained against the insured up to the limit of liability fixed\n\n19   by its policy.” Keithan v.

Missionaries, 230 A.2d at 25. It appears to have concluded that the insurer, having\n                                                       11\n\f 1   breached its duty to defend, was estopped from invoking the indemnity coverage exclusion:\n\n 2   “[t]he defendant, after breaking the contract by its unqualified refusal to defend, should not\n\n 3   thereafter be permitted to seek the protection of that contract in avoidance of its indemnity\n\n 4   provisions.” Id. at 26.\n\n 5          Pointing to the absence of any subsequent case law permitting a policyholder to recover\n\n 6   consequential damages for its insurer’s breach of a duty to defend under Connecticut law,\n\n7    National Union urges us to conclude that the measure of damages applied in Missionaries is the\n\n 8   only permissible measure for damages in cases involving a breach of a duty to defend. The\n\n 9   plaintiffs respond that a breach of a duty to defend is really no more than a breach of a\n\n10   contractual duty, and that neither Missionaries nor any of the cases cited by National Union\n\n11   expressly precludes the availability of traditional contract remedies, including consequential\n\n12   damages.\n\n13          Connecticut courts have offered virtually no guidance on this issue. In L.F. Pace & Sons,\n\n14   Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Conn. App. Ct. 1986), a Connecticut\n\n15   intermediate appellate court declined to distinguish insurance claims from other contract claims\n\n16   as they relate to the recovery of consequential damages. See id. at 772-74 (affirming jury award\n\n17   of consequential damages for breach of implied contract to act as surety). And in City of West\n\n18   Haven v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., CIV. No. N-87-68 (PCD), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">190242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Conn.\n\n19   June 1, 1989), a federal district court in Connecticut suggested in dictum that consequential\n\n20   damages may be available based on the facts of that case. The court cited a treatise for the\n\n21   proposition that “[d]amages for wrongful refusal to defend a claim include the negotiated or\n\n22   adjudicated amount of the claim, the insured’s expenses in resisting the claim and any additional\n\n23   loss legally traceable to the breach in order that the insured may be made whole.” Id. at *2\n                                                     12\n\f 1   (emphasis added) (quoting 7C Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 4689).5 At issue in City\n\n 2   of West Haven, however, was the recovery of attorneys’ fees for the duty to defend action, which\n\n 3   the court regarded as a form of punitive or exemplary damages. Id.\n\n 4          National Union asserts that City of West Haven supports its narrow interpretation of\n\n 5   Missionaries by limiting the award of attorneys’ fees to situations in which “the breach of\n\n 6   contract is motivated by bad faith, malice or reckless indifference.” Id. We find this argument\n\n 7   unpersuasive, if for no other reason than that the court in City of West Haven determined that\n\n 8   Missionaries was irrelevant because the plaintiff in that case had withdrawn its request for\n\n 9   similar attorneys’ fees. Id. In short, no Connecticut decision appears to answer the specific\n\n10   dispositive question presented by this appeal.\n\n11          Nor do the policy considerations underlying Missionaries compel a decision one way or\n\n12   the other on the availability of consequential damages. We recognize that what appears to be the\n\n13   estoppel rule adopted in Missionaries reflects a preference under Connecticut law for an insurer\n\n14   to provide a defense for claims that are even potentially covered by the relevant policy, under a\n\n15   reservation of rights.

Under these\n\n11   circumstances, we are unable to conclude with confidence that Missionaries precludes\n\n12   consequential damages arising out of a breach of the duty to defend.\n\n13           3. Reputational Damages\n\n14           Even if consequential damages are available, it is not clear that Connecticut law permits\n\n15   plaintiffs to recover reputational damages for breach of a contractual duty to defend.\n\n16   Connecticut appellate courts have not addressed whether such reputational damages are available\n\n17   in a breach of contract action.6 It is true that some courts in other jurisdictions have held that\n\n18   reputational damages arising from a breach of contract are typically not compensable, as they are\n\n19   “too speculative and could not reasonably be presumed to have been contemplated by the parties\n\n20   when they formed the contract.” Rice v.

But here, the District Court specifically instructed the jury that it\n\n4    should award consequential damages only if the plaintiff proved those damages would have been\n\n5    contemplated by the parties at the time they agreed to the Policy. Without more guidance from\n\n6    the Connecticut courts on this important issue, we are reluctant to decide one way or the other\n\n7    whether a plaintiff can recover reputational damages in such actions under Connecticut law, even\n\n8    when a jury finds that the damages are not speculative and were contemplated at the time the\n\n9    contract was formed.\n\n10          4. Certification\n\n11          Under the rules of this Court and Connecticut law, we may certify a question to the\n\n12   Supreme Court of Connecticut “if the answer may be determinative of an issue” in a pending\n\n13   case before us “and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or\n\n14   statute.” See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 51-199b(d); 2d Cir. Local R. 27.2. We conclude that\n\n15   certification is warranted in this case for at least three reasons. First, “no Connecticut court has\n\n16   ever provided an authoritative answer” to the dispositive questions in this appeal, Caruso v.\n\n17   Siemens Bus.

Under these circumstances, it would be prudent and “in the interest of simplicity,\n\n 8   directness and economy of judicial action” to certify the questions presented by this case. Conn.\n\n 9   R.

See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 51-199b(k);\n\n20   Conn. R. App. P. § 82-3.\n\n21          It is hereby Ordered that the Clerk of Court transmit to the Clerk of the Supreme Court of\n\n22   Connecticut a Certificate, together with this decision and a complete set of the briefs,\n\n23   appendices, and record filed in this Court by the parties. The parties are directed to bear equally\n                                                      16\n\f1   such fees and costs that may be required by the Supreme Court of Connecticut. This panel will\n\n2   retain jurisdiction to consider all issues that remain on this appeal and cross-appeal (including\n\n3   issues not discussed in this opinion) once the Supreme Court of Connecticut has either provided\n\n4   us with its guidance or declined certification.\n\n5                                            CERTIFICATE\n\n6          The foregoing is hereby certified to the Supreme Court of Connecticut pursuant to\n\n7   Connecticut General Statute § 51-199b and Second Circuit Local Rule 27.2, as ordered by the\n\n8   United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      17\n\f</pre>",
