Introduction\n    This case brings to a close our supervision of more than\nfour decades of litigation designed to desegregate the public\nschools of Delaware.\n    However, we do not end our supervision hastily. After the\nDelaware schools' rudimentary attempts at desegregation were\ndeemed insufficient by the district court in 1957, and by this\ncourt in 1960, judges of this circuit blazed new jurisprudential\ntrails in 1975 by requiring an interdistrict remedy. By 1977 and\n1978, the judiciary had fashioned detailed orders for primary and\nancillary relief which, together with the factors set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent\nCounty, Va., 391 U.S. 430 (1968), constituted the marching orders\nfor the school system.\n    Still, it was not until almost 20 years later (and 35 years\nafter this court announced dissatisfaction with an original plan\nthat called for grade-by-grade desegregation over a 12-year\nperiod) that the district court could announce that the marching\norders had been obeyed: The school system has achieved unitary\nstatus by complying in good faith with our detailed desegregation\ndecrees and by eliminating to the extent practicable the vestiges\nof de jure segregation. This was the ruling of the district\ncourt embodied in a judgment entered after a lengthy hearing.\nThe Coalition to Save Our Students (\"Coalition\"), the\nrepresentative of the plaintiff class, has appealed. We will\naffirm.\n    It is beyond dispute that racism and bigotry continue to\ntear at the fragile social fabric of our national and local\ncommunities, and that our best efforts as citizens are needed to\naddress this problem at many levels. However, as the district\ncourt observed in the case at hand, court-supervised school\ndesegregation alone cannot eliminate racial discrimination:\n    [A]s the years have passed since Brown I and II [Brown v.\n    Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954) and Brown v. Board of\n    Educ., 349 U.S. 294 (1955)], it has become apparent that the\n    school desegregation process has been unable to eliminate or\n    overcome racial discrimination in the \"myriad factors of\n    human existence\" outside the school environment . . . .\nCoalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ. of State of\nDel., 901 F. Supp. 784, 823 (1995) (quoting Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 22 (1971)). Or as the\nCourt succinctly put it in Swann: \"One vehicle can carry only a\n\flimited amount of baggage. It would not serve the important\nobjective of Brown I to seek to use school desegregation cases\nfor purposes beyond their scope . . . .\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 22.\n    In light of this sobering truth, it is all the more\nimportant that we write the final chapter in this long period of\nsupervision by the federal courts and release our provisional\ngrip on the administrators and educators of Northern New Castle\nCounty, for only in so doing can we permit them to resume their\nfull role in the larger social and political effort to make our\nnation worthy of the best ideals of its members. The length of\nthe discussion that follows is but one indication of the\nimportance and sensitivity of the task at hand.\n\n                     II. Procedural History\n    Historically, Delaware required its public school pupils to\nattend segregated schools. Del. Const. art. 10    2 (1950) and\nRev.Code 1935   2631. However, even before the landmark decision\nin Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (Brown I),\nthe Delaware courts ordered the admission of black children to\ncertain schools previously attended only by white children.\nBelton v. Gebhart, 87 A.2d 862, aff'd 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952).\nThe Supreme Court consolidated Belton with Brown I and affirmed,\n347 U.S. 483, holding that racial segregation of public school\nstudents deprived the minority group children of equal\neducational opportunities, in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause. See Brown I, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). The Court again\naffirmed Belton v. Gebhart in Brown v. Board of Education, 349\nU.S. 294 (1955) (Brown II), remanding to the Supreme Court of\nDelaware for further proceedings to require \"a prompt and\nreasonable start toward full compliance\" with Brown I and \"to\neffectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school\nsystem . . . with all deliberate speed.\" Brown II, 349 U.S. at\n300-01.\n    Yet notwithstanding the end of de jure segregation, the City\nof Wilmington continued to operate many racially identifiable\nschools. Accordingly, the district court fashioned an inter-\ndistrict remedy to eliminate the vestiges of segregation and,\nfaced with the state authorities' adamant and prolonged refusal\nto discharge their responsibilities, issued a remedial decree in\n1978. The 1978 Order required a 9-3 student assignment plan,\nwhich provided that all students would attend formerly\npredominantly \"white\" suburban school districts for a maximum of\nnine years and would spend at least three years in the formerly\n\"black\" school districts.\n    The 1978 Order also directed eight forms of ancillary relief\n\"necessary and essential to . . . overcome the vestige effects of\nde jure segregation,\" including: (1) an in-service training\nprogram for teachers; (2) an affirmative reading and\ncommunication skills program; (3) new curriculum offerings; (4) a\nnondiscriminatory counseling and guidance program; (5) a human\nrelations program; (6) codes of conduct providing for\nnondiscriminatory discipline; (7) the reassignment of faculty and\nstaff; and (8) nondiscriminatory guidelines for construction and\nmaintenance of school buildings. Evans v. Buchanan, 582 F.2d\n\f750, 770-774 (3d Cir. 1978) (in banc).\n    In 1981, the district court permitted the state to\nreorganize the judicially-created school district into the\ncurrent four districts -- Brandywine, Christiana, Colonial and\nRed Clay. Evans v. Buchanan, 512 F. Supp. 839 (D. Del. 1981).\nIn so doing, Judge Schwartz asserted that, notwithstanding the\ncontinued existence of \"problems that may be characterized as\nvestige effects of de jure segregation, . . . [the] four-district\nplan is viewed as a good faith effort to respond to repeated\njudicial invitations for appropriate State authorities to come\nforward with their own meaningful solutions to vexing problems.\"\nId. at 863, 874. However, because Judge Schwartz found the\n\"effort [to have] fallen short of the mark in the critical area\nof pupil assignment,\" he deferred for 60 days any order regarding\nthe State Board's motion for modification of the desegregation\ndecree in order to encourage \"curative legislation\" on the\nmatter. Id. at 872-74.\n    In 1990, Judge Schwartz made a specific finding that one of\nthe districts (Red Clay) had failed to comply in good faith with\nthe 1978 order. Coalition to Save Our Children v. Buchanan, 744\nF. Supp. 582, 587-93 (D. Del. 1990). Judge Schwartz stated that\n\"the vestiges of prior official segregation [had not] been\neradicated 'root and branch' from either the Red Clay District as\na whole or from its student assignment patterns.\" Id. at 587.\nIndeed, Judge Schwartz found that the record was \"replete . . .\nwith evidence of delay, obfuscation, and recalcitrance on the\npart of the Red Clay Board with respect to remedying the racial\ndisparities\" in that district. Id. at 592-93.\n    In 1991, Judge Schwartz stated that, notwithstanding the Red\nClay District's \"technical compliance with this court's orders,\"\nhe again had \"very grave doubts concerning the [Red Clay] Board's\ngood faith compliance with the spirit of desegregation,\" and thus\ncould \"not make a finding that the Red Clay District [was]\noperating in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause . . . .\"\nCoalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 757 F.\nSupp. 328, 349-350 (D. Del.1990).\n    Four years later, upon motion by the Delaware State Board of\nEducation for a declaration of \"unitary status,\" the district\ncourt concluded:\n    that the defendants have complied in good faith with\n    the desegregation decrees issued in this litigation,\n    that the defendants are unlikely to return to the\n    segregative practices of their predecessors, and that\n    the vestiges of past discrimination have been\n    eliminated to the extent practicable.\n\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp at 823-824. The opinion accompanying the\norder set forth 308 factual findings, which discussed: (a)\ncompliance with what have become known as Green factors (as\noriginally suggested in Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S.\n430 (1968)) -- student assignment, faculty and staff assignment,\ntransportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities; (b)\ncompliance with the ancillary relief provisions, endorsed by this\ncourt sitting in banc, see Evans v. Buchanan, 582 F.2d at 769-74;\n\fand (c) student achievement, special education and dropout rates,\nwhich the district court labelled \"Areas of Concern.\" See\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 818-22. Appellant conceded compliance\nwith two of the Green factors (transportation and facilities) and\none of the ancillary relief provisions (also concerning\nfacilities).\n    The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.    1331\n(1988). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1291\n(1988). Appeal was timely filed under Rule 4(a), Federal Rules\nof Appellate Procedure.\n\n                      III. Scope of Review\n    The Coalition's appeal presents us with three fundamental\nquestions for consideration: first, whether the district court\nproperly concluded that the four school districts of Northern New\nCastle County achieved unitary status by complying in good faith\nwith the desegregation decree and by eliminating to the extent\npracticable the vestiges of past discrimination; second, whether\nthe district court properly allocated to Appellant the burden of\nproving that certain racial disparities in student performance\nare proximately related to de jure segregation; and third,\nwhether the district court properly excluded certain expert\ntestimony proffered by Appellant.\n\n    The appeal to this court from the order declaring unitary\nstatus tracks a very narrow compass. Because the district\ncourt's finding that the school districts have achieved unitary\nstatus is factual, our review of that finding is limited to the\nclearly erroneous standard. Vaughns by Vaughns v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Prince George's County, 758 F.2d 983, 990 (4th Cir. 1985);\nUnited States v. Texas Educ. Agency, 647 F.2d 504, 506 (5th Cir.\n1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1143 (1982); Keyes v. School Dist.\nNo. 1, Denver, Colo., 895 F.2d 659, 666 (10th Cir. 1990), cert.\ndenied, 498 U.S. 1082 (1991); Jacksonville Branch, NAACP v. Duval\nCounty School Board, 883 F.2d 945, 952 n.3 (11th Cir. 1989). A\nfinding of fact is clearly erroneous only if the court has \"the\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\nUnited States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395\n(1948). Further, \"[i]t is the responsibility of an appellate\ncourt to accept the ultimate factual determination of the fact-\nfinder unless that determination either (1) is completely devoid\nof minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of\ncredibility, or (2) bears no rational relationship to the\nsupportive evidentiary data.\" Krasnov v. Dinan, 465 F.2d 1298,\n1302 (3d Cir. 1972).\n    We have plenary review of all questions of law. This\nincludes a district court's choice, interpretation and\napplication of the law to the historical facts. Louis W. Epstein\nFamily Partnership v. Kmart Corp., 13 F.3d 762, 765-66 (3d Cir.\n1994). Accordingly, this court undertakes plenary review of the\ndistrict court's allocation of the burdens of proof.\n    Finally, we review the district court's determination of the\nadmissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.\nUnited States v. Theodoropoulos, 866 F.2d 587, 590 (3d Cir.\n\f1989).\n\n                      IV. Unitary Status\n    The primary legal issue before us is whether the Northern\nNew Castle County school districts have fulfilled their\naffirmative duty to eliminate the former dual school system. The\nultimate end to be brought about by a desegregation remedy is \"a\nunitary, nonracial system of public education.\" Green, 391 U.S.\nat 436. A school system achieves this unitary status when it no\nlonger discriminates between school children on the basis of\nrace. See id. at 442. And a school system no longer\ndiscriminates among school children on the basis of race when it\naffirmatively has eliminated all vestiges of state-imposed\nsegregation. Id. at 435, 437-38 (school board charged with\naffirmative duty to eliminate racial discrimination \"root and\nbranch\"); Swann, 402 U.S. at 15 (\"the objective today remains to\neliminate from the public schools all vestiges of state-imposed\nsegregation\"). Thus our task, simply put, is to determine\nwhether the district court clearly erred in finding that the\nvestiges of de jure segregation have been eliminated in the\nBrandywine, Christiana, Colonial and Red Clay school districts.\nGreen, 391 U.S. at 435; see also Missouri v. Jenkins, ___ U.S.\n___, 115 S. Ct. 2038, 2055-56 (1995).\n    A critical starting point in identifying vestiges of\ndiscrimination is the degree of racial imbalance in the school\ndistricts. This inquiry is fundamental, because under the former\nde jure regime, racial exclusion was both the means and the end\nof a policy motivated by disparagement of, and hostility towards,\nthe disfavored race. The Court's 1968 opinion in Green squarely\naddressed this issue, noting that \"[t]he pattern of separate\n`white' and `Negro' schools . . . established under compulsion of\nstate laws is precisely the pattern of segregation to which Brown\nI and Brown II were particularly addressed.\" Green, 391 U.S. at\n435. However, the Green Court also made clear that in examining\nthe problem of racial imbalance in our schools, we are to look\n\"not just to the composition of student bodies . . . but to every\nfacet of school operations -- faculty, staff, transportation,\nextracurricular activities and facilities.\" Id.; see also Swann,\n402 U.S. at 18 (the Green factors are \"among the most important\nindicia of a segregated system.\") Because compliance with Greenfactors is\na condition precedent to unitary status, we will\nsurvey each of those factors here.\n    Nevertheless, the Green factors, which address racial\nimbalance, are not the only criteria by which we are to evaluate\nwhether the school districts have achieved unitary status. We\nmust also consider the eight programs of \"ancillary remedial\nrelief\" prescribed by this court in 1978, including: (1) an in-\nservice training program for teachers; (2) an affirmative reading\nand communication skills program; (3) new curriculum offerings;\n(4) a nondiscriminatory counseling and guidance program; (5) a\nhuman relations program; (6) codes of conduct providing for\nnondiscriminatory discipline; (7) the reassignment of faculty and\nstaff; and (8) nondiscriminatory guidelines for construction and\nmaintenance of school buildings. Evans v. Buchanan, 582 F.2d at\n\f769-74. Thus we will survey compliance with these ancillary\nrelief measures as well.\n    By considering both the Green factors and the eight measures\nof ancillary relief ordered by this court in 1978, we honor the\nmandate set forth by the Supreme Court in Dowell that a school\nboard under federal supervision \"is entitled to a rather precise\nstatement of its obligations.\" Bd. of Education of Okla. City\nPublic Schools, Indep. School Dist. No. 89, Oklahoma County, Okl.\nv. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 246 (1991) (citing Pasadena City Bd. of\nEduc. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 (1976)). Together, the Greenfactors and\nthe ancillary remedial relief measures constitute\nthese obligations, and thus precisely frame our inquiry as we\ndetermine whether the district court properly ordered the\nwithdrawal of federal supervision. The essence of that inquiry\nrecently was articulated by the Supreme Court:\n    whether the [constitutional violator] ha[s] complied in\n    good faith with the desegregation decree since it was\n    entered, and whether the vestiges of past\n    discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent\n    practicable.\nFreeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 492 (1992).\n    Given the Court's recent assertion that federal supervision\nof local school districts \"`was intended as a temporary measure\nto remedy past discrimination,'\" Jenkins, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.\nCt. at 2049 (quoting Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247), we underscore that\nthe phrase \"to the extent practicable\" implies a reasonable limit\non the duration of that federal supervision. Indeed, to extend\nfederal court supervision indefinitely is neither practicable,\ndesirable, nor proper.\n    We are keenly aware that, for as long as we have imposed\nfederal supervision on local school boards, those bodies have\nsuffered the loss of their defining function -- control over\ntheir own schools. Thus in the present matter the citizens of\nthe New Castle school districts have been denied for nearly 20\nyears what the Court has described as the \"vital national\ntradition\" of \"local autonomy of school districts.\" Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 490 (quoting Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S.\n406, 410 (1977)). Additionally, we appreciate the extended\nsocial and economic burdens that continued supervision would\nimpose on generations of innocent school children and their\nfamilies. The reality of these burdens becomes clear when we\nconsider that a child who entered first grade in one of the\nNorthern New Castle County school districts in 1976 under federal\ncourt supervision is now 26 years old, and possibly a parent with\na child of his or her own in the same judicially-controlled\nschool system.\n    Our concern for the autonomy of local school systems and\ntheir members is consistent with the established jurisprudence of\ndesegregation: a fundamental purpose of our mandate to eliminate\nthe dual system has been to encourage local school districts\nindependently to provide high-quality educational opportunities\nfor all students, a state of affairs made possible only in \"a\nunitary, nonracial system of public education.\" Green, 391 U.S.\nat 436. Were we to allow federal supervision to continue after a\n\ffinding that the school districts have complied with our\ndesegregation mandate, we would effectively preclude those school\ndistricts from achieving that goal. In sum, we cannot reconcile\nthe prospect of indefinite federal supervision of local school\ndistricts with the ultimate purpose of that supervision -- to\nfoster the creation of autonomous, racially balanced school\nsystems. Accordingly, we will remain attentive to the Supreme\nCourt's repeated instructions that such supervision be\n\"temporary\" and \"transitional.\" See, e.g., Jenkins, ___ U.S.\n___, 115 S. Ct. at 2049; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247.\n    With these teachings in mind, we turn now to the district\ncourt's analysis in this case.\n\n                      V. The Green Factors\n    The fundamental issue before the district court was whether\nthe desegregation measures taken by the school districts had\neffectively eliminated to the extent practicable the vestiges of\nthe former dual school system. In addressing this issue, the\ndistrict court began by scrutinizing various educational factors\ninitially identified by the Court in Green: student assignments,\nfaculty, staff, facilities and resources, transportation, and\nextra-curricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at 435. We address\nthe district court's consideration of each of these factors in\nturn.\n\n                      A. Student Assignment\n    Because the crux of the original constitutional violation\nwas the legalized system of segregated schools, the traditional\nremedy for the violation was to desegregate the schools through\nstudent reassignment. Accordingly, we ordered the consolidation\nof urban and suburban school districts. See Evans v. Buchanan,\n582 F.2d at 759 n.5 (quoting Evans v. Buchanan, 435 F. Supp. 832,\n838-39 (D. Del. 1977) (footnotes omitted)). The State Board and\ndistricts not only have adhered to the requirements of our\nstudent assignment order, but also have attempted to maintain a\nracial balance by consolidating districts, redrawing attendance\nzones, and instituting the busing of thousands of students.\n    Indeed, after the hearing below on the Appellees' motion for\nunitary status, the district court found that the schools in\nthese districts were \"among the most racially balanced schools in\nthe United States.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 799. The court's\nconclusion finds ample support in the record from the testimony\nof school desegregation expert Dr. Christine Rossell. Using an\n\"index of dissimilarity,\" Dr. Rossell compared the racial\nbalance in the four districts to a national sample of 76 similar\ndistricts, analyzing both the percentage of students in schools\nwith certain variances and the percentage of schools themselves\nwithin certain variances.\n    Dr. Rossell observed that, as measured against this index,\nthe four Northern New Castle County school districts have\nachieved \"close to perfect racial balance.\" Further, on the\nbasis of her full analysis, Dr. Rossell concluded that these\ndistricts \"are much less racially imbalanced than . . . [the]\nnational comparison group.\" JA 568; see also Coalition, 901 F.\n\fSupp. at 797. Because the district court's finding of racial\nbalance rests on Dr. Rossell's thorough analysis, it is not\nclearly erroneous. See Krasnov, 465 F.2d at 1302 (an appellate\ncourt must \"accept the ultimate factual determination of the\nfact-finder unless that determination . . . is completely devoid\nof minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility\n. . .\").\n    Appellant does not contest the findings of racial balance\namong schools, but argues nonetheless that segregation persists\nwithin those buildings, in classrooms and programs. More\nspecifically, Appellant contends that black students are over-\nrepresented in certain classes, such as special education, and\nunder-represented in others, such as gifted and advanced\nplacement classes. However, we are mindful that in Milliken v.\nBradley, 418 U.S. 717, 740-41 (1974), the Court held that the\nConstitution \"does not require any particular racial balance in\neach school, grade or classroom.\" See also Oliver v. Kalamazoo\nBd. of Educ., 640 F.2d 782, 809 (6th Cir. 1980) (rejecting notion\nthat school system is not unitary if black students are over- or\nunder-represented in various academic courses). Moreover, the\ndistrict court actually made 19 findings concerning the\ncircumstances of student assignments in the classrooms,\nconcluding that classroom balance throughout the districts was\nexemplary. Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800 (measured against a\nnational sample, classroom imbalance in Northern New Castle\nCounty was one-third to one-half that of other schools). We\nreview these findings for clear error.\n    First, although the district court's findings of classroom\nracial balance exclude special education classes, there is no\nclear error. In our 1978 desegregation order we expressly\nexcepted \"students presently attending and who in the future may\nattend . . . special education school facilities and such other\nsimilar special school facilities as presently exist or may be\nhereafter established . . . .\" JA 128 (Evans v. Buchanan, Civil\nAction Nos. 1816-1822, Order at 11 (D. Del. Jan. 9, 1978)). The\nrationale for this exception is obvious and compelling: students\n-- black or white -- should not be mainstreamed (i.e., denied\nspecial education meant to address special learning needs and\nproblems) merely to effect a racial balance.\n    Appellant is also unpersuasive in asserting that students\nare placed in special education programs (such as \"intensive\nlearning centers\") simply because they are black. Although in\neach of the four districts the percentage of black students in\nspecial education programs exceeds the percentage of blacks in\nthe overall student population, the record demonstrates that\nthe school districts classify students based on neutral, non-\ndiscriminatory state and federal criteria. JA 829-34.\nAdditionally, the districts make periodic re-evaluations of\nspecial education students to determine when they can return to\nregular classes. Id. Placement is not mandatory, because at\nseveral junctures, parents are empowered to reject the school's\nrecommendation to place their child in special education classes.\nJA 830, 832-33. Moreover, we note that the Appellee State Board\nhas created numerous statewide special education task forces; has\n\fauthorized five comprehensive studies relating to special\neducation; and thoroughly has investigated intervention\nstrategies, mainstreaming and the application of selection\nprocedures. JA 1223, 1243.\n    The Appellees' efforts to improve racial balance within\nthese programs not only are commendable, but successful. Indeed,\nin three of the four districts, the racial imbalances have\ndeclined. Although we might hope -- even expect -- that this\nimbalance will soon disappear, the mere fact that black\nstudents remain over-represented in special education classes\ndoes not make clearly erroneous the district court's finding of\nunitary status. Given that Dr. Reschly, in summarizing his\ncomprehensive analysis, concluded that in these school districts\n\"special education is not used as a means to separate students by\nrace,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 821; JA 839, we will accept the\ncourt's finding on this issue. See Krasnov, 465 F.2d at 1302\n(standard of review).\n    Similarly, Appellant argues that the district court's\nfindings with regard to classroom assignment are clearly\nerroneous because black students are under-represented in non-\nspecial education classes. This argument relies on, inter alia,the\ndistrict court's finding 47: \"[t]here is evidence that among\nhigh school students who achieve identical testing scores, black\nstudents were more likely to be placed in the lower level class\nthan were white students.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801\n(footnote omitted); JA 1385; JA 4249; JA 4305-07. To be sure,\nthis finding is potentially troubling, suggesting on its face\nthat black students may have been segregated from white students\nof equal testing aptitude. However, we must consider this\nfinding in the full context in which it was examined and\npresented by the district court. Thus we must consider that in\nfootnote 30, which accompanies this finding, the district court\nnoted that \"[t]he comparison apparently does not include academic\nachievement as measured by course performance, or whether such\nplacement was requested or required.\" Id. Because this\ncomparison relied on testing aptitude alone, rather than\nconsidering as well the important factor of academic achievement\nbased on course performance, and because it is not clear whether\nthe placement at issue was requested or required, we do not\nconsider finding 47 to be evidence that black students have not\nreceived equal opportunity, nor can we reasonably conclude that\nthe district court, upon its careful examination, clearly erred.\n    We observe also finding 48, which states that \"[o]n the\nother hand, the percentage of minorities enrolled in honors and\nAP classes who scored over the 75th percentile in reading or math\nin the spring of 1993 is slightly greater than that of whites in\nall 4 school districts.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801; JA\n6259. Although this finding could, as urged by Appellant, give\nrise to an inference that blacks must perform at a higher level\nthan whites in order to be placed in honors and AP classes, that\nis not the sole inference that could be drawn from so limited,\nand thus malleable, a sample. Indeed, on the basis of finding 48\nalone we may just as reasonably infer something quite different:\nthat the school districts' good faith efforts to desegregate have\n\fpaid off in terms of the improved testing performance of black\nstudents.\n    In any event, our task here is not to engage in such broad\nspeculation, nor to choose among possible inferences from the\ndata; rather, we are to inquire whether the district court's\ndetermination of the districts' unitary status was clearly\nerroneous. To accord this finding its proper value, therefore,\nit must be considered in the context of other, related findings.\nThis the district court did. Indeed, in view of the district\ncourt's copious research, we are assured that the court\ninterpreted this finding in the proper light in determining that\nthe districts have achieved unitary status.\n    At the urging of Appellant, we also have examined carefully\nthe district court's finding 36, which states that \"[t]he extent\nto which elementary and middle school students are placed in\nclasses according to their ability is unclear from the record.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800; JA 4214-21. This finding means\nlittle on its own, for it represents merely that there is\nuncertainty in the record about how elementary and middle school\nstudents are placed in classes according to their ability.\nIndeed, without further amplification, we are not persuaded to\nconclude that this statement cuts against the court's\ndetermination regarding the districts' good faith efforts to\neliminate de jure segregation. Again, we are required to place\nthis finding in context, bearing in mind that because few\nelective classes or courses are available to students at the\nelementary and middle school levels, the selective process for\nstudents is far more meaningful at the high school level. Thus\nwe must consider finding 36 in light of findings 39, 40 and 45.\n    Finding 39 describes the high school class selection process\nas involving \"class presentations by guidance counselors,\nbooklets with course descriptions, application by students in\nconsultation with family, individual guidance from guidance\ncounselors, and teacher input.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800;\nJA 755-56, 771-72, 851-54, 863-66. Not only is high school class\nselection the product of these various deliberations, but,\naccording to finding 40, \"[t]he parents and student have the\nultimate say in the level to which the student is assigned.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800; JA 1383.\n    And although finding 36 indicates that the record is unclear\non how elementary and middle school students are placed in\nclasses according to their ability, finding 45, when considered\nin its entirety, provides detailed information about the class\nplacement of high school students as set forth in the margin.\n    Accordingly, when we consider Finding 36 in the context of\nthese other relevant findings, we find unavailing the contention\nthat finding 36 provides significant evidence that minority\nstudents have not received an equal opportunity to succeed in the\npertinent school districts. The district court's multiple\nfindings on this particular issue suggest that the court did\nindeed consider \"every facet of school operations\" in determining\nthat the districts have achieved unitary status.\n    Finally, we note finding 49 of the district court's opinion,\nwhich states that \"[t]here is evidence that lower levels of\n\finstruction may not encourage achievement and may adversely\naffect the ability of a student to attend college.\" Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 801; PX 2262 at 82; PX 2265. As with the\nforegoing findings, although this finding may be considered\ntroubling on its face, alone it is neither definitive nor\nsubstantial enough to show clear error in the district court's\ndetermination of unitary status. The mere finding that evidence\nexists \"that lower levels of instruction may not encourage\nachievement and may adversely affect the ability of a student to\nattend college,\" id., does not establish anything specific about\nwhether that putative problem is related to disparate educational\nopportunity or treatment according to race.\n    Of course, this finding is obvious and indisputable as far\nas it goes: when students receive lower levels of instruction,\nthey are less likely to feel encouraged to achieve and thus will\nbe less likely to attend college. Yet this truism merely serves\nto underscore the more fundamental question at issue here -- on\nwhat basis are students placed in \"lower levels of instruction\"?\nAs we already have made clear, that basis was not racially\ndiscriminatory; the record does not support the claim that\nstudents of one race are afforded college preparation\nopportunities (advanced placement classes, counseling, help in\npreparing for college placement exams) that students of another\nrace are not.\n    Thus although the finding that \"lower levels of instruction\nmay not encourage achievement\" is problematic, especially when\nviewed in isolation, yet when considered in relevant socio-\neconomic context, this statement of mere possibility cannot be\nregarded as proof that the district court clearly erred in\ndetermining that the school districts have achieved unitary\nstatus. The district court dutifully presented this finding in\ncombination with many others and, after carefully analyzing these\nfindings in their totality, declared that \"there is no credible\nevidence linking any current racially identifiable conditions to\nthe prior violation\" Id. at 823 (footnote omitted).\n    This, too, must be said. Although the Constitution requires\nthat all of its citizens have equal access to the pursuit of\neducation, and that they be given equal breaks while attending\nschool, it does not insist that they all finish even. The proper\ntest under the Constitution is equality of opportunity, not of\nresults. On this point we would do well to recall Edmund Burke's\npithy formulation: \"[A]ll men have equal rights, but not to equal\nthings.\" And indeed, Appellant articulated its commitment to\nthis principle at oral argument: \"[w]e have never suggested that\nthe measure here is ultimate equal outcomes.\"\n    That everyone does not finish even is tragic, of course, but\nit does not amount to a constitutional violation. Nor does it\nviolate the school districts' mandate regarding student\nassignment under Green. Accordingly, we conclude that the\ndistrict court properly determined that, as to student\nassignment, the districts achieved unitary status through good\nfaith compliance with the requirements of the 1978 Order.\n\n                B. Faculty and Staff Assignments\n\f    Before the 1978 consolidation, the vast majority of black\nadministrators and teachers served two predominantly black\ndistricts. In September 1978, the districts reassigned faculty,\nadministrative and other certificated staff in all eleven\ndistricts. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that\nthe districts now have balanced their faculties to a degree that\nis virtually unprecedented among those school districts in this\ncountry that operate under court orders. The district court\nfound that the districts closely monitor the racial composition\nof their faculties and do not hesitate to block transfers and to\nmake reassignments, overriding seniority where necessary, to\nensure diverse racial representation at each school. Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 802-04. The record testimony of senior\nadministrative officials from each of the four districts supports\nthese findings.\n    Appellant does not refute either the district court's\ncalculations or its conclusion of racial balance among the\nfaculties, but nonetheless argues that the district court's\nfinding that the vestiges of de jure segregation have been\neliminated to the extent practicable is clearly erroneous because\nthe overall percentage of minority teachers within the districts\nhas declined by two or three percent since 1982. Appellant's Br.\nat 10. This gradual decline does not indicate clear error,\nhowever, because the shortage of minority teachers in the four\nschool districts is not a vestige of de jure segregation in\nNorthern New Castle County, but rather a manifestation of an\nunfortunate contemporary national trend. Indeed, even\nAppellant's expert testified that there is a critical shortage of\nblack teachers in the public schools. JA 1167-68 (the number of\nblack students graduating from colleges in the United States with\nbachelor degrees in the field of education has declined); see\nalso Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 482-83 (1992).\n    The record further reveals that, notwithstanding the\nshortage of available faculty, the districts hired minority\ncandidates at rates two to four times greater than the available\npercentage of minorities in regional and national pools. JA\n6566. This is attributable in part to the extensive affirmative\nminority recruitment efforts of each of the four school\ndistricts. For example, the Brandywine district has sought to\nexpand its pool of potential minority hires by recruiting not\nonly teachers who have received a degree in education from a 4-\nyear program, but teachers who have received their B.A. or B.S.\ndegrees in fields other than education and have prior teaching\nexperience. JA 620. The Christiana district has attempted to\nrecruit minority teachers by sending announcements to\npredominantly and historically black universities, by attending\ncareer days at predominantly black universities, and by hiring\nminorities as paraprofessionals. JA 603. The Colonial district\nhas assembled a task force to address minority faculty\nrepresentation. JA 633. And in the Red Clay district,\noccasionally a faculty position will be held open until a\nminority candidate is found. JA 624. Based on this record, the\ncourt did not clearly err in finding that the school districts\nhad demonstrated good faith efforts to integrate the faculties of\n\fthe schools.\n    We turn, then, to the racial balance among the \"non-\nprofessional\" or \"classified\" staff, which includes bus drivers,\nbus aides, secretarial and clerical positions, paraprofessionals,\ncustodial employees, and food service workers. The undisputed\nevidence of record establishes that the school districts have\nattempted to use the hiring process to improve racial balance on\nthe staff as new openings have materialized. For example,\nBrandywine recruits minority staff through community channels,\nfocusing on community centers, neighborhood churches and\ncommunity groups in minority areas. JA 621. Similarly,\nChristiana recruits through community newsletters, community\ncenters, and by \"word of mouth.\" JA 603.\n    Appellant concedes that the districts have made such\nefforts, but argues that the districts have not reassigned the\nstaff to maximize racial balance. The district court found\nthat it would be impractical for the districts to reassign these\nemployees in order to attain greater racial balance. We agree.\n    Food service workers, for example, earn approximately $3200-\n$4300 per year, working approximately three hours a day. JA 605.\nGenerally, these employees work close to where they live.\nTransferring them to a distant workplace that would require a\nlong commute simply is not feasible for the salary they receive.\nId. Secretarial and clerical personnel would experience a\nsimilarly negative economic impact. Id. Even Appellant's expert\nacknowledged that forced reassignment of these part-time, low-\nwage employees could create hardships on these workers with\nrespect to child care, commuting time, distance from work and\nexpenses. JA 1105. Accordingly, it was not clearly erroneous\nfor the court to conclude that the districts have eliminated to\nthe extent practicable any residual racial identifiability in the\nschools with respect to these employees.\n    We carefully have considered Appellant's contentions with\nrespect to faculty and staff assignment, and we conclude that\nthere was no clear error in the district court's findings.\n\n                  C. Extracurricular Activities\n    Appellant contends that the districts have not eliminated\nthe vestiges of de jure segregation from their extracurricular\nactivities. It is undisputed, however, that all extracurricular\nactivities within the four districts are open to students of all\nraces. All eligibility requirements are race-neutral, and\ndistrict officials encourage all students, regardless of race, to\nparticipate in a wide range of extracurricular activities.\n    Nevertheless, Appellant argues that the districts must also\neliminate any racial identifiability that exists within each of\nthese activities. In findings 98-100, 109-110, 118 and 125-128,\nthe district court indicated that, unfortunately, there exist a\nsubstantial number of racially identifiable extracurricular\nactivities throughout the four districts. We cannot, however,\nexpect a school district to compel or deny student participation\nin non-compulsory extracurricular activities merely to effect a\nracial balance.\n    The four districts have removed financial and transportation\n\fbarriers to participation. JA 1164. Moreover, each of the\ndistricts has demonstrated good faith efforts to reduce the\nracial identifiability of their activities through experimental\nprograms. For example, the Brandywine district invites all\neighth graders and their parents to the high schools to meet\nrepresentatives from the activities, JA 753; Christiana announces\nupcoming activities in newsletters and physical education\nclasses, JA 740; middle schoolers in Colonial are recruited to\nparticipate in activities when they enter high school, JA 743;\nand in Red Clay, coaches recruit students and expose them to\nvarious sports through the physical education curriculum, JA 680.\n    We believe that a school district's extracurricular\nactivities are unitary if they \"are available to all students\nwithin the School District regardless of race.\" Singleton v.\nJackson Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 541 F. Supp. 904, 908 (S.D.\nMiss. 1981); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 18 (\"With respect to\nsuch matters as . . . extracurricular activities,\" it may be\nenough \"to eliminate invidious racial distinctions.\"). School\ndistricts need not \"show equal participation.\" Lockett v. Board\nof Educ. of Muscogee County, No. 991 at 55 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 18\n1994) (citing Quarles v. Oxford Municipal Separate School Dist.,\n868 F.2d 750, 757 (5th Cir. 1989)). Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the record supports the district court's finding that the\ndistricts have eliminated to the extent practicable from their\nextracurricular activities the vestiges of past de jurediscrimination.\n\n  D.  Remaining Green Factors (Transportation and Facilities)\n    There is no dispute among the parties concerning the two\nremaining factors outlined in Green. Specifically,\ntransportation is provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\nAdditionally, the districts successfully have remedied the\ndistinctions between the facilities of the formerly black and\nformerly white schools.\n\n                       VI. Ancillary Relief\n    The 1978 order of this court required the implementation of\neight specific programs ancillary to the 9-3 pupil assignment\nplan. The order required the districts to:\n    1)   formulate and implement a comprehensive in-service\n         training program for teachers, administrators and other\n         staff in order to train personnel to cope with the\n         desegregation process;\n\n       2)   institute an affirmative reading and communication\n            skills program, which does not resegregate the pupils,\n            in order to remedy the effects of the past\n            discrimination;\n\n       3)   provide curriculum offerings and programs which\n            emphasize and reflect the cultural pluralism of the\n            students, and all instructional materials, texts and\n            other curriculum aids shall be free of racial bias;\n\n       4)   institute an effective and nondiscriminatory counseling\n\f         and guidance program. The counseling and guidance\n         program must insure that students are counseled on a\n         racially nondiscriminatory basis concerning all\n         programs available in the area of work opportunities\n         and opportunities for a college education;\n\n    5)   provide an appropriate human relations program . . .\n         [designed] to protect the individual dignity of\n         students and teachers and to prevent racial myths and\n         stereotypes from prevailing in schools undergoing\n         desegregation;\n\n    6)   develop . . . a code of rights and responsibilities . .\n         . provid[ing] for racially nondiscriminatory discipline\n         and . . . contain[ing] provisions to insure each\n         student in the desegregation area procedural and\n         substantive due process required by existing law. Such\n         a code will help to provide equal educational\n         opportunity to all students by protecting them from\n         unreasonable, discriminatory, and arbitrary rules; and\n         the Board shall not administer the code on a racially\n         selective or otherwise biased basis;\n\n    7)   reassign faculty, administrative and other staff\n         personnel to insure that schools do not retain their\n         former racial identity through racially identifiable\n         faculty and staff assignments; [and]\n\n    8)   establish and enforce nondiscriminatory guidelines for\n         new construction, review of building needs and the\n         appropriateness of each proposed building project or\n         school closing.\nJA 128-30; see also 447 F. Supp. at 1014; see also Evans v.\nBuchanan, 582 F.2d at 771-73.\n    The district court offered more than 180 factual findings in\ndetailing the school districts' implementation of these ancillary\nrelief provisions. In the first four years alone, more than\n$18.8 million in federal desegregation project grants were used\nto pay for human relations specialists, home-school liaisons,\nreading resource teachers and in-service programs. The state and\nthe districts maintained these programs even after the transition\nto a desegregated system. And significantly, from 1978 until the\nunitary status petition was filed, Appellant never complained to\nthe court of any failure to comply with any of the ancillary\nrelief provisions. Of these eight, the last is undisputed, and\nthe seventh we have addressed in our discussion on compliance\nwith the Green factors. Thus here we will review the district\ncourt's findings on the first six of these ancillary measures.\n\n                      A. In-Service Training\n    The district court found that all four districts offered a\nrich array of in-service programs for their faculty, and that,\nalthough the focus of these programs no longer is desegregation,\nall four districts continue to offer in-service training on\n\fdesegregation, race equity and multiculturalism. Coalition, 901\nF. Supp. at 809. Appellant contends that the district court's\nfindings are clearly erroneous because two of the Appellant's\nexperts testified that the in-service training was inadequate.\nAppellant's Br. at 25. But a reviewing court's role is not to\npick and choose isolated snippets of evidence. Rather, we must\ndecide, after viewing the record as a whole, whether there is\nevidentiary support for the district court's findings. Such\nsupport is present; accordingly, there is no clear error.\n     In January 1978, a team from the districts drafted a\nstatement listing several management goals for the in-service\ntraining of the faculty, staff and administration. The first\ngoal -- \"[t]o orient the instructional staff to the curricular\nand instructional process\" -- was accomplished through the Center\nfor Conflict and Desegregation at the University of Pittsburgh\nthe following month. JA 948-49, 4373, 4376-77. In addition, the\nteam responsible for planning in-service training also realized\nat least three other goals that year. Further, in 1978, an\nOffice of In-Service Activities was established and staffed by\ntwo full-time personnel, JA 951-52, and all programs relating to\ndesegregation were mandatory for faculty, staff and\nadministrators. JA 961-62. Finally, even Appellant's expert\ntestified that the in-service programs offered by the state at\nthe time of desegregation complied with the 1978 order. JA 1140,\n1170.\n     The record similarly supports the district court's finding\nthat the districts have continued in-service training programs\nsince the 1978 order. For example, the district court heard\nevidence that from 1981 through 1994, Brandywine offered various\nworkshops and courses related to desegregation, race equity and\nmulticulturalism. Moreover, all new Brandywine teachers are\nrequired to participate in a 12-hour induction program, which\nincludes a panel discussion on issues of multiculturalism. JA\n931.\n     Similarly, in the 1980s, various human relations specialists\nand administrators trained by the Race Desegregation Assistance\nCenter at the University of Pittsburgh worked with the Red Clay\nfaculty and staff in the area of cultural diversity. DI 1936 at\n635-36, 642. The record further reveals that from 1992 through\n1995, Red Clay also has offered in-service training on\nmulticulturalism. DX 79 at FL 12295, FL 12299, FL 12302, FL\n12304-11, FL 12313-14, DX 80; DXC 81; DI 1939 at 1806. The\ncourt's findings with regard to the Christiana and Colonial\ndistricts likewise are supported by the record.\n\n    In light of the foregoing, we are satisfied that Appellant's\ncharges have no support in the record, and thus that the district\ncourt properly found that the schools have met the requirements\nof in-service training.\n\n               B. Reading and Communication Skills\n    The district court found that an affirmative and integrated\nreading program was instituted in each of the four districts.\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 809. Appellant contends that the\n\ffinding is clearly erroneous, because the districts \"failed to\nshow that any reading program was implemented for the purpose of\nremedying the negative effects of the de jure segregation as\nrequired by the 1978 Order, or that the reading programs that\nwere implemented did not resegregate students.\" Appellant's Br.\nat 26. However, although no reading program specifically\ntargeted black students, we conclude from our review of the\nrecord that the districts nevertheless met the standard of good\nfaith compliance with the 1978 Order.\n    The record indicates that a reading program was instituted\nin the schools in 1978, immediately following the issuance of the\nremedial order. JA 967. The program employed 110 reading\nteachers, who\n    worked with the classroom teacher to help with testing,\n    interpretation of those data from the tests, selection of\n    materials, planning of program and strategies for students\n    who needed assistance and anything that [a] particular\n    teacher wanted, to do to help the students within that\n    classroom.\n\nJA 968.   Students in grades two through nine were provided\nassistance under the reading program if they were one year or\nmore below reading level, as demonstrated by standardized test\nscores. JA 968. Students in grades ten through twelve were\nprovided assistance if they were two years below level. Id. And\nsupplemental reading instruction was provided daily for 30-45\nminutes, depending on grade level. JA 969. For the most part,\nthis instruction occurred in small groups within the classroom.\nId. The districts combined have employed between 100 and 135\nreading teachers every year since the 1981-82 school year. JA\n4910-11.\n    Further, the court heard evidence and found facts pertaining\nto the reading programs in each of the four districts. With\nregard to the Red Clay district, for example, the court credited\nthe testimony of officials from the district and found that\n    reading resource teachers coordinate the \"HOSTS\"\n    program (Help One Student to Succeed) for reading- and\n    writing-deficient students. Under the program,\n    volunteer tutors work with individual children for 45\n    minutes per week. More than 300 students participate\n    in the program.\n\n    [Twenty five] parent educators hired by the Parents as\n    Teachers program teaches [sic] first-time parents in\n    New Castle County the importance of language and\n    reading for pre-school children. The program has been\n    in existence since 1987. In 1993 and 1994, the focus\n    was on teenage parents and families with multiple\n    needs.\n\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 810 (footnote omitted). The court\nfound similar progress in the other districts.\n    Because these programs were meant to address the reading\nproblems of every student, Appellant's argument that the program\n\fresegregated students is misguided. Although the school\ndistricts have not excluded black (or white) students from the\nremedial reading programs to effect a racial balance, the\ndistricts do deploy several different programs such as one-on-\none, small group and pull-out remedial reading programs, in which\nreading teachers either work inside the classroom or pull a given\nstudent out of the classroom for individual attention. Thus we\ncannot agree that the districts' remedial reading programs have\nresegregated students; the basic requirement of good faith\nefforts to remove the vestiges of de jure segregation to the\nextent practicable have been met. Accordingly, the district\ncourt did not clearly err.\n    Appellant further contends that the school districts have\n\"failed to show that any `communications skills program' was ever\nimplemented\" in any of the districts. Appellant's Br. at 26.\nHowever, there is no meaningful distinction between reading\nskills programs and communication skills programs; indeed, the\n1978 Order mandates the creation of a singular \"program\" to teach\nreading and communication skills. JA 129. Likewise, testimony\nfrom school officials on this point suggests that instruction for\nboth skills is combined. Thus \"reading skills\" and\n\"communications skills\" are synonymous for purposes of our\nanalysis here. Accordingly, on the basis of our foregoing\ndiscussion of reading skills and programs, we reject Appellant's\nargument that the districts have not complied with the 1978\nOrder.\n\n                          C. Curriculum\n    The 1978 Order required that the curriculum \"emphasize and\nreflect the cultural pluralism of the students,\" and that \"all\ninstructional materials, texts and other curriculum aids shall be\nfree of racial bias.\" JA 129. Appellant argues that the school\ndistricts \"failed to show that [an] inclusive curriculum as\nrequired by the 1978 Order was ever actually taught in a single\nclassroom or that efforts made were anything other than sporadic\nor shortlived, or that the curriculum achieved any results at\nall.\" Appellant's Br. at 27. This sweeping assertion does not\ncomport with the record.\n    The record indicates that the Delaware Department of Public\nInstruction has established text selection guidelines for the\ndistricts to use in conjunction with their own guidelines to\nensure racially unbiased texts and instructional materials. The\nDepartment also has adopted a Comprehensive Policy for\nMulticultural Education, published accompanying guidelines,\nsponsored multicultural education and adopted multicultural\ncurriculum standards. See, e.g., DX 124 at FL 23147; DX 125 at\nFL 23172. In April 1994, consistent with these guidelines, the\nDepartment sponsored a two-day Multicultural Education Institute.\nDX 52.\n    Further, the district court made specific findings that\nacknowledged efforts in each of the four districts to offer a\nmulticultural curriculum. Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 810-12.\nOur review of the record reveals several exemplary programs,\nincluding the Brandywine district's extensive black history\n\fcurriculum in the elementary schools; Christiana's inclusion of\nthe minority community in the textbook selection process;\nColonial's course entitled \"Minorities USA\"; and Red Clay's\nintegration of cultural pluralism into the social studies,\nEnglish language arts, art education and music education\ncurriculum guides.\n    In light of this substantial record evidence supporting the\ndistrict court's findings, we are satisfied that the court did\nnot clearly err when it found that the schools have complied with\nthe court order as to curricular reform.\n\n                   D. Counseling and Guidance\n    The 1978 Order required the districts to \"institute an\neffective and nondiscriminatory counseling and guidance program .\n. . [to] insure that students are counseled on a racially\nnondiscriminatory basis\" concerning post-secondary opportunities.\nJA 129. Appellant argues that the districts \"failed to show that\nany effort had been made to ensure that the counseling and\nguidance programs attempted to prevent resegregation of students\nin the classroom as required by the 1978 Order or that, in fact,\nthe counseling and guidance programs did not become vehicles for\nresegregation. The School System failed to show that the\ncounseling and guidance programs achieved any results at all.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 26. Again, the record belies Appellant's bold\nassertions.\n    In the spring of 1978, the New Castle district formed a\ncommittee \"to follow the directive of the Court at the time [--]\nto develop a nondiscriminatory developmental guidance program for\nall students.\" JA 770. The committee drafted guidelines, which\nthe district adopted in the Handbook for Certified Guidance\nCounselors. JA 770-71. In 1981, the Department modified the\nguidelines for district and statewide use in the Delaware\nGuidance Handbook, K-12, which was itself revised in 1990 as\nAppendix B to the Handbook for K-12 Education. JA 770-71.\n    The record further establishes that, from 1981 to 1991,\nthese Department guidelines governed counseling programs within\nthe districts. For example, in 1990, the state directed each\ndistrict to prepare \"a written plan describing the guidance\nprogram for the district which is reviewed periodically and\nupdated at least every five years.\" DX 230 at D 1464. Plans for\neach district subsequently were drafted and approved. JA 755,\n769-70, 852, 864, DX 230, DX 231, DX 232, DX 233, DX 234. The\ndistrict programs described in the plans include academic,\npersonal, social, career and life-planning counseling. JA 1137.\n    The court's detailed description of the programs established\nin each of the districts also is supported by the record.\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 813-814. Especially mindful of\nalleged disparities in the Red Clay school district, we emphasize\nthat the record clearly supports the district court's\ndetermination that that district administers aptitude tests,\nprovides speakers, supplies ample resource material, offers\nparticipation in various achievement programs, and facilitates an\nextensive college visitation program. JA 772-74.\n    In sum, it is clear that the State Board has adopted\n\fnondiscriminatory counseling guidelines; that all the districts\nhave provided comprehensive post-secondary career, educational\nand vocational assistance; and that the districts support\nnumerous supplementary counseling programs which encourage\nminorities to pursue post-secondary education. Moreover,\nAppellant fails to cite any instance of discriminatory\ncounseling. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not err\nin determining that this aspect of the remedial order was\nfulfilled.\n\n                        E. Human Relations\n    The 1978 Order required the districts to \"provide an\nappropriate human relations program\" for \"schools undergoing\ndesegregation.\" JA 130. The provision was intended to be\ntransitional, designed to address \"the various pressures which\narise as a result of desegregation.\" Evans, 582 F.2d at 769.\nAppellant argues that \"[t]he School System failed to show that\nany human relations program was actually implemented as written .\n. . or that any human relations program lasted for more than a\nbrief duration or achieved any results at all.\" Appellant's Br.\nat 24-25. Nevertheless, the record supports the district court's\nfindings.\n    The school districts responded to the order by implementing\na program involving more than 100 specially trained and certified\nspecialists who were assigned to schools in \"biracial teams.\" JA\n763-64. Each high school and junior high school had at least one\nteam, and these teams were also directed to serve a number of\nelementary schools. Id. These specialists provided crisis\nintervention assistance and implemented student support programs,\nsuch as peer tutoring and counseling. JA 764-66. Because the\ndesegregation went smoothly, the focus of the program soon\nshifted to multicultural awareness, problem-solving and other\nstudent support functions. JA 764. The districts continued\nthese services by retaining human relations personnel and hiring\nelementary guidance counselors, social workers, community\noutreach personnel, visiting teachers, student advisors, student\nrelations specialists and other student support personnel. SeeCoalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 815-16.\n    Moreover, the district court described in detail the\nprogress in each of the four districts. Again directing our\nfocus to the Red Clay district, we note that \"Red Clay employed\n16 human relations specialists and home/school advisors in 1981-\n82 and 18 in 1982-83\" and \"five human relations specialists and\nhome/school advisors\" as recently as 1993-94. Coalition, 901 F.\nSupp. at 816 (crediting Defendant's Exhibit 111).\n    Notwithstanding the necessary (and welcome) shift in the\nfocus of the human relations program, it clearly has lasted\nbeyond \"a brief duration\" and has yielded significant results.\nAccordingly, these findings support the district court's\ndetermination that the school districts complied with the court\norder as to human relations programs.\n\n                        F. Discipline\n   The 1978 Order required the development of a code to provide\n\f\"racially nondiscriminatory discipline\" and to ensure \"procedural\nand substantive due process.\" JA 130. In July 1978, the New\nCastle district adopted a code of conduct drafted by a \"committee\n[which had] gathered similar documents from Delaware and large\ndesegregated school districts for review.\" JA 4436. Prior to\nadoption, drafts of the code were reviewed by citizen groups,\nstudent council leaders, the Teachers' Association, and\nadministrators. JA 4435-36. The districts adopted the New\nCastle code in 1981, and each district has revised the code\nperiodically since then, through a \"process of development and\ncontinual revision that includes [the] involvement of others,\nthat includes teachers, includes administrators, and there are\nprocesses for the codes to be reviewed by external sources and\nhave input.\" JA 719.\n    Appellant's discipline expert concedes that the districts'\ncodes are not \"discriminatory on their face.\" JA 1157. And the\ndistrict court found that the codes \"are not applied in a\ndiscriminatory fashion.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 817.\nAppellant argues, however, that the school districts have failed\nto reduce racial disparities in discipline rates among students,\nand that Appellant was denied the opportunity to admit expert\ntestimony in support of this claim. However, on this matter the\nrecord supports the district court's findings, as well as its\nexercise of discretion.\n    The district court's finding that discipline is not\nadministered in a discriminatory fashion is supported by the\ntestimony of Dr. Charles Achilles, the school districts' expert.\nDr. Achilles calculated indices by dividing the percentage of\nblack student suspensions by the black enrollment percentage.\nBased on these data, Dr. Achilles determined that the districts'\nsuspension indices reflected less racial imbalance than indices\ncalculated from national suspension data compiled by the Office\nof Civil Rights and Delaware arrest data. JA 722-23. Dr.\nAchilles further illustrated that the indices were essentially\nconsistent across the four districts -- \"a result difficult to\nachieve if equitable nondiscriminatory codes were not being used\nand applied in an equitable, nondiscriminatory manner.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 817; see JA 724. And finally, Dr.\nAchilles demonstrated \"consistency in how the codes were applied\nby administrators, regardless of the administrators' race.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 817; see JA 725. In light of this\ncompelling testimony, we conclude that the district court did not\nclearly err in determining that, as to discipline, the school\ndistricts have complied with the 1978 Order. See Krasnov, 465\nF.2d at 1302 (standard of review).\n    Nor did the district court err in rejecting the testimony of\nAppellant's discipline expert, Dr. William Gordon. He could cite\nno study or authoritative literature to support his assumption\n\"that 'undiscipline' or misbehavior is a randomly distributed\ncharacteristic among racial groups . . . .\" JA 1161. And in\nfact, statistical data demonstrate a comparable or greater racial\ndisproportion for those offenses for which Delaware law mandates\nsuspension, which Gordon called \"very objective\" offenses, than\nfor those offenses he viewed as less objective. JA 726.\n\fAccordingly, we reject Appellant's argument that the schools have\nfailed to reduce racial disparities in discipline rates.\n\n    We likewise reject Appellant's contention that expert\ntestimony on this matter was improperly rejected by the district\ncourt. A trial judge's exclusion of testimony cannot be\ndisturbed on appeal \"absent a clear abuse of discretion.\" Semper\nv. Santos, 845 F.2d 1233, 1238 (3d Cir. 1988); Fashauer v. New\nJersey Transit Rail Operations, 57 F.3d 1269, 1287 (3d Cir.\n1995). In both Semper and Fashauer, the court upheld the\nexclusion of rebuttal testimony because of counsel's failure to\nadhere to a pretrial order. Semper, 845 F.2d at 1238; Fashauer,\n57 F.3d at 1287.\n    Here, Appellant disregarded two pretrial orders requiring\nthe disclosure of the \"specific subject matter as to which each\nexpert will testify\" and the provision of expert reports\ncomplying with Rule 26, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nDenying Appellant's motion to delay disclosure of the identity of\nits experts, the district court stressed, more than three months\nbefore trial, that \"[t]his is a case where the interests of\njustice dictate public disclosure of the parties' experts and\nearly resolution of any potential disputes regarding any experts'\nqualifications.\" JA 203, 208.\n    Rule 26 states that \"[t]he report shall contain a complete\nstatement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and\nreasons therefor\" and obligates a party to supplement the report\nif it \"learns that in some material respect the information\ndisclosed is incomplete or incorrect . . . .\" Fed. R. Civ. P.\n26(a)(2)(B) & (e)(1). Supplementation must be made \"with special\npromptness as the trial date approaches.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e).\nExclusion of testimony is an appropriate sanction for failure to\nsupplement in a timely manner. See Freund v. Fleetwood\nEnterprises, Inc., 956 F.2d 354, 358 (1st Cir. 1992).\n    As of November 30, Appellant knew all of the State Board's\nexperts' topics and methodologies. Appellant could have, but\ndeclined to, file a supplemental report for expert witness de\nLeeuw on December 9, as it did for three of its other experts.\nAppellant also could have disclosed its intent as a result of\ncounsel's comments at the deposition on December 15. Instead,\nAppellant chose the tactical route of surprise. In light of the\nforegoing discussion, we conclude that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding this surprise testimony.\n\n          VII. Areas of Concern to the District Court\n             and Allocations of the Burden of Proof\n\n         Aside from its examination of the four school\ndistricts' compliance with the Green factors and the ancillary\nrelief measures, the district court also acknowledged that\ncertain performance disparities persist in the New Castle County\nschools -- most notably in the Red Clay district. These\nperformance disparities include student achievement, special\neducation, and dropout rates, and are not disputed here.\nHowever, because these disparities are not among the vestiges\n\fenumerated either in Green or in the ancillary relief order, we\nmust determine, first, whether these disparities actually are\nvestiges of de jure segregation, and if so, whether the school\ndistricts have in good faith eliminated them to the extent\npracticable. Having considered the taxonomy of disparities\nproffered by Appellant and reviewed the record and pertinent\nlegal precepts, we hold that Appellant properly was allocated the\nburden to prove that the disparities were vestiges, and that the\nAppellant failed to meet this burden.\n         The Court has made plain that certain disparities\nnecessarily are vestiges of de jure segregation. Identifying\nwhat would become known as the Green factors, the Court directed\nschool boards to propose plans designed to disestablish state-\nimposed segregation in \"every facet of school operations --\nfaculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities and\nfacilities.\" Green, 391 U.S. at 435. Accordingly, and as the\nrelevant cases cited by Appellant demonstrate, the Court\nconsistently has turned to the Green factors to \"determin[e]\nwhether a dual school system has been disestablished.\" Columbus,\n443 U.S. at 458-61 (Green factors). See also Davis v. Board of\nSch. Comm'rs of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 37 (1971) (pupil\nassignment); Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. at 538\n(pupil assignment and school construction). Indeed, the Greenfactors have\nbecome per se vestiges of de jure segregation -- and\ntherefore the focal point for determining unitary status.\nNevertheless, the performance disparities enumerated by Appellant\nare not among these factors.\n         Still, the Green factors are not the only disparities\nthat may be classified as vestiges of de jure segregation.\nDepending on the circumstances of a particular case, the trial\ncourt still may exercise discretion to consider other factors.\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.   The circumstances of the instant\ncase prompted the district court, in 1978, to order eight\nancillary remedial measures. As with the Green factors, we have\nreviewed the districts' compliance with that order and conclude\nthat there was a good faith effort to eliminate the vestiges\nidentified therein to the extent practicable. Again, however,\nthe performance disparities urged here were not identified among\nthese vestiges of de jure segregation.\n         We emphasize that here we are not discussing the burden\nof proving compliance with the Green factors or the 1978 Order,\nas to which the school districts acknowledge bearing the\nevidentiary burden. Our discussion here, and our allocation of\nthe burden of proof to Appellant, is limited to the issue of\nproving that the identified performance disparities are vestiges\nof de jure segregation.\n         Because the performance disparities claimed by\nAppellant are not among (or even similar to) the Green factors or\nthe vestiges identified in the 1978 Order, we will not simply\npresume -- as Appellant urges us to do -- that these are vestiges\nof de jure segregation. Appellant offers no persuasive authority\nfor establishing a causal link between present achievement\ndisparities and past de jure segregation. In fact, all but one\nof the cases relied on by Appellant on this point are irrelevant,\n\fbecause they address only Green-type factors; the State Board\ndoes not dispute that it carried the burden of proving good faith\nefforts to eliminate (to the extent practicable) such vestiges of\nde jure segregation.\n         Appellant thus can rely solely on Vaughns by Vaughns v.\nBd. of Educ. of Prince George's County, 758 F.2d 983, 990-91 (4th\nCir. 1985), which, upon our review, supports the district court.\nIn Vaughns, because the school district was not unitary with\nrespect to the Green factor of student assignment, id. at 990-91,\nthe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the\nplaintiffs were entitled to a presumption that disparities in\nspecial education and gifted and talented programs arose from\nprior segregation. More important, the Vaughns court\ndistinguished a decision from a sister circuit because \"the\nburden shifted to [Appellants] in that case only because the\nschool system had achieved unitary status with regard to student\nassignment.\" Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 991.\n         Here, however, the districts have been unitary as to\nschool assignments since the 1978 order. Had the Vaughns school\ndistrict satisfied the Green factors as have the Delaware\ndistricts before us, the Vaughns plaintiffs would have had to\nprove that performance disparities resulted from de juresegregation. The\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit so held\nin two subsequent cases. See Riddick by Riddick v. School Bd. of\nCity of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 534 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 479\nU.S. 938 (1986); School Bd. of the City of Richmond, Va. v.\nBaliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1312 (4th Cir. 1987). The same result\nshould obtain here.\n         Further, we must respect the Court's teaching that \"a\nschool board is entitled to a rather precise statement of its\nobligations under a desegregation decree\" and to \"a like\nstatement from the court\" for when \"such a decree is to be\nterminated or dissolved.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 246 (citing\nPasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424 (1976)).\nBecause we are reluctant to impose any unstated obligation on the\nschool boards, we allocate the burden to prove any additional\nviolation to the Appellant. See Jenkins, 115 S. Ct. at 2055-56\n(to require a remedy, inferior student achievement must be proven\nto have resulted from de jure segregation); see also Keyes v.\nSchool Dist. No. 1, C.A. Nos. C-1499, 69-M-1499 (D. Colo. Sept.\n12, 1995), slip op. at 14 (\"The Court's opinion in . . . Jenkins. . .\ndefeats the plaintiffs' call for compelling additional\naction to investigate and redress racial disparities in student\nachievement . . . [when the] court has never made any findings\nthat such differences are the result of discrimination by the\nDistrict\").\n         In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that\nAppellant failed to carry its burden. The district court's\nfinding that persistent student performance disparities were\ncaused by socioeconomic factors is supported by the record.\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 818-19. The district court cited\nvarious demographic data from the 1990 U.S. Census and the 1992\nVital Statistics Report of Delaware that illustrate a\n\"black/white gap\" in the geographic area contained in the four\n\fschool districts, and in New Castle County generally, as to\nsocioeconomic conditions.   The record establishes that \"Blacks\nin the desegregation area are in an inferior position\neconomically to whites, and [that] that gap is wider in New\nCastle County than it is in the nation as a whole.\" Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 818.\n         Further, the record supports a causal link between\nthese socioeconomic factors and student achievement across the\nfour districts: \"There is consistency between the gap in\nsocioeconomic status with the gap in achievement, with Brandywine\nstatistics demonstrating the greatest disparity in both areas,\nColonial the least disparity.\" Id. With such support in the\nrecord, these findings cannot be clearly erroneous. Anchoring\nits determination on these unfortunate, but uncontroverted,\nsocioeconomic factors, the court found, inter alia, that\n\"[b]ecause the environment outside school is so strong,\ncumulative, and varied, schools cannot overcome such\nenvironmental/differences [sic] among children.\" Id. at 819. We\nagree.\n         Accordingly, we affirm the district court's allocation\nof the burden of proof and its determination that persistent\nperformance disparities are not vestiges of de jure segregation.\n\n                         VIII. Conclusion\n         The task of setting forth reasons for affirming the\ndistrict court's judgment would have been lightened considerably\n-- and this opinion made benevolently more brief -- had the\nCoalition not chosen to mount a scatter-gun attack on virtually\nevery aspect of the district court's comprehensive opinion.\nIndeed, the Coalition portrays nearly 20 years of federal court\nsupervision of Delaware public education as a cheerless and\nsorrowful failure. As our discussion has shown, however, the\nCoalition's contentions, in the main, have been expressed in\nconclusory language that neglects to demonstrate where the\ndistrict court erred and fails to appreciate the narrow standard\nof review by which we are constrained.\n         Moreover, the Coalition repeatedly has failed properly\nto acknowledge the importance of pervasive socioeconomic\nconditions that account for discrepancies among the races in\neducational performance. Indeed, the Coalition avoids the\nresponsibility of carefully examining the roots of the continuing\nblack/white achievement gap, a brutal national phenomenon first\ndocumented in the 1960s and substantiated in various recent\nstudies that \"demonstrate that if socioeconomic characteristics\nare more equalized, achievement levels are more equalized.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 819. These studies conclude that\n\"[i]t is difficult for children to take equal advantage of\nlearning opportunities absent the initial and cumulative\nadvantages of a stimulating home curriculum,\" and that \"[b]ecause\nthe environment outside school is so strong, cumulative, and\nvaried, schools cannot overcome such environmental/differences\namong children.\" Id.\n         These conclusions support our belief, presented in the\nforegoing discussion, that none of the Coalition's arguments\n\fconcerning special education, discipline and dropout rates,\nstudent achievement, extra-curricular activities or disparities\nin college matriculation can seriously be considered without\nweighing the impact of critical demographic data. This the\nCoalition has failed to do, choosing instead to focus its primary\nenergies on arguing for continued federal court supervision of\nthe schools -- as if a federal judge's order could eliminate,\nwith the stroke of a pen, broad social problems.\n         As humans, we acknowledge with melancholy the fact that\nmany socioeconomic factors militate against a completely level\nplaying field in our society. As judges, however, we are\npowerless to alter formidable social, economic and demographic\nforces and conditions over which no legal precept has control.\nMoreover, we are constrained to fulfill an obligation to address\nonly those constitutional questions properly presented to us, and\nto show fealty to appropriate standards of review, lest we\nabandon the limits on judicial power that give coherence to our\npolitical system. The district court articulated the meaning of\nthese institutional limits for this case:\n         [t]he continued existence of racial discrimination in\n         our society as a whole, and the effect of that\n         discrimination on the ability of a black child to enter\n         school on an equal footing with more privileged white\n         schoolmates, are not matters in dispute in this\n         litigation.\n\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 823. Unfortunately, in its\npresentation the Coalition repeatedly has refused to accept the\nfundamental concept that this court's scope of review is limited\nto determining whether the district court clearly erred in\nconcluding that the school districts have achieved unitary\nstatus.\n         The history of our jurisprudence contains no true\nprecedent for the micromanagement of school systems by the\nfederal courts. Indeed, our authority to supervise these school\ndistricts does not stem from the Anglo-American common law\ntradition, in which the law evolves through judicial reasoning\nbased on legal principle; instead, our legitimacy here derives\nexclusively from the powers that inhere in equity jurisdiction,\n\"another stream that flowed alongside the common law, whose\nheadwaters were in the discretionary royal prerogative. Equity\nwas a more flexible process, more unprincipled, initially quite\nad hoc.\" Thus the jurisprudential basis for 20 years of\ndetailed management of the Northern New Castle County school\nsystem has been, simply, a remedy framed in equity to enforce a\ndesegregation decree.\n         This equitable remedy and, by definition, its\njurisprudential legitimacy, were meant to have a limited\nlifespan. The remedy was designed to serve only as an implement\nfor monitoring and guidance, not as a permanent substitute for\nstate and local school boards, or indeed, for the state\nlegislature. Thus in our zeal to insure maximum educational\nopportunities for all Delaware school students, the federal\ncourts must bear in mind that the responsibility for\n\fadministering the schools ultimately belongs to locally elected\nofficials. Indeed, we must acknowledge that although it has been\nproper for us to supervise multiple generations of students in\nthe service of unassailable ideals, in the process we have also\ndenied multiple generations of elected officials the freedom to\nparticipate fully in representative government. For 20 years\nthere has been a constant colloquy between federal judges and\nofficers of these political institutions, a score of years in\nwhich to achieve desegregation \"with all deliberate speed,\" as\nordered in Brown II, 349 U.S. 294, 301 (1955).\n         In ruling that the school districts of Northern New\nCastle County have at long last truly respected our specific\norders of desegregation, the district court has cut the umbilical\ncord extending from the courtroom to the classroom. Institutions\nthat normally are free to exercise powers traditionally granted\nthem (and them alone) in the American political process now are\nfree to assume those powers. The time has come for the courts to\nstep back. What Roscoe Pound said almost a century ago still is\nmost appropriate: \"[W]hen men demand too much of law, when they\nseek to devolve upon it the whole burden of social control, when\nthey seek to make it do the work of the [school,] home and . . .\nchurch, enforcement of law comes to involve many difficulties.\"\n         The judgment of the district court declaring unitary\nstatus will be affirmed.\n\nCoalition to Save our Children v. State Board of Education of the\nState of Delaware et al., No. 95-7452\n_________________________________________________________________\nSAROKIN, J., dissenting:\n         One hundred years ago, the United States Supreme Court\nturned its back on the constitutional promise of equal protection\nof the law that this country made to its African-American\ncitizens in the aftermath of the Civil War. In Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), the Court upheld the\nconstitutionality of laws requiring the racial segregation of\npublic facilities, including public schools, as \"within the\ncompetency of the state legislatures,\" id. at 544, and validated\nthe infamous doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" See id. at 552\n(Harlan, J., dissenting).\n         No one at the time could have truly believed for one\ninstant that there was a shred of equality between the systems\nserving the white children and black children of the dual school\nsystems. Yet it took close to sixty years for the Supreme Court\nto acknowledge the reality of segregation. In one of the most\nglorious moments of the history of the federal judiciary, the\nCourt, speaking in a unanimous voice, effectively repealed the\n\"separate but equal\" doctrine by holding, in Brown v. Board of\nEducation, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954), that \"in the field of public\neducation the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place.\"\n         Along with Topeka, Kansas, the Supreme Court in Brownwas\nconsidering the fates of three additional school systems:\nSouth Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. Delaware became a part\nof this historic decision after the state's Supreme Court ordered\ntwo districts to admit black children into de jure all-white\n\fschools. Gebhart v. Belton, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952). It was the\nappeal from that decision that was consolidated with the Topeka\ncase.\n         There was no straight and unwavering march toward a\ncolor-blind school system in the aftermath of Brown, however.\nRather, desegregation in Delaware and elsewhere has had a \"long,\ntortured history,\" Evans v. Buchanan, 447 F. Supp. 982, 1000 (D.\nDel.), aff'd, 582 F.2d 750 (3d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 446 U.S.\n923 (1980). Resistance to the mandate of Brown was fierce, and\nat times violent. Then-Governor George Wallace of Alabama spoke\nfor many when, standing on the front steps of the University of\nAlabama in Tuscaloosa, he denounced the \"illegal usurpation of\n[state] power by the Central Government\" and tried to block\nadmission of African-American youngsters into the state\nuniversity system.\n         Delaware officials, as well, proved less than\nresponsive to the constitutional mandate to desegregate the\nstate's public schools and, as a result, the federal courts were\ncompelled to enforce the mandate one ruling at a time,\nculminating with this Court's desegregation order in 1978. Evans\nv. Buchanan, 582 F.2d 750 (3d Cir. 1978) (in banc), cert. denied,\n446 U.S. 923 (1980). Today we are asked to lift this order.\n              The Majority accurately reflects the tortured\nhistory of this matter. The elapse of four decades of litigation\nand court supervision clearly militates against its continuance,\nbut it is also evidence of begrudging compliance with repeated\ncourt orders to desegregate. I find it ironic that the delay in\nimplementing the orders of this court to end segregation is now\nbeing utilized to justify the end of court intervention.\nAlthough it is very tempting to end judicial supervision in the\nface of substantial progress, it would be unfortunate to abandon\nit just short of success. I dissent, not because I conclude that\nany of the findings of the district court are erroneous, but\nrather because accepting them causes me to conclude that some\nvestiges of past discrimination may remain, although I concede\nthat many have been eliminated.\n              I concur with the majority's recognition of the\nneed to return control of schools to local communities, but only\nif and when we are satisfied that the goals established some 18\nyears ago have been substantially met. I challenge the\nmajority's suggestion that the court's role in these matters has\n\"denied multiple generations of elected officials the freedom to\nparticipate fully in representative government.\" Majority at\n68. The denial of that participation, if it occurred, was not\ndue to judicial usurpation but rather arose from the\ndiscriminatory and unconstitutional conduct of many of those\nelected officials. It is not the courts who have delayed the\nreturn to local power, but it is those elected officials who\nfailed to act \"with all deliberate speed.\" Brown v. Board of\nEducation [Brown II], 349 U.S. 294, 301 (1955). Even if we are\nto withdraw our supervision at this juncture, I see little need\nto apologize for the court's intervention in these matters.\nWithout such intervention our schools would have remained\nseparate and unequal and a segment of our nation would have been\n\fdenied rights and opportunities to which all are entitled.\n\n                      I. Shared principles\n         Before I articulate the reasons for my dissent, I want\nto underscore the shared premises under which the majority and I\noperate.\n         There is, first of all, no disagreement that \"to extend\nfederal court supervision indefinitely is neither practicable,\ndesirable, nor proper,\" Majority at 16, and this is not what I\nadvocate today. At the same time, the Supreme Court has held\nthat supervision by the courts should continue until \"the\nvestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 492 (1992).\nBecause the Appellees have not met this requirement, I believe\nthat withdrawal of supervision is premature at this point.\n         Nor is there any disagreement between the Majority and\nthe Dissent that \"[t]he proper test under the Constitution is\nequality of opportunity, not of results.\" Majority at 31. To\nthe extent that the principal issue in this Dissent is the\nplacement of African-American children in lower-level classes,\nand to the extent that the district court itself found that\n\"lower levels of instruction may not encourage achievement and\nmay adversely affect the ability of a student to attend college,\"\nCoalition to Save our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 901 F.\nSupp. 784, 801,   49 (D. Del. 1995), it is their opportunity to\nsucceed academically that is at stake.\n         Finally, I share the Majority's \"reluctan[ce] to impose\nany unstated obligation on the school boards.\" Majority at 61.\nAt the same time, we should not impose or tolerate any\nlimitations on the opportunity of young black students to\nparticipate equally in the educational process and derive all of\nthe benefits therefrom.\n\n                      II. Factual findings\n         I now turn to the substantive review of the district\ncourt's ruling. First, I agree with the Majority's conclusion\nthat the vestiges of segregation have been eliminated with\nrespect to the following areas: intra-district student racial\nbalance, Majority at 18-20; special education student assignment,\nid. at 21-24; faculty and clerical staff assignment, id. at 32-\n36; extracurricular activities, id. at 37-38; transportation, id.at 39;\nfacilities, id.; in-service training, id. at 41-44;\nreading skills, id. at 44-47; curriculum, id. at 48-50;\ncounseling and guidance, id. at 50-52; human relations, id. at\n52-53; and discipline, id. at 53-57.\n         However, I cannot agree with the Majority that the\nAppellees demonstrated, or that the district court correctly\nconcluded, that the vestiges of segregation have been eliminated\nwith respect to the following facets of school operations:\nstudent classroom assignment; certified staff assignment; and\ncommunications skills programs. I therefore would remand to the\ndistrict court for further findings regarding these three areas.\nIn addition, because classroom assignment affects student\nachievement, I would remand for further findings regarding the\n\fso-called \"areas of concern.\" Finally, because the district\ncourt did not apply the correct legal standard regarding the\nexclusion of the testimony of one of the Coalition's experts, I\nwould remand for further findings on this issue as well.\n                 A. Student classroom assignment\n         I note, first of all, that \"the school districts\nacknowledge bearing the evidentiary burden\" of proving compliance\nwith this issue, other Green factors and the 1978 Order. SeeMajority at\n59.\n         1. The district court's findings and conclusions\n         Findings 30 to 49 of the district court's opinion\nconcern student classroom assignments. Coalition, 901 F. Supp.\nat 799-401. Findings 34 through 49 focus more specifically on\n\"tracking\" or \"ability grouping,\" i.e., the assignment of\nstudents \"to various instructional groups on the basis of\nability.\" Id. at 800-01. Among the court's findings are the\nfollowing:\n              36. The extent to which elementary and\n         middle school students are placed in classes\n         according to their ability is unclear from\n         the record.\n\n                             * * *\n\n             38. In 1993, the percentage of\n        minorities in the self-contained honors and\n        gifted student program at Burnett Elementary\n        School [the only self-contained \"gifted\"\n        student program in the 4 districts, id. at\n        800 n. 27], who scored above 85% on exams is\n        slightly greater than that for the other\n        groups.\n\n                             * * *\n\n             46. A review of the percentages of the\n        racial groups who were taking college and\n        non-college prep classes illustrates that: a)\n        a little over 50% of Brandywine's black\n        students in grades 9-12 were taking non-\n        college prep English, whereas a little less\n        than 20% of Brandywine's white students were\n        taking that level of English; b) a little\n        over 60% of Christiana's black students in\n        grades 9-12 were taking non-college prep\n        English, whereas a little less than 25% of\n        Christiana's white students were taking that\n        level of English; c) a little over 50% of\n        Colonial's black students in grades 9-12 were\n        taking non-college prep English, whereas a\n        little less than 35% of Colonial's white\n        students were taking that level of English;\n        d) a little over 40% of Red Clay's black\n        students in grades 9-12 were taking non-\n\f         college prep English, whereas a little less\n         than 17% of Red Clay's white students were\n         taking that level of English. Less than 5%\n         of black students were enrolled in advanced\n         English in the high schools of the 4\n         districts; however, over 20% of white\n         students were at that level.\n\n              47. There is evidence that among high\n         school students who achieve identical testing\n         scores [\"The comparison apparently does not\n         include academic achievement as measured by\n         course performance, or whether such placement\n         was requested or required.\" Id. at 801\n         n.30.], black students were more likely to be\n         placed in the lower level class than were\n         white students.\n\n              48. On the other hand, the percentage of\n         minorities enrolled in honors and AP classes\n         who scored over the 75th percentile in\n         reading or math in the spring of 1993 is\n         slightly greater than that of whites in all 4\n         school districts.\n\n              49. There is evidence that lower levels\n         of instruction may not encourage achievement\n         and may adversely affect the ability of a\n         student to attend college.\n\nId. at 800-01 (citations omitted).\n         Taken together, these findings demonstrate that: (1)\nAfrican-American students are less likely to be assigned to high-\nlevel classes than their white counterparts, and more likely to\nbe placed in low-level classes [ 46]; and (2) these disparate\nassignments are made at least in part for reasons other than\nacademic merit, since black students who perform as well as white\nstudents are \"more likely to be placed on the lower level class\nthan [are] white students\" [ 47; see also     38, 48]. In the\nabsence of alternative explanations, these findings permit the\ninference that the four districts' tracking practices may be\nbased, at least in part, on racial considerations. Furthermore,\nthe court's findings demonstrate that these disparate tracking\nassignments may deprive African-American students of the\nopportunity to achieve the same level of academic success,\nincluding college admission, as their white counterparts [ 49].\n         The district court made no additional finding of fact\nregarding alternate explanations for these \"potentially\ntroubling\" findings, see Majority at 24. Furthermore, whereas it\nwas able to conclude, with regard to school-based student\nassignments, that \"[t]he 4 districts are among the most racially\nbalanced schools in the United States,\" see Coalition, 901 F.\nSupp. at 799,   29, it reached no such conclusion regarding\ntracking-based assignments.\n\f         The court did conclude as a legal matter that \"there is\nno credible evidence linking any current racially identifiable\nconditions to the prior violation,\" id. at 823, and that \"the\nvestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.\" Id. at 823-24. I believe that the evidence\ndiscussed supra does not support this conclusion.\n         First of all, the court's own findings constitute\n\"credible evidence\" potentially linking one racially identifiable\ncondition -- i.e., the racial disparities in assignment to high-\nlevel and low-level classes -- to \"the prior violation.\"\n         Second, while the findings regarding student tracking\ndo not prove conclusively that the school districts discriminate\nin their tracking practices on the basis of race, they certainly\ndo not support the opposite conclusion -- i.e., that the\ndistricts do not discriminate on the basis of race. If anything,\nthe court's findings create a presumption that race might be a\nfactor in New Castle County's tracking practices. Since the\nburden with regard to the Green factors -- including student\nassignments -- is on the Appellees to prove that the vestiges of\nsegregation have been eliminated, and since the Appellees offered\nno explanation for the disparities in tracking, the uncertainty\nas to the cause of the disparities should be resolved in favor of\nthe Coalition, and therefore the district court's conclusion that\nthe vestiges have been eliminated, at least with regards to\nstudent classroom assignment, was unsupported and premature.\n                    2. The Majority's analysis\n         Despite the disparity between the court's own findings\nof fact and its conclusions of law, the Majority affirms the\ncourt's conclusion. I believe that the Majority's position is\nbased on the wrong standard of review, the wrong allocation of\nburdens and an unsustainable reading of the evidentiary record.\n                               (a)\n         First, the Majority defines \"our task\" as \"to inquire\nwhether the district court's determination of the districts'\nunitary status was clearly erroneous.\" Majority at 26. The\ndistrict court's determination as to unitary status, however, is\none not of fact, which we would review for clear error, but of\nlaw, see Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 822-23, which as is customary\nwe subject to plenary review.\n                               (b)\n         Second, time and again the Majority dismisses the\nimport of the district court's factual findings by resolving gaps\nin the evidentiary record and ambiguities as to those factual\nfindings in favor of the Appellees, despite the fact that by its\nown acknowledgment, and that of Appellees, Appellees bear the\nburden of showing that the vestiges of discrimination have been\neliminated.\n         (i) The Majority dismisses the district court's finding\nthat \"among high school students who achieve identical testing\nscores, black students were more likely to be placed in the lower\nlevel class than were white students,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at\n801,   47, as \"no[] . . . evidence that black students have not\nreceived equal opportunity.\" Majority at 25. While the Majority\nconcedes that this \"potentially troubling\" finding might\n\f\"suggest[] on its face that black students may have been\nsegregated from white students of equal testing aptitude,\" id. at\n24, it rejects this conclusion on the ground that the comparison\ndid not \"consider[] as well the important factor of academic\nachievement based on course performance,\" and that \"it is not\nclear whether the placement at issue was requested or required.\"\nId. at 25.\n         Of course, the evidentiary gaps that the Majority\nidentifies do not nullify the import of the district court's\nfinding as to potential disparate treatment of equally qualified\nstudents based on race. Furthermore, these gaps should not serve\nto exonerate the party that bears the burden of proof;\nuncertainty as to the significance of the district court's\nfactual finding should not be resolved in favor of the party that\nbears the burden.\n         (ii) The Majority dismisses the district court's\nfinding that \"the percentage of minorities enrolled in honors and\nAP classes who scored over the 75th percentile in reading or math\nin the spring of 1993 is slightly greater than that of whites in\nall 4 school districts,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801,    48, as\n\"so limited, and thus malleable, a sample,\" Majority at 25, as to\nallow any number of inferences. Specifically, while the Majority\nacknowledges that \"this finding could . . . give rise to an\ninference that blacks must perform at a higher level than whites\nin order to be placed in honors and AP classes,\" it suggests that\n\"we may just as reasonably infer something quite different: that\nthe school districts' good faith efforts to desegregate have paid\noff in terms of the improved testing performance of black\nstudents.\" Id. at 25-26.\n         The Majority's inference, even assuming that it is one\nan appellate court could draw, is unconvincing at best: the issue\nis not whether some black students perform well, but rather\nwhether black students must perform better than whites to be\nplaced in honors and AP classes, which the district court's\nfinding clearly suggests. In any case, once again it is\ninappropriate -- and legally erroneous -- to dismiss the\nCoalition's interpretation because another interpretation, more\nfavorable to Appellees, is possible when the burden lies with\nAppellees.\n         (iii) The Majority dismisses the district court's\nfinding that \"[t]he extent to which elementary and middle school\nstudents are placed in classes according to their ability is\nunclear from the record,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800,    36,\nas \"mean[ing] little on its own, for it represents merely that\nthere is uncertainty in the record about how elementary and\nmiddle school students are placed in classes according to their\nability.\" Majority at 26.\n         True enough. However, uncertainty about student\nplacement merely demonstrates that Appellees have failed to meet\ntheir burden of showing that the vestiges of discrimination have\nbeen eliminated. To suggest otherwise is to misallocate the\nevidentiary burden.\n         (iv) The Majority dismisses the district court's\nfinding of \"[e]vidence that lower levels of instruction may not\n\fencourage achievement and may adversely affect the ability of a\nstudent to attend college,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801,   49,\nas \"not establish[ing] anything specific about whether that\nputative problem is related to disparate educational opportunity\nor treatment according to race.\" Majority at 29.\n         The significance of this finding, however, is not to\ndemonstrate that black students are channeled to lower-level\nclasses, but that if they are, this would have a deleterious\neffect on their level of academic achievement. This finding,\nwhen read in the context of the district court's other findings\nsuggesting that students are assigned to different levels of\ninstruction based on race, is ominous and suggests that the poor\nperformance of black students in a number of areas might not be\nrelated solely to socioeconomic factors.\n                                (c)\n         At the end of its analysis, the Majority proclaims that\n\"[a]s we already have made clear, [the basis on which students\nare placed in lower levels of instruction] was not racially\ndiscriminatory.\" Majority at 29. In fact, neither the district\ncourt's findings nor even the Majority's analysis supports such a\nconclusion. At best, they suggest that the record is\nindeterminate regarding whether students are assigned to certain\nlevels of instruction on the basis of race -- i.e., that\nAppellees have failed to establish that in the area of student\nassignment, the vestiges of discrimination have been eliminated\nto the extent practicable.\n                          3. Conclusion\n         For the foregoing reasons, I would remand to the\ndistrict court for further findings regarding the racial\ndisparities in tracking.\n                        B. Certified staff\n         Regarding the issue of staff assignment, the district\ncourt noted that \"[t]he staff is divided into three subsections:\nadministrative staff, certified staff, and classified staff.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 802,    50. As the court explained,\n\"'[c]ertified staff' includes nonadministrative certified\npersonnel such as teachers, psychologists, speech and hearing\ntherapists, educational diagnosticians and other 'instructional\nand pupil support personnel.'\" Id.,     52.\n         Except for teachers, the court made no finding\nregarding the racial identifiability of the schools with respect\nto the certified staff. Similarly, the Majority discusses the\ndistricts' efforts regarding the faculties, Majority at 33-35,\nand the \"non-professional\" or \"classified\" staff only, id. at 35-\n36, but in no way discusses the districts' efforts regarding\ncertified staff.\n         No one disputes that these professionals were included\nin the 1978 Order, and I see no reason for the district court's\nomission. Therefore, I would remand to the court for further\nfindings regarding whether vestiges with regard to certified\nstaff have been eliminated.\n                     C. Communication skills\n         The 1978 Order required the districts (which at the\ntime were consolidated into a single district) \"to institute an\n\faffirmative reading and communication skills program which does\nnot resegregate pupils.\" Evans, 447 F. Supp. at 1015-16. I do\nnot dispute the Majority's conclusion that \"the districts . . .\nmet the standard of good faith compliance with\" the Order\nregarding reading skills. See Majority at 45. However, the\ndistrict court made not a single finding regarding the\nimplementation of a communication skills program. See Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 809-10,     168-185.\n         The Majority contends that this oversight is\ninconsequential because \"there is no meaningful distinction\nbetween reading skills programs and communication skills\nprograms,\" Majority at 47, and that \"'reading skills' and\n'communications skills' are synonymous for purposes of our\nanalysis here.\" Id. at 48. However, there is no support in the\nrecord to read the \"communication skills\" requirement as mere\nsurplusage. I cannot agree with the Majority's suggestion,\neighteen years after the fact, that the language of the 1978\nOrder was merely sloppy or redundant. This suggestion is not\nonly in contradiction with the careful analysis of the district\ncourt at the time, but also with the plain meaning of the words.\nReading and communication are different forms of human activity,\nand they involve different skills. Therefore, I would remand to\nthe district court for further findings in this area.\n                        D. Areas of concern\n         In addition to the so-called Green factors and the\nancillary relief measures outlined by the district court in 1978,\nthe district court considered several \"areas of concern\" for\npossible discriminatory practices: student achievement; special\neducation; and dropout rates. Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 818-22.\nAs the Majority acknowledges, there is no dispute that\nsignificant disparities along racial lines remain in these\nvarious areas. See Majority at 57. The issue is whether these\ndisparities are legally cognizable vestiges of de juresegregation.   The\ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here is no\ncredible evidence demonstrating that the differences between\nblack and white children's success in school can be attributed to\nthe former de jure segregated school system.\" Coalition, 901 F.\nSupp. at 823.\n         In a very real sense, there can be no doubt that the\ncondition of many African-Americans in our society is a lasting\nlegacy of a time when people of color as a matter of law were\ndenied equality of opportunity. However, the Supreme Court has\nmade it clear that not all vestiges of de jure segregation are\n\"the concern of the law,\" but only those that \"have a causal link\nto the de jure violation being remedied.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503\nU.S. 467, 496 (1992).\n         With regard to the Green factors, causality is\npresumed. As the Majority explains, \"the Green factors have\nbecome per se vestiges of de jure segregation.\" Majority at 58.\nCausality is also presumed for the ancillary relief measures\ncontained in the 1978 Order. But the issue of establishing\ncausality is a more difficult one in the case of the identified\nperformance disparities.\n         I agree with the Majority that under the typical\n\fscenario, \"[b]ecause the performance disparities claimed by\nAppellant are not among (or even similar to) the Green factors or\nthe vestiges identified in the 1978 Order, we will not simply\npresume . . . that these are vestiges of de jure segregation.\"\nMajority at 59. I also agree with the Majority, however, that if\nthe district court ultimately were to find that the school\ndistrict has not achieved unitary status, the burden would shift\nand the plaintiffs would be entitled to a presumption of\ncausality. See id. at 60 (citing Vaughns by Vaughns v. Bd. of\nEduc. of Prince George's County, 758 F.2d 983, 990-91 (4th Cir.\n1985)).\n         As I explain supra, I believe that remand is\nappropriate in the instant matter for further findings regarding\nclassroom assignment. If the district court were to conclude on\nremand that students are assigned to different levels of\neducation based on race, under Vaughns v. Vaughns such a finding\nwould create a presumption of causal relationship between the dejure\nviolation and the disparities in achievement, and the\nevidentiary burden would shift to Appellees. We note, too, that\nthis presumption would be entirely consistent with the district\ncourt's own finding that \"lower levels of instruction may not\nencourage achievement and may adversely affect the ability of a\nstudent to attend college.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801,\n49.\n         Because any conclusion the court draws regarding class\nplacement may affect its conclusion that \"[t]here is no credible\nevidence demonstrating that the differences between black and\nwhite children's success in school can be attributed to the\nformer de jure segregated school system,\" id. at 823, I would\nvacate the court's conclusion regarding the so-called areas of\nconcern and remand for reconsideration in light of the above.\n             E. Exclusion of Jan de Leeuw's testimony\n         The Coalition argued on appeal that the district court\nimproperly excluded expert testimony it sought to present to\nrebut the defendant' own experts, and that it was prejudiced by\nthe exclusion. The Majority correctly notes that \"[a] trial\njudge's exclusion of testimony cannot be disturbed on appeal\n'absent a clear abuse of discretion.'\" Majority at 56 (citing\nSemper v. Santos, 845 F.2d 1233, 1238 (3d Cir. 1988); Fashauer v.\nNew Jersey Transit Rail Operations, 57 F.3d 1269, 1287 (3d Cir.\n1995)). However, review is plenary when the district court's\nevidentiary ruling \"implicates 'the application of a legally set\nstandard.'\" Lippay v. Christos, 996 F.2d 1490, 1496 (3d Cir.\n1993) (quoting Savarese v. Agriss, 883 F.2d 1194, 1200 (3d Cir.\n1989)).\n                       1. Factual findings\n         On November 2, 1994, the district court issued an order\nsetting up, inter alia, the framework for pre-trial discovery.\nIn particular, the court ordered that by November 9, 1994, \"each\nparty [should] designate which of its experts [would] testify at\ntrial and the specific subject matter as to which each expert\n[would] testify.\" Coalition to Save our Children v. Delaware\nBoard of Education, Nos. 1816-1822-SLR, slip op. at 4 (D. Del.\nNov. 2, 1994) (Order) (JA 318). The court further ordered the\n\fparties to \"exchange expert reports, the content of which will\ncomply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)\" by November 23. Id.,\nslip op. at 5 (JA 319).\n         The Coalition submitted its list of experts on November\n17. Among those listed was Dr. Jan de Leeuw, Director of the\nUCLA Statistical Consulting Center. Redesignation of Expert\nWitnesses, Coalition to Save our Children v. State Board of\nEducation, C.A. No. 1816-1822 SLR, slip op. at 2 (D. Del. Nov.\n17, 1994) (JA 346). Dr. de Leeuw was to \"be called as an expert\nwitness in the fields of statistical consultation, data analysis,\nand related matters.\" Id.\n         Dr. de Leeuw submitted his Report on Creation and Use\nof Database (hereinafter the \"de Leeuw Report\") on November 29,\n1994. JA 4041. The report deals exclusively with the\npreparation and construction of the database. One section,\nentitled \"Goal of Analysis,\" explains:\n         The analysis consists of providing expert\n         witnesses with tables. The tables depicted\n         the racial composition of districts and\n         schools with regard to outcomes of interest.\n         These tables provide the actual number and\n         percentages of students who fall within each\n         of these categories. In addition, the tables\n         include marginal (or conditional)\n         percentages.\nDe Leeuw Report at 14 (JA 4055).\n         An attorney for the school system wrote to the court on\nDecember 1 protesting that \"the expert reports provided by\nPlaintiff were incomplete,\" Letter from Rodman Ward, Jr. to Judge\nSue L. Robinson (Dec. 1, 1994) (JA 362), and asking that the\nCoalition provide \"expert reports that comply fully with Rule\n26(a)(2)(B)\" by December 9. Id.; see also Letter from Rodman\nWard, Jr. to Thomas D. Barr (Dec. 2, 1995) (JA 384). The\nCoalition apparently did not supplement Dr. de Leeuw's report by\nthat date. Board's Brief at 55.\n         Dr. de Leeuw was deposed on December 15. After being\ninitially asked if he would be \"offering any opinions in this\nmatter,\" he responded, \"Opinions, no. I have to describe the\ndatabase construction, and I don't think that involves any\nopinions.\" Deposition of Jan de Leeuw, Dec. 15, 1994\n(hereinafter the \"de Leeuw Deposition\") (JA 1562).   However,\nThomas Henderson, a counsel for the Coalition, intervened later\nduring the deposition to \"give [the Board's counsel] notice that\n[Dr. de Leeuw] may testify as to materials and analyses, data . .\n. in the defendants [sic] reports.\" Id. (JA 1563). Describing\nthis intervention as \"a real problem,\" Andre G. Bouchard, the\nschool system's counsel, requested that he be given notice if the\nCoalition intended to call Dr. de Leeuw to testify about\n\"anything outside of his report.\" Id. Mr. Henderson responded,\n\"Well, I heard your request and it's on the record, and I will\nconsider that.\" Id.\n         The same day, the Coalition informed the defendants of\nits intention to call three new rebuttal experts. One of these\nwitnesses was Dr. Franklin Fisher, a professor of economics at\n\fM.I.T., who was to testify on the statistical analysis methods\nused in the reports by Dr. Rossell, Dr. Armor and Dr. Walberg,\nthree of the Board's witnesses. JA 858. The defense objected\nduring a hearing held on December 27, on the ground that Dr.\nFisher's testimony would simply \"duplicate what [it] thought Mr.\nDeleeuw [sic] was supposed to do.\" JA 860. The next day, the\ncourt sustained the objection and excluded the new experts'\ntestimony:\n         The deadline for naming experts is long past.\n         The general context of defendants' experts'\n         testimony and methodology used by these\n         experts should have been of no surprise to\n         the plaintiff. Defendants would be\n         prejudiced if these experts were allowed to\n         testify. And plaintiff has not claimed\n         prejudice in the absence of their testimony.\nTr. 1572 (JA 863). The Coalition did not appeal the court's\nruling.\n         On January 3, 1995, the day of Dr. de Leeuw's\ntestimony, the Coalition's counsel handed to the defendants what\ndefendants describe as \"91 pages of charts and statistical data,\"\nBoard's Brief at 56, and signaled that it intended to call Dr. de\nLeeuw to offer rebuttal testimony regarding the analyses of three\nexperts for the defendants, Drs. Armor, Achilles and Reschly.\nBoards' Brief at 56. The new testimony sought from Dr. de Leeuw\nwas to be the same as that which the Coalition expected to elicit\nfrom Dr. Fisher, and that the court excluded on December 28. JA\n1229. This time again, however, the court excluded the testimony\non the ground that the Coalition's effort failed to comply with\nthe court's previous orders and with Rule 26.\n                        2. Legal analysis\n         The Coalition argues that the court's exclusion of Dr.\nde Leeuw's rebuttal testimony is contrary to Rule 703 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, as well as \"normal practice and the\ncommon usage of expert witnesses.\" Appellant's Brief at 47. The\nCoalition further argues that exclusion of Dr. de Leeuw's\ntestimony \"does not make sense since Dr. de Leeuw's testimony was\nfashioned, and could only have been fashioned, after the cross-\nexamination of the School System's witnesses and the production\nof data bases and disk files that were made during trial.\" Id.at 47-48.\nFinally, the Coalition argues that the excluded\ntestimony \"would have demonstrated a series of methodological and\nanalytical flaws fatally undermining [the Coalition's]\ntestimony.\" Id. at 47. Because the district court failed to\nconsider the importance of Dr. de Leeuw's proffered testimony, I\nwould remand.\n                               (a)\n         I note, first, that Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence is inapposite to the dispute at hand. Rule 703 states,\ninter alia: \"The facts or data in the particular case upon which\nan expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by\nor made known to the expert at or before the hearing.\" The\nsubject of the dispute over Dr. de Leeuw's testimony, and the\nreason for his exclusion, is the scope of his expertise as\n\fdefined in the Coalition's November 30 report, and more\nspecifically \"whether at this late stage in the proceeding the\nplaintiff should be given the opportunity to present affirmative\nevidence by an expert never before qualified in\" the area of\nstudent achievement. JA 1230 (statement by The Court).\n         Similarly, the cases cited by the Coalition as\nevidencing \"normal practice and the common usage of expert\nwitnesses\" are of no relevance in the instant case. The issue in\nthe first two cases was whether an expert should be allowed to\ntestify after attending the testimony of other witnesses,\nallegedly in violation of an order by the court excluding all\nwitnesses from the courtroom during trial. United States v.\nCrabtree, 979 F.2d 1261, 1270 (7th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 114\nS. Ct. 216 (1993); United States v. Bramlet, 820 F.2d 851, 855\n(7th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 861 (1987). Nor does the\nthird case cited by the Coalition, an unreported district court\nopinion, offer any support for its argument. Laysears v.\nSchindler Elevator Corp., No. Civ. A. 94-3152 (E.D. Penn. Sept.\n27, 1995).\n                               (b)\n         The Coalition next argues that Dr. de Leeuw's testimony\ncould only have been fashioned after cross-examination of the\nBoard's witnesses and the production of databases and disk files\nduring trial. There are two problems with this argument. The\nfirst is that regardless of when specific data was given to the\nCoalition, the Coalition was aware all along that the school\nsystem would present statistical analyses as part of its\nargument, and it was aware by late November of the areas for\nwhich statistical analysis would be presented. The second\nproblem has to do with the chronology of what information was\navailable and when. As just noted, as of November 30, the\nCoalition knew the subjects on which the school system's various\nexperts would testify, and the extent to which they relied on\nstatistical analysis. JA 1289. As to specific experts,\n\"anything that Dr. Achilles relied on in his testimony was\nentirely in the appendix to the report on the 30th in terms of\nall the backup data for his tables.\" JA 1290. Regarding Dr.\nReschly's testimony, \"the backup tables for all of that data [the\ndata on which Dr. Reschly relied] were all contained in the\nappendix that [the school system] delivered on November 30th.\"\nId. Finally, as to Dr. Armor, it appears from the school\nsystem's uncontroverted testimony that \"[h]is methodology is\ndescribed in his report. The statistical analysis is described\nin his report. The assumptions that he made in his regression\nmethodology is described carefully and fully in his report.\" Id.\nTherefore, the only data that was missing as of December 1 was\nspecific census data used by Dr. Armor in his work -- but again,\nwhile the Coalition may not have had all the data as of November\n30, it knew the scope and methodology of the testimony to be\npresented by the school system. Therefore, the district court\nwas certainly acting within its discretion when it found that the\nCoalition failed to comply with its orders regarding Dr. de\nLeeuw's belated testimony.\n                               (c)\n\f         Our analysis does not end with the district court's\nfinding, however. It has been the \"consistent position\" of the\nThird Circuit that \"'the importance of the excluded testimony is\none of the factors to be considered in deciding whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding a witness.'\" Sowell v.\nButcher & Singer, Inc., 926 F.2d 289, 302 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting\nMeyers v. Pennypack Woods Home Ownership Assn., 559 F.2d 894, 904\n(3d Cir. 1977), overruled on other grounds, Goodman v. Lukens\nSteel, 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir. 1985), aff'd, 482 U.S. 656\n(1987)). Other factors include: \"bad faith on the part of the\nparty seeking to call witnesses not listed in his pretrial\nmemorandum,\" Meyers, 559 F.2d at 904; \"ability of the party to\nhave discovered the witnesses earlier,\" id.; \"validity of the\nexcuse offered by the party,\" id.; \"willfulness of the party's\nfailure to comply with the court's order,\" id.; and \"the parties'\nintent to confuse or mislead his [sic] adversary.\" Id.. As the\ncourt in Meyers explained, the following \"basic considerations\"\nshould guide the court's decision:\n         (1) the prejudice or surprise in fact of the\n         party against whom the excluded witnesses\n         would have testified, (2) the ability of that\n         party to cure the prejudice, (3) the extent\n         to which waiver of the rule against calling\n         unlisted witnesses would disrupt the orderly\n         and efficient trial of the case or of other\n         cases in the court, and (4) bad faith or\n         willfulness in failing to comply with the\n         court's order.\nId.at 904-05; see also DeMarines v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 580\nF.2d 1193, 1201-02 (3d Cir. 1978).\n         Furthermore, \"the likelihood of finding an abuse of\ndiscretion is affected by the importance of the district court's\ndecision to the outcome of the case and the effect it will have\non important rights.\" In re Paoli Railroad Yard PCB Litigation,\n35 F.3d 717, 750 (3d Cir. 1994) (citation omitted), cert. deniedsub nom.\nGeneral Electric Co. v. Ingram, 115 S. Ct. 1253 (1995).\n         There is no evidence in the record that the district\ncourt considered the importance of Dr. de Leeuw's proffered\ntestimony or several of the other factors outlined in Meyers.\nTherefore, I believe that we should vacate the district court's\ndecision to exclude Dr. de Leeuw's belated testimony and remand\nto the district court for the more complete consideration of Dr.\nde Leeuw's testimony that the law of this Circuit demands.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n         The presence of a number of young black students at the\nargument of this matter should serve as a compelling reminder to\nus that while we struggle over the sufficiency of proof and\nallocation of burdens, our decision today directly affects the\neducation and future of many of these young people.\n         As I cannot join the opinion of the Majority on the\nlegal grounds outlined above, neither can I join the condemnation\nof Coalition's counsel. Without the zealous advocacy\ndemonstrated throughout this case's history, much of what has\n\fbeen accomplished in the past two decades would not have been.\n         Nor can I join in the Majority's criticism of \"the\nmicromanagement of [segregated] school systems by the federal\ncourts.\" Majority at 67. The courts assumed their role in these\nmatters not out of an unquenchable thirst for power or a desire\nto intrude upon the province of others, but because of the\nfailure of those charged with the responsibility of ending\nsegregation to fulfill the duties imposed upon them and respond\nvoluntarily to the commands of Brown. The courts' authority in\nthese matters does not spring from arrogance, nor does it merely\n\"inhere in equity jurisdiction.\" Id. It is rooted in the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.\n         Much time has elapsed since the State of Delaware was\nfirst ordered to desegregate its schools and, admittedly, much\nhas been accomplished. But unless and until we can be certain\nthat all of the vestiges of past discrimination have been\neliminated to the extent practicable, supervision should not be\nabandoned. Considering that we are dealing here with the\neducation and future of a large number of tomorrow's leaders, to\ntrade additional time for greater equality is not a bad bargain.\n         Accordingly, I would remand for further consideration\nand findings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Introduction\n    This case brings to a close our supervision of more than\nfour decades of litigation designed to desegregate the public\nschools of Delaware.\n    However, we do not end our supervision hastily. After the\nDelaware schools' rudimentary attempts at desegregation were\ndeemed insufficient by the district court in 1957, and by this\ncourt in 1960, judges of this circuit blazed new jurisprudential\ntrails in 1975 by requiring an interdistrict remedy. By 1977 and\n1978, the judiciary had fashioned detailed orders for primary and\nancillary relief which, together with the factors set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in Green v. County School Bd. of New Kent\nCounty, Va., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968), constituted the marching orders\nfor the school system.\n    Still, it was not until almost 20 years later (and 35 years\nafter this court announced dissatisfaction with an original plan\nthat called for grade-by-grade desegregation over a 12-year\nperiod) that the district court could announce that the marching\norders had been obeyed: The school system has achieved unitary\nstatus by complying in good faith with our detailed desegregation\ndecrees and by eliminating to the extent practicable the vestiges\nof de jure segregation. This was the ruling of the district\ncourt embodied in a judgment entered after a lengthy hearing.\nThe Coalition to Save Our Students (\"Coalition\"), the\nrepresentative of the plaintiff class, has appealed. We will\naffirm.\n    It is beyond dispute that racism and bigotry continue to\ntear at the fragile social fabric of our national and local\ncommunities, and that our best efforts as citizens are needed to\naddress this problem at many levels. However, as the district\ncourt observed in the case at hand, court-supervised school\ndesegregation alone cannot eliminate racial discrimination:\n    [A]s the years have passed since Brown I and II [Brown v.\n    Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954) and Brown v.

Or as the\nCourt succinctly put it in Swann: \"One vehicle can carry only a\n\flimited amount of baggage. It would not serve the important\nobjective of Brown I to seek to use school desegregation cases\nfor purposes beyond their scope . . . .\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 22.\n    In light of this sobering truth, it is all the more\nimportant that we write the final chapter in this long period of\nsupervision by the federal courts and release our provisional\ngrip on the administrators and educators of Northern New Castle\nCounty, for only in so doing can we permit them to resume their\nfull role in the larger social and political effort to make our\nnation worthy of the best ideals of its members. The length of\nthe discussion that follows is but one indication of the\nimportance and sensitivity of the task at hand.\n\n                     II. Procedural History\n    Historically, Delaware required its public school pupils to\nattend segregated schools. Del. Const. art. 10    2 (1950) and\nRev.Code 1935   2631.

Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1955) (Brown II), remanding to the Supreme Court of\nDelaware for further proceedings to require \"a prompt and\nreasonable start toward full compliance\" with Brown I and \"to\neffectuate a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school\nsystem . . . with all deliberate speed.\" Brown II, 349 U.S. at\n300-01.\n    Yet notwithstanding the end of de jure segregation, the City\nof Wilmington continued to operate many racially identifiable\nschools. Accordingly, the district court fashioned an inter-\ndistrict remedy to eliminate the vestiges of segregation and,\nfaced with the state authorities' adamant and prolonged refusal\nto discharge their responsibilities, issued a remedial decree in\n1978. The 1978 Order required a 9-3 student assignment plan,\nwhich provided that all students would attend formerly\npredominantly \"white\" suburban school districts for a maximum of\nnine years and would spend at least three years in the formerly\n\"black\" school districts.\n    The 1978 Order also directed eight forms of ancillary relief\n\"necessary and essential to . . . overcome the vestige effects of\nde jure segregation,\" including: (1) an in-service training\nprogram for teachers; (2) an affirmative reading and\ncommunication skills program; (3) new curriculum offerings; (4) a\nnondiscriminatory counseling and guidance program; (5) a human\nrelations program; (6) codes of conduct providing for\nnondiscriminatory discipline; (7) the reassignment of faculty and\nstaff; and (8) nondiscriminatory guidelines for construction and\nmaintenance of school buildings.

Evans v. Buchanan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299292\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299292/evans-v-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

[the] four-district\nplan is viewed as a good faith effort to respond to repeated\njudicial invitations for appropriate State authorities to come\nforward with their own meaningful solutions to vexing problems.\"\nId. at 863, 874. However, because Judge Schwartz found the\n\"effort [to have] fallen short of the mark in the critical area\nof pupil assignment,\" he deferred for 60 days any order regarding\nthe State Board's motion for modification of the desegregation\ndecree in order to encourage \"curative legislation\" on the\nmatter. Id. at 872-74.\n    In 1990, Judge Schwartz made a specific finding that one of\nthe districts (Red Clay) had failed to comply in good faith with\nthe 1978 order. Coalition to Save Our Children v.

Judge Schwartz stated that\n\"the vestiges of prior official segregation [had not] been\neradicated 'root and branch' from either the Red Clay District as\na whole or from its student assignment patterns.\" Id. at 587.\nIndeed, Judge Schwartz found that the record was \"replete . . .\nwith evidence of delay, obfuscation, and recalcitrance on the\npart of the Red Clay Board with respect to remedying the racial\ndisparities\" in that district. Id. at 592-93.\n    In 1991, Judge Schwartz stated that, notwithstanding the Red\nClay District's \"technical compliance with this court's orders,\"\nhe again had \"very grave doubts concerning the [Red Clay] Board's\ngood faith compliance with the spirit of desegregation,\" and thus\ncould \"not make a finding that the Red Clay District [was]\noperating in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause . . . .\"\nCoalition to Save Our Children v.

Appellant conceded compliance\nwith two of the Green factors (transportation and facilities) and\none of the ancillary relief provisions (also concerning\nfacilities).\n    The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.    1331\n(1988).

Scope of Review\n    The Coalition's appeal presents us with three fundamental\nquestions for consideration: first, whether the district court\nproperly concluded that the four school districts of Northern New\nCastle County achieved unitary status by complying in good faith\nwith the desegregation decree and by eliminating to the extent\npracticable the vestiges of past discrimination; second, whether\nthe district court properly allocated to Appellant the burden of\nproving that certain racial disparities in student performance\nare proximately related to de jure segregation; and third,\nwhether the district court properly excluded certain expert\ntestimony proffered by Appellant.\n\n    The appeal to this court from the order declaring unitary\nstatus tracks a very narrow compass. Because the district\ncourt's finding that the school districts have achieved unitary\nstatus is factual, our review of that finding is limited to the\nclearly erroneous standard.

Unitary Status\n    The primary legal issue before us is whether the Northern\nNew Castle County school districts have fulfilled their\naffirmative duty to eliminate the former dual school system. The\nultimate end to be brought about by a desegregation remedy is \"a\nunitary, nonracial system of public education.\" Green, 391 U.S.\nat 436. A school system achieves this unitary status when it no\nlonger discriminates between school children on the basis of\nrace. See id. at 442. And a school system no longer\ndiscriminates among school children on the basis of race when it\naffirmatively has eliminated all vestiges of state-imposed\nsegregation. Id. at 435, 437-38 (school board charged with\naffirmative duty to eliminate racial discrimination \"root and\nbranch\"); Swann, 402 U.S. at 15 (\"the objective today remains to\neliminate from the public schools all vestiges of state-imposed\nsegregation\"). Thus our task, simply put, is to determine\nwhether the district court clearly erred in finding that the\nvestiges of de jure segregation have been eliminated in the\nBrandywine, Christiana, Colonial and Red Clay school districts.\nGreen, 391 U.S. at 435; see also Missouri v. Jenkins, ___ U.S.\n___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2038</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2055-56 (1995).\n    A critical starting point in identifying vestiges of\ndiscrimination is the degree of racial imbalance in the school\ndistricts. This inquiry is fundamental, because under the former\nde jure regime, racial exclusion was both the means and the end\nof a policy motivated by disparagement of, and hostility towards,\nthe disfavored race. The Court's 1968 opinion in Green squarely\naddressed this issue, noting that \"[t]he pattern of separate\n`white' and `Negro' schools . . . established under compulsion of\nstate laws is precisely the pattern of segregation to which Brown\nI and Brown II were particularly addressed.\" Green, 391 U.S. at\n435. However, the Green Court also made clear that in examining\nthe problem of racial imbalance in our schools, we are to look\n\"not just to the composition of student bodies . . . but to every\nfacet of school operations -- faculty, staff, transportation,\nextracurricular activities and facilities.\" Id.; see also Swann,\n402 U.S. at 18 (the Green factors are \"among the most important\nindicia of a segregated system.\") Because compliance with Greenfactors is\na condition precedent to unitary status, we will\nsurvey each of those factors here.\n    Nevertheless, the Green factors, which address racial\nimbalance, are not the only criteria by which we are to evaluate\nwhether the school districts have achieved unitary status. We\nmust also consider the eight programs of \"ancillary remedial\nrelief\" prescribed by this court in 1978, including: (1) an in-\nservice training program for teachers; (2) an affirmative reading\nand communication skills program; (3) new curriculum offerings;\n(4) a nondiscriminatory counseling and guidance program; (5) a\nhuman relations program; (6) codes of conduct providing for\nnondiscriminatory discipline; (7) the reassignment of faculty and\nstaff; and (8) nondiscriminatory guidelines for construction and\nmaintenance of school buildings. Evans v. Buchanan, 582 F.2d at\n\f769-74. Thus we will survey compliance with these ancillary\nrelief measures as well.\n    By considering both the Green factors and the eight measures\nof ancillary relief ordered by this court in 1978, we honor the\nmandate set forth by the Supreme Court in Dowell that a school\nboard under federal supervision \"is entitled to a rather precise\nstatement of its obligations.\" Bd. of Education of Okla. City\nPublic Schools, Indep. School Dist. No. 89, Oklahoma County, Okl.\nv.

Together, the Greenfactors and\nthe ancillary remedial relief measures constitute\nthese obligations, and thus precisely frame our inquiry as we\ndetermine whether the district court properly ordered the\nwithdrawal of federal supervision. The essence of that inquiry\nrecently was articulated by the Supreme Court:\n    whether the [constitutional violator] ha[s] complied in\n    good faith with the desegregation decree since it was\n    entered, and whether the vestiges of past\n    discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent\n    practicable.\nFreeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (1992).\n    Given the Court's recent assertion that federal supervision\nof local school districts \"`was intended as a temporary measure\nto remedy past discrimination,'\" Jenkins, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.\nCt. at 2049 (quoting Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247), we underscore that\nthe phrase \"to the extent practicable\" implies a reasonable limit\non the duration of that federal supervision. Indeed, to extend\nfederal court supervision indefinitely is neither practicable,\ndesirable, nor proper.\n    We are keenly aware that, for as long as we have imposed\nfederal supervision on local school boards, those bodies have\nsuffered the loss of their defining function -- control over\ntheir own schools. Thus in the present matter the citizens of\nthe New Castle school districts have been denied for nearly 20\nyears what the Court has described as the \"vital national\ntradition\" of \"local autonomy of school districts.\" Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 490 (quoting Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109728\"><a href=\"/opinion/109728/dayton-bd-of-ed-v-brinkman/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410 (1977)). Additionally, we appreciate the extended\nsocial and economic burdens that continued supervision would\nimpose on generations of innocent school children and their\nfamilies. The reality of these burdens becomes clear when we\nconsider that a child who entered first grade in one of the\nNorthern New Castle County school districts in 1976 under federal\ncourt supervision is now 26 years old, and possibly a parent with\na child of his or her own in the same judicially-controlled\nschool system.\n    Our concern for the autonomy of local school systems and\ntheir members is consistent with the established jurisprudence of\ndesegregation: a fundamental purpose of our mandate to eliminate\nthe dual system has been to encourage local school districts\nindependently to provide high-quality educational opportunities\nfor all students, a state of affairs made possible only in \"a\nunitary, nonracial system of public education.\" Green, 391 U.S.\nat 436. Were we to allow federal supervision to continue after a\n\ffinding that the school districts have complied with our\ndesegregation mandate, we would effectively preclude those school\ndistricts from achieving that goal. In sum, we cannot reconcile\nthe prospect of indefinite federal supervision of local school\ndistricts with the ultimate purpose of that supervision -- to\nfoster the creation of autonomous, racially balanced school\nsystems. Accordingly, we will remain attentive to the Supreme\nCourt's repeated instructions that such supervision be\n\"temporary\" and \"transitional.\" See, e.g., Jenkins, ___ U.S.\n___, 115 S. Ct. at 2049; Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247.\n    With these teachings in mind, we turn now to the district\ncourt's analysis in this case.\n\n                      V. The Green Factors\n    The fundamental issue before the district court was whether\nthe desegregation measures taken by the school districts had\neffectively eliminated to the extent practicable the vestiges of\nthe former dual school system. In addressing this issue, the\ndistrict court began by scrutinizing various educational factors\ninitially identified by the Court in Green: student assignments,\nfaculty, staff, facilities and resources, transportation, and\nextra-curricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at 435. We address\nthe district court's consideration of each of these factors in\nturn.\n\n                      A. Student Assignment\n    Because the crux of the original constitutional violation\nwas the legalized system of segregated schools, the traditional\nremedy for the violation was to desegregate the schools through\nstudent reassignment. Accordingly, we ordered the consolidation\nof urban and suburban school districts. See Evans v. Buchanan,\n582 F.2d at 759 n.5 (quoting Evans v. Buchanan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1424669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1424669/evans-v-buchanan/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n838-39 (D. Del. 1977) (footnotes omitted)). The State Board and\ndistricts not only have adhered to the requirements of our\nstudent assignment order, but also have attempted to maintain a\nracial balance by consolidating districts, redrawing attendance\nzones, and instituting the busing of thousands of students.\n    Indeed, after the hearing below on the Appellees' motion for\nunitary status, the district court found that the schools in\nthese districts were \"among the most racially balanced schools in\nthe United States.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 799. The court's\nconclusion finds ample support in the record from the testimony\nof school desegregation expert Dr. Christine Rossell. Using an\n\"index of dissimilarity,\" Dr. Rossell compared the racial\nbalance in the four districts to a national sample of 76 similar\ndistricts, analyzing both the percentage of students in schools\nwith certain variances and the percentage of schools themselves\nwithin certain variances.\n    Dr. Rossell observed that, as measured against this index,\nthe four Northern New Castle County school districts have\nachieved \"close to perfect racial balance.\" Further, on the\nbasis of her full analysis, Dr. Rossell concluded that these\ndistricts \"are much less racially imbalanced than . . . [the]\nnational comparison group.\" JA 568; see also Coalition, 901 F.\n\fSupp. at 797. Because the district court's finding of racial\nbalance rests on Dr. Rossell's thorough analysis, it is not\nclearly erroneous. See Krasnov, 465 F.2d at 1302 (an appellate\ncourt must \"accept the ultimate factual determination of the\nfact-finder unless that determination . . . is completely devoid\nof minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility\n. . .\").\n    Appellant does not contest the findings of racial balance\namong schools, but argues nonetheless that segregation persists\nwithin those buildings, in classrooms and programs. More\nspecifically, Appellant contends that black students are over-\nrepresented in certain classes, such as special education, and\nunder-represented in others, such as gifted and advanced\nplacement classes. However, we are mindful that in Milliken v.\nBradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109102\"><a href=\"/opinion/109102/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740-41 (1974), the Court held that the\nConstitution \"does not require any particular racial balance in\neach school, grade or classroom.\" See also Oliver v. Kalamazoo\nBd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387113\"><a href=\"/opinion/387113/michelle-oliver-v-kalamazoo-board-of-education-state-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (6th Cir. 1980) (rejecting notion\nthat school system is not unitary if black students are over- or\nunder-represented in various academic courses). Moreover, the\ndistrict court actually made 19 findings concerning the\ncircumstances of student assignments in the classrooms,\nconcluding that classroom balance throughout the districts was\nexemplary. Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800 (measured against a\nnational sample, classroom imbalance in Northern New Castle\nCounty was one-third to one-half that of other schools). We\nreview these findings for clear error.\n    First, although the district court's findings of classroom\nracial balance exclude special education classes, there is no\nclear error. In our 1978 desegregation order we expressly\nexcepted \"students presently attending and who in the future may\nattend . . . special education school facilities and such other\nsimilar special school facilities as presently exist or may be\nhereafter established . . . .\" JA 128 (Evans v. Buchanan, Civil\nAction Nos. 1816-1822, Order at 11 (D. Del. Jan. 9, 1978)). The\nrationale for this exception is obvious and compelling: students\n-- black or white -- should not be mainstreamed (i.e., denied\nspecial education meant to address special learning needs and\nproblems) merely to effect a racial balance.\n    Appellant is also unpersuasive in asserting that students\nare placed in special education programs (such as \"intensive\nlearning centers\") simply because they are black. Although in\neach of the four districts the percentage of black students in\nspecial education programs exceeds the percentage of blacks in\nthe overall student population, the record demonstrates that\nthe school districts classify students based on neutral, non-\ndiscriminatory state and federal criteria. JA 829-34.\nAdditionally, the districts make periodic re-evaluations of\nspecial education students to determine when they can return to\nregular classes. Id. Placement is not mandatory, because at\nseveral junctures, parents are empowered to reject the school's\nrecommendation to place their child in special education classes.\nJA 830, 832-33. Moreover, we note that the Appellee State Board\nhas created numerous statewide special education task forces; has\n\fauthorized five comprehensive studies relating to special\neducation; and thoroughly has investigated intervention\nstrategies, mainstreaming and the application of selection\nprocedures. JA 1223, 1243.\n    The Appellees' efforts to improve racial balance within\nthese programs not only are commendable, but successful. Indeed,\nin three of the four districts, the racial imbalances have\ndeclined. Although we might hope -- even expect -- that this\nimbalance will soon disappear, the mere fact that black\nstudents remain over-represented in special education classes\ndoes not make clearly erroneous the district court's finding of\nunitary status. Given that Dr. Reschly, in summarizing his\ncomprehensive analysis, concluded that in these school districts\n\"special education is not used as a means to separate students by\nrace,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 821; JA 839, we will accept the\ncourt's finding on this issue. See Krasnov, 465 F.2d at 1302\n(standard of review).\n    Similarly, Appellant argues that the district court's\nfindings with regard to classroom assignment are clearly\nerroneous because black students are under-represented in non-\nspecial education classes. This argument relies on, inter alia,the\ndistrict court's finding 47: \"[t]here is evidence that among\nhigh school students who achieve identical testing scores, black\nstudents were more likely to be placed in the lower level class\nthan were white students.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801\n(footnote omitted); JA 1385; JA 4249; JA 4305-07. To be sure,\nthis finding is potentially troubling, suggesting on its face\nthat black students may have been segregated from white students\nof equal testing aptitude. However, we must consider this\nfinding in the full context in which it was examined and\npresented by the district court. Thus we must consider that in\nfootnote 30, which accompanies this finding, the district court\nnoted that \"[t]he comparison apparently does not include academic\nachievement as measured by course performance, or whether such\nplacement was requested or required.\" Id. Because this\ncomparison relied on testing aptitude alone, rather than\nconsidering as well the important factor of academic achievement\nbased on course performance, and because it is not clear whether\nthe placement at issue was requested or required, we do not\nconsider finding 47 to be evidence that black students have not\nreceived equal opportunity, nor can we reasonably conclude that\nthe district court, upon its careful examination, clearly erred.\n    We observe also finding 48, which states that \"[o]n the\nother hand, the percentage of minorities enrolled in honors and\nAP classes who scored over the 75th percentile in reading or math\nin the spring of 1993 is slightly greater than that of whites in\nall 4 school districts.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801; JA\n6259. Although this finding could, as urged by Appellant, give\nrise to an inference that blacks must perform at a higher level\nthan whites in order to be placed in honors and AP classes, that\nis not the sole inference that could be drawn from so limited,\nand thus malleable, a sample. Indeed, on the basis of finding 48\nalone we may just as reasonably infer something quite different:\nthat the school districts' good faith efforts to desegregate have\n\fpaid off in terms of the improved testing performance of black\nstudents.\n    In any event, our task here is not to engage in such broad\nspeculation, nor to choose among possible inferences from the\ndata; rather, we are to inquire whether the district court's\ndetermination of the districts' unitary status was clearly\nerroneous. To accord this finding its proper value, therefore,\nit must be considered in the context of other, related findings.\nThis the district court did. Indeed, in view of the district\ncourt's copious research, we are assured that the court\ninterpreted this finding in the proper light in determining that\nthe districts have achieved unitary status.\n    At the urging of Appellant, we also have examined carefully\nthe district court's finding 36, which states that \"[t]he extent\nto which elementary and middle school students are placed in\nclasses according to their ability is unclear from the record.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800; JA 4214-21. This finding means\nlittle on its own, for it represents merely that there is\nuncertainty in the record about how elementary and middle school\nstudents are placed in classes according to their ability.\nIndeed, without further amplification, we are not persuaded to\nconclude that this statement cuts against the court's\ndetermination regarding the districts' good faith efforts to\neliminate de jure segregation. Again, we are required to place\nthis finding in context, bearing in mind that because few\nelective classes or courses are available to students at the\nelementary and middle school levels, the selective process for\nstudents is far more meaningful at the high school level. Thus\nwe must consider finding 36 in light of findings 39, 40 and 45.\n    Finding 39 describes the high school class selection process\nas involving \"class presentations by guidance counselors,\nbooklets with course descriptions, application by students in\nconsultation with family, individual guidance from guidance\ncounselors, and teacher input.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800;\nJA 755-56, 771-72, 851-54, 863-66. Not only is high school class\nselection the product of these various deliberations, but,\naccording to finding 40, \"[t]he parents and student have the\nultimate say in the level to which the student is assigned.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800; JA 1383.\n    And although finding 36 indicates that the record is unclear\non how elementary and middle school students are placed in\nclasses according to their ability, finding 45, when considered\nin its entirety, provides detailed information about the class\nplacement of high school students as set forth in the margin.\n    Accordingly, when we consider Finding 36 in the context of\nthese other relevant findings, we find unavailing the contention\nthat finding 36 provides significant evidence that minority\nstudents have not received an equal opportunity to succeed in the\npertinent school districts. The district court's multiple\nfindings on this particular issue suggest that the court did\nindeed consider \"every facet of school operations\" in determining\nthat the districts have achieved unitary status.\n    Finally, we note finding 49 of the district court's opinion,\nwhich states that \"[t]here is evidence that lower levels of\n\finstruction may not encourage achievement and may adversely\naffect the ability of a student to attend college.\" Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 801; PX 2262 at 82; PX 2265. As with the\nforegoing findings, although this finding may be considered\ntroubling on its face, alone it is neither definitive nor\nsubstantial enough to show clear error in the district court's\ndetermination of unitary status. The mere finding that evidence\nexists \"that lower levels of instruction may not encourage\nachievement and may adversely affect the ability of a student to\nattend college,\" id., does not establish anything specific about\nwhether that putative problem is related to disparate educational\nopportunity or treatment according to race.\n    Of course, this finding is obvious and indisputable as far\nas it goes: when students receive lower levels of instruction,\nthey are less likely to feel encouraged to achieve and thus will\nbe less likely to attend college. Yet this truism merely serves\nto underscore the more fundamental question at issue here -- on\nwhat basis are students placed in \"lower levels of instruction\"?\nAs we already have made clear, that basis was not racially\ndiscriminatory; the record does not support the claim that\nstudents of one race are afforded college preparation\nopportunities (advanced placement classes, counseling, help in\npreparing for college placement exams) that students of another\nrace are not.\n    Thus although the finding that \"lower levels of instruction\nmay not encourage achievement\" is problematic, especially when\nviewed in isolation, yet when considered in relevant socio-\neconomic context, this statement of mere possibility cannot be\nregarded as proof that the district court clearly erred in\ndetermining that the school districts have achieved unitary\nstatus. The district court dutifully presented this finding in\ncombination with many others and, after carefully analyzing these\nfindings in their totality, declared that \"there is no credible\nevidence linking any current racially identifiable conditions to\nthe prior violation\" Id. at 823 (footnote omitted).\n    This, too, must be said. Although the Constitution requires\nthat all of its citizens have equal access to the pursuit of\neducation, and that they be given equal breaks while attending\nschool, it does not insist that they all finish even. The proper\ntest under the Constitution is equality of opportunity, not of\nresults. On this point we would do well to recall Edmund Burke's\npithy formulation: \"[A]ll men have equal rights, but not to equal\nthings.\" And indeed, Appellant articulated its commitment to\nthis principle at oral argument: \"[w]e have never suggested that\nthe measure here is ultimate equal outcomes.\"\n    That everyone does not finish even is tragic, of course, but\nit does not amount to a constitutional violation. Nor does it\nviolate the school districts' mandate regarding student\nassignment under Green. Accordingly, we conclude that the\ndistrict court properly determined that, as to student\nassignment, the districts achieved unitary status through good\nfaith compliance with the requirements of the 1978 Order.\n\n                B. Faculty and Staff Assignments\n\f    Before the 1978 consolidation, the vast majority of black\nadministrators and teachers served two predominantly black\ndistricts. In September 1978, the districts reassigned faculty,\nadministrative and other certificated staff in all eleven\ndistricts. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that\nthe districts now have balanced their faculties to a degree that\nis virtually unprecedented among those school districts in this\ncountry that operate under court orders. The district court\nfound that the districts closely monitor the racial composition\nof their faculties and do not hesitate to block transfers and to\nmake reassignments, overriding seniority where necessary, to\nensure diverse racial representation at each school. Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 802-04. The record testimony of senior\nadministrative officials from each of the four districts supports\nthese findings.\n    Appellant does not refute either the district court's\ncalculations or its conclusion of racial balance among the\nfaculties, but nonetheless argues that the district court's\nfinding that the vestiges of de jure segregation have been\neliminated to the extent practicable is clearly erroneous because\nthe overall percentage of minority teachers within the districts\nhas declined by two or three percent since 1982. Appellant's Br.\nat 10. This gradual decline does not indicate clear error,\nhowever, because the shortage of minority teachers in the four\nschool districts is not a vestige of de jure segregation in\nNorthern New Castle County, but rather a manifestation of an\nunfortunate contemporary national trend. Indeed, even\nAppellant's expert testified that there is a critical shortage of\nblack teachers in the public schools. JA 1167-68 (the number of\nblack students graduating from colleges in the United States with\nbachelor degrees in the field of education has declined); see\nalso Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 482-83 (1992).\n    The record further reveals that, notwithstanding the\nshortage of available faculty, the districts hired minority\ncandidates at rates two to four times greater than the available\npercentage of minorities in regional and national pools. JA\n6566. This is attributable in part to the extensive affirmative\nminority recruitment efforts of each of the four school\ndistricts. For example, the Brandywine district has sought to\nexpand its pool of potential minority hires by recruiting not\nonly teachers who have received a degree in education from a 4-\nyear program, but teachers who have received their B.A. or B.S.\ndegrees in fields other than education and have prior teaching\nexperience. JA 620. The Christiana district has attempted to\nrecruit minority teachers by sending announcements to\npredominantly and historically black universities, by attending\ncareer days at predominantly black universities, and by hiring\nminorities as paraprofessionals. JA 603. The Colonial district\nhas assembled a task force to address minority faculty\nrepresentation. JA 633. And in the Red Clay district,\noccasionally a faculty position will be held open until a\nminority candidate is found. JA 624. Based on this record, the\ncourt did not clearly err in finding that the school districts\nhad demonstrated good faith efforts to integrate the faculties of\n\fthe schools.\n    We turn, then, to the racial balance among the \"non-\nprofessional\" or \"classified\" staff, which includes bus drivers,\nbus aides, secretarial and clerical positions, paraprofessionals,\ncustodial employees, and food service workers. The undisputed\nevidence of record establishes that the school districts have\nattempted to use the hiring process to improve racial balance on\nthe staff as new openings have materialized. For example,\nBrandywine recruits minority staff through community channels,\nfocusing on community centers, neighborhood churches and\ncommunity groups in minority areas. JA 621. Similarly,\nChristiana recruits through community newsletters, community\ncenters, and by \"word of mouth.\" JA 603.\n    Appellant concedes that the districts have made such\nefforts, but argues that the districts have not reassigned the\nstaff to maximize racial balance. The district court found\nthat it would be impractical for the districts to reassign these\nemployees in order to attain greater racial balance. We agree.\n    Food service workers, for example, earn approximately $3200-\n$4300 per year, working approximately three hours a day. JA 605.\nGenerally, these employees work close to where they live.\nTransferring them to a distant workplace that would require a\nlong commute simply is not feasible for the salary they receive.\nId. Secretarial and clerical personnel would experience a\nsimilarly negative economic impact. Id. Even Appellant's expert\nacknowledged that forced reassignment of these part-time, low-\nwage employees could create hardships on these workers with\nrespect to child care, commuting time, distance from work and\nexpenses. JA 1105. Accordingly, it was not clearly erroneous\nfor the court to conclude that the districts have eliminated to\nthe extent practicable any residual racial identifiability in the\nschools with respect to these employees.\n    We carefully have considered Appellant's contentions with\nrespect to faculty and staff assignment, and we conclude that\nthere was no clear error in the district court's findings.\n\n                  C. Extracurricular Activities\n    Appellant contends that the districts have not eliminated\nthe vestiges of de jure segregation from their extracurricular\nactivities. It is undisputed, however, that all extracurricular\nactivities within the four districts are open to students of all\nraces. All eligibility requirements are race-neutral, and\ndistrict officials encourage all students, regardless of race, to\nparticipate in a wide range of extracurricular activities.\n    Nevertheless, Appellant argues that the districts must also\neliminate any racial identifiability that exists within each of\nthese activities. In findings 98-100, 109-110, 118 and 125-128,\nthe district court indicated that, unfortunately, there exist a\nsubstantial number of racially identifiable extracurricular\nactivities throughout the four districts. We cannot, however,\nexpect a school district to compel or deny student participation\nin non-compulsory extracurricular activities merely to effect a\nracial balance.\n    The four districts have removed financial and transportation\n\fbarriers to participation. JA 1164. Moreover, each of the\ndistricts has demonstrated good faith efforts to reduce the\nracial identifiability of their activities through experimental\nprograms. For example, the Brandywine district invites all\neighth graders and their parents to the high schools to meet\nrepresentatives from the activities, JA 753; Christiana announces\nupcoming activities in newsletters and physical education\nclasses, JA 740; middle schoolers in Colonial are recruited to\nparticipate in activities when they enter high school, JA 743;\nand in Red Clay, coaches recruit students and expose them to\nvarious sports through the physical education curriculum, JA 680.\n    We believe that a school district's extracurricular\nactivities are unitary if they \"are available to all students\nwithin the School District regardless of race.\" Singleton v.\nJackson Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2288520\"><a href=\"/opinion/2288520/singleton-v-jackson-mun-separate-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

School\ndistricts need not \"show equal participation.\" Lockett v. Board\nof Educ. of Muscogee County, No. 991 at 55 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 18\n1994) (citing Quarles v. Oxford Municipal Separate School Dist.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518877\"><a href=\"/opinion/518877/robert-earl-quarles-cross-appellees-v-oxford-municipal-separate-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757 (5th Cir. 1989)). Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the record supports the district court's finding that the\ndistricts have eliminated to the extent practicable from their\nextracurricular activities the vestiges of past de jurediscrimination.\n\n  D.  Remaining Green Factors (Transportation and Facilities)\n    There is no dispute among the parties concerning the two\nremaining factors outlined in Green. Specifically,\ntransportation is provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\nAdditionally, the districts successfully have remedied the\ndistinctions between the facilities of the formerly black and\nformerly white schools.\n\n                       VI. Ancillary Relief\n    The 1978 order of this court required the implementation of\neight specific programs ancillary to the 9-3 pupil assignment\nplan. The order required the districts to:\n    1)   formulate and implement a comprehensive in-service\n         training program for teachers, administrators and other\n         staff in order to train personnel to cope with the\n         desegregation process;\n\n       2)   institute an affirmative reading and communication\n            skills program, which does not resegregate the pupils,\n            in order to remedy the effects of the past\n            discrimination;\n\n       3)   provide curriculum offerings and programs which\n            emphasize and reflect the cultural pluralism of the\n            students, and all instructional materials, texts and\n            other curriculum aids shall be free of racial bias;\n\n       4)   institute an effective and nondiscriminatory counseling\n\f         and guidance program. The counseling and guidance\n         program must insure that students are counseled on a\n         racially nondiscriminatory basis concerning all\n         programs available in the area of work opportunities\n         and opportunities for a college education;\n\n    5)   provide an appropriate human relations program . . .\n         [designed] to protect the individual dignity of\n         students and teachers and to prevent racial myths and\n         stereotypes from prevailing in schools undergoing\n         desegregation;\n\n    6)   develop . . . a code of rights and responsibilities . .\n         . provid[ing] for racially nondiscriminatory discipline\n         and . . . contain[ing] provisions to insure each\n         student in the desegregation area procedural and\n         substantive due process required by existing law. Such\n         a code will help to provide equal educational\n         opportunity to all students by protecting them from\n         unreasonable, discriminatory, and arbitrary rules; and\n         the Board shall not administer the code on a racially\n         selective or otherwise biased basis;\n\n    7)   reassign faculty, administrative and other staff\n         personnel to insure that schools do not retain their\n         former racial identity through racially identifiable\n         faculty and staff assignments; [and]\n\n    8)   establish and enforce nondiscriminatory guidelines for\n         new construction, review of building needs and the\n         appropriateness of each proposed building project or\n         school closing.\nJA 128-30; see also 447 F. Supp. at 1014; see also Evans v.\nBuchanan, 582 F.2d at 771-73.\n    The district court offered more than 180 factual findings in\ndetailing the school districts' implementation of these ancillary\nrelief provisions. In the first four years alone, more than\n$18.8 million in federal desegregation project grants were used\nto pay for human relations specialists, home-school liaisons,\nreading resource teachers and in-service programs. The state and\nthe districts maintained these programs even after the transition\nto a desegregated system. And significantly, from 1978 until the\nunitary status petition was filed, Appellant never complained to\nthe court of any failure to comply with any of the ancillary\nrelief provisions. Of these eight, the last is undisputed, and\nthe seventh we have addressed in our discussion on compliance\nwith the Green factors. Thus here we will review the district\ncourt's findings on the first six of these ancillary measures.\n\n                      A. In-Service Training\n    The district court found that all four districts offered a\nrich array of in-service programs for their faculty, and that,\nalthough the focus of these programs no longer is desegregation,\nall four districts continue to offer in-service training on\n\fdesegregation, race equity and multiculturalism. Coalition, 901\nF. Supp. at 809. Appellant contends that the district court's\nfindings are clearly erroneous because two of the Appellant's\nexperts testified that the in-service training was inadequate.\nAppellant's Br. at 25. But a reviewing court's role is not to\npick and choose isolated snippets of evidence. Rather, we must\ndecide, after viewing the record as a whole, whether there is\nevidentiary support for the district court's findings. Such\nsupport is present; accordingly, there is no clear error.\n     In January 1978, a team from the districts drafted a\nstatement listing several management goals for the in-service\ntraining of the faculty, staff and administration. The first\ngoal -- \"[t]o orient the instructional staff to the curricular\nand instructional process\" -- was accomplished through the Center\nfor Conflict and Desegregation at the University of Pittsburgh\nthe following month. JA 948-49, 4373, 4376-77. In addition, the\nteam responsible for planning in-service training also realized\nat least three other goals that year. Further, in 1978, an\nOffice of In-Service Activities was established and staffed by\ntwo full-time personnel, JA 951-52, and all programs relating to\ndesegregation were mandatory for faculty, staff and\nadministrators. JA 961-62. Finally, even Appellant's expert\ntestified that the in-service programs offered by the state at\nthe time of desegregation complied with the 1978 order. JA 1140,\n1170.\n     The record similarly supports the district court's finding\nthat the districts have continued in-service training programs\nsince the 1978 order. For example, the district court heard\nevidence that from 1981 through 1994, Brandywine offered various\nworkshops and courses related to desegregation, race equity and\nmulticulturalism. Moreover, all new Brandywine teachers are\nrequired to participate in a 12-hour induction program, which\nincludes a panel discussion on issues of multiculturalism. JA\n931.\n     Similarly, in the 1980s, various human relations specialists\nand administrators trained by the Race Desegregation Assistance\nCenter at the University of Pittsburgh worked with the Red Clay\nfaculty and staff in the area of cultural diversity. DI 1936 at\n635-36, 642. The record further reveals that from 1992 through\n1995, Red Clay also has offered in-service training on\nmulticulturalism. DX 79 at FL 12295, FL 12299, FL 12302, FL\n12304-11, FL 12313-14, DX 80; DXC 81; DI 1939 at 1806. The\ncourt's findings with regard to the Christiana and Colonial\ndistricts likewise are supported by the record.\n\n    In light of the foregoing, we are satisfied that Appellant's\ncharges have no support in the record, and thus that the district\ncourt properly found that the schools have met the requirements\nof in-service training.\n\n               B. Reading and Communication Skills\n    The district court found that an affirmative and integrated\nreading program was instituted in each of the four districts.\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 809. Appellant contends that the\n\ffinding is clearly erroneous, because the districts \"failed to\nshow that any reading program was implemented for the purpose of\nremedying the negative effects of the de jure segregation as\nrequired by the 1978 Order, or that the reading programs that\nwere implemented did not resegregate students.\" Appellant's Br.\nat 26. However, although no reading program specifically\ntargeted black students, we conclude from our review of the\nrecord that the districts nevertheless met the standard of good\nfaith compliance with the 1978 Order.\n    The record indicates that a reading program was instituted\nin the schools in 1978, immediately following the issuance of the\nremedial order. JA 967. The program employed 110 reading\nteachers, who\n    worked with the classroom teacher to help with testing,\n    interpretation of those data from the tests, selection of\n    materials, planning of program and strategies for students\n    who needed assistance and anything that [a] particular\n    teacher wanted, to do to help the students within that\n    classroom.\n\nJA 968.   Students in grades two through nine were provided\nassistance under the reading program if they were one year or\nmore below reading level, as demonstrated by standardized test\nscores. JA 968. Students in grades ten through twelve were\nprovided assistance if they were two years below level. Id. And\nsupplemental reading instruction was provided daily for 30-45\nminutes, depending on grade level. JA 969. For the most part,\nthis instruction occurred in small groups within the classroom.\nId. The districts combined have employed between 100 and 135\nreading teachers every year since the 1981-82 school year. JA\n4910-11.\n    Further, the court heard evidence and found facts pertaining\nto the reading programs in each of the four districts. With\nregard to the Red Clay district, for example, the court credited\nthe testimony of officials from the district and found that\n    reading resource teachers coordinate the \"HOSTS\"\n    program (Help One Student to Succeed) for reading- and\n    writing-deficient students. Under the program,\n    volunteer tutors work with individual children for 45\n    minutes per week. More than 300 students participate\n    in the program.\n\n    [Twenty five] parent educators hired by the Parents as\n    Teachers program teaches [sic] first-time parents in\n    New Castle County the importance of language and\n    reading for pre-school children. The program has been\n    in existence since 1987. In 1993 and 1994, the focus\n    was on teenage parents and families with multiple\n    needs.\n\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 810 (footnote omitted). The court\nfound similar progress in the other districts.\n    Because these programs were meant to address the reading\nproblems of every student, Appellant's argument that the program\n\fresegregated students is misguided. Although the school\ndistricts have not excluded black (or white) students from the\nremedial reading programs to effect a racial balance, the\ndistricts do deploy several different programs such as one-on-\none, small group and pull-out remedial reading programs, in which\nreading teachers either work inside the classroom or pull a given\nstudent out of the classroom for individual attention. Thus we\ncannot agree that the districts' remedial reading programs have\nresegregated students; the basic requirement of good faith\nefforts to remove the vestiges of de jure segregation to the\nextent practicable have been met. Accordingly, the district\ncourt did not clearly err.\n    Appellant further contends that the school districts have\n\"failed to show that any `communications skills program' was ever\nimplemented\" in any of the districts. Appellant's Br. at 26.\nHowever, there is no meaningful distinction between reading\nskills programs and communication skills programs; indeed, the\n1978 Order mandates the creation of a singular \"program\" to teach\nreading and communication skills. JA 129. Likewise, testimony\nfrom school officials on this point suggests that instruction for\nboth skills is combined. Thus \"reading skills\" and\n\"communications skills\" are synonymous for purposes of our\nanalysis here. Accordingly, on the basis of our foregoing\ndiscussion of reading skills and programs, we reject Appellant's\nargument that the districts have not complied with the 1978\nOrder.\n\n                          C. Curriculum\n    The 1978 Order required that the curriculum \"emphasize and\nreflect the cultural pluralism of the students,\" and that \"all\ninstructional materials, texts and other curriculum aids shall be\nfree of racial bias.\" JA 129. Appellant argues that the school\ndistricts \"failed to show that [an] inclusive curriculum as\nrequired by the 1978 Order was ever actually taught in a single\nclassroom or that efforts made were anything other than sporadic\nor shortlived, or that the curriculum achieved any results at\nall.\" Appellant's Br. at 27. This sweeping assertion does not\ncomport with the record.\n    The record indicates that the Delaware Department of Public\nInstruction has established text selection guidelines for the\ndistricts to use in conjunction with their own guidelines to\nensure racially unbiased texts and instructional materials. The\nDepartment also has adopted a Comprehensive Policy for\nMulticultural Education, published accompanying guidelines,\nsponsored multicultural education and adopted multicultural\ncurriculum standards. See, e.g., DX 124 at FL 23147; DX 125 at\nFL 23172. In April 1994, consistent with these guidelines, the\nDepartment sponsored a two-day Multicultural Education Institute.\nDX 52.\n    Further, the district court made specific findings that\nacknowledged efforts in each of the four districts to offer a\nmulticultural curriculum. Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 810-12.\nOur review of the record reveals several exemplary programs,\nincluding the Brandywine district's extensive black history\n\fcurriculum in the elementary schools; Christiana's inclusion of\nthe minority community in the textbook selection process;\nColonial's course entitled \"Minorities USA\"; and Red Clay's\nintegration of cultural pluralism into the social studies,\nEnglish language arts, art education and music education\ncurriculum guides.\n    In light of this substantial record evidence supporting the\ndistrict court's findings, we are satisfied that the court did\nnot clearly err when it found that the schools have complied with\nthe court order as to curricular reform.\n\n                   D. Counseling and Guidance\n    The 1978 Order required the districts to \"institute an\neffective and nondiscriminatory counseling and guidance program .\n. . [to] insure that students are counseled on a racially\nnondiscriminatory basis\" concerning post-secondary opportunities.\nJA 129. Appellant argues that the districts \"failed to show that\nany effort had been made to ensure that the counseling and\nguidance programs attempted to prevent resegregation of students\nin the classroom as required by the 1978 Order or that, in fact,\nthe counseling and guidance programs did not become vehicles for\nresegregation. The School System failed to show that the\ncounseling and guidance programs achieved any results at all.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 26. Again, the record belies Appellant's bold\nassertions.\n    In the spring of 1978, the New Castle district formed a\ncommittee \"to follow the directive of the Court at the time [--]\nto develop a nondiscriminatory developmental guidance program for\nall students.\" JA 770. The committee drafted guidelines, which\nthe district adopted in the Handbook for Certified Guidance\nCounselors. JA 770-71. In 1981, the Department modified the\nguidelines for district and statewide use in the Delaware\nGuidance Handbook, K-12, which was itself revised in 1990 as\nAppendix B to the Handbook for K-12 Education. JA 770-71.\n    The record further establishes that, from 1981 to 1991,\nthese Department guidelines governed counseling programs within\nthe districts. For example, in 1990, the state directed each\ndistrict to prepare \"a written plan describing the guidance\nprogram for the district which is reviewed periodically and\nupdated at least every five years.\" DX 230 at D 1464. Plans for\neach district subsequently were drafted and approved. JA 755,\n769-70, 852, 864, DX 230, DX 231, DX 232, DX 233, DX 234. The\ndistrict programs described in the plans include academic,\npersonal, social, career and life-planning counseling. JA 1137.\n    The court's detailed description of the programs established\nin each of the districts also is supported by the record.\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 813-814. Especially mindful of\nalleged disparities in the Red Clay school district, we emphasize\nthat the record clearly supports the district court's\ndetermination that that district administers aptitude tests,\nprovides speakers, supplies ample resource material, offers\nparticipation in various achievement programs, and facilitates an\nextensive college visitation program. JA 772-74.\n    In sum, it is clear that the State Board has adopted\n\fnondiscriminatory counseling guidelines; that all the districts\nhave provided comprehensive post-secondary career, educational\nand vocational assistance; and that the districts support\nnumerous supplementary counseling programs which encourage\nminorities to pursue post-secondary education. Moreover,\nAppellant fails to cite any instance of discriminatory\ncounseling. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not err\nin determining that this aspect of the remedial order was\nfulfilled.\n\n                        E. Human Relations\n    The 1978 Order required the districts to \"provide an\nappropriate human relations program\" for \"schools undergoing\ndesegregation.\" JA 130. The provision was intended to be\ntransitional, designed to address \"the various pressures which\narise as a result of desegregation.\" Evans, 582 F.2d at 769.\nAppellant argues that \"[t]he School System failed to show that\nany human relations program was actually implemented as written .\n. . or that any human relations program lasted for more than a\nbrief duration or achieved any results at all.\" Appellant's Br.\nat 24-25. Nevertheless, the record supports the district court's\nfindings.\n    The school districts responded to the order by implementing\na program involving more than 100 specially trained and certified\nspecialists who were assigned to schools in \"biracial teams.\" JA\n763-64. Each high school and junior high school had at least one\nteam, and these teams were also directed to serve a number of\nelementary schools. Id. These specialists provided crisis\nintervention assistance and implemented student support programs,\nsuch as peer tutoring and counseling. JA 764-66. Because the\ndesegregation went smoothly, the focus of the program soon\nshifted to multicultural awareness, problem-solving and other\nstudent support functions. JA 764. The districts continued\nthese services by retaining human relations personnel and hiring\nelementary guidance counselors, social workers, community\noutreach personnel, visiting teachers, student advisors, student\nrelations specialists and other student support personnel. SeeCoalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 815-16.\n    Moreover, the district court described in detail the\nprogress in each of the four districts. Again directing our\nfocus to the Red Clay district, we note that \"Red Clay employed\n16 human relations specialists and home/school advisors in 1981-\n82 and 18 in 1982-83\" and \"five human relations specialists and\nhome/school advisors\" as recently as 1993-94. Coalition, 901 F.\nSupp. at 816 (crediting Defendant's Exhibit 111).\n    Notwithstanding the necessary (and welcome) shift in the\nfocus of the human relations program, it clearly has lasted\nbeyond \"a brief duration\" and has yielded significant results.\nAccordingly, these findings support the district court's\ndetermination that the school districts complied with the court\norder as to human relations programs.\n\n                        F. Discipline\n   The 1978 Order required the development of a code to provide\n\f\"racially nondiscriminatory discipline\" and to ensure \"procedural\nand substantive due process.\" JA 130. In July 1978, the New\nCastle district adopted a code of conduct drafted by a \"committee\n[which had] gathered similar documents from Delaware and large\ndesegregated school districts for review.\" JA 4436. Prior to\nadoption, drafts of the code were reviewed by citizen groups,\nstudent council leaders, the Teachers' Association, and\nadministrators. JA 4435-36. The districts adopted the New\nCastle code in 1981, and each district has revised the code\nperiodically since then, through a \"process of development and\ncontinual revision that includes [the] involvement of others,\nthat includes teachers, includes administrators, and there are\nprocesses for the codes to be reviewed by external sources and\nhave input.\" JA 719.\n    Appellant's discipline expert concedes that the districts'\ncodes are not \"discriminatory on their face.\" JA 1157. And the\ndistrict court found that the codes \"are not applied in a\ndiscriminatory fashion.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 817.\nAppellant argues, however, that the school districts have failed\nto reduce racial disparities in discipline rates among students,\nand that Appellant was denied the opportunity to admit expert\ntestimony in support of this claim. However, on this matter the\nrecord supports the district court's findings, as well as its\nexercise of discretion.\n    The district court's finding that discipline is not\nadministered in a discriminatory fashion is supported by the\ntestimony of Dr. Charles Achilles, the school districts' expert.\nDr. Achilles calculated indices by dividing the percentage of\nblack student suspensions by the black enrollment percentage.\nBased on these data, Dr. Achilles determined that the districts'\nsuspension indices reflected less racial imbalance than indices\ncalculated from national suspension data compiled by the Office\nof Civil Rights and Delaware arrest data. JA 722-23. Dr.\nAchilles further illustrated that the indices were essentially\nconsistent across the four districts -- \"a result difficult to\nachieve if equitable nondiscriminatory codes were not being used\nand applied in an equitable, nondiscriminatory manner.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 817; see JA 724. And finally, Dr.\nAchilles demonstrated \"consistency in how the codes were applied\nby administrators, regardless of the administrators' race.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 817; see JA 725. In light of this\ncompelling testimony, we conclude that the district court did not\nclearly err in determining that, as to discipline, the school\ndistricts have complied with the 1978 Order. See Krasnov, 465\nF.2d at 1302 (standard of review).\n    Nor did the district court err in rejecting the testimony of\nAppellant's discipline expert, Dr. William Gordon. He could cite\nno study or authoritative literature to support his assumption\n\"that 'undiscipline' or misbehavior is a randomly distributed\ncharacteristic among racial groups . . . .\" JA 1161. And in\nfact, statistical data demonstrate a comparable or greater racial\ndisproportion for those offenses for which Delaware law mandates\nsuspension, which Gordon called \"very objective\" offenses, than\nfor those offenses he viewed as less objective. JA 726.\n\fAccordingly, we reject Appellant's argument that the schools have\nfailed to reduce racial disparities in discipline rates.\n\n    We likewise reject Appellant's contention that expert\ntestimony on this matter was improperly rejected by the district\ncourt.

Instead,\nAppellant chose the tactical route of surprise. In light of the\nforegoing discussion, we conclude that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding this surprise testimony.\n\n          VII. Areas of Concern to the District Court\n             and Allocations of the Burden of Proof\n\n         Aside from its examination of the four school\ndistricts' compliance with the Green factors and the ancillary\nrelief measures, the district court also acknowledged that\ncertain performance disparities persist in the New Castle County\nschools -- most notably in the Red Clay district. These\nperformance disparities include student achievement, special\neducation, and dropout rates, and are not disputed here.\nHowever, because these disparities are not among the vestiges\n\fenumerated either in Green or in the ancillary relief order, we\nmust determine, first, whether these disparities actually are\nvestiges of de jure segregation, and if so, whether the school\ndistricts have in good faith eliminated them to the extent\npracticable. Having considered the taxonomy of disparities\nproffered by Appellant and reviewed the record and pertinent\nlegal precepts, we hold that Appellant properly was allocated the\nburden to prove that the disparities were vestiges, and that the\nAppellant failed to meet this burden.\n         The Court has made plain that certain disparities\nnecessarily are vestiges of de jure segregation. Identifying\nwhat would become known as the Green factors, the Court directed\nschool boards to propose plans designed to disestablish state-\nimposed segregation in \"every facet of school operations --\nfaculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities and\nfacilities.\" Green, 391 U.S. at 435. Accordingly, and as the\nrelevant cases cited by Appellant demonstrate, the Court\nconsistently has turned to the Green factors to \"determin[e]\nwhether a dual school system has been disestablished.\" Columbus,\n443 U.S. at 458-61 (Green factors). See also Davis v. Board of\nSch. Comm'rs of Mobile County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108317\"><a href=\"/opinion/108317/davis-v-board-of-school-commrs-of-mobile-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (1971) (pupil\nassignment); Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. at 538\n(pupil assignment and school construction). Indeed, the Greenfactors have\nbecome per se vestiges of de jure segregation -- and\ntherefore the focal point for determining unitary status.\nNevertheless, the performance disparities enumerated by Appellant\nare not among these factors.\n         Still, the Green factors are not the only disparities\nthat may be classified as vestiges of de jure segregation.\nDepending on the circumstances of a particular case, the trial\ncourt still may exercise discretion to consider other factors.\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492-93.   The circumstances of the instant\ncase prompted the district court, in 1978, to order eight\nancillary remedial measures. As with the Green factors, we have\nreviewed the districts' compliance with that order and conclude\nthat there was a good faith effort to eliminate the vestiges\nidentified therein to the extent practicable. Again, however,\nthe performance disparities urged here were not identified among\nthese vestiges of de jure segregation.\n         We emphasize that here we are not discussing the burden\nof proving compliance with the Green factors or the 1978 Order,\nas to which the school districts acknowledge bearing the\nevidentiary burden. Our discussion here, and our allocation of\nthe burden of proof to Appellant, is limited to the issue of\nproving that the identified performance disparities are vestiges\nof de jure segregation.\n         Because the performance disparities claimed by\nAppellant are not among (or even similar to) the Green factors or\nthe vestiges identified in the 1978 Order, we will not simply\npresume -- as Appellant urges us to do -- that these are vestiges\nof de jure segregation. Appellant offers no persuasive authority\nfor establishing a causal link between present achievement\ndisparities and past de jure segregation. In fact, all but one\nof the cases relied on by Appellant on this point are irrelevant,\n\fbecause they address only Green-type factors; the State Board\ndoes not dispute that it carried the burden of proving good faith\nefforts to eliminate (to the extent practicable) such vestiges of\nde jure segregation.\n         Appellant thus can rely solely on Vaughns by Vaughns v.\nBd. of Educ. of Prince George's County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450397\"><a href=\"/opinion/450397/sylvester-j-vaughns-jr-by-his-father-and-next-friend-sylvester-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 990-91 (4th\nCir. 1985), which, upon our review, supports the district court.\nIn Vaughns, because the school district was not unitary with\nrespect to the Green factor of student assignment, id. at 990-91,\nthe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the\nplaintiffs were entitled to a presumption that disparities in\nspecial education and gifted and talented programs arose from\nprior segregation. More important, the Vaughns court\ndistinguished a decision from a sister circuit because \"the\nburden shifted to [Appellants] in that case only because the\nschool system had achieved unitary status with regard to student\nassignment.\" Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 991.\n         Here, however, the districts have been unitary as to\nschool assignments since the 1978 order. Had the Vaughns school\ndistrict satisfied the Green factors as have the Delaware\ndistricts before us, the Vaughns plaintiffs would have had to\nprove that performance disparities resulted from de juresegregation. The\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit so held\nin two subsequent cases. See Riddick by Riddick v.

The same result\nshould obtain here.\n         Further, we must respect the Court's teaching that \"a\nschool board is entitled to a rather precise statement of its\nobligations under a desegregation decree\" and to \"a like\nstatement from the court\" for when \"such a decree is to be\nterminated or dissolved.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 246 (citing\nPasadena City Bd. of Educ. v.

See Jenkins, 115 S. Ct. at 2055-56\n(to require a remedy, inferior student achievement must be proven\nto have resulted from de jure segregation); see also Keyes v.\nSchool Dist. No. 1, C.A. Nos.

Jenkins. . .\ndefeats the plaintiffs' call for compelling additional\naction to investigate and redress racial disparities in student\nachievement . . . [when the] court has never made any findings\nthat such differences are the result of discrimination by the\nDistrict\").\n         In light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that\nAppellant failed to carry its burden. The district court's\nfinding that persistent student performance disparities were\ncaused by socioeconomic factors is supported by the record.\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 818-19. The district court cited\nvarious demographic data from the 1990 U.S. Census and the 1992\nVital Statistics Report of Delaware that illustrate a\n\"black/white gap\" in the geographic area contained in the four\n\fschool districts, and in New Castle County generally, as to\nsocioeconomic conditions.   The record establishes that \"Blacks\nin the desegregation area are in an inferior position\neconomically to whites, and [that] that gap is wider in New\nCastle County than it is in the nation as a whole.\" Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 818.\n         Further, the record supports a causal link between\nthese socioeconomic factors and student achievement across the\nfour districts: \"There is consistency between the gap in\nsocioeconomic status with the gap in achievement, with Brandywine\nstatistics demonstrating the greatest disparity in both areas,\nColonial the least disparity.\" Id. With such support in the\nrecord, these findings cannot be clearly erroneous. Anchoring\nits determination on these unfortunate, but uncontroverted,\nsocioeconomic factors, the court found, inter alia, that\n\"[b]ecause the environment outside school is so strong,\ncumulative, and varied, schools cannot overcome such\nenvironmental/differences [sic] among children.\" Id. at 819. We\nagree.\n         Accordingly, we affirm the district court's allocation\nof the burden of proof and its determination that persistent\nperformance disparities are not vestiges of de jure segregation.\n\n                         VIII. Conclusion\n         The task of setting forth reasons for affirming the\ndistrict court's judgment would have been lightened considerably\n-- and this opinion made benevolently more brief -- had the\nCoalition not chosen to mount a scatter-gun attack on virtually\nevery aspect of the district court's comprehensive opinion.\nIndeed, the Coalition portrays nearly 20 years of federal court\nsupervision of Delaware public education as a cheerless and\nsorrowful failure. As our discussion has shown, however, the\nCoalition's contentions, in the main, have been expressed in\nconclusory language that neglects to demonstrate where the\ndistrict court erred and fails to appreciate the narrow standard\nof review by which we are constrained.\n         Moreover, the Coalition repeatedly has failed properly\nto acknowledge the importance of pervasive socioeconomic\nconditions that account for discrepancies among the races in\neducational performance. Indeed, the Coalition avoids the\nresponsibility of carefully examining the roots of the continuing\nblack/white achievement gap, a brutal national phenomenon first\ndocumented in the 1960s and substantiated in various recent\nstudies that \"demonstrate that if socioeconomic characteristics\nare more equalized, achievement levels are more equalized.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 819. These studies conclude that\n\"[i]t is difficult for children to take equal advantage of\nlearning opportunities absent the initial and cumulative\nadvantages of a stimulating home curriculum,\" and that \"[b]ecause\nthe environment outside school is so strong, cumulative, and\nvaried, schools cannot overcome such environmental/differences\namong children.\" Id.\n         These conclusions support our belief, presented in the\nforegoing discussion, that none of the Coalition's arguments\n\fconcerning special education, discipline and dropout rates,\nstudent achievement, extra-curricular activities or disparities\nin college matriculation can seriously be considered without\nweighing the impact of critical demographic data. This the\nCoalition has failed to do, choosing instead to focus its primary\nenergies on arguing for continued federal court supervision of\nthe schools -- as if a federal judge's order could eliminate,\nwith the stroke of a pen, broad social problems.\n         As humans, we acknowledge with melancholy the fact that\nmany socioeconomic factors militate against a completely level\nplaying field in our society. As judges, however, we are\npowerless to alter formidable social, economic and demographic\nforces and conditions over which no legal precept has control.\nMoreover, we are constrained to fulfill an obligation to address\nonly those constitutional questions properly presented to us, and\nto show fealty to appropriate standards of review, lest we\nabandon the limits on judicial power that give coherence to our\npolitical system. The district court articulated the meaning of\nthese institutional limits for this case:\n         [t]he continued existence of racial discrimination in\n         our society as a whole, and the effect of that\n         discrimination on the ability of a black child to enter\n         school on an equal footing with more privileged white\n         schoolmates, are not matters in dispute in this\n         litigation.\n\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 823. Unfortunately, in its\npresentation the Coalition repeatedly has refused to accept the\nfundamental concept that this court's scope of review is limited\nto determining whether the district court clearly erred in\nconcluding that the school districts have achieved unitary\nstatus.\n         The history of our jurisprudence contains no true\nprecedent for the micromanagement of school systems by the\nfederal courts. Indeed, our authority to supervise these school\ndistricts does not stem from the Anglo-American common law\ntradition, in which the law evolves through judicial reasoning\nbased on legal principle; instead, our legitimacy here derives\nexclusively from the powers that inhere in equity jurisdiction,\n\"another stream that flowed alongside the common law, whose\nheadwaters were in the discretionary royal prerogative. Equity\nwas a more flexible process, more unprincipled, initially quite\nad hoc.\" Thus the jurisprudential basis for 20 years of\ndetailed management of the Northern New Castle County school\nsystem has been, simply, a remedy framed in equity to enforce a\ndesegregation decree.\n         This equitable remedy and, by definition, its\njurisprudential legitimacy, were meant to have a limited\nlifespan. The remedy was designed to serve only as an implement\nfor monitoring and guidance, not as a permanent substitute for\nstate and local school boards, or indeed, for the state\nlegislature. Thus in our zeal to insure maximum educational\nopportunities for all Delaware school students, the federal\ncourts must bear in mind that the responsibility for\n\fadministering the schools ultimately belongs to locally elected\nofficials. Indeed, we must acknowledge that although it has been\nproper for us to supervise multiple generations of students in\nthe service of unassailable ideals, in the process we have also\ndenied multiple generations of elected officials the freedom to\nparticipate fully in representative government. For 20 years\nthere has been a constant colloquy between federal judges and\nofficers of these political institutions, a score of years in\nwhich to achieve desegregation \"with all deliberate speed,\" as\nordered in Brown II, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 301 (1955).\n         In ruling that the school districts of Northern New\nCastle County have at long last truly respected our specific\norders of desegregation, the district court has cut the umbilical\ncord extending from the courtroom to the classroom. Institutions\nthat normally are free to exercise powers traditionally granted\nthem (and them alone) in the American political process now are\nfree to assume those powers. The time has come for the courts to\nstep back.

Shared principles\n         Before I articulate the reasons for my dissent, I want\nto underscore the shared premises under which the majority and I\noperate.\n         There is, first of all, no disagreement that \"to extend\nfederal court supervision indefinitely is neither practicable,\ndesirable, nor proper,\" Majority at 16, and this is not what I\nadvocate today. At the same time, the Supreme Court has held\nthat supervision by the courts should continue until \"the\nvestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.\" Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (1992).\nBecause the Appellees have not met this requirement, I believe\nthat withdrawal of supervision is premature at this point.\n         Nor is there any disagreement between the Majority and\nthe Dissent that \"[t]he proper test under the Constitution is\nequality of opportunity, not of results.\" Majority at 31. To\nthe extent that the principal issue in this Dissent is the\nplacement of African-American children in lower-level classes,\nand to the extent that the district court itself found that\n\"lower levels of instruction may not encourage achievement and\nmay adversely affect the ability of a student to attend college,\"\nCoalition to Save our Children v. State Bd. of Educ., 901 F.\nSupp. 784, 801,   49 (D. Del. 1995), it is their opportunity to\nsucceed academically that is at stake.\n         Finally, I share the Majority's \"reluctan[ce] to impose\nany unstated obligation on the school boards.\" Majority at 61.\nAt the same time, we should not impose or tolerate any\nlimitations on the opportunity of young black students to\nparticipate equally in the educational process and derive all of\nthe benefits therefrom.\n\n                      II. Factual findings\n         I now turn to the substantive review of the district\ncourt's ruling. First, I agree with the Majority's conclusion\nthat the vestiges of segregation have been eliminated with\nrespect to the following areas: intra-district student racial\nbalance, Majority at 18-20; special education student assignment,\nid. at 21-24; faculty and clerical staff assignment, id. at 32-\n36; extracurricular activities, id. at 37-38; transportation, id.at 39;\nfacilities, id.; in-service training, id. at 41-44;\nreading skills, id. at 44-47; curriculum, id. at 48-50;\ncounseling and guidance, id. at 50-52; human relations, id. at\n52-53; and discipline, id. at 53-57.\n         However, I cannot agree with the Majority that the\nAppellees demonstrated, or that the district court correctly\nconcluded, that the vestiges of segregation have been eliminated\nwith respect to the following facets of school operations:\nstudent classroom assignment; certified staff assignment; and\ncommunications skills programs. I therefore would remand to the\ndistrict court for further findings regarding these three areas.\nIn addition, because classroom assignment affects student\nachievement, I would remand for further findings regarding the\n\fso-called \"areas of concern.\" Finally, because the district\ncourt did not apply the correct legal standard regarding the\nexclusion of the testimony of one of the Coalition's experts, I\nwould remand for further findings on this issue as well.\n                 A. Student classroom assignment\n         I note, first of all, that \"the school districts\nacknowledge bearing the evidentiary burden\" of proving compliance\nwith this issue, other Green factors and the 1978 Order. SeeMajority at\n59.\n         1. The district court's findings and conclusions\n         Findings 30 to 49 of the district court's opinion\nconcern student classroom assignments. Coalition, 901 F. Supp.\nat 799-401. Findings 34 through 49 focus more specifically on\n\"tracking\" or \"ability grouping,\" i.e., the assignment of\nstudents \"to various instructional groups on the basis of\nability.\" Id. at 800-01. Among the court's findings are the\nfollowing:\n              36. The extent to which elementary and\n         middle school students are placed in classes\n         according to their ability is unclear from\n         the record.\n\n                             * * *\n\n             38. In 1993, the percentage of\n        minorities in the self-contained honors and\n        gifted student program at Burnett Elementary\n        School [the only self-contained \"gifted\"\n        student program in the 4 districts, id. at\n        800 n. 27], who scored above 85% on exams is\n        slightly greater than that for the other\n        groups.\n\n                             * * *\n\n             46. A review of the percentages of the\n        racial groups who were taking college and\n        non-college prep classes illustrates that: a)\n        a little over 50% of Brandywine's black\n        students in grades 9-12 were taking non-\n        college prep English, whereas a little less\n        than 20% of Brandywine's white students were\n        taking that level of English; b) a little\n        over 60% of Christiana's black students in\n        grades 9-12 were taking non-college prep\n        English, whereas a little less than 25% of\n        Christiana's white students were taking that\n        level of English; c) a little over 50% of\n        Colonial's black students in grades 9-12 were\n        taking non-college prep English, whereas a\n        little less than 35% of Colonial's white\n        students were taking that level of English;\n        d) a little over 40% of Red Clay's black\n        students in grades 9-12 were taking non-\n\f         college prep English, whereas a little less\n         than 17% of Red Clay's white students were\n         taking that level of English. Less than 5%\n         of black students were enrolled in advanced\n         English in the high schools of the 4\n         districts; however, over 20% of white\n         students were at that level.\n\n              47. There is evidence that among high\n         school students who achieve identical testing\n         scores [\"The comparison apparently does not\n         include academic achievement as measured by\n         course performance, or whether such placement\n         was requested or required.\" Id. at 801\n         n.30.], black students were more likely to be\n         placed in the lower level class than were\n         white students.\n\n              48. On the other hand, the percentage of\n         minorities enrolled in honors and AP classes\n         who scored over the 75th percentile in\n         reading or math in the spring of 1993 is\n         slightly greater than that of whites in all 4\n         school districts.\n\n              49. There is evidence that lower levels\n         of instruction may not encourage achievement\n         and may adversely affect the ability of a\n         student to attend college.\n\nId. at 800-01 (citations omitted).\n         Taken together, these findings demonstrate that: (1)\nAfrican-American students are less likely to be assigned to high-\nlevel classes than their white counterparts, and more likely to\nbe placed in low-level classes [ 46]; and (2) these disparate\nassignments are made at least in part for reasons other than\nacademic merit, since black students who perform as well as white\nstudents are \"more likely to be placed on the lower level class\nthan [are] white students\" [ 47; see also     38, 48]. In the\nabsence of alternative explanations, these findings permit the\ninference that the four districts' tracking practices may be\nbased, at least in part, on racial considerations. Furthermore,\nthe court's findings demonstrate that these disparate tracking\nassignments may deprive African-American students of the\nopportunity to achieve the same level of academic success,\nincluding college admission, as their white counterparts [ 49].\n         The district court made no additional finding of fact\nregarding alternate explanations for these \"potentially\ntroubling\" findings, see Majority at 24. Furthermore, whereas it\nwas able to conclude, with regard to school-based student\nassignments, that \"[t]he 4 districts are among the most racially\nbalanced schools in the United States,\" see Coalition, 901 F.\nSupp. at 799,   29, it reached no such conclusion regarding\ntracking-based assignments.\n\f         The court did conclude as a legal matter that \"there is\nno credible evidence linking any current racially identifiable\nconditions to the prior violation,\" id. at 823, and that \"the\nvestiges of past discrimination have been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.\" Id. at 823-24. I believe that the evidence\ndiscussed supra does not support this conclusion.\n         First of all, the court's own findings constitute\n\"credible evidence\" potentially linking one racially identifiable\ncondition -- i.e., the racial disparities in assignment to high-\nlevel and low-level classes -- to \"the prior violation.\"\n         Second, while the findings regarding student tracking\ndo not prove conclusively that the school districts discriminate\nin their tracking practices on the basis of race, they certainly\ndo not support the opposite conclusion -- i.e., that the\ndistricts do not discriminate on the basis of race. If anything,\nthe court's findings create a presumption that race might be a\nfactor in New Castle County's tracking practices. Since the\nburden with regard to the Green factors -- including student\nassignments -- is on the Appellees to prove that the vestiges of\nsegregation have been eliminated, and since the Appellees offered\nno explanation for the disparities in tracking, the uncertainty\nas to the cause of the disparities should be resolved in favor of\nthe Coalition, and therefore the district court's conclusion that\nthe vestiges have been eliminated, at least with regards to\nstudent classroom assignment, was unsupported and premature.\n                    2. The Majority's analysis\n         Despite the disparity between the court's own findings\nof fact and its conclusions of law, the Majority affirms the\ncourt's conclusion. I believe that the Majority's position is\nbased on the wrong standard of review, the wrong allocation of\nburdens and an unsustainable reading of the evidentiary record.\n                               (a)\n         First, the Majority defines \"our task\" as \"to inquire\nwhether the district court's determination of the districts'\nunitary status was clearly erroneous.\" Majority at 26. The\ndistrict court's determination as to unitary status, however, is\none not of fact, which we would review for clear error, but of\nlaw, see Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 822-23, which as is customary\nwe subject to plenary review.\n                               (b)\n         Second, time and again the Majority dismisses the\nimport of the district court's factual findings by resolving gaps\nin the evidentiary record and ambiguities as to those factual\nfindings in favor of the Appellees, despite the fact that by its\nown acknowledgment, and that of Appellees, Appellees bear the\nburden of showing that the vestiges of discrimination have been\neliminated.\n         (i) The Majority dismisses the district court's finding\nthat \"among high school students who achieve identical testing\nscores, black students were more likely to be placed in the lower\nlevel class than were white students,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at\n801,   47, as \"no[] . . . evidence that black students have not\nreceived equal opportunity.\" Majority at 25. While the Majority\nconcedes that this \"potentially troubling\" finding might\n\f\"suggest[] on its face that black students may have been\nsegregated from white students of equal testing aptitude,\" id. at\n24, it rejects this conclusion on the ground that the comparison\ndid not \"consider[] as well the important factor of academic\nachievement based on course performance,\" and that \"it is not\nclear whether the placement at issue was requested or required.\"\nId. at 25.\n         Of course, the evidentiary gaps that the Majority\nidentifies do not nullify the import of the district court's\nfinding as to potential disparate treatment of equally qualified\nstudents based on race. Furthermore, these gaps should not serve\nto exonerate the party that bears the burden of proof;\nuncertainty as to the significance of the district court's\nfactual finding should not be resolved in favor of the party that\nbears the burden.\n         (ii) The Majority dismisses the district court's\nfinding that \"the percentage of minorities enrolled in honors and\nAP classes who scored over the 75th percentile in reading or math\nin the spring of 1993 is slightly greater than that of whites in\nall 4 school districts,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801,    48, as\n\"so limited, and thus malleable, a sample,\" Majority at 25, as to\nallow any number of inferences. Specifically, while the Majority\nacknowledges that \"this finding could . . . give rise to an\ninference that blacks must perform at a higher level than whites\nin order to be placed in honors and AP classes,\" it suggests that\n\"we may just as reasonably infer something quite different: that\nthe school districts' good faith efforts to desegregate have paid\noff in terms of the improved testing performance of black\nstudents.\" Id. at 25-26.\n         The Majority's inference, even assuming that it is one\nan appellate court could draw, is unconvincing at best: the issue\nis not whether some black students perform well, but rather\nwhether black students must perform better than whites to be\nplaced in honors and AP classes, which the district court's\nfinding clearly suggests. In any case, once again it is\ninappropriate -- and legally erroneous -- to dismiss the\nCoalition's interpretation because another interpretation, more\nfavorable to Appellees, is possible when the burden lies with\nAppellees.\n         (iii) The Majority dismisses the district court's\nfinding that \"[t]he extent to which elementary and middle school\nstudents are placed in classes according to their ability is\nunclear from the record,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 800,    36,\nas \"mean[ing] little on its own, for it represents merely that\nthere is uncertainty in the record about how elementary and\nmiddle school students are placed in classes according to their\nability.\" Majority at 26.\n         True enough. However, uncertainty about student\nplacement merely demonstrates that Appellees have failed to meet\ntheir burden of showing that the vestiges of discrimination have\nbeen eliminated. To suggest otherwise is to misallocate the\nevidentiary burden.\n         (iv) The Majority dismisses the district court's\nfinding of \"[e]vidence that lower levels of instruction may not\n\fencourage achievement and may adversely affect the ability of a\nstudent to attend college,\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801,   49,\nas \"not establish[ing] anything specific about whether that\nputative problem is related to disparate educational opportunity\nor treatment according to race.\" Majority at 29.\n         The significance of this finding, however, is not to\ndemonstrate that black students are channeled to lower-level\nclasses, but that if they are, this would have a deleterious\neffect on their level of academic achievement. This finding,\nwhen read in the context of the district court's other findings\nsuggesting that students are assigned to different levels of\ninstruction based on race, is ominous and suggests that the poor\nperformance of black students in a number of areas might not be\nrelated solely to socioeconomic factors.\n                                (c)\n         At the end of its analysis, the Majority proclaims that\n\"[a]s we already have made clear, [the basis on which students\nare placed in lower levels of instruction] was not racially\ndiscriminatory.\" Majority at 29. In fact, neither the district\ncourt's findings nor even the Majority's analysis supports such a\nconclusion. At best, they suggest that the record is\nindeterminate regarding whether students are assigned to certain\nlevels of instruction on the basis of race -- i.e., that\nAppellees have failed to establish that in the area of student\nassignment, the vestiges of discrimination have been eliminated\nto the extent practicable.\n                          3. Conclusion\n         For the foregoing reasons, I would remand to the\ndistrict court for further findings regarding the racial\ndisparities in tracking.\n                        B. Certified staff\n         Regarding the issue of staff assignment, the district\ncourt noted that \"[t]he staff is divided into three subsections:\nadministrative staff, certified staff, and classified staff.\"\nCoalition, 901 F. Supp. at 802,    50. As the court explained,\n\"'[c]ertified staff' includes nonadministrative certified\npersonnel such as teachers, psychologists, speech and hearing\ntherapists, educational diagnosticians and other 'instructional\nand pupil support personnel.'\" Id.,     52.\n         Except for teachers, the court made no finding\nregarding the racial identifiability of the schools with respect\nto the certified staff. Similarly, the Majority discusses the\ndistricts' efforts regarding the faculties, Majority at 33-35,\nand the \"non-professional\" or \"classified\" staff only, id. at 35-\n36, but in no way discusses the districts' efforts regarding\ncertified staff.\n         No one disputes that these professionals were included\nin the 1978 Order, and I see no reason for the district court's\nomission. Therefore, I would remand to the court for further\nfindings regarding whether vestiges with regard to certified\nstaff have been eliminated.\n                     C. Communication skills\n         The 1978 Order required the districts (which at the\ntime were consolidated into a single district) \"to institute an\n\faffirmative reading and communication skills program which does\nnot resegregate pupils.\" Evans, 447 F. Supp. at 1015-16. I do\nnot dispute the Majority's conclusion that \"the districts . . .\nmet the standard of good faith compliance with\" the Order\nregarding reading skills. See Majority at 45. However, the\ndistrict court made not a single finding regarding the\nimplementation of a communication skills program. See Coalition,\n901 F. Supp. at 809-10,     168-185.\n         The Majority contends that this oversight is\ninconsequential because \"there is no meaningful distinction\nbetween reading skills programs and communication skills\nprograms,\" Majority at 47, and that \"'reading skills' and\n'communications skills' are synonymous for purposes of our\nanalysis here.\" Id. at 48. However, there is no support in the\nrecord to read the \"communication skills\" requirement as mere\nsurplusage. I cannot agree with the Majority's suggestion,\neighteen years after the fact, that the language of the 1978\nOrder was merely sloppy or redundant. This suggestion is not\nonly in contradiction with the careful analysis of the district\ncourt at the time, but also with the plain meaning of the words.\nReading and communication are different forms of human activity,\nand they involve different skills. Therefore, I would remand to\nthe district court for further findings in this area.\n                        D. Areas of concern\n         In addition to the so-called Green factors and the\nancillary relief measures outlined by the district court in 1978,\nthe district court considered several \"areas of concern\" for\npossible discriminatory practices: student achievement; special\neducation; and dropout rates. Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 818-22.\nAs the Majority acknowledges, there is no dispute that\nsignificant disparities along racial lines remain in these\nvarious areas. See Majority at 57. The issue is whether these\ndisparities are legally cognizable vestiges of de juresegregation.   The\ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here is no\ncredible evidence demonstrating that the differences between\nblack and white children's success in school can be attributed to\nthe former de jure segregated school system.\" Coalition, 901 F.\nSupp. at 823.\n         In a very real sense, there can be no doubt that the\ncondition of many African-Americans in our society is a lasting\nlegacy of a time when people of color as a matter of law were\ndenied equality of opportunity. However, the Supreme Court has\nmade it clear that not all vestiges of de jure segregation are\n\"the concern of the law,\" but only those that \"have a causal link\nto the de jure violation being remedied.\" Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496 (1992).\n         With regard to the Green factors, causality is\npresumed. As the Majority explains, \"the Green factors have\nbecome per se vestiges of de jure segregation.\" Majority at 58.\nCausality is also presumed for the ancillary relief measures\ncontained in the 1978 Order. But the issue of establishing\ncausality is a more difficult one in the case of the identified\nperformance disparities.\n         I agree with the Majority that under the typical\n\fscenario, \"[b]ecause the performance disparities claimed by\nAppellant are not among (or even similar to) the Green factors or\nthe vestiges identified in the 1978 Order, we will not simply\npresume . . . that these are vestiges of de jure segregation.\"\nMajority at 59. I also agree with the Majority, however, that if\nthe district court ultimately were to find that the school\ndistrict has not achieved unitary status, the burden would shift\nand the plaintiffs would be entitled to a presumption of\ncausality. See id. at 60 (citing Vaughns by Vaughns v. Bd. of\nEduc. of Prince George's County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450397\"><a href=\"/opinion/450397/sylvester-j-vaughns-jr-by-his-father-and-next-friend-sylvester-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 990-91 (4th Cir.\n1985)).\n         As I explain supra, I believe that remand is\nappropriate in the instant matter for further findings regarding\nclassroom assignment. If the district court were to conclude on\nremand that students are assigned to different levels of\neducation based on race, under Vaughns v. Vaughns such a finding\nwould create a presumption of causal relationship between the dejure\nviolation and the disparities in achievement, and the\nevidentiary burden would shift to Appellees. We note, too, that\nthis presumption would be entirely consistent with the district\ncourt's own finding that \"lower levels of instruction may not\nencourage achievement and may adversely affect the ability of a\nstudent to attend college.\" Coalition, 901 F. Supp. at 801,\n49.\n         Because any conclusion the court draws regarding class\nplacement may affect its conclusion that \"[t]here is no credible\nevidence demonstrating that the differences between black and\nwhite children's success in school can be attributed to the\nformer de jure segregated school system,\" id. at 823, I would\nvacate the court's conclusion regarding the so-called areas of\nconcern and remand for reconsideration in light of the above.\n             E. Exclusion of Jan de Leeuw's testimony\n         The Coalition argued on appeal that the district court\nimproperly excluded expert testimony it sought to present to\nrebut the defendant' own experts, and that it was prejudiced by\nthe exclusion. The Majority correctly notes that \"[a] trial\njudge's exclusion of testimony cannot be disturbed on appeal\n'absent a clear abuse of discretion.'\" Majority at 56 (citing\nSemper v. Santos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505508\"><a href=\"/opinion/505508/auckland-semper-and-eldra-semper-v-raymundo-santos-and-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238 (3d Cir. 1988); Fashauer v.\nNew Jersey Transit Rail Operations, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698331\"><a href=\"/opinion/698331/thomas-fashauer-jr-v-new-jersey-transit-rail-operations-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287 (3d Cir.\n1995)).

Factual findings\n         On November 2, 1994, the district court issued an order\nsetting up, inter alia, the framework for pre-trial discovery.\nIn particular, the court ordered that by November 9, 1994, \"each\nparty [should] designate which of its experts [would] testify at\ntrial and the specific subject matter as to which each expert\n[would] testify.\" Coalition to Save our Children v. Delaware\nBoard of Education, Nos. 1816-1822-SLR, slip op. at 4 (D. Del.\nNov. 2, 1994) (Order) (JA 318). The court further ordered the\n\fparties to \"exchange expert reports, the content of which will\ncomply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)\" by November 23. Id.,\nslip op. at 5 (JA 319).\n         The Coalition submitted its list of experts on November\n17. Among those listed was Dr. Jan de Leeuw, Director of the\nUCLA Statistical Consulting Center. Redesignation of Expert\nWitnesses, Coalition to Save our Children v. State Board of\nEducation, C.A. No. 1816-1822 SLR, slip op. at 2 (D. Del. Nov.\n17, 1994) (JA 346). Dr. de Leeuw was to \"be called as an expert\nwitness in the fields of statistical consultation, data analysis,\nand related matters.\" Id.\n         Dr. de Leeuw submitted his Report on Creation and Use\nof Database (hereinafter the \"de Leeuw Report\") on November 29,\n1994. JA 4041. The report deals exclusively with the\npreparation and construction of the database. One section,\nentitled \"Goal of Analysis,\" explains:\n         The analysis consists of providing expert\n         witnesses with tables. The tables depicted\n         the racial composition of districts and\n         schools with regard to outcomes of interest.\n         These tables provide the actual number and\n         percentages of students who fall within each\n         of these categories. In addition, the tables\n         include marginal (or conditional)\n         percentages.\nDe Leeuw Report at 14 (JA 4055).\n         An attorney for the school system wrote to the court on\nDecember 1 protesting that \"the expert reports provided by\nPlaintiff were incomplete,\" Letter from Rodman Ward, Jr. to Judge\nSue L. Robinson (Dec. 1, 1994) (JA 362), and asking that the\nCoalition provide \"expert reports that comply fully with Rule\n26(a)(2)(B)\" by December 9. Id.; see also Letter from Rodman\nWard, Jr. to Thomas D. Barr (Dec. 2, 1995) (JA 384). The\nCoalition apparently did not supplement Dr. de Leeuw's report by\nthat date. Board's Brief at 55.\n         Dr. de Leeuw was deposed on December 15. After being\ninitially asked if he would be \"offering any opinions in this\nmatter,\" he responded, \"Opinions, no. I have to describe the\ndatabase construction, and I don't think that involves any\nopinions.\" Deposition of Jan de Leeuw, Dec. 15, 1994\n(hereinafter the \"de Leeuw Deposition\") (JA 1562).   However,\nThomas Henderson, a counsel for the Coalition, intervened later\nduring the deposition to \"give [the Board's counsel] notice that\n[Dr. de Leeuw] may testify as to materials and analyses, data . .\n. in the defendants [sic] reports.\" Id. (JA 1563). Describing\nthis intervention as \"a real problem,\" Andre G. Bouchard, the\nschool system's counsel, requested that he be given notice if the\nCoalition intended to call Dr. de Leeuw to testify about\n\"anything outside of his report.\" Id. Mr. Henderson responded,\n\"Well, I heard your request and it's on the record, and I will\nconsider that.\" Id.\n         The same day, the Coalition informed the defendants of\nits intention to call three new rebuttal experts. One of these\nwitnesses was Dr. Franklin Fisher, a professor of economics at\n\fM.I.T., who was to testify on the statistical analysis methods\nused in the reports by Dr. Rossell, Dr. Armor and Dr. Walberg,\nthree of the Board's witnesses. JA 858. The defense objected\nduring a hearing held on December 27, on the ground that Dr.\nFisher's testimony would simply \"duplicate what [it] thought Mr.\nDeleeuw [sic] was supposed to do.\" JA 860. The next day, the\ncourt sustained the objection and excluded the new experts'\ntestimony:\n         The deadline for naming experts is long past.\n         The general context of defendants' experts'\n         testimony and methodology used by these\n         experts should have been of no surprise to\n         the plaintiff. Defendants would be\n         prejudiced if these experts were allowed to\n         testify. And plaintiff has not claimed\n         prejudice in the absence of their testimony.\nTr. 1572 (JA 863). The Coalition did not appeal the court's\nruling.\n         On January 3, 1995, the day of Dr. de Leeuw's\ntestimony, the Coalition's counsel handed to the defendants what\ndefendants describe as \"91 pages of charts and statistical data,\"\nBoard's Brief at 56, and signaled that it intended to call Dr. de\nLeeuw to offer rebuttal testimony regarding the analyses of three\nexperts for the defendants, Drs. Armor, Achilles and Reschly.\nBoards' Brief at 56. The new testimony sought from Dr. de Leeuw\nwas to be the same as that which the Coalition expected to elicit\nfrom Dr. Fisher, and that the court excluded on December 28. JA\n1229. This time again, however, the court excluded the testimony\non the ground that the Coalition's effort failed to comply with\nthe court's previous orders and with Rule 26.\n                        2. Legal analysis\n         The Coalition argues that the court's exclusion of Dr.\nde Leeuw's rebuttal testimony is contrary to Rule 703 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, as well as \"normal practice and the\ncommon usage of expert witnesses.\" Appellant's Brief at 47. The\nCoalition further argues that exclusion of Dr. de Leeuw's\ntestimony \"does not make sense since Dr. de Leeuw's testimony was\nfashioned, and could only have been fashioned, after the cross-\nexamination of the School System's witnesses and the production\nof data bases and disk files that were made during trial.\" Id.at 47-48.\nFinally, the Coalition argues that the excluded\ntestimony \"would have demonstrated a series of methodological and\nanalytical flaws fatally undermining [the Coalition's]\ntestimony.\" Id. at 47. Because the district court failed to\nconsider the importance of Dr. de Leeuw's proffered testimony, I\nwould remand.\n                               (a)\n         I note, first, that Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence is inapposite to the dispute at hand. Rule 703 states,\ninter alia: \"The facts or data in the particular case upon which\nan expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by\nor made known to the expert at or before the hearing.\" The\nsubject of the dispute over Dr. de Leeuw's testimony, and the\nreason for his exclusion, is the scope of his expertise as\n\fdefined in the Coalition's November 30 report, and more\nspecifically \"whether at this late stage in the proceeding the\nplaintiff should be given the opportunity to present affirmative\nevidence by an expert never before qualified in\" the area of\nstudent achievement. JA 1230 (statement by The Court).\n         Similarly, the cases cited by the Coalition as\nevidencing \"normal practice and the common usage of expert\nwitnesses\" are of no relevance in the instant case. The issue in\nthe first two cases was whether an expert should be allowed to\ntestify after attending the testimony of other witnesses,\nallegedly in violation of an order by the court excluding all\nwitnesses from the courtroom during trial.

Nor does the\nthird case cited by the Coalition, an unreported district court\nopinion, offer any support for its argument. Laysears v.\nSchindler Elevator Corp., No. Civ. A. 94-3152 (E.D. Penn. Sept.\n27, 1995).\n                               (b)\n         The Coalition next argues that Dr. de Leeuw's testimony\ncould only have been fashioned after cross-examination of the\nBoard's witnesses and the production of databases and disk files\nduring trial. There are two problems with this argument. The\nfirst is that regardless of when specific data was given to the\nCoalition, the Coalition was aware all along that the school\nsystem would present statistical analyses as part of its\nargument, and it was aware by late November of the areas for\nwhich statistical analysis would be presented. The second\nproblem has to do with the chronology of what information was\navailable and when. As just noted, as of November 30, the\nCoalition knew the subjects on which the school system's various\nexperts would testify, and the extent to which they relied on\nstatistical analysis. JA 1289. As to specific experts,\n\"anything that Dr. Achilles relied on in his testimony was\nentirely in the appendix to the report on the 30th in terms of\nall the backup data for his tables.\" JA 1290. Regarding Dr.\nReschly's testimony, \"the backup tables for all of that data [the\ndata on which Dr. Reschly relied] were all contained in the\nappendix that [the school system] delivered on November 30th.\"\nId. Finally, as to Dr. Armor, it appears from the school\nsystem's uncontroverted testimony that \"[h]is methodology is\ndescribed in his report. The statistical analysis is described\nin his report. The assumptions that he made in his regression\nmethodology is described carefully and fully in his report.\" Id.\nTherefore, the only data that was missing as of December 1 was\nspecific census data used by Dr. Armor in his work -- but again,\nwhile the Coalition may not have had all the data as of November\n30, it knew the scope and methodology of the testimony to be\npresented by the school system. Therefore, the district court\nwas certainly acting within its discretion when it found that the\nCoalition failed to comply with its orders regarding Dr. de\nLeeuw's belated testimony.\n                               (c)\n\f         Our analysis does not end with the district court's\nfinding, however. It has been the \"consistent position\" of the\nThird Circuit that \"'the importance of the excluded testimony is\none of the factors to be considered in deciding whether the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in excluding a witness.'\" Sowell v.\nButcher & Singer, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556428\"><a href=\"/opinion/556428/sowell-john-b-v-butcher-singer-inc-grey-thomas-a-bennett-samuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting\nMeyers v.

As the\ncourt in Meyers explained, the following \"basic considerations\"\nshould guide the court's decision:\n         (1) the prejudice or surprise in fact of the\n         party against whom the excluded witnesses\n         would have testified, (2) the ability of that\n         party to cure the prejudice, (3) the extent\n         to which waiver of the rule against calling\n         unlisted witnesses would disrupt the orderly\n         and efficient trial of the case or of other\n         cases in the court, and (4) bad faith or\n         willfulness in failing to comply with the\n         court's order.\nId.at 904-05; see also DeMarines v.

Conclusion\n         The presence of a number of young black students at the\nargument of this matter should serve as a compelling reminder to\nus that while we struggle over the sufficiency of proof and\nallocation of burdens, our decision today directly affects the\neducation and future of many of these young people.\n         As I cannot join the opinion of the Majority on the\nlegal grounds outlined above, neither can I join the condemnation\nof Coalition's counsel. Without the zealous advocacy\ndemonstrated throughout this case's history, much of what has\n\fbeen accomplished in the past two decades would not have been.\n         Nor can I join in the Majority's criticism of \"the\nmicromanagement of [segregated] school systems by the federal\ncourts.\" Majority at 67. The courts assumed their role in these\nmatters not out of an unquenchable thirst for power or a desire\nto intrude upon the province of others, but because of the\nfailure of those charged with the responsibility of ending\nsegregation to fulfill the duties imposed upon them and respond\nvoluntarily to the commands of Brown. The courts' authority in\nthese matters does not spring from arrogance, nor does it merely\n\"inhere in equity jurisdiction.\" Id. It is rooted in the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution.\n         Much time has elapsed since the State of Delaware was\nfirst ordered to desegregate its schools and, admittedly, much\nhas been accomplished. But unless and until we can be certain\nthat all of the vestiges of past discrimination have been\neliminated to the extent practicable, supervision should not be\nabandoned. Considering that we are dealing here with the\neducation and future of a large number of tomorrow's leaders, to\ntrade additional time for greater equality is not a bad bargain.\n         Accordingly, I would remand for further consideration\nand findings consistent with this opinion.\n\f</pre>",
