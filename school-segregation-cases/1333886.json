Plaintiffs, a researcher and several library, historical research, and national security affairs associations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> assert that, in contravention of the first amendment, a government agency, the National Security Agency (NSA or Agency), has interfered with their access to the documents.  But for the unauthorized and unconstitutional interference of the Agency, plaintiffs allege, the library would accord them access to the withheld papers.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court decided the case on the merits for the NSA;  the court held, on the basis of facts not genuinely in controversy, that plaintiffs did not have a first amendment right of access to the materials.   American Library Association v. Faurer, 631 F.Supp. 416 (D.D.C.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment dismissing the action, but we do so without reaching the merits.  Plaintiffs claim a speaker-hearer (or communicator-reader) relationship with the library.  They say \"this is a case where government action is preventing a willing, private speaker from communicating information to plaintiffs.\"    Reply Brief for Appellants at 9.  There is generally no right, however, \"to hear what a speaker does not choose to say.\"   Frissell v. Rizzo, 597 F.2d 840, 848 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 841, 100 S.Ct. 82, 62 L.Ed.2d 54 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, we find, have not shown that they are adequate representatives of the library's interests, or that they can reliably convey that private speaker's will.  Nor have they endeavored to join the foundation that maintains the library as a party in the action pursuant to Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication).  We therefore hold that plaintiffs are not positioned to maintain this case.  With no warrant to stand-in for the speaker, they correspondingly lack standing to assert the right to hear.   See Frissell, 597 F.2d at 848-49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Friedman Collection on Cryptology\" is housed at the George C. Marshall Research Foundation's Library (Marshall Library or Library), a private facility on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia.  The Library houses the private papers of several former federal officers once prominently involved in the nation's defense, most notably, the papers of Secretary of State George C. Marshall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Friedman was for years the nation's foremost cryptanalyst;  he devoted his extraordinary talent to the service of the United States as a long-term employee of the NSA and its predecessor agencies.  Friedman retired in 1955 but continued thereafter to work for NSA as a consultant.  He also began in his retirement years to review and catalog his massive collection of materials on cryptology and secret communication, consisting of several hundred books, technical monographs, artifacts, and memorabilia, plus voluminous correspondence.  The Agency furnished some assistance to Friedman in storing his cryptology materials securely in his home, cataloging them, even filling in gaps in his collection.  In August 1969, some months before his death, Friedman wrote to the George C. Marshall Research Foundation reporting his decision to convey his collection to that private foundation, for maintenance at the Marshall Library.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Friedman stated in his August 1969 letter to the Foundation that two considerations motivated his choice of the Marshall Library.  The second consideration was the Foundation's \"agree[ment] to keep the Collection  intact.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   The first was Friedman's understanding that the Library \"would be approved as an institution which could keep valuable or classified papers relating to our National Security or to our National Defense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   In December 1970, after Friedman's death, his Collection on Cryptology was transported from his home in Washington, D.C., to the Marshall Library.  NSA provided for secure shipment of the collection to safeguard the materials and facilitate the in transit insurance arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While employed at NSA, in February 1954, Friedman had signed a secrecy oath.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   The oath acknowledged Friedman's obligations not to disclose information concerning NSA, and stated, inter alia:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[U]pon ... severance of my connection with the National Security Agency, I will not reveal ... my connection with or knowledge of communications intelligence or communication security operations unless freed from this obligation by unmistakable and categorical official notice....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSA, however, never set out by written agreement a statement of the terms and conditions under which the Friedman Collection would be kept at the Marshall Library.  In contrast, the Department of the Army had entered into an agreement with the Marshall Foundation in 1967 concerning the Library's maintenance of Army-originated papers containing classified information;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Friedman had referred to this 1967 agreement in his August 1969 letter concerning the gift of his cryptology collection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Friedman Collection, lodged in the Marshall Library in December 1970, was opened to the public in January 1978.  Prior to that time, for two weeks late in 1975, Friedman's biographer, British writer Ronald Clark, enjoyed unrestricted access to the entire collection.  (Friedman's wife had requested that the collection stay closed to the general public until publication of the biography.  The biography, titled The Man Who Broke Purple, The Life of the World's Greatest Cryptologist, Colonel William F. Friedman, was published by Little, Brown and Co. in 1977.)    In addition to Clark, NSA officials had examined the materials in the years between 1970 and 1978.  Two inspections were made in 1971, and one in 1974, to organize the materials and assess their historical significance.  In July 1975 and November and December 1976, NSA undertook classification review of the documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   During the 1976 review,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> certain documents in Friedman's correspondence files were segregated as \"sensitive.\"    NSA did not then label that material \"classified,\" but the Library's archivist agreed to remove items in the \"sensitive\" category from the open shelves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, when the public was admitted to the Friedman Collection in 1978, two categories of materials were withheld:  classified documents;  and items of correspondence NSA had identified in 1976 as sensitive.  In October 1979, without informing NSA, but apparently without intent to defy the Agency's instructions, the Library's archivist opened to the public the correspondence declared sensitive in 1976, and held back only the items in the classified category.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   This action went unnoticed by NSA until 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some declassification and reclassification of books, pamphlets, and monographs occurred in 1981,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> but NSA reviewers did not that year examine the Friedman correspondence files.  A book about the NSA published in 1982<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> led the Agency to suspect that the sensitive Friedman correspondence segregated in 1976 had been made available to the public sometime after the Collection opened in 1978.  In an April 1983 visit to the Library, NSA officials discovered that the sensitive documents had indeed been accessible to Library visitors since October 1979.  These officials approved continued public access to some of the documents once in the sensitive category, classified a few of the items labeled sensitive in 1976, and asked the Library, pending continuing NSA review, to seal as still sensitive (albeit not then classified) several of the documents identified in 1976, along with some additional material earlier thought to be nonsensitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precipitating this lawsuit, in May and June 1983, Jay Peterzell, a research associate at the Center for National Security Studies, visited the Marshall Library, reviewed the large open portions of the Friedman Collection, and requested access to the withdrawn portions.  On information from the Library about NSA's position regarding the withheld documents, Peterzell and the organizational plaintiffs wrote to NSA in January 1984;  they asked the Agency to rescind its instructions to the Library, so that all Friedman Collection documents that at any time had been available for public inspection would be restored to open shelves.  NSA promptly denied this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, between February and April 1984, NSA eliminated the separate, \"sensitive\" category;  the Agency either classified or opened to the public all Friedman Collection materials.  Three government publications<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and thirty pieces of correspondence now reside in the classified category.  In the confusion attending 1975-1984 classification, declassification, and reclassification of Friedman's books and papers, each of the currently classified items had been freely available to the public at the Marshall Library at one time.  This litigation aims at permanent public disclosure of the thirty-three now classified items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint, filed in February 1984, alleges that NSA has no power to direct a private entity (the Marshall Library) to deny access to non-classified materials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and that, once information has been made available to the public, NSA lacks authority to stamp it classified.  NSA's unauthorized actions, researcher Peterzell and the organizational plaintiffs charge, interfere, in contravention of the first amendment, with the public access that the Library, if left alone by NSA, would grant to everything in the Friedman Collection.  The complaint deliberately states no claim under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552, and also deliberately refrains from naming the Marshall Foundation as a party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSA responded to the complaint by moving to dismiss or for summary judgment.  The district court allowed plaintiffs to pursue discovery before answering NSA's motion;  upon completing their discovery, plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment.  The district court then granted NSA's motion;  it reasoned that:  (1) section 6(a) of the National Security Agency Act of 1959,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> reinforced by Friedman's secrecy oath, authorized NSA to control the Library's handling of Friedman Collection documents containing sensitive information about the Agency's activities, 631 F.Supp. at 420;  and (2) the first amendment did not block classification of documents previously available to the public \"where their disclosure might endanger the national security,\" id. at 422.  After reviewing in camera a classified affidavit of NSA's Deputy Director, the district court concluded that the Agency had properly classified the thirty-odd documents at issue because their \"[d]isclosure ... could be reasonably expected to cause serious damage to the national security.\"   Id. at 423.  From this disposition of the merits of their complaint, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek access to information they concede they could not obtain through a FOIA request.   See, e.g., Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 742, 744-45 (D.C.Cir.1981).  The following colloquy occurred at oral argument on that point.  Counsel for NSA had noted that NSA now possessed copies of the thirty-three Friedman Collection items still withheld from public view.  The court inquired whether plaintiffs could request under FOIA access to the copies of the Friedman Collection items currently lodged at NSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for plaintiffs:  Yes, and I have no doubt about the outcome of that suit, your Honor.  The affidavits [NSA] filed would be accepted by any district judge in the country and by any court of appeals as adequate to repel a FOIA request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court:  So what you are really arguing for is a more generous standard on getting access to classified information than you would have if you had to proceed the way requesters normally do, that is, under FOIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for plaintiffs:  Yes, because in our view the information at the Library is not properly classified because it had been already released by the Agency;  duly authorized officials had made it available and in fact it was available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere deposit of the Collection at the Library, plaintiffs acknowledged, did not release the materials from the undertaking embodied in Friedman's secrecy oath.  See supra p. 83.  But that oath, plaintiffs contend, gave NSA only the right to review the Friedman Collection for classified information before the Library opened the Collection to the public.  See Brief for Appellants at 17.  Once NSA had that opportunity and allowed the Library to display the materials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> plaintiffs maintain, \"NSA renounced its control over the documents, and they became the unrestricted property of the Library pursuant to Mr. Friedman's gift.\"    Id. at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the secrecy oath that bound Friedman continues to bind the Library, we hold, is a question plaintiffs are not positioned to litigate.  The Library has made no claim that the secrecy pledges Friedman signed no longer control access to materials in the Collection.  Nor has the Library asserted its willingness to display the documents--even if it could establish a legal right to do so--against NSA's plea that national security considerations warrant withholding the thirty-three items.  Plaintiffs' case, we think it critical to recognize, is essentially derivative;  their access claim posits a \"willing, private speaker.\"    See supra pp. 82, 83-85.  But the record does not bear out the Library's qualification for \"willing speaker\" billing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs used the discovery opportunity afforded them in the district court to inquire into the Library's readiness to communicate.  They point to statements contained in the depositions of two Library officials to show that the Library was and remains a willing speaker, thwarted by unjustified government interference.  See Brief for Appellants at 13.  The featured statements do show annoyance and frustration over NSA's instructions to hold back materials the Agency declared \"sensitive\" but did not classify.  As one of the officials said:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[T]he material that had been withheld but not classified ... was an embarrassment to us ... and we felt they should either classify it or put it on the shelf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, the other official commented:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thing that gave us a problem ... was material that they did not feel was classified but we were requested to remove from open shelves.  This was our basic problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We didn't have any problem with classified material....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once NSA eliminated the \"sensitive\" but not classified category, by either classifying the documents or advertently releasing them from the secrecy pledge, the Library's \"problem,\" it appears, was overcome.  We find no indication that the Library presented itself as a willing communicator after NSA, in the words of a Library official<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>c[a]me down and ha[d] a look at the material and [did] what [the Library] had been asking all along, to either classify the material or open it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reader's interest in dislodging a government-imposed restraint on another's communication has been insightfully analyzed as \"fundamentally analogous\" to a claim of \"standing to assert the rights of a third party.\"   Frissell, 597 F.2d at 848.  Courts have rejected such claims where the litigant and the third party whose rights the litigant seeks to raise may have divergent interests.  See generally Rohr, Fighting for the Rights of Others:  The Troubled Law of Third Party Standing and Mootness in the Federal Courts, 35 U.MIAMI L.REV. 393, 456-61 (1981) (setting out cases in point).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Library has never objected to classification reviews by NSA, it has objected to a limbo category of unclassified but nonetheless withheld papers, it has urged--and apparently does not now object to--firm decisions by NSA either to open documents or to classify them.  The arrangement between NSA and the Library concerning the Friedman Collection, from the start, see supra pp. 83-85, has been notably informal.  Neither side, it appears, felt a need for a written agreement.  Both viewed the arrangement as advantageous to the participants and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a solid basis on which to conclude that plaintiffs' interests and the Library's in displaying the thirty-three documents are congruent, we hold that plaintiffs' claim cannot be maintained.  Plaintiffs, no doubt, are eager to know what the documents in contention contain.  But the Marshall Library, in view of its beneficial relationships with federal officers and agencies concerned with national defense, has not been shown to be a willing communicator.  In these circumstances, precedent rules out adjudication of plaintiffs' plea.   See, e.g., Davis &amp; Farnum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U.S. 207, 23 S.Ct. 498, 47 L.Ed. 778 (1903);  Friedman v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Friedman Collection on Cryptology\" is housed at the George C. Marshall Research Foundation's Library (Marshall Library or Library), a private facility on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia.  The Library houses the private papers of several former federal officers once prominently involved in the nation's defense, most notably, the papers of Secretary of State George C. Marshall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Friedman was for years the nation's foremost cryptanalyst;  he devoted his extraordinary talent to the service of the United States as a long-term employee of the NSA and its predecessor agencies.  Friedman retired in 1955 but continued thereafter to work for NSA as a consultant.  He also began in his retirement years to review and catalog his massive collection of materials on cryptology and secret communication, consisting of several hundred books, technical monographs, artifacts, and memorabilia, plus voluminous correspondence.  The Agency furnished some assistance to Friedman in storing his cryptology materials securely in his home, cataloging them, even filling in gaps in his collection.  In August 1969, some months before his death, Friedman wrote to the George C. Marshall Research Foundation reporting his decision to convey his collection to that private foundation, for maintenance at the Marshall Library.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Friedman stated in his August 1969 letter to the Foundation that two considerations motivated his choice of the Marshall Library.  The second consideration was the Foundation's \"agree[ment] to keep the Collection  intact.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   The first was Friedman's understanding that the Library \"would be approved as an institution which could keep valuable or classified papers relating to our National Security or to our National Defense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   In December 1970, after Friedman's death, his Collection on Cryptology was transported from his home in Washington, D.C., to the Marshall Library.  NSA provided for secure shipment of the collection to safeguard the materials and facilitate the in transit insurance arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While employed at NSA, in February 1954, Friedman had signed a secrecy oath.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   The oath acknowledged Friedman's obligations not to disclose information concerning NSA, and stated, inter alia:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>[U]pon ... severance of my connection with the National Security Agency, I will not reveal ... my connection with or knowledge of communications intelligence or communication security operations unless freed from this obligation by unmistakable and categorical official notice....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSA, however, never set out by written agreement a statement of the terms and conditions under which the Friedman Collection would be kept at the Marshall Library.  In contrast, the Department of the Army had entered into an agreement with the Marshall Foundation in 1967 concerning the Library's maintenance of Army-originated papers containing classified information;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Friedman had referred to this 1967 agreement in his August 1969 letter concerning the gift of his cryptology collection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Friedman Collection, lodged in the Marshall Library in December 1970, was opened to the public in January 1978.  Prior to that time, for two weeks late in 1975, Friedman's biographer, British writer Ronald Clark, enjoyed unrestricted access to the entire collection.  (Friedman's wife had requested that the collection stay closed to the general public until publication of the biography.  The biography, titled The Man Who Broke Purple, The Life of the World's Greatest Cryptologist, Colonel William F. Friedman, was published by Little, Brown and Co. in 1977.)    In addition to Clark, NSA officials had examined the materials in the years between 1970 and 1978.  Two inspections were made in 1971, and one in 1974, to organize the materials and assess their historical significance.  In July 1975 and November and December 1976, NSA undertook classification review of the documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   During the 1976 review,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> certain documents in Friedman's correspondence files were segregated as \"sensitive.\"    NSA did not then label that material \"classified,\" but the Library's archivist agreed to remove items in the \"sensitive\" category from the open shelves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, when the public was admitted to the Friedman Collection in 1978, two categories of materials were withheld:  classified documents;  and items of correspondence NSA had identified in 1976 as sensitive.  In October 1979, without informing NSA, but apparently without intent to defy the Agency's instructions, the Library's archivist opened to the public the correspondence declared sensitive in 1976, and held back only the items in the classified category.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>   This action went unnoticed by NSA until 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some declassification and reclassification of books, pamphlets, and monographs occurred in 1981,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> but NSA reviewers did not that year examine the Friedman correspondence files.  A book about the NSA published in 1982<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> led the Agency to suspect that the sensitive Friedman correspondence segregated in 1976 had been made available to the public sometime after the Collection opened in 1978.  In an April 1983 visit to the Library, NSA officials discovered that the sensitive documents had indeed been accessible to Library visitors since October 1979.  These officials approved continued public access to some of the documents once in the sensitive category, classified a few of the items labeled sensitive in 1976, and asked the Library, pending continuing NSA review, to seal as still sensitive (albeit not then classified) several of the documents identified in 1976, along with some additional material earlier thought to be nonsensitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precipitating this lawsuit, in May and June 1983, Jay Peterzell, a research associate at the Center for National Security Studies, visited the Marshall Library, reviewed the large open portions of the Friedman Collection, and requested access to the withdrawn portions.  On information from the Library about NSA's position regarding the withheld documents, Peterzell and the organizational plaintiffs wrote to NSA in January 1984;  they asked the Agency to rescind its instructions to the Library, so that all Friedman Collection documents that at any time had been available for public inspection would be restored to open shelves.  NSA promptly denied this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, between February and April 1984, NSA eliminated the separate, \"sensitive\" category;  the Agency either classified or opened to the public all Friedman Collection materials.  Three government publications<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> and thirty pieces of correspondence now reside in the classified category.  In the confusion attending 1975-1984 classification, declassification, and reclassification of Friedman's books and papers, each of the currently classified items had been freely available to the public at the Marshall Library at one time.  This litigation aims at permanent public disclosure of the thirty-three now classified items.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint, filed in February 1984, alleges that NSA has no power to direct a private entity (the Marshall Library) to deny access to non-classified materials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and that, once information has been made available to the public, NSA lacks authority to stamp it classified.  NSA's unauthorized actions, researcher Peterzell and the organizational plaintiffs charge, interfere, in contravention of the first amendment, with the public access that the Library, if left alone by NSA, would grant to everything in the Friedman Collection.  The complaint deliberately states no claim under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552, and also deliberately refrains from naming the Marshall Foundation as a party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSA responded to the complaint by moving to dismiss or for summary judgment.  The district court allowed plaintiffs to pursue discovery before answering NSA's motion;  upon completing their discovery, plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment.  The district court then granted NSA's motion;  it reasoned that:  (1) section 6(a) of the National Security Agency Act of 1959,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> reinforced by Friedman's secrecy oath, authorized NSA to control the Library's handling of Friedman Collection documents containing sensitive information about the Agency's activities, 631 F.Supp. at 420;  and (2) the first amendment did not block classification of documents previously available to the public \"where their disclosure might endanger the national security,\" id. at 422.  After reviewing in camera a classified affidavit of NSA's Deputy Director, the district court concluded that the Agency had properly classified the thirty-odd documents at issue because their \"[d]isclosure ... could be reasonably expected to cause serious damage to the national security.\"   Id. at 423.  From this disposition of the merits of their complaint, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs seek access to information they concede they could not obtain through a FOIA request.   See, e.g., Military Audit Project v. Casey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393156\"><a href=\"/opinion/393156/military-audit-project-felice-d-cohen-morton-h-halperin-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 742, 744-45 (D.C.Cir.1981).  The following colloquy occurred at oral argument on that point.  Counsel for NSA had noted that NSA now possessed copies of the thirty-three Friedman Collection items still withheld from public view.  The court inquired whether plaintiffs could request under FOIA access to the copies of the Friedman Collection items currently lodged at NSA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for plaintiffs:  Yes, and I have no doubt about the outcome of that suit, your Honor.  The affidavits [NSA] filed would be accepted by any district judge in the country and by any court of appeals as adequate to repel a FOIA request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Court:  So what you are really arguing for is a more generous standard on getting access to classified information than you would have if you had to proceed the way requesters normally do, that is, under FOIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for plaintiffs:  Yes, because in our view the information at the Library is not properly classified because it had been already released by the Agency;  duly authorized officials had made it available and in fact it was available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere deposit of the Collection at the Library, plaintiffs acknowledged, did not release the materials from the undertaking embodied in Friedman's secrecy oath.  See supra p. 83.  But that oath, plaintiffs contend, gave NSA only the right to review the Friedman Collection for classified information before the Library opened the Collection to the public.  See Brief for Appellants at 17.  Once NSA had that opportunity and allowed the Library to display the materials,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> plaintiffs maintain, \"NSA renounced its control over the documents, and they became the unrestricted property of the Library pursuant to Mr. Friedman's gift.\"    Id. at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the secrecy oath that bound Friedman continues to bind the Library, we hold, is a question plaintiffs are not positioned to litigate.  The Library has made no claim that the secrecy pledges Friedman signed no longer control access to materials in the Collection.  Nor has the Library asserted its willingness to display the documents--even if it could establish a legal right to do so--against NSA's plea that national security considerations warrant withholding the thirty-three items.  Plaintiffs' case, we think it critical to recognize, is essentially derivative;  their access claim posits a \"willing, private speaker.\"    See supra pp. 82, 83-85.  But the record does not bear out the Library's qualification for \"willing speaker\" billing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs used the discovery opportunity afforded them in the district court to inquire into the Library's readiness to communicate.  They point to statements contained in the depositions of two Library officials to show that the Library was and remains a willing speaker, thwarted by unjustified government interference.  See Brief for Appellants at 13.  The featured statements do show annoyance and frustration over NSA's instructions to hold back materials the Agency declared \"sensitive\" but did not classify.  As one of the officials said:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>[T]he material that had been withheld but not classified ... was an embarrassment to us ... and we felt they should either classify it or put it on the shelf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, the other official commented:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thing that gave us a problem ... was material that they did not feel was classified but we were requested to remove from open shelves.  This was our basic problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We didn't have any problem with classified material....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once NSA eliminated the \"sensitive\" but not classified category, by either classifying the documents or advertently releasing them from the secrecy pledge, the Library's \"problem,\" it appears, was overcome.  We find no indication that the Library presented itself as a willing communicator after NSA, in the words of a Library official<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>c[a]me down and ha[d] a look at the material and [did] what [the Library] had been asking all along, to either classify the material or open it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reader's interest in dislodging a government-imposed restraint on another's communication has been insightfully analyzed as \"fundamentally analogous\" to a claim of \"standing to assert the rights of a third party.\"   Frissell, 597 F.2d at 848.  Courts have rejected such claims where the litigant and the third party whose rights the litigant seeks to raise may have divergent interests.  See generally Rohr, Fighting for the Rights of Others:  The Troubled Law of Third Party Standing and Mootness in the Federal Courts, 35 U.MIAMI L.REV. 393, 456-61 (1981) (setting out cases in point).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Library has never objected to classification reviews by NSA, it has objected to a limbo category of unclassified but nonetheless withheld papers, it has urged--and apparently does not now object to--firm decisions by NSA either to open documents or to classify them.  The arrangement between NSA and the Library concerning the Friedman Collection, from the start, see supra pp. 83-85, has been notably informal.  Neither side, it appears, felt a need for a written agreement.  Both viewed the arrangement as advantageous to the participants and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Absent a solid basis on which to conclude that plaintiffs' interests and the Library's in displaying the thirty-three documents are congruent, we hold that plaintiffs' claim cannot be maintained.  Plaintiffs, no doubt, are eager to know what the documents in contention contain.  But the Marshall Library, in view of its beneficial relationships with federal officers and agencies concerned with national defense, has not been shown to be a willing communicator.  In these circumstances, precedent rules out adjudication of plaintiffs' plea.   See, e.g., Davis &amp; Farnum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95844\"><a href=\"/opinion/95844/davis-farnum-mfg-co-v-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95844\"><a href=\"/opinion/95844/davis-farnum-mfg-co-v-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
