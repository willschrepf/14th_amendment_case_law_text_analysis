The superintendent of schools, when called by the relators, testified that the assignment of pupils is not and cannot be made according to geographical lines; that the Smith Place School is located in the most densely populated portion of the city and that half the grade pupils of the city live in \"very close proximity\" thereto. It thus became necessary to assign many pupils in that vicinity to other buildings, each case being considered on its own facts, the general intention and purpose being to so allocate the pupils that each school would have approximately the same number of pupils per room and the same cost of instruction per pupil.</p>\n<p>Though there was a less number of pupils in the Midland School, there was approximately the same number of pupils per room as in the other schools. It is conceded that the equipment, teaching facilities and other accommodations of the Midland School are in every way equal to those provided for the other schools. The relators in their testimony indicated their complaint was not based upon any racial distinction, but only upon inconvenience. The record shows the following testimony of one of the relators. \"The Court: You have no objection now to the Midland School by reason of distance or anything of that kind? A. No, I don't. Other than I asked permission to send them to the school nearest my home.</p>\n<p>\"Q. There is no other reason why they shouldn't go to Midland School now, so far as you are concerned? A. No, there isn't. Only I would like for them to go to the school nearest home. It would be more convenient for me.\"</p>\n<p>Section 7684, General Code, provides as follows: \"Boards of education may make such an assignment of the youth of their respective districts to the schools established by them as in their opinion best will promote the interests of education in their districts.\"</p>\n<p>By the provisions of this statute, broad power and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 149</span> \ndiscretion are conferred upon boards of education to so assign pupils to the various schools of their districts as they in good faith believe will best promote the interests of education. The court cannot control that discretion or substitute its own discretion for that of the board of education. Those affected by such order of assignment of pupils are not entitled to a review of that action of the board in a mandamus proceeding.</p>\n<p>Conditions manifestly made it necessary to assign many pupils living in the vicinity of the Smith Place School to other schools. It is to be observed that the relators resided a half mile from the Smith Place School. Action of the court directing that the assignment made by the board be altered and the relators' children permitted to attend the Smith Place School must logically be followed by the further direction that two pupils assigned to that school be transferred elsewhere. The court thus would be making a selection that is within the absolute power and discretion of the board of education.</p>\n<p>Upon the matter of alleged discrimination, it may be observed that the record discloses that heretofore white children have been assigned to the Midland School and colored children have been assigned to the Smith Place School; in fact, the oldest son of the relators had attended the Smith Place School through the entire seven grades. It does not appear, therefore, that a fixed policy had been adopted by the board of education making any classification, distinction or discrimination on the basis of race or color.</p>\n<p>It has not been established that the respondents have failed or refused to perform a duty specially enjoined by law. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>WEYGANDT, C.J., ZIMMERMAN, WILLIAMS, MATTHIAS and HART, JJ., concur.</p>\n<blockquote><p>  DAY, J., dissents.</blockquote> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 150</span> </p>",

      "posture": "APPEAL from the Court of Appeals of Clinton county.\n\nThis case originated in the Court of Appeals of Clinton county. The relators were Theodore Lewis and Mary Elizabeth Lewis, parents and next friends of\nCharles Edward Lewis and Thealou Lewis. The respondents were the Board of Education of the Wilmington School District, Harry W. Hodson, superintendent of schools, and Miss Viola Larrick, principal of Smith Place School. Charles Edward Lewis and Thealou Lewis are aged nine and six years respectively, and are residents of the Wilmington School District and thus are eligible for enrollment and admission in the elementary schools of the district.\n\nThe respondent board of education now maintains four elementary schools in the Wilmington City School District, known as the Smith Place School, Main School, East End School and Midland School. The Smith Place School is located approximately five-tenths of a mile from the relators' residence; the Main School is located approximately eight-tenths of a mile, the East End School in excess of two miles, and the Midland School approximately one and one-fourth miles from relators' residence.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the school year, relators' children had been assigned to Midland School and, by reason thereof, their admission and enrollment in Smith Place School was refused by the principal of that school. Thereupon relators instituted this proceeding for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the respondents to admit and enroll the relators' children in Smith Place School or Main School. The relators aver \"that said Midland School is a segregated school for the exclusive use, accommodation and training of persons of the colored race; that the children of said relators are colored children; and that by the acts of the defendants said children are being denied and deprived of their right to attend the elementary school within their district convenient to their home as other children irrespective of their race or color.\"\n\nIssue was made and the case was heard upon certain stipulations of fact and evidence adduced. The court found in favor of the respondents and that the relators\nwere not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Thereupon the case was duly appealed to this court.",
