Connor\n                                    Clerk\n\nWILKINSON, Chief Judge, concurring in the denial of reconsidera-\ntion:\n\n   The matter of attorneys’ fees has been extensively debated in the\nen banc decision of the court and I have no desire to belabor it. In\nview of my good colleague’s dissent, however, I shall briefly state the\nbasis for my view that a departure from the American rule, whereby\neach side pays its own lawyers, is not warranted with respect to the\nunitary status determination.\n\n   Such a departure is not justified for the simple reason that Congress\nhas not authorized it. The Supreme Court has made clear that Con-\ngress has not \"extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow\ncounsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem\nthem warranted.\" Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc’y, 421\nU.S. 240, 260 (1975). Under the American rule, \"we follow a general\npractice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit stat-\nutory authority.\" Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia\nDept. of Health & Human Res., 121 S. Ct. 1835, 1839 (2001) (internal\nquotation omitted). There is no such authority here.\n\n  The dissent attempts to analogize the unitary status proceedings to\nan action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for which attorney’s fees would be\n\f6       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\navailable to prevailing parties at the discretion of the court under 42\nU.S.C. § 1988. What we have here, however, is the exact opposite of\na § 1983 action. The essence of a § 1983 action is that the defendant\nhas violated the plaintiff’s federal rights under color of state law. In\ncontrast, the entire point of a unitary status determination is to prove\nthat the school district is in compliance with federal law. And Con-\ngress has simply not authorized us to impose attorney’s fees on a\nparty whose actions have been adjudged compliant with federal stat-\nutes and our Constitution.\n\n   While the dissent would have us believe that the Grant and Capac-\nchione plaintiffs simply picked up where the Swann plaintiffs left off,\nthis is simply not the case. The focus of their respective efforts was\nquite different. The Swann plaintiffs sought to prove the school board\nin violation of the bedrock federal mandate that no student be denied\nan education on account of his or her race. The unitary status proceed-\nings sought to determine, by contrast, that the rights of all school chil-\ndren under federal law had been vindicated and achieved.\n\n   It is important that the judicial system not blow hot and cold with\nrespect to the litigants who come before it. For many decades the\ncourts impressed upon the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district the\nsingular importance of desegregating its public schools and affording\neach and every child an equal educational opportunity without regard\nto race. See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402\nU.S. 1, 15 (1971) (\"[S]chool authorities are clearly charged with the\naffirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert\nto a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be elimi-\nnated root and branch.\") (internal quotation omitted). Now that this\ngoal of unitariness has been reached, it would be inconsistent in the\nextreme to punish the school board for doing the very thing the courts\nhave all along insisted that it do.\n\n   My good dissenting brother urges us to view this matter as one of\nequity or policy. I readily agree that the Grant and Capacchione plain-\ntiffs have performed a substantial public service in achieving the uni-\ntary status determination and in returning the school system to the\ncontrol of local authorities. As a matter of equity, however, there is\nalso something to be said for looking to the future, putting this litiga-\ntion behind us, and spending public funds on the education of school\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION       7\nchildren rather than on opposing lawyers’ bills. The dissent predicts\nthat unitary status proceedings will become unaffordable in the\nabsence of fee shifting, but it is quite possible that school boards in\nother locations will be moved to free themselves from court orders on\ntheir own without the need for private interveners to enter the suit. In\nall events, these are questions of pure policy and underscore the inad-\nvisability of courts debating the pros and cons of fee shifting in the\nabsence of a congressional declaration.\n\n   It is simply untenable to impose a large fee obligation upon a pub-\nlic school district for desegregating its schools. Congress has not\nsanctioned such a course of action. It would mark a cruel sequel to\nthe Brown decision if, at the end of the day, federal courts were to\npunish the successful completion of the desegregation process with an\nunauthorized departure from the American rule.\n\nTRAXLER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from this court’s denial of Capacchione’s and\nGrant’s motions to reconsider their claims to attorneys’ fees for the\nrole they played as private attorneys general in achieving a declara-\ntion of unitary status. As a result of this declaration, CMS must have\na race-neutral student assignment plan in place no later than the 2002-\n2003 school year unless its use of race is narrowly tailored to serve\na compelling governmental interest. The plaintiff-intervenors have\nprevailed against CMS and have obtained a decree that alters the con-\nduct of CMS toward all children attending public school in Mecklen-\nburg County. Yet, this court vacates the district court’s fee award on\nthe ground that the plaintiff-intervenors have not prevailed.\n\n   School desegregation cases are unique in the manner in which they\nproceed. There are two basic steps in the court process to obtain uni-\ntary status. In the first part, the plaintiffs seek to impose federal court\ncontrol over the school system and to have federal courts dictate pro-\ncedures for the operation of the schools. When the court-ordered pro-\ncedures have worked, the second part begins with the parties\nreturning to district court to obtain a declaration of unitary status and\nthe concomitant removal of federal court oversight.\n\n  This case began in 1965 when the original Swann plaintiffs brought\na § 1983 action to convert CMS \"into a unitary nonracial system\n\f8       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nwherein educational opportunities offered by [the board] are made\navailable to all students without regard to race or color.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,162. The Swann plaintiffs succeeded in having CMS placed under\ncourt order and participated in proceedings whereby the district court\nadopted a sweeping desegregation plan. In 1975, the case was\nremoved from the active docket and the Swann plaintiffs were\ndeservedly and properly awarded $204,072.33 in fees and costs for\ntheir service as private attorneys general in the first phase of the\ndesegregation effort.\n\n   For the most part, this case remained inactive until 1997, when\nCapacchione challenged CMS’s magnet schools program and, shortly\nthereafter, amended her complaint to seek a declaration of unitary sta-\ntus as well. Swann was reactivated and Capacchione intervened in\nthat action. Grant then moved for a declaration of unitary status and\nalso intervened in the Swann litigation. Thus began the second part\nof the process.\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs, however, did not want the second and final\nphase of the judicial process to occur, so they fought a finding of uni-\ntary status. Capacchione and Grant had to step in and prove to the dis-\ntrict court that what the Swann plaintiffs originally sought in their\nlawsuit under § 1983 had, in fact, been achieved—that what had been\nstarted in the 1960s had finally been completed and the vestiges of\nsegregation removed to the extent practicable. And like the Swann\nplaintiffs, who received a fee award for work done before the case\nwas removed from the active docket, the plaintiff-intervenors now\nseek, and are entitled to, their attorneys’ fees.\n\n   No member of the court doubts that the Swann plaintiffs would be\nentitled to fees under § 1988 had they been the ones to successfully\nmove for a declaration of unitary status. Yet in spite of the same mea-\nsure of success by the plaintiff-intervenors, we deny them their fees.\nBy judicial fiat, plaintiff-intervenors in school desegregation cases\nhave been written out of § 1988. Should another case like this arise\nwhere the original plaintiffs and the school board are content to let the\ndesegregation order remain in place long after the dual system has\nbeen dismantled, parents demanding a return of local control will be\nhelpless. As the present case demonstrates, a declaration of unitary\nstatus can be expensive ($1.49 million). I have no doubt that if our\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      9\ndecision had been on the books in 1997 neither Capacchione, nor\nGrant, nor virtually any other public school parent in Mecklenburg\nCounty could have afforded to seek a removal of the federal courts\nfrom control of the school system. I find it ironic that in affirming the\ndistrict court’s declaration of unitary status but denying the prevailing\nparties their fees, we simultaneously condemn other school districts\nin our circuit to prolonged and unnecessary federal court control.\n\n   Finally, while unfortunate that the school board should have to pay\nsuch a large award, this is a risk it took when it decided to fight the\nunitary status determination—not unlike the ill-fated decision it made\nin the 1960s to fight the desegregation effort to begin with, when we\nmade it pay the fees of the original Swann plaintiffs. For attorneys’\nfees purposes, this court has decided that one party can get its fees\nunder § 1988 for forcing the school board to abide by the law while\nthe other cannot. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n   Judge Widener and Judge Wilkins have authorized me to indicate\nthat they join in this dissent.\n\f",

There is no such authority here.\n\n  The dissent attempts to analogize the unitary status proceedings to\nan action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for which attorney’s fees would be\n\f6       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\navailable to prevailing parties at the discretion of the court under 42\nU.S.C. § 1988. What we have here, however, is the exact opposite of\na § 1983 action. The essence of a § 1983 action is that the defendant\nhas violated the plaintiff’s federal rights under color of state law. In\ncontrast, the entire point of a unitary status determination is to prove\nthat the school district is in compliance with federal law. And Con-\ngress has simply not authorized us to impose attorney’s fees on a\nparty whose actions have been adjudged compliant with federal stat-\nutes and our Constitution.\n\n   While the dissent would have us believe that the Grant and Capac-\nchione plaintiffs simply picked up where the Swann plaintiffs left off,\nthis is simply not the case. The focus of their respective efforts was\nquite different. The Swann plaintiffs sought to prove the school board\nin violation of the bedrock federal mandate that no student be denied\nan education on account of his or her race. The unitary status proceed-\nings sought to determine, by contrast, that the rights of all school chil-\ndren under federal law had been vindicated and achieved.\n\n   It is important that the judicial system not blow hot and cold with\nrespect to the litigants who come before it. For many decades the\ncourts impressed upon the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district the\nsingular importance of desegregating its public schools and affording\neach and every child an equal educational opportunity without regard\nto race. See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1971) (\"[S]chool authorities are clearly charged with the\naffirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert\nto a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be elimi-\nnated root and branch.\") (internal quotation omitted). Now that this\ngoal of unitariness has been reached, it would be inconsistent in the\nextreme to punish the school board for doing the very thing the courts\nhave all along insisted that it do.\n\n   My good dissenting brother urges us to view this matter as one of\nequity or policy. I readily agree that the Grant and Capacchione plain-\ntiffs have performed a substantial public service in achieving the uni-\ntary status determination and in returning the school system to the\ncontrol of local authorities. As a matter of equity, however, there is\nalso something to be said for looking to the future, putting this litiga-\ntion behind us, and spending public funds on the education of school\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD         OF   EDUCATION       7\nchildren rather than on opposing lawyers’ bills. The dissent predicts\nthat unitary status proceedings will become unaffordable in the\nabsence of fee shifting, but it is quite possible that school boards in\nother locations will be moved to free themselves from court orders on\ntheir own without the need for private interveners to enter the suit. In\nall events, these are questions of pure policy and underscore the inad-\nvisability of courts debating the pros and cons of fee shifting in the\nabsence of a congressional declaration.\n\n   It is simply untenable to impose a large fee obligation upon a pub-\nlic school district for desegregating its schools. Congress has not\nsanctioned such a course of action. It would mark a cruel sequel to\nthe Brown decision if, at the end of the day, federal courts were to\npunish the successful completion of the desegregation process with an\nunauthorized departure from the American rule.\n\nTRAXLER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from this court’s denial of Capacchione’s and\nGrant’s motions to reconsider their claims to attorneys’ fees for the\nrole they played as private attorneys general in achieving a declara-\ntion of unitary status. As a result of this declaration, CMS must have\na race-neutral student assignment plan in place no later than the 2002-\n2003 school year unless its use of race is narrowly tailored to serve\na compelling governmental interest. The plaintiff-intervenors have\nprevailed against CMS and have obtained a decree that alters the con-\nduct of CMS toward all children attending public school in Mecklen-\nburg County. Yet, this court vacates the district court’s fee award on\nthe ground that the plaintiff-intervenors have not prevailed.\n\n   School desegregation cases are unique in the manner in which they\nproceed. There are two basic steps in the court process to obtain uni-\ntary status. In the first part, the plaintiffs seek to impose federal court\ncontrol over the school system and to have federal courts dictate pro-\ncedures for the operation of the schools. When the court-ordered pro-\ncedures have worked, the second part begins with the parties\nreturning to district court to obtain a declaration of unitary status and\nthe concomitant removal of federal court oversight.\n\n  This case began in 1965 when the original Swann plaintiffs brought\na § 1983 action to convert CMS \"into a unitary nonracial system\n\f8       BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION\nwherein educational opportunities offered by [the board] are made\navailable to all students without regard to race or color.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,162. The Swann plaintiffs succeeded in having CMS placed under\ncourt order and participated in proceedings whereby the district court\nadopted a sweeping desegregation plan. In 1975, the case was\nremoved from the active docket and the Swann plaintiffs were\ndeservedly and properly awarded $204,072.33 in fees and costs for\ntheir service as private attorneys general in the first phase of the\ndesegregation effort.\n\n   For the most part, this case remained inactive until 1997, when\nCapacchione challenged CMS’s magnet schools program and, shortly\nthereafter, amended her complaint to seek a declaration of unitary sta-\ntus as well. Swann was reactivated and Capacchione intervened in\nthat action. Grant then moved for a declaration of unitary status and\nalso intervened in the Swann litigation. Thus began the second part\nof the process.\n\n   The Swann plaintiffs, however, did not want the second and final\nphase of the judicial process to occur, so they fought a finding of uni-\ntary status. Capacchione and Grant had to step in and prove to the dis-\ntrict court that what the Swann plaintiffs originally sought in their\nlawsuit under § 1983 had, in fact, been achieved—that what had been\nstarted in the 1960s had finally been completed and the vestiges of\nsegregation removed to the extent practicable. And like the Swann\nplaintiffs, who received a fee award for work done before the case\nwas removed from the active docket, the plaintiff-intervenors now\nseek, and are entitled to, their attorneys’ fees.\n\n   No member of the court doubts that the Swann plaintiffs would be\nentitled to fees under § 1988 had they been the ones to successfully\nmove for a declaration of unitary status. Yet in spite of the same mea-\nsure of success by the plaintiff-intervenors, we deny them their fees.\nBy judicial fiat, plaintiff-intervenors in school desegregation cases\nhave been written out of § 1988. Should another case like this arise\nwhere the original plaintiffs and the school board are content to let the\ndesegregation order remain in place long after the dual system has\nbeen dismantled, parents demanding a return of local control will be\nhelpless. As the present case demonstrates, a declaration of unitary\nstatus can be expensive ($1.49 million). I have no doubt that if our\n\f        BELK v. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD        OF   EDUCATION      9\ndecision had been on the books in 1997 neither Capacchione, nor\nGrant, nor virtually any other public school parent in Mecklenburg\nCounty could have afforded to seek a removal of the federal courts\nfrom control of the school system. I find it ironic that in affirming the\ndistrict court’s declaration of unitary status but denying the prevailing\nparties their fees, we simultaneously condemn other school districts\nin our circuit to prolonged and unnecessary federal court control.\n\n   Finally, while unfortunate that the school board should have to pay\nsuch a large award, this is a risk it took when it decided to fight the\nunitary status determination—not unlike the ill-fated decision it made\nin the 1960s to fight the desegregation effort to begin with, when we\nmade it pay the fees of the original Swann plaintiffs. For attorneys’\nfees purposes, this court has decided that one party can get its fees\nunder § 1988 for forcing the school board to abide by the law while\nthe other cannot. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n   Judge Widener and Judge Wilkins have authorized me to indicate\nthat they join in this dissent.\n\f</pre>",
