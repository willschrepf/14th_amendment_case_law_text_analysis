Code, § 11350, subd. (a)) in separate cases. The\ncourt suspended imposition of sentence and placed her on formal felony probation in\n                                                               1\neach case. When Penal Code section 1170.18 was enacted by the voters as part of\nProposition 47 in November 2014, defendant remained on probation. She filed petitions\nto recall her “sentence” in each case. The trial court denied her petitions on the ground\nthat she was not “currently serving a sentence” despite the fact that she remained on\nfelony probation in both cases. Defendant challenges this ruling on appeal, and the\nAttorney General concedes that the trial court erred. We agree and reverse the orders\ndenying defendant’s petitions.\n\n\n\n1\n         Subsequent statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n\f                                       I. Background\n       In January 2013, defendant was charged by complaint with felony possession of\nheroin (Health & Saf. Code, § 11350, subd. (a)), misdemeanor possession of controlled\nsubstance paraphernalia (Health & Saf. Code, § 11364.1, subd. (a)), and misdemeanor\ninterference with a business by obstructing or intimidating customers (§ 602.1, subd. (a)).\nThese offenses were alleged to have occurred in December 2012. Defendant pleaded\nguilty to the felony count, and the other counts were dismissed. In August 2013, the\ncourt suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for the\nDecember 2012 possession offense. In May 2014, defendant was charged by complaint\nwith a May 2014 felony possession of heroin. She pleaded no contest. In June 2014, the\ncourt suspended imposition of sentence for the May 2014 offense and placed defendant\non probation. In October 2014, the court reinstated probation for both convictions.\n       In March 2015, defendant filed petitions under section 1170.18 for recall of her\nsentences in both cases. She alleged in her petitions that she was “currently serving”\nsentences for these convictions. The prosecution responded that defendant was ineligible\nbecause she “has not been sentenced” and is “not serving a sentence.” Defendant argued\nthat either she had been sentenced on her felony convictions or she was eligible to have\nthem automatically reduced to misdemeanors under In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740.\n       In May 2015, the court denied defendant’s petitions. It stated: “I do believe that\nthe court feels a traditional definition of sentence is the one it will follow until told\notherwise. So I’m going to either deny the petition, or if Ms. Gomez wishes to be\nsentenced, I’m happy to do that also.” Defendant chose not “to proceed to sentencing at\nthis time.” Defendant timely filed notices of appeal from the court’s orders.\n\n\n                                         II. Analysis\n       Section 1170.18 is derived from Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and\nSchools Act, passed by voter initiative at the November 4, 2014 election. Subdivision (a)\n\n                                               2\n\fof the statute provides: “A person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether\nby trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor\nunder the act that added this section (‘this act’) had this act been in effect at the time of\nthe offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the\njudgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing in accordance with\nSections 11350, 11357, or 11377 of the Health and Safety Code . . . as those sections\nhave been amended or added by this act.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) If the petitioner meets\nthe criteria in subdivision (a) of the statute, the felony sentence “shall be recalled and the\npetitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor” pursuant to the statutes under which he or she\nwas convicted, as those sections were amended or added by the Act, “unless the court, in\nits discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b)); cf. T.W. v. Superior Court (2015) 236\nCal.App.4th 646, 650; People v. Rivera (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1092-1093.)\n       The parties agree that in passing Proposition 47 the voters intended to embrace\nprobationers within the reach of the resentencing provisions of section 1170.18. To\ninterpret the statutory language otherwise would, in their view, lead to absurd\nconsequences. We find merit in this position. As the Attorney General acknowledges,\nthere is nothing in either the ballot materials or the statutory language that appears to\nlimit the phrase “currently serving a sentence for a conviction” to those serving a term of\nimprisonment. Defendant points out that granting probation is in some contexts a\n“sentencing choice” (see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.405(6) [“ ‘Sentence choice’\nmeans the selection of any disposition of the case that does not amount to a dismissal,\nacquittal, or grant of a new trial”]). (Cf. People v. Howard (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1081, 1084\n[referring to court’s authority “at time of sentencing” either to suspend imposition of\nsentence or impose sentence and suspend its execution]; In re DeLong (2001) 93\nCal.App.4th 562, 571 [“an order granting probation and suspending imposition of\nsentence is a form of sentencing”].) Both parties observe that the language of another\n\n                                               3\n\fvoter initiative, Proposition 36, the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000,\nused the language “sentenced to probation.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 7, 2000) ballot measure summary of Prop. 36, p. 3; see People v. Mendoza (2003)\n106 Cal.App.4th 1030, 1034 [quoting ballot pamphlet to distinguish conviction from\nsentence and referring to “sentence of probation”].)\n       The ballot materials for Proposition 47 likewise indicate that the voters regarded\n                                                                    2\nprobation as one of the options within a sentencing procedure; the legislative analysis\nrefers to offenders who are “sentenced” to supervision by a county probation officer\nwhile indicating that both jail time for eligible offenders and the caseloads of probation\nofficers would be reduced by including felony probation as a disposition eligible for\nresentencing under section 1170.18. (See People v. Shabazz (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303,\n310 [discussing Proposition 47 mechanism for resentencing after being “sentenced or\nplaced on probation”].) The Legislative Analyst discussed these options under the\nheading of “Misdemeanor Sentencing” and generally noted the fiscal consequences of\n“the resentencing of individuals currently serving sentences for felonies that are changed\nto misdemeanors . . . .” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) analysis of\nProp. 47 by Legislative Analyst, pp. 34-36, italics added.) Nothing in the text of the\ninitiative, the legislative analysis, or the arguments for and against it indicate an intent to\ndistinguish between a prison sentence and felony probation, or between a grant of\nprobation after suspending imposition of sentence and an order imposing sentence but\n\n\n\n2\n        “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . “we turn first to the language of the statute,\ngiving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] The statutory language must also\nbe construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in\nlight of the electorate’s intent]. . . . When the language is ambiguous, “we refer to other\nindicia of the voters’ intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Robert L. v. Superior Court (2003)\n30 Cal.4th 894, 900-901, quoting Horwich v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276\nand People v. Birkett (1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231.)\n\n                                                 4\n\f                          3\nsuspending its execution. The statute itself allows the recall of a “felony sentence” and\nallows the petitioner to request “resentencing” in Health and Safety Code section 11350\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) And as defendant points out, Proposition 47 was\nintended to reach those with “nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,”\nwhich would encompass many who were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, p. 70, § 3.) To deprive those defendants of the\nbenefit of the reduced penalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters\nwould not have either anticipated or approved.\n       We accordingly adopt the parties’ proffered liberal construction of the statute to\napply to all those with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who\notherwise meet the conditions specified in the statutory scheme. Because she met the\ncriteria for eligibility under section 1170.18, defendant was entitled to consideration of\nher petitions for resentencing.\n\n\n                                     III. Disposition\n       The orders are reversed, and the matters are remanded for consideration of\ndefendant’s petitions under section 1170.18.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Neither party suggests any significance in the latter distinction for purposes of\nProposition 47 treatment.\n\n                                               5\n\f                                _______________________________\n                                Mihara, J.\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________\nElia, Acting P.

The statute itself allows the recall of a “felony sentence” and\nallows the petitioner to request “resentencing” in Health and Safety Code section 11350\ncases, without segregating those serving prison sentences from those serving probation\nterms. (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) And as defendant points out, Proposition 47 was\nintended to reach those with “nonserious, nonviolent crimes like . . . drug possession,”\nwhich would encompass many who were granted probation. (Voter Information Guide,\nGen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, p. 70, § 3.) To deprive those defendants of the\nbenefit of the reduced penalty for their offenses would create an incongruity the voters\nwould not have either anticipated or approved.\n       We accordingly adopt the parties’ proffered liberal construction of the statute to\napply to all those with felony dispositions, including those placed on probation who\notherwise meet the conditions specified in the statutory scheme. Because she met the\ncriteria for eligibility under section 1170.18, defendant was entitled to consideration of\nher petitions for resentencing.\n\n\n                                     III. Disposition\n       The orders are reversed, and the matters are remanded for consideration of\ndefendant’s petitions under section 1170.18.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Neither party suggests any significance in the latter distinction for purposes of\nProposition 47 treatment.\n\n                                               5\n\f                                _______________________________\n                                Mihara, J.\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________\nElia, Acting P.
