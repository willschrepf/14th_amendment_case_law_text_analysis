No. 03-cv-01053)\n   District Judge: Honorable Donetta W. Ambrose\n   _______________________________________\n\n\n     Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                AUGUST 5, 2005\n\nBefore: ALITO, SMITH AND COWEN, Circuit Judges.\n\n             (Filed: September 19, 2005)\n\n\n            _______________________\n\n                   OPINION\n            _______________________\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n       Steven Romansky, a Pennsylvania state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals an\n\norder of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania\n\ndismissing his civil rights action against prison officials and employees. We will affirm\n\nthe District Court’s order.\n\n       In his complaint, Romansky alleges that he tried to file a habeas petition in District\n\nCourt, and the Clerk returned it to him because he did not provide the required number of\n\ncopies. Romansky states he submitted a request to prison employees looking for an\n\nalternative to file his petition, but they returned it, stating that the policy for indigent\n\ninmates did not apply to his filing. He filed a grievance, which was denied.\n\n       Romansky further alleges that after he told a prison employee that he did not\n\nreceive a copy of his grievance, he received a misconduct charging him with lying. A\n\nhearing examiner dismissed the charge without prejudice. Although the facts are unclear,\n\nthe same employee then issued another misconduct containing the same charges. At the\n\nsecond hearing, the examiner found Romansky guilty, and imposed a sanction of punitive\n\nsegregation.\n\n       Romansky submitted additional requests for copies of his grievance and his\n\nmisconducts, and documents related to his grievance appeals, but did not receive them.\n\nHe filed a second grievance alleging denial of access to the courts and the grievance\n\nsystem, and retaliation. Prison officials responded that these issues were already\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\faddressed. Romansky filed a third grievance after the library refused to copy documents\n\nfor another lawsuit, and officials responded that copies are not free of charge.\n\n       Romansky claims the defendants violated his constitutional right to access to the\n\ncourts, and retaliated against him for attempting to litigate and for filing grievances. The\n\nDistrict Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation to dismiss the complaint\n\nunder the screening provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act for failure to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief can be granted. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our standard of review is plenary. See Tourscher v.\n\nMcCullough, 184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n       In recommending the dismissal of Romansky’s access to courts claim, the\n\nMagistrate Judge correctly stated that Romansky failed to allege that the habeas petition\n\nthat he was unable to file was nonfrivolous, identify the underlying cause of action, and\n\nplead that his claim would provide a remedy that could not otherwise be obtained. See\n\nChristopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 (2002) (requiring such allegations to state an\n\naccess to courts claim). As noted by the Magistrate Judge, Christopher requires that “the\n\npredicate claim be described well enough to apply the ‘nonfrivolous’ test and to show that\n\nthe ‘arguable’ nature of the underlying claim is more than hope.” Id. at 416. Romansky\n\nhas not made this showing.\n\n       We also agree with the District Court that Romansky does not state a First\n\nAmendment claim based upon his allegations that the defendants interfered with, or did\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fnot respond to, his grievances. Romansky’s access to the District Court satisfies his right\n\nto petition the government. See Antonelli v. Sheahan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1430 (7 th Cir. 1996)\n\n(holding the invocation of the judicial process indicated that the prison had not infringed\n\nthe prisoner’s First Amendment rights). In addition, in light of the fact that he was found\n\nguilty of misconduct, Romansky does not state a retaliation claim based upon his receipt\n\nof a misconduct after he told a prison employee that a copy of his grievance was lost. See\n\nHenderson v. Baird, 29 F.3d 464, 469 (8 th Cir. 1994) (stating that a finding that a prisoner\n\nviolated the rules checkmates his retaliation claim).\n\n       Romansky argues in his brief that he states an Eighth Amendment claim because\n\nhe must write everything he files with the courts, causing eye strain and paralysis in his\n\nhand, and he must sell his meals to afford legal supplies. We agree with the District\n\nCourt that Romansky does not state such a claim because he has not been deprived of the\n\nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities. See Tillman v. Lebanon County Corr.\n\nFacility, 221 F.3d 410, 417-18 (3d Cir. 2000). We also reject Romansky’s argument that\n\nhe states a claim for oppression under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5301 because he did not\n\ninclude this claim in his complaint. Finally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Romansky’s motion for appointment of counsel.\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the order of the District Court.\n\f",
