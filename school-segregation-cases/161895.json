It challenges several\nnew Federal Election Commission regulations that restrict\nhow non-profits may spend and raise money to advance their\npreferred policy positions and candidates. EMILY’s List\nargues that the regulations violate the First Amendment.\n\n     The First Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme\nCourt, protects the right of individual citizens to spend\nunlimited amounts to express their views about policy issues\nand candidates for public office.        Similarly, the First\nAmendment, as the Court has construed it, safeguards the\nright of citizens to band together and pool their resources as\nan unincorporated group or non-profit organization in order to\nexpress their views about policy issues and candidates for\npublic office. We agree with EMILY’s List that the new FEC\nregulations contravene those principles and violate the First\nAmendment. We reverse the judgment of the District Court\nand direct it to enter judgment for EMILY’s List and to vacate\nthe challenged regulations.\n\f                              3\n                               I\n\n     In the wake of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\nand the Supreme Court’s 2003 decision in McConnell v. FEC,\nthe election season of 2004 erupted with bitter accusations\nabout the activities of certain non-profit entities. The\ncontroversy was popularly known by a single term – “527s” –\nthat refers to the section of the tax code applicable to non-\nprofits engaged in political activities. The debate arose after\nwealthy individuals contributed huge sums of money to non-\nprofits ranging from America Coming Together to\nMoveOn.org to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in order to\nsupport advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter\nregistration drives. In total during the 2004 campaign, these\ngroups reportedly spent several hundred million dollars.\n\n     As the campaign unfolded, many in both major parties –\nincluding President Bush and Senator Kerry – questioned the\nactivities of certain non-profits. Some encouraged the FEC to\nban large donations to non-profit entities in the same way that\nCongress in BCRA had banned large contributions to political\nparties. Proponents of additional regulation reasoned that\nnon-profits had replaced political parties as the soft-money\n“loophole” in the campaign finance system. See Edward B.\nFoley & Donald Tobin, The New Loophole?: 527s, Political\nCommittees, and McCain-Feingold, BNA MONEY & POL.\nREP., Jan. 7, 2004.\n\n    In response, the FEC did not ban non-profits from\nreceiving and spending large donations, as some had urged.\nBut the FEC did limit how much non-profits such as\nEMILY’s List could raise and spend. The FEC achieved this\nobjective by dictating that covered non-profits pay for a large\npercentage of election-related activities out of their hard-\n\f                               4\nmoney accounts. See 11 C.F.R. §§ 106.6(c), (f).1 Because\ndonations to those hard-money accounts are capped at $5000\nannually for individual contributors, the FEC’s allocation\nregulations substantially restrict the ability of non-profits to\nspend money for election-related activities such as\nadvertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration\ndrives. The regulations separately require that donations to\nnon-profits be considered hard money subject to the $5000\ncap if the corresponding solicitation indicated that donations\nwould be used to support the election or defeat of a federal\ncandidate. See id. § 100.57.\n\n     In early 2005, EMILY’s List filed suit, arguing that the\nnew regulations violated the First Amendment and the Federal\nElection Campaign Act. In 2008, the District Court upheld\nthe regulations in their entirety.\n\n                               II\n\n     To assess the constitutionality of the new FEC\nregulations, we initially must address at some length the\nrelevant First Amendment principles set forth by the Supreme\nCourt.\n\n                               A\n\n     Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides that\n“Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of\nspeech.” U.S. CONST. amend. I. This guarantee “has its\nfullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of\n    1\n        A hard-money account is subject to source and amount\nlimitations. For example, under the statute, EMILY’s List cannot\naccept donations of more than $5000 annually into its hard-money\naccount from any single contributor. 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C). A\nsoft-money account may receive unlimited donations.\n\f                              5\ncampaigns for political office.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,\n15 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).             The\nAmendment “protects political association as well as political\nexpression.” Id.; see also NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.\nPatterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958).\n\n    In analyzing the interaction of the First Amendment and\ncampaign finance laws, the Court has articulated several\noverarching principles of relevance here.\n\n     First, the Court has held that campaign contributions and\nexpenditures constitute “speech” within the protection of the\nFirst Amendment. In Buckley, the foundational case, the\nCourt definitively ruled that “contribution and expenditure\nlimitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First\nAmendment activities.” 424 U.S. at 14. The Court has never\nstrayed from that cardinal tenet, notwithstanding some\npassionate objections. See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov’t\nPAC, 528 U.S. 377, 398 (2000) (Stevens, J., concurring)\n(“Money is property; it is not speech.”); J. Skelly Wright,\nPolitics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech?, 85 YALE\nL.J. 1001 (1976).\n\n     Second, the Court has ruled that the Government cannot\nlimit campaign contributions and expenditures to achieve\n“equalization” – that is, it cannot restrict the speech of some\nso that others might have equal voice or influence in the\nelectoral process. In perhaps the most important sentence in\nthe Court’s entire campaign finance jurisprudence, Buckley\nstated: “[T]he concept that government may restrict the\nspeech of some elements of our society in order to enhance\nthe relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First\nAmendment.” 424 U.S. at 48-49. The Court added that the\nGovernment’s interest in “equalizing the relative ability of\n\f                                6\nindividuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections”\ndoes not justify regulation. Id. at 48.\n\n     In Davis v. FEC, the Court strongly reiterated that\n“equalization” is not a “legitimate government objective.”\n128 S. Ct. 2759, 2773 (2008). The Davis Court approvingly\nquoted Justice Kennedy’s observation in Austin v. Michigan\nState Chamber of Commerce that “the notion that the\ngovernment has a legitimate interest in restricting the quantity\nof speech to equalize the relative influence of speakers on\nelections” is “antithetical to the First Amendment.” Id.\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nAustin v. Mich. State Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652,\n684 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“This illiberal free-speech\nprinciple of ‘one man, one minute’ was proposed and soundly\nrejected in Buckley”).2\n\n     Third, the Court has recognized a strong governmental\ninterest in combating corruption and the appearance thereof.\nSee Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 45-48; see also McConnell v.\nFEC, 540 U.S. 93, 154 (2003). This, indeed, is the only\ninterest the Court thus far has recognized as justifying\ncampaign finance regulation. Davis, 128 S. Ct. at 2773\n(“Preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are\n\n    2\n       The Court’s rejection of the equalization argument is\nconsistent with its broader First Amendment jurisprudence: “As a\ngeneral matter, the American First Amendment tradition requires\nthat the financial, political, or rhetorical imbalance between the\nproponents of competing arguments is insufficient to justify\ngovernment intervention to correct that imbalance.” Frederick\nSchauer & Richard H. Pildes, Electoral Exceptionalism and the\nFirst Amendment, 77 TEX. L. REV. 1803, 1825 (1999); see\ngenerally Lillian R. BeVier, Money and Politics: A Perspective on\nthe First Amendment and Campaign Finance Reform, 73 CAL. L.\nREV. 1045 (1985).\n\f                               7\nthe only legitimate and compelling government interests thus\nfar identified for restricting campaign finances.”) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Importantly, the Court has\nemphasized that the anti-corruption rationale is not boundless.\nThe core corruption that Government may permissibly target\nwith campaign finance regulation “is the financial quid pro\nquo: dollars for political favors.” FEC v. Nat’l Conservative\nPAC (NCPAC), 470 U.S. 480, 497 (1985). This anti-\ncorruption interest is implicated by contributions to\ncandidates: “To the extent that large contributions are given\nto secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential\noffice holders, the integrity of our system of representative\ndemocracy is undermined.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27; see\nalso Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454\nU.S. 290, 296-97 (1981) (“Buckley identified a single narrow\nexception to the rule that limits on political activity were\ncontrary to the First Amendment”; the exception relates “to\nthe perception of undue influence of large contributors to a\ncandidate”).      Based on the close relationship between\ncandidates and parties and record evidence demonstrating that\npolitical parties sold access to candidates in exchange for\ncontributions, the Court has held that the anti-corruption\ninterest also justifies limits on contributions to parties. See\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 154; see also Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n38.3\n\n     Fourth, in applying the anti-corruption rationale, the\nCourt has afforded stronger protection to expenditures by\ncitizens and groups (for example, for advertisements, get-out-\nthe-vote efforts, and voter registration activities) than it has\n    3\n      Contributions include coordinated expenditures – that is,\nexpenditures coordinated with a candidate or party.        See\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 121; FEC v. Colo. Republican Fed.\nCampaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 443 (2001); see also 2 U.S.C. §\n441a(a)(7)(B).\n\f                                  8\nprovided to their contributions to candidates or parties. The\nCourt has explained that contributions to a candidate or party\npose a greater risk of quid pro quo corruption than do\nexpenditures. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 46-47. At the same\ntime, the Court has stated that limits on contributions to\ncandidates or parties pose only a “marginal restriction upon\nthe contributor’s ability to engage in free communication.”\nId. at 20-21. By contrast, expenditure restrictions limit\n“political expression at the core of our electoral process and\nof the First Amendment freedoms.” Id. at 39 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A “restriction on the amount of\nmoney a person or group can spend on political\ncommunication during a campaign necessarily reduces the\nquantity of expression by restricting the number of issues\ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the\naudience reached.” Id. at 19. The Court’s jurisprudence, in\nshort, reflects a “fundamental constitutional difference\nbetween money spent to advertise one’s views independently\nof the candidate’s campaign and money contributed to the\ncandidate to be spent on his campaign.” NCPAC, 470 U.S. at\n497 (emphases added); see also Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S.\n230, 241-42 (2006).4\n\n\n     4\n        Many have criticized the distinction between contributions\nand expenditures because, in their view, they are “two sides of the\nsame First Amendment coin.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 241 (opinion of\nBurger, C.J.). Some contend that limits on contributions and\nexpenditures are both suspect under the First Amendment. See id.;\nid. at 290 (opinion of Blackmun, J); see also Shrink Mo. Gov’t\nPAC, 528 U.S. at 410 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Others argue that\nthe interest in limiting contributions similarly justifies restricting\nexpenditures. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 260-62 (opinion of White,\nJ.). The Court thus far has rebuffed both critiques and adhered to\nthe Buckley divide. See Randall, 548 U.S. at 242 (“Over the last 30\nyears, in considering the constitutionality of a host of different\n\f                                9\n\n     In maintaining this line between (i) contributions to\ncandidates or parties and (ii) expenditures, the Court has\nacknowledged that a citizen’s or group’s large expenditure –\nfor example, in financing advertisements or get-out-the-vote\nactivities – may confer some benefit on a candidate and\nthereby give influence to the spender. But the Court\nnonetheless has consistently dismissed the notion that\nexpenditures implicate the anti-corruption interest. See\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 47 (expenditures not “a quid pro quo for\nimproper commitments from the candidate”); see also\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 153 (“mere political favoritism or\nopportunity for influence alone is insufficient to justify\nregulation”); id. at 156-57 n.51 (Congress could not regulate\ntalk show hosts or newspaper editors “on the sole basis that\ntheir activities conferred a benefit on the candidate”);\nNCPAC, 470 U.S. at 498 (“exchange of political favors for\nuncoordinated expenditures remains a hypothetical possibility\nand nothing more”).\n\n     Fifth, the Court has been somewhat more tolerant of\nregulation of for-profit corporations and labor unions. The\nCourt has permitted statutory limits on contributions that for-\nprofit corporations and unions make from their general\ntreasuries to candidates and parties.5 More controversially,\nthe Court has carved out a significant exception to Buckley’s\nholding on expenditures: The Court has upheld laws that\nprohibit for-profit corporations and unions from making\nexpenditures for activities expressly advocating the election\n\ncampaign finance statutes, this Court has repeatedly adhered to\nBuckley’s constraints, including those on expenditure limits.”).\n     5\n        The Court also has ruled that the Government may bar\ncertain non-profit as well as for-profit corporations from making\ndirect contributions to candidates or parties. See FEC v. Beaumont,\n539 U.S. 146, 159-60 (2003).\n\f                               10\nor defeat of a federal candidate. The Court has permitted\nthose expenditure limits on the ground that they restrain the\n“corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of\nwealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate\nform and that have little or no correlation to the public’s\nsupport for the corporation’s political ideas.” Austin, 494\nU.S. at 660; see also McConnell, 540 U.S. at 204-05; but see\nFirst Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 776-77\n(1978); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 48-49.6\n\n     To sum up so far: In reconciling the competing interests,\nthe Supreme Court has generally approved statutory limits on\ncontributions to candidates and political parties as consistent\nwith the First Amendment.           The Court has rejected\nexpenditure limits on individuals, groups, candidates, and\nparties, even though expenditures may confer benefits on\ncandidates. And the Court has upheld limits on for-profit\ncorporations’ and unions’ use of their general treasury funds\nto make campaign contributions to candidates or political\nparties or to make expenditures for activities expressly\nadvocating the election or defeat of federal candidates.\n\n                               B\n\n     This case does not involve regulation of candidates,\nparties, or for-profit corporations. Rather, this case concerns\n\n    6\n        The Supreme Court is presently considering whether to\noverrule Austin (and McConnell’s reliance on it) to the extent\nAustin permitted the Government to limit for-profit corporations’\nand unions’ expenditures. See Citizens United v. FEC, No. 08-205\n(S. Ct. reargued Sept. 9, 2009); cf. Austin, 494 U.S. at 702\n(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“Today’s decision abandons [Buckley’s]\ndistinction and threatens once-protected political speech.”). The\nregulations at issue here violate the First Amendment with or\nwithout Austin on the books. See infra note 11.\n\f                                 11\nthe FEC’s regulation of non-profit entities that are not\nconnected to a candidate, party, or for-profit corporation. We\nthus must consider how the constitutional principles outlined\nabove apply to non-profits – and in particular to three\ndifferent kinds of non-profits: (i) those that only make\nexpenditures; (ii) those that only make contributions to\ncandidates or parties; and (iii) those that do both. For\npurposes of the First Amendment analysis, the central issue\nturns out to be whether independent non-profits are treated\nlike individual citizens (who under Buckley have the right to\nspend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates)\nor like political parties (which under McConnell do not have\nthe right to raise and spend unlimited soft money).7\n\n                                 1\n\n     The first relevant category of non-profit entities consists\nof those that only make expenditures for political activities\nsuch as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter\n\n\n    7\n        In referring to non-profit entities, we mean non-connected\nnon-profit corporations (usually advocacy or ideological or\npolitically oriented non-profits) that engage in election-related\nactivities and register with the Internal Revenue Service under 26\nU.S.C. § 527 or § 501(c), as well as unincorporated non-profit\ngroups. “Non-connected” means that the non-profit is not a\ncandidate committee, a party committee, or a committee established\nby a corporation or labor union. See 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(a). “Non-\nconnected” for purposes of this opinion also excludes so-called\nleadership PACs.\n     Some non-profits register with the FEC as political\ncommittees; others do not. Our constitutional analysis of donations\nto and spending by non-connected non-profits applies regardless\nwhether a non-profit has registered as a political committee with the\nFEC. See infra note 15.\n\f                              12\nregistration drives. Non-profits in this category make no\ncontributions to federal candidates or parties.\n\n     The Supreme Court’s case law establishes that those non-\nprofit entities, like individual citizens, are constitutionally\nentitled to raise and spend unlimited money in support of\ncandidates for elected office – with the narrow exception that,\nunder Austin, the Government may restrict to some degree\nhow non-profits spend donations received from the general\ntreasuries of for-profit corporations or unions. See Cal. Med.\nAss’n v. FEC, 453 U.S. 182, 202-03 (1981) (opinion of\nBlackmun, J.); see also FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc.\n(MCFL), 479 U.S. 238, 259-65 (1986); NCPAC, 470 U.S. at\n501; Citizens Against Rent Control, 454 U.S. at 296-99;\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 47; N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake, 525\nF.3d 274, 292-93 (4th Cir. 2008).\n\n     Those principles were initially articulated in Cal-Med.\nThere, Justice Blackmun determined that “contributions to\npolitical committees can be limited only if those contributions\nimplicate the governmental interest in preventing actual or\npotential corruption, and if the limitation is no broader than\nnecessary to achieve that interest.” Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 203\n(opinion of Blackmun, J.). Applying that standard, he found\nthat “contributions to a committee that makes only\nindependent expenditures pose no such threat” of “actual or\npotential corruption.” Id. “By pooling their resources,\nadherents of an association amplify their own voices; the\nassociation is but the medium through which its individual\nmembers seek to make more effective the expression of their\nown views.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Justice Blackmun thus concluded that Government\n\f                                 13\nmay not limit contributions to a non-profit that only makes\nexpenditures.8\n\n     The Court reinforced those principles a year later in\nCitizens Against Rent Control. There, the Court struck down\nlimits on donations to a non-profit committee seeking to\ndefeat a ballot measure. See Citizens Against Rent Control,\n454 U.S. at 296-99. Building on the established right of\nindividuals to make unlimited expenditures, the Court stated\nthat there are “of course, some activities, legal if engaged in\nby one, yet illegal if performed in concert with others, but\npolitical expression is not one of them.” Id. at 296. The\nCourt further reasoned: “Placing limits on contributions\nwhich in turn limit expenditures plainly impairs freedom of\nexpression.” Id. at 299. In the Court’s words, to place “a\nSpartan limit – or indeed any limit – on individuals wishing to\nband together to advance their views on a ballot measure,\nwhile placing none on individuals acting alone, is clearly a\nrestraint on the right of association.” Id. at 296.\n    8\n        In Cal-Med, there was no majority opinion on the First\nAmendment issue. Under the Marks principle, Justice Blackmun’s\nopinion in Cal-Med appears to be controlling. See Marks v. United\nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977); cf., e.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal.\nv. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 269-320 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).\nEven if Justice Blackmun’s opinion were not binding under the\nMarks principle or even if his discussion of expenditure-only non-\nprofits were considered dicta, his opinion’s principles have been\nfollowed in subsequent decisions such as Citizens Against Rent\nControl. In that regard, we note that Justice Marshall’s opinion in\nCal-Med did not decide how the First Amendment applies to\ncontributions to a non-profit that only makes expenditures. See\nCal-Med, 453 U.S. at 197 n.17 (opinion of Marshall, J.) (“American\nCivil Liberties Union suggests that § 441a(a)(1)(C) would violate\nthe First Amendment if construed to limit the amount individuals\ncould jointly expend to express their political views. We need not\nconsider this hypothetical application . . . .”).\n\f                               14\n\n     In NCPAC, the Court reiterated that the Government may\nnot limit the spending of non-profits. The Court invalidated a\nlaw that restricted a group’s expenditures in support of a\ncandidate who had accepted public financing. See NCPAC,\n470 U.S. at 501. The Court stated that citizens’ “collective\naction in pooling their resources to amplify their voices” is\n“entitled to full First Amendment protection . . . .” Id. at 495.\n\n     In MCFL, the Court again underscored that non-profit\nadvocacy groups are generally entitled to raise and spend\nunlimited money on elections. The Court invalidated an\nexpenditure limit imposed on a non-profit corporation that\nhad distributed a newsletter promoting pro-life candidates.\nThe Court noted that individuals “contribute to a political\norganization in part because they regard such a contribution\nas a more effective means of advocacy than spending the\nmoney under their own personal direction.” MCFL, 479 U.S.\nat 261.     The Court added that “[v]oluntary political\nassociations do not suddenly present the specter of corruption\nmerely by assuming the corporate form.” Id. at 263; see also\nAustin, 494 U.S. at 701 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (MCFL held\nthat “a nonprofit corporation engaged in political discussion\nof candidates and elections has the full protection of the First\nAmendment”). Adhering to MCFL, the McConnell Court\nruled that BCRA’s ban on certain electioneering\ncommunications could not validly be applied to non-profit\ncorporations. See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 210-11.\n\n     The principles set forth in Cal-Med, Citizens Against\nRent Control, NCPAC, and MCFL are rooted in the Court’s\nconsistent holdings beginning with Buckley that individual\ncitizens may spend money without limit (apart from the limit\non their own contributions to candidates or parties) in support\nof the election of particular candidates. After all, if one\n\f                                  15\nperson is constitutionally entitled to spend $1 million to run\nadvertisements supporting a candidate (as Buckley held), it\nlogically follows that 100 people are constitutionally entitled\nto donate $10,000 each to a non-profit group that will run\nadvertisements supporting a candidate.9 Put another way: “If\nthe First Amendment prohibits any limitation on how much\nmoney an independent political committee can spend on an\nindependent-expenditure campaign, how can it permit limits\non donations to committees that make only independent\nexpenditures?” Richard Briffault, The 527 Problem and the\nBuckley Problem, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 949, 982 (2005);\nsee also Edward B. Foley, The “Major Purpose” Test:\nDistinguishing Between Election-Focused and Issue-Focused\nGroups, 31 N. KY. L. REV. 341, 343 (2004) (stating “baseline\nproposition that it would be unconstitutional to limit the\ncontributions that individuals may give to ideological groups\nto be used for electoral purposes”); Note, The\nUnconstitutionality of Limitations on Contributions to\nPolitical Committees in the 1976 Federal Election Campaign\nAct Amendments, 86 YALE L.J. 953 (1977).\n\n    These Supreme Court decisions reflect, moreover, the\ncommonsense proposition that regulation of non-profits does\nnot fit within the anti-corruption rationale, which constitutes\n\n     9\n       To be sure, some cases suggest that the First Amendment\ninterest in donating to someone else for speech, while important, is\nless weighty than the First Amendment interest in speaking oneself.\nBut those cases involve contributions to candidates or parties. See\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 21. With respect to donations to groups other\nthan candidates or political parties, the Court has said that there are\n“of course, some activities, legal if engaged in by one, yet illegal if\nperformed in concert with others, but political expression is not one\nof them.” Citizens Against Rent Control, 454 U.S. at 296; see also\nMCFL, 479 U.S. at 261; NCPAC, 470 U.S. at 495; Cal-Med, 453\nU.S. at 203 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); NAACP, 357 U.S.at 460.\n\f                              16\nthe sole basis for regulating campaign contributions and\nexpenditures. See Davis, 128 S. Ct. at 2773. As the Court has\nexplained the anti-corruption principle, mere donations to\nnon-profit groups cannot corrupt candidates and\nofficeholders. In the words of the Fourth Circuit, it is\n“implausible that contributions to independent expenditure\npolitical committees are corrupting.” N.C. Right to Life, 525\nF.3d at 293 (internal quotation marks omitted). And to the\nextent a non-profit then spends its donations on activities such\nas advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter\nregistration drives, those expenditures are not considered\ncorrupting, even though they may generate gratitude from and\ninfluence with officeholders and candidates. Rather, under\nBuckley, those expenditures are constitutionally protected.\nTherefore, limiting donations to and spending by non-profits\nin order to prevent corruption of candidates and officeholders\nrepresents a kind of “prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis”\nregulation to which the Supreme Court has emphatically\nstated, “Enough is enough.” FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc.\n(WRTL), 551 U.S. 449, 478-79 (2007) (controlling opinion of\nRoberts, C.J.).\n\n     Writing for the Fourth Circuit, Judge Wilkinson recently\nsummarized the relevant Supreme Court precedents,\nconcluding that “the Court has never held that it is\nconstitutional to apply contribution limits to political\ncommittees that make solely independent expenditures.” N.C.\nRight to Life, 525 F.3d at 292. Those non-profit groups\nreceive full First Amendment protection and are entitled to\nreceive donations and make expenditures because they “offer\nan opportunity for ordinary citizens to band together to speak\non the issue or issues most important to them.” Id. at 295.\nWe agree with Judge Wilkinson’s assessment of the state of\nthe law.\n\f                                 17\n                                 2\n\n     The second relevant category of non-profits consists of\nthose that only make contributions to federal candidates or\npolitical parties and make no expenditures. Given the\nconstitutionally permissible caps on an individual donor’s\ncontributions to candidates or parties, the Supreme Court has\nacknowledged the risk that individuals might use non-profits\nto evade those limits. In order to prevent circumvention of\nlimits on an individual donor’s contributions to candidates\nand parties, the Court has held that non-profit entities can be\nrequired to make their own contributions to candidates and\nparties, as well as pay associated administrative expenses, out\nof a hard-money account that is subject to source and amount\nrestrictions. See Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198-99 (opinion of\nMarshall, J.); id. at 203-04 (opinion of Blackmun, J.). As a\nmajority of the Court pointed out in Cal-Med, doing so\nprevents non-profits from being used as “conduits” for illegal\ncontributions to parties and candidates and thus prevents\n“evasion of the limitations on contributions” to a candidate.\nId. at 203 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also id. at 198\n(opinion of Marshall, J.) (limit on donations to non-profit\nprevents evasion of “$1,000 limit on contributions to\ncandidates . . . by channeling funds” through the non-profit);\nCal. Med. Ass’n v. FEC, 641 F.2d 619, 625 (9th Cir. 1980)\n(Kennedy, J.) (non-profit committee is “natural conduit for\ncandidate contributions and . . . the essential purpose of the\nprovision here in question is to limit those contributions, not\nto limit expenditures for any other type of political\nadvocacy”) (emphasis added).10\n    10\n        The requirement that certain administrative expenses be\nfunded in part with hard money prevents a contributor from\nessentially taking control of a non-profit and thereby circumventing\nlimits on individual contributions to candidates. See Cal-Med, 453\nU.S. at 198-99 n.19 (opinion of Marshall, J.); id. at 203 (opinion of\n\f                                18\n\n    Consistent with Cal-Med’s ruling, FECA limits\ncontributors to donating a maximum of $5000 per year to a\nnon-profit’s hard-money account. A non-profit in turn may\ncontribute to a candidate or party only from that hard-money\naccount. See 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C). And an individual’s\ncontribution to a non-profit’s hard-money account may count\nagainst the individual’s aggregate annual contribution limits.\nSee 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3).\n\n                                3\n\n     What about a non-profit entity that falls into both\ncategories – in other words, a non-profit that makes\nexpenditures and makes contributions to candidates or\nparties? EMILY’s List is a good example of such a hybrid\nnon-profit: It makes expenditures for advertisements, get-out-\nthe-vote efforts, and voter registration drives; it also makes\ndirect contributions to candidates and parties. In all of its\nactivities, its mission is to promote and safeguard abortion\nrights and to support the election of pro-choice Democratic\nwomen to federal, state, and local offices nationwide.\n\n    The constitutional principles that govern such a hybrid\nnon-profit entity follow ineluctably from the well-established\nprinciples governing the other two categories of non-profits.\nTo prevent circumvention of contribution limits by individual\ndonors, non-profit entities may be required to make their own\ncontributions to federal candidates and parties out of a hard-\nmoney account – that is, an account subject to source and\n\n\nBlackmun, J.). But as discussed above, the Cal-Med Court never\nstated that non-profits could be required to use hard money for\nadvertisements, get-out-the-vote activities, and voter registration\ndrives; indeed, Justice Blackmun’s opinion stated the opposite.\n\f                                19\namount limitations ($5000 annually per contributor).\nSimilarly, non-profits also may be compelled to use their\nhard-money accounts to pay an appropriately tailored share of\nadministrative expenses associated with their contributions.\nSee Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198-99 n.19 (opinion of Marshall,\nJ.). But non-profit entities are entitled to make their\nexpenditures – such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote\nefforts, and voter registration drives – out of a soft-money or\ngeneral treasury account that is not subject to source and\namount limits. Stated another way: A non-profit that makes\nexpenditures to support federal candidates does not suddenly\nforfeit its First Amendment rights when it decides also to\nmake direct contributions to parties or candidates. Rather, it\nsimply must ensure, to avoid circumvention of individual\ncontribution limits by its donors, that its contributions to\nparties or candidates come from a hard-money account.11\n\n\n    11\n        One additional wrinkle: To the extent a non-profit receives\ndonations from for-profit corporations or unions, those donations\ncannot be placed in the non-profit’s hard-money account (because\nfor-profit corporate or union donations cannot be the source of\ncontributions to parties or candidates). Moreover, under Austin, the\nsoft-money account into which such donations are deposited cannot\nbe used to fund express-advocacy election activities that for-profit\ncorporations and unions are themselves banned from conducting.\nCf. WRTL, 551 U.S. at 476-77; MCFL, 479 U.S. at 259-64; FEC v.\nNRA, 254 F.3d 173, 191-92 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Justice Souter\nrecently summarized these points: A “nonprofit may use its general\ntreasury to pay for clearly electioneering communications so long\nas it declines to serve as a conduit for money from business\ncorporations and unions (and thus qualifies for the MCFL\nexception).” WRTL, 551 U.S. at 521 (Souter, J., dissenting)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). If Austin were overruled, then\nnon-profits would be able to make unlimited express-advocacy\nexpenditures from their soft-money accounts even if they accepted\ndonations from for-profit corporations or unions to those accounts.\n\f                                  20\n                                  C\n\n     How does McConnell affect the above principles\ngoverning non-profits? McConnell upheld congressionally\nimposed limits on political parties receiving or spending soft\nmoney. Some have argued that the Government can similarly\nrestrict soft-money contributions to and spending by non-\nprofits. In this case, the District Court accepted that reasoning\nin ruling for the FEC; it found non-profits similarly situated to\npolitical parties for purposes of the First Amendment analysis.\n\n       In our judgment, however, McConnell does not support\nsuch regulation of non-profits. McConnell affirmed BCRA’s\nlimits on contributions to political parties because of the close\nties between candidates and parties and the extensive record\nevidence of what it deemed a threat of actual or apparent\ncorruption – specifically, the access to federal officials and\ncandidates that large soft-money contributors to political\nparties received in exchange for their contributions. The\nCourt said that it was “not unwarranted for Congress to\nconclude that the selling of access gives rise to the appearance\nof corruption.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 154. The Court\nexpressly based its conclusion on the “close relationship\nbetween federal officeholders and the national parties, as well\nas the means by which parties have traded on that relationship\n. . . .” Id.12\n\n     12\n        See generally McConnell, 540 U.S. at 130 (“both parties\npromised and provided special access to candidates and senior\nGovernment officials in exchange for large soft-money\ncontributions”); id. at 145 (“special relationship and unity of\ninterest” that candidates and officeholders share with parties); id. at\n146 (“The evidence in the record shows that candidates and donors\nalike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to\nincrease their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on\nthe part of officeholders, with the national parties serving as willing\n\f                                  21\n\n     Unlike the political parties examined in McConnell, there\nis no record evidence that non-profit entities have sold access\nto federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large\ncontributions. See also Craig Holman, The Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act: Limits and Opportunities for Non-\n\nintermediaries.”); id. at 150 (“The record in the present cases is\nreplete with similar examples of national party committees peddling\naccess to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large\nsoft-money donations.”); id. at 151 (“So pervasive is this practice\nthat the six national party committees actually furnish their own\nmenus of opportunities for access to would-be soft-money donors,\nwith increased prices reflecting an increased level of access.”); id.\nat 152 (“close ties that candidates and officeholders have with their\nparties”); id. at 153-54 (“As the record demonstrates, it is the\nmanner in which parties have sold access to federal candidates and\nofficeholders that has given rise to the appearance of undue\ninfluence.”); id. at 155 (“no meaningful separation between the\nnational party committees and the public officials who control\nthem”) (internal quotation marks omitted); id. (“Given this close\nconnection and alignment of interests, large soft-money\ncontributions to national parties are likely to create actual or\napparent indebtedness on the part of federal officeholders”); id.\n(“This close affiliation has also placed national parties in a position\nto sell access to federal officeholders in exchange for soft-money\ncontributions”); id. (“Access to federal officeholders is the most\nvaluable favor the national party committees are able to give in\nexchange for large donations.”); id. at 156 n.51 (“[T]he record\ndemonstrates close ties between federal officeholders and the state\nand local committees of their parties. That close relationship makes\nstate and local parties effective conduits for donors desiring to\ncorrupt federal candidates and officeholders. Thus, in upholding\n§§ 323(b), (d), and (f), we rely not only on the fact that they\nregulate contributions used to fund activities influencing federal\nelections, but also that they regulate contributions to, or at the\nbehest of, entities uniquely positioned to serve as conduits for\ncorruption.”).\n\f                              22\nProfit Groups in Federal Elections, 31 N. KY. L. REV. 243,\n280 (2004) (“Today’s electioneering non-profit groups . . .\ncan make no such promises of access in exchange for a soft\nmoney contribution.”).\n\n     More fundamentally, non-profit groups do not have the\nsame inherent relationship with federal candidates and\nofficeholders that political parties do. The McConnell Court\nidentified numerous “real-world differences between political\nparties and interest groups.” 540 U.S. at 188. “Interest\ngroups do not select slates of candidates for elections.\nInterest groups do not determine who will serve on legislative\ncommittees, elect congressional leadership, or organize\nlegislative caucuses. Political parties have influence and\npower in the Legislature that vastly exceeds that of any\ninterest group. As a result, it is hardly surprising that party\naffiliation is the primary way by which voters identify\ncandidates, or that parties in turn have special access to and\nrelationships with federal officeholders.” Id. As noted in\nMcConnell, Congress recognized these differences and\nenacted a statutory scheme under which “[i]nterest groups . . .\nremain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration,\nGOTV activities, mailings,” and advertising. Id. at 187.\n\n     In sum, it will not work to simply transport McConnell’s\nholding from the political party context to the non-profit\nsetting. On this question as well, we agree with Judge\nWilkinson: “It is . . . not an exaggeration to say that\nMcConnell views political parties as different in kind than\nindependent expenditure committees.” N.C. Right to Life, 525\nF.3d at 293.\n\n    For non-profit entities, the most pertinent Supreme Court\nprecedents remain Buckley, Cal-Med, Citizens Against Rent\nControl, NCPAC, and MCFL. As discussed above, those\n\f                                 23\ncases ultimately stand for the proposition that non-profit\ngroups may accept unlimited donations to their soft-money\naccounts. And subject to the one Austin-based exception,\nnon-profit groups – like individual citizens – may spend\nunlimited amounts out of their soft-money accounts for\nelection-related activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-\nvote efforts, and voter registration drives.13\n    13\n         Some have suggested that footnote 48 of the McConnell\nopinion, in the course of discussing contributions to parties, subtly\nre-interpreted Cal-Med to permit restrictions on large soft-money\ndonations to non-profits. See, e.g., Edward B. Foley & Donald\nTobin, The New Loophole?: 527s, Political Committees, and\nMcCain-Feingold, BNA MONEY & POL. REP., Jan. 7, 2004;\nMemorandum from Prof. Daniel R. Ortiz, Univ. of Va. School of\nLaw, to Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center (Apr. 9,\n2004). We decline to adopt that expansive reading of footnote 48.\n      First, as explained by one leading election-law expert, such a\nreading would require overruling the Supreme Court’s longstanding\ndichotomy between limits on contributions and expenditures. See\nRichard L. Hasen, Buckley is Dead, Long Live Buckley, 153 U. PA.\nL. REV. 31, 70 (2004). Limits on donations to non-profit entities\nare analytically akin to limits on expenditures by the donors. See\nCal-Med, 453 U.S. at 202 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also\nBriffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. at 982 (“[I]f George Soros’s\ndirect expenditure of $23 million on anti-Bush or pro-Kerry ads is\nconstitutionally protected, how does he forfeit that protection if he\ncombines his $23 million with $20 million from Peter Lewis and\nmaybe another $10 million from some slightly smaller fry in a fund\nthat takes out essentially the same ads and supports the same voter\ndrives?”). For that reason, a broad interpretation of footnote 48\nwould mean “the entire Buckley edifice . . . falls.” Hasen, 153 U.\nPA. L. REV. at 70. “Is that what the Court really intended buried in\na few sentences of a footnote in one of the longest cases in Supreme\nCourt history?” Id. We think not.\n      Second, footnote 48 simply cited Cal-Med together with\nBuckley in the course of establishing the constitutionality of limits\non contributions to political parties, not to non-profits (which the\n\f                                  24\n                                  III\n\n     We now consider whether the 2004 FEC regulations at\nissue in this case comport with the relevant constitutional\nprinciples. They do not.\n\n    The fundamental flaw, as counsel for EMILY’s List\nsuccinctly stated at oral argument, is that the Commission\nimproperly “brought to bear what was essentially a political\nparty analysis to a non-connected, independent committee\nwhich is not under the control of, or associated with\n\n\nCourt had no need to address). In the key concluding sentence in\nthe footnote, the Court rejected the idea that the government could\nonly regulate “parties as pass-throughs.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n152 n.48 (emphasis added). Moreover, footnote 48 was responding\nto a point in Justice Kennedy’s dissent that had nothing to do with\nnon-profits. See Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. at 986\n(“importantly, the McConnell footnote was written in the course of\nthe Court’s analysis of BCRA’s application of contribution limits to\nthe activities of political parties”). We would unfairly wrench\nfootnote 48 from its context were we to adopt the broad\ninterpretation some have proposed.\n     Third, in a later passage in the McConnell opinion, the Court\nexplained that, under the statute, “[i]nterest groups . . . remain free\nto raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities,\nmailings,” and advertisements. 540 U.S. at 187. That passage –\nand the accompanying discussion – would make little sense if\nfootnote 48 were read to equate non-profits with political parties.\n     Fourth, the Fourth Circuit in North Carolina Right to Life\nrefused to adopt this broad reading of footnote 48; it eschewed the\ndissenting judge’s extensive reliance on it. See 525 F.3d at 333-34\n(Michael, J., dissenting).\n     In short, we decline to read this footnote addressing a different\nissue in McConnell to indirectly (i) overrule Buckley, (ii) discard\nJustice Blackmun’s opinion in Cal-Med, and (iii) equate non-profits\nwith political parties, contrary to other discussion in McConnell.\n\f                                  25\ncandidates in the fashion of a political party.” Tr. of Oral\nArg. at 4.\n\n                                  A\n\n    The rules set forth in §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57\ncontain five relevant provisions. In our judgment, the\nprovisions are not closely drawn to meet an important\ngovernmental interest.14\n\n     14\n        We need not decide whether the regulations are subject to\nthe strictest scrutiny applicable to spending restrictions or the still\n“rigorous” but slightly lesser “closely drawn” scrutiny applicable to\ncontribution restrictions. See generally Davis v. FEC, 128 S. Ct.\n2759, 2770-72 (2008); FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), 551\nU.S. 449, 464 (2007); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 29 (1976).\nUnder either permutation of this “exacting” scrutiny, Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 16, the regulations violate the First Amendment. That said,\nthe allocation and “mere reference” regulations of §§ 106.6(c) and\n106.6(f) are best considered spending restrictions under the analysis\nset forth in Wisconsin Right to Life. 551 U.S. at 457, 477 n.9, 478-\n79; see also Cal. Med. Ass’n v. FEC, 453 U.S. 182, 203 (1981)\n(opinion of Blackmun, J.) (limits on donations to non-profits\nsubject to strict scrutiny). In Wisconsin Right to Life, the Court\nindicated that forcing an entity to spend out of a segregated fund\nsubject to source and amount limitations, rather than its general\ntreasury, was a spending restriction. 551 U.S. at 477 n.9. So too\nhere. Unlike BCRA’s rules for political parties, moreover, these\nregulations do not limit how much someone can contribute to\nEMILY’s List or other covered non-profits.              Rather, these\nregulations force non-profit entities to pay for a large percentage of\ntheir varied political activities out of hard-money accounts subject\nto source and amount ($5000) limits rather than out of soft-money\naccounts that may receive unlimited donations. Through this\nmechanism, the regulations limit how much non-profits ultimately\ncan spend on advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter\nregistration drives. These regulations therefore “reduce[] the\n\f                                 26\n\n     Under the Supreme Court’s precedents, non-profit\nentities may be required to use their hard-money accounts for\ntheir own contributions to candidates and parties and for an\nappropriately tailored share of administrative expenses\nassociated with such contributions. But as explained above,\nnon-profits may not be forced to use their hard-money\naccounts for expenditures such as advertisements, get-out-the-\nvote efforts, and voter registration drives. Non-profits – like\nindividual citizens – are entitled to spend and raise unlimited\nmoney for those activities. The FEC’s five new regulatory\nprovisions flout those principles.\n\n    First, the regulations require covered15 non-profit entities\nto use their hard-money accounts to pay at least 50% of the\n\nquantity of expression” for groups like EMILY’s List “by\nrestricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their\nexploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 19. As a rough analogy, consider a law that requires home\nbuyers to pay a 50% cash down payment to obtain a mortgage.\nThat kind of law would significantly limit how much buyers could\nafford to spend for a new house. A similar dynamic is at play as a\nresult of these regulations.\n      15\n          The regulations apply only to those non-profits that must\nregister with the FEC as political committees – namely, groups that\nreceive or spend more than $1000 annually for the purpose of\ninfluencing a federal election and whose “major purpose” involves\nfederal elections. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79; see 2 U.S.C. §§ 431-\n434, 441a; supra note 7. Our constitutional analysis of donations\nand spending limits applies both to non-connected non-profits\nregistered as political committees with the FEC and to non-\nconnected non-profits that are not so registered. The fact that a\nnon-profit spends a certain amount or percentage of its money in\nrelation to federal elections cannot be a basis, at least under the\nanti-corruption rationale, for restricting its ability to accept large\ndonations to support those expenditures. That conclusion follows\n\f                                  27\ncosts of their generic get-out-the-vote efforts and voter\nregistration activities. 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). By “generic,”\nthe regulations mean those activities that refer to a party but\ndo not promote or oppose a particular candidate. See id. §\n100.25. This provision violates the First Amendment because\nnon-profits are constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the\ncosts of such voter drive activities out of their soft-money\naccounts. See Cal. Med. Ass’n v. FEC, 453 U.S. 182, 203\n(1981) (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also FEC v. Mass.\nCitizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL), 479 U.S. 238, 259-63 (1986);\nFEC v. Nat’l Conservative PAC (NCPAC), 470 U.S. 480, 501\n(1985); Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454\nU.S. 290, 298-99 (1981); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 45-48\n(1976).\n\n     Second, the regulations mandate that covered non-profits\nuse their hard-money accounts for 50% of any generic\ncommunications that refer to a party without referring to a\ncandidate, for example, “Support the Democratic party.” 11\nC.F.R. § 106.6(c). This provision likewise violates the First\nAmendment because non-profits are constitutionally entitled\nto pay 100% of the costs of such communications out of their\nsoft-money accounts. See Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 203 (opinion\nof Blackmun, J.); see also MCFL, 479 U.S. at 259-63;\nNCPAC, 470 U.S. at 501; Citizens Against Rent Control, 454\nU.S. at 298-99; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 45-48.\n\nfrom the Supreme Court’s consistent holdings that large\nexpenditures are constitutionally protected and the corresponding\nprinciple that non-profits are constitutionally entitled to accept large\ndonations to their soft-money accounts to support advertisements,\nget-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration activities. Of course,\nbecause of the lesser First Amendment protection against\ndisclosure, the major purpose test is permissible under current\nprecedent for determining non-profits’ disclosure obligations. See\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 79.\n\f                               28\n\n     Third, the regulations direct covered non-profit entities to\nuse their hard-money accounts to pay at least 50% of all\nadministrative expenses. 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). Those\nadministrative expenses include rent, utilities, office supplies,\nand salaries, among other costs. But a non-profit may be\nforced to use hard money for, at most, a percentage of\nadministrative expenses that “closely” corresponds to the\npercentage of activities relating to its contributions as\ncompared to its advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and\nvoter registration activities. See Davis v. FEC, 128 S. Ct.\n2759, 2770 (2008) (campaign finance regulations must at\nleast be “closely drawn” to further an important governmental\ninterest); Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 198-99 n.19 (opinion of\nMarshall, J.) (rejecting argument that non-profit was entitled\nto pay its “entire” administrative expenses with unlimited\ndonations or soft-money account) (emphasis added). The\ntailoring must ensure that a hybrid non-profit is not unduly\nadvantaged as compared to a non-profit that makes only\ncontributions (and thus must fund certain administrative\nexpenses with hard money) and is not unduly disadvantaged\nas compared to a non-profit that makes only expenditures\n(and thus may fund its administrative expenses with soft\nmoney). Section 106.6(c) does not attempt or purport to\nallocate administrative expenses in that way. And the “desire\nfor a bright-line rule    . . . hardly constitutes the compelling\nstate interest necessary to justify any infringement on First\nAmendment freedom.” FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc.\n(WRTL), 551 U.S. 449, 479 (2007) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (controlling opinion of Roberts, C.J.).\n\n     Fourth, the regulations compel covered non-profit entities\nto use their hard-money accounts to pay 100% of the costs of\nadvertisements or other communications that “refer” to a\nfederal candidate.       11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f)(1).       If an\n\f                               29\nadvertisement or communication refers to a state candidate as\nwell as a federal candidate, the non-profit must pay for it with\na percentage of its hard-money account as determined by time\nand space allocation. See id. § 106.6(f)(3). Here again, the\nproblem is that non-profits are constitutionally entitled to pay\n100% of the costs of their advertisements and other\ncommunications out of a soft-money account. See MCFL,\n479 U.S. at 251; NCPAC, 470 U.S. at 501; Citizens Against\nRent Control, 454 U.S. at 299; Cal-Med, 453 U.S. at 203\n(opinion of Blackmun, J.); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 45-48.\n\n     Fifth, the regulations create a new regime for solicitations\nindicating that donated funds will be used to support or\noppose the election of a clearly identified federal candidate.\n11 C.F.R. § 100.57. The regulations require that donations in\nresponse to such solicitations be treated as 100% hard money.\nId. § 100.57(a)-(b)(1). This means that donations in response\nto such solicitations are subject to a $5000 cap. If a\nsolicitation also refers to a state or local candidate, at least\n50% of the responsive donations must go to the hard-money\naccount. Id. § 100.57(b)(2). This provision is badly flawed.\nNon-profits are entitled to raise money for their soft-money\naccounts to help support their preferred candidates, yet this\nregulation prohibits non-profits from saying as much in their\nsolicitations. “Such notions run afoul of the fundamental rule\nof protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has\nthe autonomy to choose the content of his own message.”\nWRTL, 551 U.S. at 477 n.9 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Davis, 128 S. Ct. at 2771 (provision that requires\nchoice between “unfettered political speech” and\n“discriminatory fundraising limitations” violates First\nAmendment).\n\f                               30\n                               B\n\n     In short, the new FEC regulations do not pass muster\nunder the Supreme Court’s First Amendment precedents. The\nregulations are not “closely drawn” to serve a cognizable anti-\ncorruption interest. See Davis, 128 S. Ct. at 2770-71; WRTL,\n551 U.S. at 478-80; NCPAC, 470 U.S. at 496-97; Citizens\nAgainst Rent Control, 454 U.S. at 296-97; Buckley, 424 U.S.\nat 26-27, 45-48. Donations to and spending by a non-profit\ncannot corrupt a candidate or officeholder, at least in the\nabsence of some McConnell-like evidence establishing such\ncorruption or the appearance thereof. See N.C. Right to Life,\nInc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274, 292-93 (4th Cir. 2008); see also\nRichard Briffault, The 527 Problem and the Buckley\nProblem, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 949, 999 (2005) (“The 527s\ndo not fit easily within Buckley’s anticorruption paradigm, at\nleast as the Supreme Court has defined corruption until\nnow.”); Gregg D. Polsky & Guy-Uriel E. Charles, Regulating\nSection 527 Organizations, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 1000,\n1027-35 (2005).\n\n     Of course, the fact that the regulations do not serve a\ncognizable anti-corruption interest is not surprising because\nthe decision to more tightly regulate entities like EMILY’s\nList arose out of an entirely different concern: the influence of\nnon-profits that raise and spend large amounts of money and\nthereby affect federal elections. See, e.g., Comments of\nDemocracy 21, Campaign Legal Center & Center for\nResponsive Politics in Response to Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking, No. 2004-6, at 1-2 (Apr. 5, 2004) (criticizing\n“the spending of tens of millions of dollars of soft money\nexplicitly for the purpose of influencing the presidential\nelection by section 527 groups”). Responding to such\ncomplaints, the FEC adopted these new regulations to tamp\ndown spending by non-profits and thereby better equalize the\n\f                              31\nvoices of citizens and groups who participate in the political\nprocess. Large donations to and spending by non-profits\nprompted these regulations, and limiting non-profits’\nexpenditures is their intended and predictable effect.\n\n     But the Supreme Court’s First Amendment cases have\nrepeatedly repudiated this equalization rationale as a basis for\nregulating campaign-related contributions or expenditures.\nSee Davis, 128 S. Ct. at 2773; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 48-49.\nUnder current law, therefore, these regulations are\nunsupportable. The concern with “large individual donations\nto the 527s is that they permit a tiny group of Americans – the\nwealthiest . . . – to play an enormous role in the electoral\nprocess . . . . Buckley, however, rejected the protection of\npolitical equality as a basis for limiting the role of money in\nelection campaigns.” Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. at\n954 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n   As a lower court, we must strictly adhere to the Supreme\nCourt’s precedents. The regulations contravene the First\nAmendment as it has been interpreted thus far by the Supreme\nCourt.16\n\n                               C\n\n     As some commentators point out, it might seem\nincongruous to permit non-profits to receive and spend large\nsoft-money donations when political parties and candidates\ncannot. See Samuel Issacharoff & Pamela S. Karlan, The\nHydraulics of Campaign Finance Reform, 77 TEX. L. REV.\n    16\n         This case does not involve reporting and disclosure\nobligations. The Government has a freer hand in imposing\nreporting and disclosure requirements than it does in limiting\ncontributions and expenditures. See McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S.\n93, 121-22 (2003); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64-68.\n\f                              32\n1705, 1715 (1999). But this perceived anomaly has existed to\nsome extent since Buckley, which recognized that contribution\nlimitations “alone would not reduce the greater potential voice\nof affluent persons and well-financed groups, who would\nremain free to spend unlimited sums directly to promote\ncandidates and policies they favor in an effort to persuade\nvoters.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26 n.26. And McConnell\nsimilarly took note of the fact that, even after that decision\nupholding regulations on contributions to parties, “[i]nterest\ngroups . . . remain free to raise soft money to fund voter\nregistration, GOTV activities, mailings,” and advertisements.\nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 187 (2003).\n\n     If eliminating this perceived asymmetry is deemed\nnecessary, the constitutionally permitted legislative solution,\nas the Court stated in an analogous situation in Davis, is “to\nraise or eliminate” limits on contributions to parties or\ncandidates. 128 S. Ct. at 2774. But it is not permissible, at\nleast under current Supreme Court precedents, to remove the\nincongruity by placing these limits on spending by or\ndonations to non-profits.\n\n                              IV\n\n     In addition to its First Amendment challenge to the five\nregulatory provisions, EMILY’s List alternatively contends\nthat three of the five provisions exceed the FEC’s statutory\nauthority. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) (agency may not act “in\nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or\nshort of statutory right.”). We agree.\n\n     When enacting BCRA in 2002, Congress did not\nauthorize the FEC to restrict donations to or spending by non-\nprofits – even though Congress was aware that BCRA’s\nrestrictions on political parties meant that independent non-\n\f                               33\nprofit groups would become more influential in the electoral\nprocess. Indeed, Senator Lieberman, speaking in the Senate\nat the time, anticipated that “at least some of the soft money\ndonors who will no longer be able to give to political parties\nwill be looking for other ways to influence our elections.\nDonations to 527 groups will probably top many of their\nlists.” 148 CONG. REC. S10779 (daily ed. Oct. 17, 2002)\n(statement of Sen. Lieberman). He was right. Yet in the\nseven years since BCRA was enacted, Congress still has not\nimposed limits on non-profits, apparently because of\ncontinuing constitutional and policy concerns about regulating\nthem in such a manner.\n\n    The statutory question, therefore, is whether the FEC’s\nauthority under the long-standing Federal Election Campaign\nAct justifies the challenged regulations.\n\n     Under FECA, the FEC’s authority extends only to\nregulating donations and expenditures made “for the purpose\nof influencing any election for Federal office.” 2 U.S.C.\n§ 431(8)(A)(i).   As the Supreme Court has explained,\n“[d]onations made solely for the purpose of influencing state\nor local elections are therefore unaffected by FECA’s\nrequirements and prohibitions.” McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S.\n93, 122 (2003).\n\n     Under FECA, in other words, the FEC possesses\nstatutory authority to require a non-profit to use its hard-\nmoney account to pay for federal activities, generic activities,\nand mixed federal-state-local activities. See id. at 122-23.17\n\n    17\n        As explained earlier in this opinion, those approaches run\ninto severe First Amendment obstacles. For purposes of this\ndiscussion, however, we analyze the statute as written without\nregard to constitutional implications.\n\f                                  34\nBut the FEC exceeds its statutory authority when it requires\nnon-profits to use hard money for exclusively state and local\nelection activities. See id. at 122; Chevron USA, Inc. v.\nNatural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (step\none).\n\n    The three regulatory provisions that EMILY’s List\nchallenges under FECA cross the statute’s boundaries.\n\n     EMILY’s List targets one of the provisions in § 106.6(c)\nas exceeding the FEC’s statutory authority – namely, the part\nrequiring covered non-profits to use their hard-money\naccounts to pay for 50% of their administrative expenses.\nThis requirement applies even if more than 50% of a non-\nprofit’s administrative expenses are exclusively associated\nwith state and local elections. That poses a problem because\nthe FEC possesses no authority under FECA to require non-\nprofits to use their hard-money accounts for their exclusively\nstate and local election activities. We thus concur with\nEMILY’s List that this provision is overbroad and\n“federalizes the funding and reporting of a large portion of\nsuch a committee’s nonfederal receipts and disbursements,\nwhich are not made for the purpose of influencing federal\nelections.” EMILY’s List Br. at 39.18\n\n     18\n         As discussed above, § 106.6(c) also requires non-profits to\nuse their federal or hard-money accounts to pay for (i) at least 50%\nof their generic get-out-the vote and voter registration activities and\n(ii) at least 50% of their generic communications, which refer to a\nparty but not a candidate. In its brief, EMILY’s List does not raise\nstatutory challenges to those two provisions. See EMILY’s List Br.\nat 35-40; id. at 38 (challenging under the statute only that provision\nin § 106.6(c) that sets forth a “‘Minimum Percentages’ Rule for\nAdministrative Costs”). Presumably, EMILY’s List has not\nchallenged these two provisions under FECA because McConnell\nindicated that these generic activities qualify under the statute as\n\f                                35\n\n    Next, EMILY’s List argues that § 106.6(f) exceeds the\nFEC’s statutory authority. Recall that this provision requires\ncovered non-profits to use hard money for all or part of their\npublic communications that merely “refer” to federal\ncandidates. See 11 C.F.R. 106.6(f). The FEC runs roughshod\nover the limits on its statutory authority when it presumes that\nany public communications that merely “refer” to a federal\ncandidate necessarily seek to influence a federal election.19\n\n     For example, § 106.6(f) would compel a covered non-\nprofit to use some hard money to pay for an advertisement\nrunning only in California in which Senator Jones from Maine\nendorses Candidate Smith for Governor of California. The\nsole purpose of such an advertisement is to influence the state\nelection in California – a matter entirely outside the FEC’s\nstatutory authority.\n\n\n\n\nactivities and communications “for the purpose of influencing”\nfederal elections. See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 123 (“Although a\nliteral reading of FECA’s definition of ‘contribution’ would have\nrequired such activities to be funded with hard money, the FEC\nruled that political parties could fund mixed-purpose activities –\nincluding get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertising – in\npart with soft money.”) (emphasis added).\n      19\n         The original FEC proposal was far narrower and would have\ncovered only communications that promote, attack, support, or\noppose federal candidates, similar to BCRA’s requirement for state\nand local parties. See 69 Fed. Reg. at 11,753, 11,757-11,758 (Mar.\n11, 2004) (notice of proposed rulemaking).           After initially\nconsidering that limited proposal, the FEC ultimately decided to\nregulate broadly and to saddle non-profits with even greater\nrestrictions than Congress in BCRA chose to impose on state and\nlocal parties.\n\f                              36\n     An incident illustrating § 106.6(f)’s statutory flaws\noccurred in 2005. EMILY’s List sought to run advertisements\nfeaturing Senator Stabenow in order to support Democratic\nwomen candidates for state legislative offices. At the time,\nSenator Stabenow was a candidate for reelection to the U.S.\nSenate in Michigan. EMILY’s List represented that the\ncommunication would not be distributed in Michigan, would\nnot reference Senator Stabenow’s federal candidacy, would\nnot solicit funds for her federal candidacy, and would not\nrefer to any clearly identified non-federal candidate. Rather,\nit would support non-federal Democratic women candidates\nas a class. Nonetheless, the FEC determined that the mere\nreference to Senator Stabenow meant that EMILY’s List had\nto pay for the communications with 100% hard money. See\nFEC Adv. Op. 2005-13, at 3-4 (Oct. 20, 2005).\n\n     Finally, EMILY’s List argues that the solicitation rule set\nforth in § 100.57 also exceeds the FEC’s statutory power. We\nagree. To reiterate, § 100.57 requires covered non-profits to\ntreat as hard-money “contributions” all funds given in\nresponse to solicitations indicating that “any portion” of the\nfunds received will be used to support or oppose the election\nof a federal candidate. 11 C.F.R. §§ 100.57(a)-(b)(1)\n(emphasis added). If the communication indicates that the\nfunds will support or oppose both a federal and non-federal\ncandidate, then at least 50% of those funds must be treated as\nhard money. See id. § 100.57(b)(2). The statutory defect in\nthe rule is that, depending on the particular solicitation at\nissue, it requires covered non-profits to treat as hard money\ncertain donations that are not actually made “for the purpose\nof influencing” federal elections.\n\n    Consider a fundraising pitch in which a non-profit such\nas EMILY’s List tells donors that only 10% of their gift will\nbe used to support identified federal candidates, with the rest\n\f                                37\nto exclusively support state and local candidates. Each donor\nfully and correctly understands that only a small portion of his\nor her gift will be used “for the purpose of influencing”\nfederal elections. And yet, § 100.57 requires that at least 50%\nof donations in response to such a solicitation be classified as\na hard-money donation subject to the $5000 cap – thereby\nsimultaneously creating a separate $5000 cap on soft-money\ndonations given in response to such a solicitation. This may\nrequire a non-profit to decline or return funds it receives for\npurely state and local elections. That is not permissible under\nFECA.\n\n     In short, there is a significant mismatch between these\nchallenged provisions and the FEC’s authority under FECA.\nTherefore, we conclude that §§ 106.6(f) and 100.57, as well\nas the provision in § 106.6(c) that applies to administrative\nexpenses, exceed the FEC’s statutory authority.20\n\n\n    20\n        EMILY’s List separately argues that three of the five\nregulatory provisions at issue in this case are also arbitrary and\ncapricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. EMILY’s List\nBr. at 40-44. We are less persuaded by EMILY’s List’s free-\nstanding arbitrary and capricious argument. Putting aside the\nconstitutional and statutory-authority problems with the challenged\nrules, the provisions are not otherwise arbitrary and capricious.\nAgencies generally do not violate the APA’s deferential arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard when they employ bright-line rules for\nreasons of administrative convenience, so long as those rules fall\nwithin a zone of reasonableness and are reasonably explained. See,\ne.g., ExxonMobil Gas Mktg. Co. v. FERC, 297 F.3d 1071, 1084\n(D.C. Cir. 2002); WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 238 F.3d 449, 461-62\n(D.C. Cir. 2001).\n      EMILY’s List does not bring a challenge under either FECA\nor the APA to § 106.6(c)’s requirement that covered non-profits\npay at least 50% of the cost of their generic communications out of\ntheir hard-money accounts. See EMILY’s List Br. at 35-44.\n\f                              38\n                              V\n\n    Before concluding, we add a few words regarding the\nconcurring opinion.\n\n     To begin, it is important to emphasize the area of\nagreement between the opinion of the Court and the\nconcurrence. All three judges on the panel have determined\nthat §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 are unlawful and must\nbe vacated.\n\n    The concurrence advances two main points: (i) that under\nMcConnell, the Federal Government constitutionally may\nregulate non-profits like political parties; and (ii) that we\nshould not address the First Amendment issue in this case.\nNeither argument is convincing.\n\n     First, the concurrence contends that “regulation of\npolitical parties is not McConnell’s theme,” and it reads\nMcConnell to support regulation not only of political parties\nbut also of independent non-profit groups. Concurring Op. at\n19. As we have explained at length above, we do not find that\na persuasive interpretation of McConnell. In upholding Title I\nof BCRA, the McConnell Court relied heavily on the “unity\nof interest,” “close relationship,” and “close ties” among\ncandidates, officeholders, and political parties.          The\nconcurrence identifies no similar unity of interest between\nnon-profits, on the one hand, and candidates, officeholders, or\nparties on the other. The McConnell Court also based its\ndecision on the substantial record evidence of parties selling\naccess in exchange for soft-money contributions. The Court\nrepeatedly emphasized that “Congress must show concrete\n\n\nEMILY’s List raises only a constitutional challenge to that\nprovision.\n\f                                 39\nevidence that a particular type of financial transaction is\ncorrupting or gives rise to the appearance of corruption . . . . It\nhas done so here.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 185-86 n.72. The\nconcurrence cites no similar record evidence showing that\nnon-profits sell access to officeholders and candidates in\nexchange for large soft-money contributions.\n\n     In our judgment, “McConnell views political parties as\ndifferent in kind than independent expenditure committees.”\nN.C. Right to Life v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274, 293 (4th Cir. 2008).\nWe therefore disagree with the concurrence’s attempt to\nstretch McConnell’s reasoning from political parties to non-\nprofits.21\n\n\n\n     21\n        The concurrence notes that McConnell upheld § 323(f) of\nBCRA, which prohibits state and local candidates and officeholders\nfrom using soft money for communications that promote, support,\nattack, or oppose a federal candidate. We fail to see how this\naspect of McConnell justifies upholding limits on non-profits.\nMcConnell, as we read it, relied in part on the fact that\nofficeholders, candidates, and parties at all levels share a close\nrelationship and apparent unity of interest. And the Court also\nbased its conclusion with respect to state and local candidates and\nofficeholders – as elsewhere – on “the record in this litigation,” 540\nU.S. at 185, emphasizing that “Congress must show concrete\nevidence that a particular type of financial transaction is corrupting\nor gives rise to the appearance of corruption . . . . It has done so\nhere.” Id. at 185-86 n.72.\n      The concurrence also raises concern about the activities of\nnon-profit committees that are “closely aligned” with federal\ncandidates. Concurring Op. at 23. But our constitutional analysis\nof non-profits applies only to non-connected non-profits. See 11\nC.F.R. § 106.6(a); supra note 7. Moreover, expenditures by\nindividuals or non-profits that are coordinated with a candidate may\nbe considered contributions to that candidate.\n\f                             40\n     Relatedly, the concurrence disputes our reading of Cal-\nMed. See Concurring Op. at 24. But our analysis of that case,\nincluding our reliance on Justice Blackmun’s opinion, tracks\nthe persuasive reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in North\nCarolina Right to Life, of several other courts, and of\nnumerous commentators. See, e.g., N.C. Right to Life, 525\nF.3d at 292; see also, e.g., Comm. on Jobs Candidate\nAdvocacy Fund v. Herrera, No. C 07-03199, 2007 WL\n2790351, *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2007); Wash. State\nRepublican Party v. Wash. State Pub. Disclosure Comm’n, 4\nP.3d 808, 825 (Wash. 2000); Richard Briffault, The 527\nProblem and the Buckley Problem, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV.\n949, 982-85 (2005); John C. Eastman, Strictly Scrutinizing\nCampaign Finance Restrictions (and the Courts that Judge\nThem), 50 CATH. U. L. REV. 13, 37 (2000); Gregg D. Polsky\n& Guy-Uriel E. Charles, Regulating Section 527\nOrganizations, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 1000, 1031 (2005).\nMoreover, the concurrence does not substantively address the\nseveral post-Cal-Med cases that similarly recognize the right\nof non-profits to raise and spend money to support their\nagendas and preferred candidates. See, e.g., FEC v. Mass.\nCitizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL), 479 U.S. 238, 259-65 (1986);\nFEC v. Nat’l Conservative PAC (NCPAC), 470 U.S. 480, 501\n(1985); Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454\nU.S. 290, 296-99 (1981).\n\n    The concurrence further contends that we have not\nreceived on-point briefing on the constitutional issue. We\nagain respectfully disagree. The briefs and oral argument\nfocused first and most extensively on the First Amendment\nand McConnell – and debated the key question in this case:\nFor First Amendment purposes, are non-profits more like\nindividual citizens (who under Buckley have the right to spend\nunlimited money to support their preferred candidates) or\nmore like political parties (which under McConnell do not)?\n\f                               41\nSee Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 44-51 (1976); see also\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 155-56. Moreover, Cal-Med was\ncited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18, 32-33; FEC Br. at 21, 27, 28, 34;\nAmicus Br. at 21, 24; EMILY’s List Reply Br. at 11, 19-20.\nIndeed, the FEC’s brief noted that Cal-Med was a case\n“chiefly relied upon.” FEC Br. at iv. In short, the briefs and\noral argument focused on and grappled with the critical issues\nposed by the First Amendment challenge.\n\n    The concurrence suggests, however, that our holding\ngoes further than the submission of EMILY’s List. But\nEMILY’s List forcefully argued that these regulations\n“violate the First Amendment of the United States\nConstitution,” contended that McConnell and Cal-Med do not\nsupport the FEC’s approach, and asked the Court to vacate the\nnew regulations in their entirety. EMILY’s List Br. at 19. In\ndeciding this case, we have set forth the relevant\nconstitutional principles as we discern them, and we then have\napplied those principles to the challenged regulations. In so\ndoing, we have concluded that the regulations violate the First\nAmendment; we therefore have vacated the regulations,\nwhich is precisely the relief EMILY’s List sought in\nadvancing its First Amendment claims.\n\n     Second, apart from its substantive disagreement with our\nFirst Amendment analysis, the concurrence states that we\nshould resolve this case on statutory grounds alone, and\nclaims that it is “gratuitous” for us to address the First\nAmendment. We respectfully but firmly disagree.\n\n     The threshold problem with the concurrence’s preferred\nstatutory-only approach is that EMILY’s List raises a\nstatutory challenge to only three of the five provisions at issue\nhere. EMILY’s List does not advance a statutory challenge to\n\f                                42\nthe provision in § 106.6(c) requiring that covered non-profits\nuse their federal or hard-money accounts to pay for at least\n50% of their generic get-out-the-vote and voter registration\nactivities. Nor does EMILY’s List raise a statutory challenge\nto the provision in § 106.6(c) requiring that covered non-\nprofits use hard money to pay for at least 50% of their generic\ncommunications. Compare EMILY’s List Br. at 38-39\n(discussing only administrative expenses provision of §\n106.6(c) in statutory section of brief) with EMILY’s List Br.\nat 32 (raising constitutional challenges to all provisions of §\n106.6(c)). Indeed, footnote 11 of EMILY’s List’s brief all but\nconcedes that, under the statute, the FEC may require use of\nhard money for these generic activities.\n\n     EMILY’s List’s decision not to target these two\nprovisions of § 106.6(c) on statutory grounds appears wise.\nSuch an argument would be very difficult to square with\nMcConnell’s several pointed statements that FECA permits\nthe FEC to treat generic activities as entirely federal for\npurposes of contribution and expenditure limits. In fact,\nMcConnell harshly criticized the FEC for not having\npreviously treated political parties’ generic activities as\nentirely federal activities subject to FECA’s limits. See\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 142 (by allowing generic activities to\nbe funded largely with soft money, FEC’s allocation regime\n“subverted” original FECA scheme); id. at 167 (FECA\nscheme “eroded” by FEC’s allocation regime); see also id. at\n142 n.44.22\n\n\n    22\n          The concurrence finds “perplexing[]” our reading of\nMcConnell’s statutory discussion. Concurring Op. at 10. We think\nit’s straightforward. McConnell said the statutory phrase “for the\npurpose of influencing” federal elections covers generic activities.\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 167. That seems to foreclose any statutory\nchallenge to the new regulatory provisions applicable to generic\n\f                                  43\n\n     Under the circumstances, we have no choice but to\naddress EMILY’s List’s First Amendment argument. The\nconcurrence apparently wants us to address a statutory\nargument that EMILY’s List did not raise and then to accept\nthat statutory claim even though we find it unpersuasive and\ninconsistent with precedent. We respectfully decline the\nconcurrence’s proposal.23\n\n\n\nactivities. But that of course does not resolve EMILY’s List’s\nconstitutional challenge.\n     23\n        Even if EMILY’s List had put forward meritorious statutory\nchallenges to all of the regulatory provisions that it has challenged\nunder the First Amendment, we still would possess discretion to\nrule in the alternative on both statutory and constitutional grounds.\nThe avoidance principle cited by the concurrence is prudential, not\njurisdictional. And it is not uncommon for lower courts to rule on\nalternative statutory and constitutional grounds when appropriate.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Thomas, No. 07-3080, 2009 WL\n2152429, *3-5 (D.C. Cir. July 21, 2009); Time Warner Entm’t Co.,\nL.P. v. FCC, 240 F.3d 1126, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 2001); see generally\nRichard H. Fallon, Jr. & Daniel J. Meltzer, New Law, Non-\nRetroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 HARV. L. REV.\n1731, 1801 (1991) (“Simply as a routine matter, the Supreme\nCourt, in common with the lower federal courts, may choose to\ndiscuss either or both of alternative grounds for reaching a\ndecision.”).\n     Given that the complaint in this case was filed four and a half\nyears ago, that the parties and the District Court overwhelmingly\nfocused their attention on the constitutional issue, that resolution of\nthe case only on statutory grounds would not alleviate the\ncontinuing legal uncertainty, and that this is an area of law\ndemanding prompt and clear judicial decisionmaking, it would not\nbe an inappropriate exercise of judicial discretion for an\nintermediate court to resolve this case on alternative constitutional\nand statutory grounds.\n\f                                44\n\n                              ***\n\n     The FEC rules challenged by EMILY’s List –\n§§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 – violate the First\nAmendment. Sections 106.6(f) and 100.57 also exceed the\nFEC’s authority under the Federal Election Campaign Act, as\ndoes the provision of § 106.6(c) that applies to administrative\nexpenses. The FEC may not enforce §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), or\n100.57. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and\ndirect it to enter judgment for EMILY’s List and to vacate the\nchallenged regulations.\n\n                                                      So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     In any event, we need not cross that discretionary bridge here\nbecause, as we have explained, we must address the Constitution’s\napplication to non-profits’ election-related spending and\nfundraising in order to resolve the appeal.\n\f     BROWN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part: “If there is\none doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process\nof constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass\non questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication\nis unavoidable.” Spector Motor Serv., Inc. v. McLaughlin,\n323 U.S. 101, 105 (1944). “Thus, if a case can be decided on\neither of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question,\nthe other a question of statutory construction or general law,\nthe Court will decide only the latter.” Ashwander v. TVA, 297\nU.S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Because\nthese regulations must be vacated as contrary to the statute,\nwe need not and should not reach the First Amendment issue.\nBut if we’re going to answer an unnecessary constitutional\nquestion, we at least ought to get it right. In light of\nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), I have grave doubts\nabout the court’s analysis, which bears at most a passing\nresemblance to the parties’ briefs, and which will profoundly\naffect campaign finance law in this circuit. I thus respectfully\nconcur only with Part IV of the court’s opinion, except for\nfootnotes 17, 18 and 20.\n\n                               I.\n\n                              A.\n\n     Though I do not join their First Amendment holding, I\nagree with my colleagues’ conclusion that we must vacate the\nregulations challenged here (the Multiple Candidate\nAllocation Regulation, 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f); the Solicitation\nRegulation, 11 C.F.R. § 100.57; and the Administrative Costs\nAllocation Regulation, 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c)). I begin with\nfirst principles. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is\nan agency within the Executive Branch. The Executive\nBranch cannot make law, but instead executes laws enacted\nby the Legislative Branch. In executing the law, the FEC may\nissue “necessary” rules, 2 U.S.C. § 437d(a)(8), but, as with all\nagencies, the FEC acts contrary to law if it promulgates\n\f                                  2\nregulations “in excess of [its] statutory jurisdiction,” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(C). See also La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476\nU.S. 355, 374 (1986) (“[A]n agency literally has no power to\nact . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”).\n\n     By the plain language of the Federal Election Campaign\nAct (FECA), the FEC lacks the power it now asserts. To fall\nwithin FEC jurisdiction, a “gift, subscription, loan, advance,\nor deposit of money or anything of value” must be provided\nto a political committee “for the purpose of influencing any\nelection for Federal office,” 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i), and any\nmoney expended by such a committee must also have been\ndone for that same purpose, id. § 431(9)(A)(i). There is no\nother reasonable way to read Congress’s words. For the FEC\nto have any role, money must be used for the “purpose”—\ndefined as an “objective, goal, or end,” BLACK’S LAW\nDICTIONARY 1356 (9th ed. 2009)—of “influencing” an\n“election for Federal office.” The inescapable corollary is the\nFEC has no authority over money given or spent “solely for\nthe purpose of influencing state or local elections,” an activity\n“unaffected by FECA’s requirements and prohibitions.”\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 122.\n\n    Here, the FEC has set aside Congress’s command that the\nagency’s jurisdiction be bounded by the “purpose” for which\nmoney is spent. Instead of strictly minding this jurisdictional\nmarker, the FEC conclusively presumes a federal purpose\ndrives any spending that might influence a federal election.1\nThe question though is not whether spending influences a\nfederal election, but whether it was spent for that reason.\n1\n See, e.g., Political Committee Status, Definition of Contribution,\nand Allocation for Separate Segregated Funds and Nonconnected\nCommittees, 69 Fed. Reg. 68,056, 68,062 (Nov. 23, 2004) (Final\nRules) (“[R]eferences solely to a political party inherently influence\nboth Federal and non-Federal elections.”).\n\f                                  3\nOtherwise, the word “purpose” becomes superfluous, a result\nthat this court cannot accept, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,\n442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979), especially for a jurisdictional\nprovision like this one, see, e.g., N. Am. Van Lines, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 869 F.2d 596, 598 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Under FECA,\nfederal effects are simply not enough.2\n\n     Nor does labeling spending that may affect both state and\nfederal elections as “mixed-purpose” somehow solve the\nFEC’s problem. Regulating on the basis of such a label still\nassumes there must be a federal purpose behind any spending\nthat might influence, even tangentially, a federal campaign.\nBecause that necessary assumption is false, these regulations\nremain invalid. Only after a federal purpose—mixed or\notherwise—is identified does the FEC’s power come into\nplay. If a federal purpose can be shown, then allocation ratios\nlike those promulgated here may well be appropriate under\nFECA, but just asserting that there must be a federal purpose\nskips the threshold jurisdictional question.3\n2\n  Cf. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c (under the Voting Rights Act, certain\njurisdictions cannot alter their voting procedures without showing\nthe change “neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of\ndenying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color”\n(emphasis added)).\n3\n  It is also no defense to say that under Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1\n(1976), everything political committees do reflects federal\npurposes. See EMILY’s List v. FEC, 569 F. Supp. 2d 18, 44\n(D.D.C. 2008) (“EMILY’s List is undoubtedly correct that its status\nas a political committee does not automatically give the FEC\nauthority to regulate its legitimately nonfederal election\nactivities.”). In Buckley, the Court explained “[e]xpenditures of . . .\n‘political committees’ . . . can be assumed to fall within the core\narea sought to be addressed by Congress.” 424 U.S. at 79. This\n“assum[ption],” however, is rebutted when it is unreasonable to\nposit a federal purpose. See Akins v. FEC, 101 F.3d 731, 742 (D.C.\n\f                                4\n\n                               B.\n\n     These regulations give short shrift to the “purpose” of\nspending and so must be vacated. Indeed, we have already\nrejected the FEC’s view. Just fours years ago, in Shays v.\nFEC, we held FECA requires that “to qualify as ‘expenditure’\nin the first place, spending must be undertaken ‘for the\npurpose of influencing’ a federal election” and agreed with\nthe FEC that “time, place, and content may be critical indicia\nof communicative purpose.” 414 F.3d 76, 99 (D.C. Cir.\n2005). Though a federal\n\n      election-related intent is obvious . . . in statements\n      urging voters to “elect” or “defeat” a specified\n      candidate or party, the same may not be true of ads\n      identifying a federal politician but focusing on\n      pending legislation—a proposed budget, for example,\n      or government reform initiatives—and appearing three\n      years before the next election. Nor is such purpose\n      necessarily evident in statements referring, say, to a\n      Connecticut senator but running only in San Francisco\n      media markets.\n\nId.\n\n     Shays confirms what FECA says: context matters.\nReferencing a federal candidate “may” reveal a federal\npurpose, but if an ad will not be aired to her constituents or if\nit will run “years before the next election,” then absent some\npersuasive indicia of a federal purpose, a reference by itself to\n\n\nCir. 1996) (en banc) vac’d on other grounds 524 U.S. 1 (1998)\n(Buckley only “creat[es] a presumption” of a federal purpose).\n\f                                5\nthe candidate does not trigger FEC jurisdiction. This was the\nFEC’s position in Shays, and it should be the FEC’s position\nnow. FECA’s unambiguous text requires no less.\n\n     Under the Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation,\npolitical committees must use hard money for “[p]ublic\ncommunications that refer to one or more clearly identified\nFederal candidates, regardless of whether there is reference to\na political party, but do not refer to any clearly identified non-\nFederal candidates.” 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f)(1). The rule is\ncategorical. Even if a communication only says “Vote No on\nState Ballot Initiative 123—They Waste Enough Taxes in\nWashington, D.C.,” merely referring (perhaps by means of a\nmontage of grainy black-and-white photos) to United States\nSenators of both parties with a penchant for pork-barrel\nspending, the ad is per se deemed to have a federal purpose.\nThis is true even if those big spenders hail from distant states,\nare not up for reelection for years, and the spot will not be\nshown anywhere near their voters. Whether such an ad could\naffect a federal race is doubtful, but the FEC goes further and\nsays these ads always reflect a federal purpose. In an age\nwhen even pizza shops and used-car dealers invoke the\nstereotype of wasteful federal spending to sell their wares, the\nFEC’s lack of sophistication is startling.\n\n     The FEC’s approach also ignores that a state campaign\nmay be more effective if the campaigning group can mention\na federal official’s endorsement. Many federal politicians are\nof national stature, particularly those associated with hot\nbutton political issues. If, for example, a referendum would\nmake it more difficult to get an abortion, a pro-choice group\nmay trumpet a statement denouncing it from a prominent pro-\nchoice United States senator, while a pro-life group may\nrespond with a statement from an equally prominent pro-life\nsenator. To say, as the FEC does, that citing these statements\n\f                                 6\ncan only be done for the purpose of influencing federal\nelections is to pretend away the power of celebrity. Just as\nMichael J. Fox’s name might be used in commercials for a\nstem cell amendment because his association makes for\neffective politics, see Alfonso Serrano, Stem Cell Opponents\nTo Air Celebrity Ad, CBSNEWS.COM, Oct. 25, 2006,\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/25/politics/main212\n2383.shtml, an out-of-state and out-of-cycle Senator Debbie\nStabenow’s endorsement might be used to support state\ncandidates because her association makes for effective state\npolitics, particularly to targeted demographics.4\n\n     The Solicitation Regulation respects Congress’s language\nno better. The regulation declares any donation “made by any\nperson in response to any communication is a contribution to\nthe person making the communication if the communication\nindicates that any portion of the funds received will be used to\nsupport or oppose the election of a clearly identified Federal\ncandidate.” 11 C.F.R. § 100.57(a). This rule applies even if a\nsolicitation’s banner headline says only a certain percentage\nof the donation will be used for federal activities. Hence,\neven if someone gives $1000 in response to a solicitation that\nunambiguously says 90% of what is received will be spent on\nlocal elections, the FEC asserts jurisdiction over the entire\ngift. If a gift is made subject to this disclaimer, how is the full\n$1000 given for the purpose of influencing a federal election?\n\n    The Solicitation Regulation also says “[i]f the solicitation\ndoes not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal\n4\n  “[R]eferring to Senator Stabenow might well inspire recipients\noutside of her home state to contribute to her campaign, and thus\ninfluence her federal election, or might otherwise raise her national\nprofile and ultimately influence her election,” EMILY’s List, 569 F.\nSupp. 2d. at 48, but if such speculative brainstorming can satisfy\nFECA’s “purpose” requirement, there is no “purpose” requirement.\n\f                                7\ncandidates, but does refer to a political party, in addition to [a]\nclearly identified Federal candidate,” then the entire gift\nbecomes subject to the FEC’s authority, id. § 100.57(b)(1),\nand “[i]f the solicitation refers to one or more clearly\nidentified non-Federal candidates, in addition to [a] clearly\nidentified Federal candidate . . . , at least fifty percent (50%)\nof the total funds received are contributions [subject to the\nFEC], whether or not the solicitation refers to a political\nparty,” id. § 100.57(b)(2). Even if the solicitation is\nunmistakable that the entire gift will be spent on local\nelections, the FEC nonetheless still claims jurisdiction over at\nleast some of the resulting donations.\n\n     This blindingly-bright line suffers from the same flaw as\nthe Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation: it assumes\nmerely referencing a federal candidate always unmasks a\npurpose of influencing a federal election and assumes those\nwho give money in response to such a solicitation also\nunfailingly do so for the same purpose. That’s just not true.\nInstead, a federal politician’s name can be used for reasons\ntied solely to state electioneering. Again, consider an out-of-\nstate and out-of-cycle Senator Stabenow. If she were to say\n“EMILY’s List supported a Democrat like me when I was\nrunning for state office, and I’m asking you to support\nEMILY’s List now so it can continue to work on behalf of\nwomen who are seeking state office,” then under the\nSolicitation Regulation, the entire amount of any donations is\nsubject to the FEC.5 That result conflicts with Congress’s\n“purpose” requirement.\n5\n  My hypothetical is similar to one EMILY’s List posed to the FEC,\nwith the only material difference being the inclusion of a party\nlabel. While the FEC said EMILY’s List’s solicitation was fine,\nsee FEC Advisory Op. 2005-13, at 5–6 (Oct. 20, 2005), it could not\nhave said the same for mine: including “Democrat”—an important\nlabel in state politics too—causes the gift to be hard money.\n\f                                  8\n     Finally, the Administrative Costs Allocation Regulation is\ncontrary to law. Under 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c), committees\nmust use “at least 50 percent Federal funds” for\n“administrative expenses, costs of generic voter drives, and\ncosts of public communications that refer to any political\nparty.” An obvious problem is this rule applies in odd-\nnumbered years when there are no federal elections. If later\nthis November EMILY’s List were to say “vote a straight\nDemocratic ticket for the city counsel” in a broadcast in Walla\nWalla, Washington, no less than half of the cost would have\nto be expensed to a federal account, even though there is no\nfederal race to influence. The FEC is explicit: if a\ncommunication mentions a political party, then context is\nirrelevant. See FEC Advisory Op. 2005-13, at 4–5 (Oct. 20,\n2005) (the duty to “pay the costs of public communications\nthat refer to a political party with at least 50 percent Federal\nfunds does not change based on the activities of [the\ncommittee] in the particular State”).\n\n     Contrary to this regulation’s premise, moreover, certain\n“administrative expenses” do not always reflect a federal\npurpose, mixed or otherwise. A committee, for example, that\nopposes human cloning (and thus supports many different\nstate and federal candidates and laws throughout the nation)\nmay launch an outpost in a state that is considering an anti-\ncloning measure and organize a voter drive there,6 even\nthough the group has no intention of participating in any\nfederal election. By this regulation, a full half of the costs\n\n6\n  A “generic voter drive” includes “any . . . activities that urge the\ngeneral public to . . . support candidates . . . associated with a\nparticular issue, without mentioning a specific candidate.” 11\nC.F.R. § 106.6(b)(1)(iii) (emphasis added). Thus, if a committee\nsays “support candidates for the General Assembly who oppose\nhuman cloning” in an odd-numbered year, hard money is required.\n\f                                 9\nmust be expensed to the committee’s federal account. In fact,\nthe FEC would require the committee to use hard money for a\nleaflet that says “both Democrats and Republicans” endorse\nthe initiative. Such a leaflet is not “generic party advertising,”\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 123; it is an ad for a state ballot\ninitiative, not a political party, and it defies reason to say\notherwise.7 FECA does not require this absurdity.\n\n     The court says EMILY’s List has waived part of its\nstatutory claim. First, my colleagues concede EMILY’s List\nhas challenged every other subpart of these regulations, and\nagree the FEC has exceeded its statutory powers, but say\nbecause EMILY’s List only mentions “administrative\nexpenses” in one section of its brief, it waives its argument\nabout “costs of generic voter drives” and “costs of public\ncommunications that refer to any political party.” 11 C.F.R.\n§ 106.6(c). This is so even though the clauses are in the exact\nsame sentence of the exact same regulation, and even though\nthey violate the exact same section of FECA for the exact\nsame reason.        This is perplexing.       EMILY’s List\ncomprehensively says “[n]or are the regulations permitted by\nFECA. FECA was passed to regulate contributions and\nexpenditures made with ‘the purpose of influencing any\nelection for Federal office.’” EMILY’s List Br. at 17\n(emphasis added). And if there is any doubt, EMILY’s List\n\n7\n  “Generic party advertising” is not in the United States Code or the\nCode of Federal Regulations. It was used by the McConnell district\ncourt to mean, naturally, ads that support a party. See 251 F. Supp.\n2d 176, 199 (D.D.C. 2003) (per curiam) (“[N]ational parties\nexpended $14 million in nonfederal funds for ‘generic’ party\nadvertising, consisting predominantly of television advertisements\nthat did not mention candidates names, but urged viewers to simply\nvote for a particular party or stressed themes from the presidential\ncampaigns.”); id. at 654 (separate opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.)\n(“generic party advertising (that is, ‘Vote Republican!’)”).\n\f                                  10\nopens its reply brief by saying “[t]he regulations at issue in\nthis case violate the First Amendment, Chevron[], and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act.” EMILY’s List Reply Br. at 1\n(emphasis added). EMILY’s List also contends § 106.6(c)\nrequires using hard money for ads that state “both Democrats\nand Republicans” support a measure. Id. at 16. It goes\nwithout saying that EMILY’s List never argues “the\nregulations all violate FECA, except for the second and third\nclauses in the second sentence of 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c).”8\n\n     Second and even more perplexingly, in order to buttress\nits waiver argument, the same judges that read McConnell\nnarrowly as a case that “views political parties as different in\nkind than independent expenditure committees,” Maj. Op. at\n22, concludes EMILY’s List could not have successfully\nchallenged § 106.6(c)’s regulation of generic activities on\nstatutory grounds because McConnell specifically approved\nregulation of contribution and expenditure limits for these\nfunds. Id. at 41–42. If this were correct, it would mean the\nFEC can constitutionally regulate a committee like EMILY’s\nList, and the court’s constitutional analysis is critically\nundermined.\n\n\n8\n  Even if we assume EMILY’s List has inadequately raised this\nissue, waiver is a prudential doctrine—not jurisdictional. E.g.,\nMitchell v. Fishbein, 377 F.3d 157, 164–65 (2d Cir. 2004). And\nthough my colleagues are mistaken on waiver, if they were truly\nconcerned about this, we could order additional briefing. E.g., U.S.\nNat’l Bank v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 444–48\n(1993) (holding the D.C. Circuit did not err in ordering\nsupplemental briefing on a subject not raised because “when an\nissue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to\nthe particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather\nretains the independent power to identify and apply the proper\nconstruction of governing law”).\n\f                              11\n\n                              C.\n\n    No one disputes the FEC can craft bright-line rules. An\n“objective test,” Orloski v. FEC, 795 F.2d 156, 162 (D.C. Cir.\n1986), in fact, may be constitutionally required, see FEC v.\nWis. Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 467–69 (2007) (opinion\nof Roberts, C.J.). Communications calling for the election or\ndefeat of federal candidates certainly fall within the agency’s\nauthority, and the FEC may have a bit more leeway to\nregulate ads directed at federal electorates or aired during\nfederal elections.      Shays, 414 F.3d at 99.          FECA’s\nunambiguous text, however, forbids the Commission from\ndoing what it has done here: promulgating proxies for\n“purpose” that wholly ignore all relevant contextual clues.\nThe regulations consequently must be vacated as contrary to\ncongressional will.\n\n                              II.\n\n                              A.\n\n     Because this case can be decided on statutory grounds,\nwe need not reach the constitutional question, and so should\nnot reach the constitutional question. Our precedent is not\nwishy-washy: “Federal courts should not decide constitutional\nquestions unless it is necessary to do so. Before reaching a\nconstitutional question, a federal court should therefore\nconsider whether there is a nonconstitutional ground for\ndeciding the case, and if there is, dispose of the case on that\nground.” Kalka v. Hawk, 215 F.3d 90, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\nSee also Meredith Corp. v. FCC, 809 F.2d 863, 870 (D.C. Cir.\n1987); United States v. Thomas, 572 F.3d 945, 952 (D.C. Cir.\n2009) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part). My colleagues duck\nthis rule, preferring to summon the awesome power of\n\f                              12\nMarbury v. Madison. But in their eagerness to play John\nMarshall, they do not follow him. The Great Chief Justice\nhimself cautioned: “No questions can be brought before a\njudicial tribunal of greater delicacy than those which involve\nthe constitutionality of a legislative act. If they become\nindispensably necessary to the case, the court must meet and\ndecide them,” but if not, “a just respect for the legislature\nrequires, that the obligation of its laws should not be\nunnecessarily and wantonly assailed.” Ex parte Randolph, 20\nF. Cas. 242, 254 (C.C.D. Va. 1833) (No. 11,558).\n\n     The reasons to be “keenly mindful of our institutional\nrole” and “fully appreciate” the solemnity of constitutional\nadjudication are obvious. Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 2513 (2009). Meekness, for\none, compels us to recognize we are not the Constitution’s\nonly friend—each branch swears an oath to uphold it. See\nU.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 8; Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S.\n57, 64 (1981). And if we misread a statute, Congress can fix\nit; not so with the Constitution.\n\n     The court, however, is not content just answering a\ngratuitous constitutional question. Its holding is broader than\neven the plaintiff requests. Instead of arguing nonprofits have\na constitutional right to pay for ads attacking federal\ncandidates with soft money, EMILY’s List more modestly\nchallenges the regulations as the “functional equivalent of\nspending limits, prohibiting EMILY’s List from supporting\nstate and local candidates in certain ways when its federal\nfunds are exhausted” and claims they are not properly tailored\nbecause they “restrict vast amounts of nonfederal activity.”\nEMILY’s List Br. at 17 (summary of argument) (emphasis\nadded). The court holds, nonetheless, that EMILY’s List is\nconstitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of its\n\f                                13\nadvertisements out of a soft-money account, even for ads that\nattack or promote federal candidates. Maj. Op. at 28–29.9\n\n     Because EMILY’s List’s actual claims are not bold\nenough, the court sua sponte spins a more aggressive\nargument—making its waiver charge all the more curious.\nNowhere does any party refer to Justice Blackmun’s separate\nopinion in California Medical Association v. FEC, 453 U.S.\n182 (1981) (“Cal-Med”). Nor does EMILY’s List mention\nFEC v. National Conservative PAC, 470 U.S. 480 (1985)\n(“NCPAC”), FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479\nU.S. 238 (1986) (“MCFL”), or North Carolina Right to Life,\nInc. v. Leake, 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2008)—in other words,\nthe cases upon which the court’s holding depends, see, e.g.,\nMaj. Op. at 11–16, 22–23, 26.10 None of the law review\n\n9\n Consistent with its briefing, during oral argument counsel for\nEMILY’s List was more circumspect than the court is today:\n\n     The Court:       Would your position preclude say regulation\n                      of get out the vote drives, or voter\n                      registration, or that sort of thing? Do you\n                      think that would be beyond the FEC’s\n                      purview?\n\n     EMILY’s List:    No, Your Honor, we don’t take that position,\n                      we take the position that reasonable\n                      regulations to account for the federal election\n                      related impact of that activity are\n                      permissible.\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. at 9. Cf. Maj. Op. at 27 (“[N]on-profits are\nconstitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of such voter\ndrive activities out of their soft-money accounts.”).\n10\n   In fact, EMILY’s List does not mention Cal-Med until its reply\nbrief, and neither party cites Cal-Med for a proposition integral to\n\f                                14\narticles the court relies on are cited—much less discussed—\neither.11 And far from hashing out McConnell’s “footnote\n48,” id. at 23 n.13, neither party mentions it. The court today\nissues an expansive constitutional decision without the benefit\nof on-point briefing. Before deciding a complicated First\nAmendment issue, we ought to ask for the parties’ views.\n\n     In attempting to connect its decision to the parties’ views,\nthe court artfully re-imagines the “key question in this case,”\ndescribing it as whether “non-profits [are] more like\nindividual citizens (who under Buckley have the right to spend\nunlimited money . . . ) or more like political parties (which\nunder McConnell do not).” Maj. Op. at 40. The court notes\n“Cal-Med was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at\noral argument.” Id. at 41. Cal-Med was cited and discussed\nby the parties, but never to support the proposition for which\nthe court now relies on it. For instance, when asked by the\ncourt to respond to the FEC’s reliance on Cal-Med, counsel\n\nthe court’s holding. EMILY’s List does cite, once, as a “see also,”\nCitizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290\n(1981), but for a background principle. EMILY’s List Br. at 23–24.\nThe FEC cites MCFL in a footnote for an immaterial point, FEC\nBr. at 23 n.17, but does not mention NCPAC, Citizens Against Rent\nControl, or North Carolina Right to Life.\n11\n   Many of the articles do not support the court, and not one\nsquarely does. E.g., Edward B. Foley, The “Major Purpose” Test:\nDistinguishing Between Election-Focused and Issue-Focused\nGroups, 31 N. KY. L. REV. 341, 344 (2004) (“[I]n my judgment\ncontributions to political committees should be classified under the\nFirst Amendment with contributions to political parties . . . .”);\nRichard L. Hasen, Buckley is Dead, Long Live Buckley, 153 U. PA.\nL. REV. 31, 72 (2004) (explaining that because of the “considerable\ndeference” it displayed, “[l]ower courts showing fidelity to\nMcConnell will have a difficult time striking down most campaign\nfinance regulation”).\n\f                               15\nfor EMILY’s List offered this succinct critique of the court’s\nholding:\n\n   The Court:        Can you deal with [FEC’s counsel’s]\n                     response on [Cal-Med]?\n\n   EMILY’s List: Yes. I mean, Cal[-]Med is\n                 mysteriously produced here for the\n                 FEC’s position. Cal[-]Med didn’t\n                 raise any of the issues in this case.\n                 Cal[-]Med was a simple question of\n                 whether a committee that was\n                 making contributions to federal\n                 candidates had to observe a limit on\n                 contributions made to that federal\n                 program. That set a law now, that’s\n                 certainly what EMILY’s List does. I\n                 don’t think it bears at all on this\n                 invasion of our state and local\n                 programs through the promulgation\n                 of these excessive federal regulatory\n                 schemes.\n\nTr. of Oral Arg. at 32–33. How true.\n\n    But even if it were judicially proper for me to do so, and\neven if the issues were briefed, I doubt I could join the court’s\nopinion in full. This is not because I dislike its outcome.\nIndeed, I agree with what seems to be the unstated premise: if\nthe Supreme Court’s cases made any sense, the First\nAmendment would protect much more than pornography,\nprofanity, and pyrotechnics. See United States v. Playboy\nEntm’t Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803 (2000); Cohen v.\nCalifornia, 403 U.S. 15 (1971); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S.\n397 (1989). The amendment’s “purpose,” after all, is “to\n\f                               16\npreserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth\nwill ultimately prevail,” FCC v. League of Women Voters,\n468 U.S. 364, 377 (1984)—a principle that “has its fullest and\nmost urgent application to speech uttered during a campaign\nfor political office,” Eu v. S.F. County Democratic Cent.\nComm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989). If those beautifully fierce\nwords “Congress shall make no law” are to do anything but\ncondemn our constitutionalism as a failed experiment, then at\nleast political speech in all its forms should be free of\ngovernment constraint.\n\n     My colleagues’ distaste for the FEC’s handiwork is to\ntheir credit. It shows they take the First Amendment\nseriously. And they are right, of course, that if constitutional\nlaw were better acquainted with the Constitution, regulations\nsuch as these would never survive Article III scrutiny. If an\nadvertisement criticizes the President of the United States, the\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, or the Chair of the\nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations, it can be a felony\npunishable by up to five years in prison to pay for that ad\nusing money the federal government doesn’t know about or\nthat comes from sources the federal government deems to\nhave already given enough. See 2 U.S.C. § 437g(d). The\nFirst Amendment, logically construed, cannot condone such a\nweighty burden on political speech at the same time it forbids\npenalizing the production of “virtual child pornography,”\nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coal., 535 U.S. 234 (2002).\n\n     I also agree with the court that “corruption” should only\nbe understood in terms of quid pro quo—not a free-floating\nunease about money in politics. Once “corruption” is\ndisconnected from “pay to play,” Congress has carte blanche\nto stifle speech, a license that is particularly pernicious as our\noverweening government ever enlarges itself. Power—\ngovernment power—is what generates passion in politics.\n\f                              17\nMoney only measures its depth. The more power is at stake,\nthe more money will be used to shield, deflect, or co-opt it.\nSo long as the government can take and redistribute a man’s\nlivelihood, there will always be money in politics. One man’s\ncorruption is another man’s political accountability.\n\n     But there is a rub. We sit on a lower court and “must\nfollow the binding Supreme Court precedent” until the Court\nitself overrules it. We the People Found., Inc. v. United\nStates, 485 F.3d 140, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Though we do\nnot read the court above’s precedent unduly expansively, we\nalso do not drag our feet: “it is not our role to fight a rear-\nguard action” against the logical implications of the Court’s\ncases. United States v. Gardellini, 545 F.3d 1089, 1096 (D.C.\nCir. 2008). Instead, we take its holdings as we find them,\napplying them to cover all they fairly address. Stare decisis\nmeans nothing if we only are bound by those cases with\nwhich we already agree. Like it or not, we cannot ignore\nSupreme Court precedent.\n\n    Modesty is dictated by the difficulty of applying\nMcConnell’s facial generalizations to real world events. It is\nhard to say exactly how contribution limits on hybrid\ncommittees, like EMILY’s List, should be analyzed after\nMcConnell. McConnell involved a wide-ranging facial\nchallenge addressing the constitutionality of BCRA. Trying\nto extrapolate from that case to this one is risky and reason\nenough to avoid the constitutional bog. Suffice it to say that\nthe Supreme Court majority, the dissenters, and the\ncommentators all have read McConnell as a maximalist\nopinion. See 540 U.S. at 192–93 (“[O]ur decisions in Buckley\nand MCFL were specific to the statutory language before us;\nthey in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever\nfixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating\ncampaign-related speech.”); id. at 263 (Scalia, J., dissenting)\n\f                               18\n(“We have witnessed merely the second scene of Act I of\nwhat promises to be a lengthy tragedy.”); id. at 264 (Thomas,\nJ., dissenting) (“[T]he Court today upholds what can only be\ndescribed as the most significant abridgment of the freedoms\nof speech and association since the Civil War.”); id. at 294\n(Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“This new definition of corruption\nsweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path.”);\nid. at 357 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (“Today’s decision, by\nnot requiring tailored restrictions, has significantly reduced\nthe protection for political speech having little or nothing to\ndo with corruption or the appearance of corruption.”); see also\nRichard Briffault, The 527 Problem . . . and the Buckley\nProblem, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 949, 970 (2005)\n(“McConnell, however, transformed the constitutional\nlandscape.”).\n\n     In both holding and discussion, the McConnell Court\nsided with the censor, going so far as to rely on theoretical\nanticipation to uphold a speech restriction, see 540 U.S. at\n185 (upholding BCRA § 323(f), which forbids state and local\nofficeholders and candidates from using soft money to\nsupport or attack federal candidates, based on the “eminently\nreasonable prediction that . . . state and local candidates and\nofficeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-\nmoney funding of sham issue advertising”), and ending with\nan invitation for even more congressional action, id. at 224\n(“We are under no illusion that BCRA will be the last\ncongressional statement on the matter.”). This is not the\nmodus operandi of a tentative tribunal; the Court knew what it\nwas doing, and said so. After McConnell, if these regulations\nare within the FEC’s statutory power, then there is no obvious\nreason they facially violate the First Amendment.12\n\n12\n   This a facial challenge. For such claims, “exercising judicial\nrestraint . . . frees the Court not only from unnecessary\n\f                                  19\n\n     It is true McConnell upheld, against an equal protection\nchallenge, a provision of BCRA regulating political parties.\nBut regulation of political parties is not McConnell’s theme.\nThe Court broadly recognized and deferred to governmental\ninterests in preventing corruption, the appearance of\ncorruption, and circumvention of election regulations.\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 136–37, 143–45, 152–53. Arguably,\nthis expansive corruption/circumvention/conduit rationale is\nbroad enough to encompass some limits on independent\nexpenditure committees, particularly for those political\ncommittees with a self-proclaimed electoral mission. See\nBriffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. at 986–87; Hasen, 153 U.\nPA. L. REV. at 67–68. EMILY’s List is a multicandidate\npolitical committee that has as its primary purpose electing\nideologically compatible candidates, EMILY’s List Br. at 3. 13\n\npronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature\ninterpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional\napplication might be cloudy.” Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State\nRepublican Party, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190–91 (2008). As a rule, a\nlaw is facially repugnant only if it “is unconstitutional in all of its\napplications,” but there is a narrow First Amendment exception\nwhere “a law may be overturned [if] a substantial number of its\napplications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s\nplainly legitimate sweep,” id. at 1191 n.6. Those seeking this\n“strong medicine,” id., however, face a “heavy burden,”\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 207.\n13\n   In defining its mission, EMILY’s List explains that it “is\ncommitted to a three-pronged strategy to elect pro-choice\nDemocratic women: recruiting and funding viable women\ncandidates; helping them build and run effective campaign\norganizations; and mobilizing women voters to help elect\nprogressive candidates across the nation.” EMILY’s List, Our\nMission, http://emilyslist.org/about/mission/ (last visited Aug. 28,\n2009).\n\f                               20\nAs such, it supports Democratic candidates for federal office.\nSee Matthew B. Stannard, Cash is Key for Tauscher’s\nReplacement, S.F. CHRON., Aug. 24, 2009, at A1, available at\n2009 WLNR 16474721 (noting that a candidate in a federal\nprimary race “has touted the endorsement of EMILY’s List, a\nnational fundraising organization that supported [former U.S.\nRepresentative Ellen Tauscher] and backs Democratic women\nwho support abortion rights.”). Thus, EMILY’s List is much\nmore like a political party than the Sierra Club or the Society\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\n     Whether, under the high court’s current precedents,\nEMILY’s List could be regulated exactly like a political party\nis unknown. That it should not be regulated more harshly\nthan a political party seems to be the committee’s complaint\nwith the FEC regulations challenged in this court. EMILY’s\nList Br. at 39 (“Bizarrely, [the regulation] also treats nonparty\nPACs more harshly than any other type of committee, save\nnational parties and candidates themselves.”). My point is not\nthat McConnell mandates such treatment; only that nothing in\nthe opinion’s logic clearly precludes it. The court does not\nthink this is “a persuasive interpretation of McConnell.” Maj.\nOp. at 38. Perhaps the court is right. But reading the case, as\nthe court does, to sanction First Amendment immunity for all\nnon-connected nonprofits seems even more implausible.\n\n                                 B.\n\n     Precedent holds allocation and solicitation rules are\ncontribution limits. This is key, as such limits receive less\nthan “strict scrutiny,” given they “‘entail only a marginal\nrestriction upon the contributor’s ability to engage in free\ncommunication.’” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 134–35 (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 20)). The “‘overall effect’ of dollar\nlimits on contributions is [also] ‘merely to require candidates\n\f                              21\nand political committees to raise funds from a greater number\nof persons.’” Id. at 136 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 21–22).\nUnlike strict scrutiny, which requires narrow tailoring to serve\ncompelling governmental interests, a contribution limit is\n“valid [if] it satisfies the lesser demand of being closely\ndrawn to match a sufficiently important interest.” Id.\n\n     After McConnell, allocation and solicitation rules are\nsubject only to this lesser scrutiny. Facing BCRA § 323(a),\nwhich forbids national parties from soliciting and spending\nsoft money, and § 323(b), which forbids state parties from\nspending soft money on “federal election activities,” the\nCourt declined to apply strict scrutiny. 540 U.S. at 138–39.\nThe Court held “neither provision in any way limits the total\namount of money parties can spend. Rather, they simply limit\nthe source and individual amount of donations. That they do\nso by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render\nthem expenditure limitations.” Id. at 139. We instead ask\n“whether the mechanism adopted to implement the\ncontribution limit, or to prevent circumvention of that limit,\nburdens speech in a way that a direct restriction on the\ncontribution itself would not.” Id. at 138–39. Using the\nCourt’s standard, I agree with the district court that while the\nFEC’s regulations “may affect the manner in which EMILY’s\nList must fund the speech in which it chooses to engage, they\ndo not in any way limit the political speech that EMILY’s List\nmay undertake.” EMILY’s List, 569 F. Supp. 2d at 39.\n\n     The issue we confront then is whether these regulations,\nfacially, are closely drawn to match an important interest. To\nanswer, we again ought to look to McConnell. In upholding\nBCRA § 323, the Court noted the “interests that underlie\ncontribution limits—interests in preventing both the actual\ncorruption threatened by large financial contributions and the\neroding of public confidence in the electoral process through\n\f                              22\nthe appearance of corruption.” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 136.\nThe Court bluntly held these interests are “not limited . . . to\nthe elimination of cash-for-vote exchanges,” but “extend to\nthe broader threat from politicians too compliant with the\nwishes of large contributors.” Id. at 143. Congress must be\nable to “address [these] more subtle but equally dispiriting\nforms of corruption” by “remov[ing] the temptation” of “large\nfinancial contributions.” Id. at 153. To combat “cynical\nassumption[s],” Congress can “regulate the appearance of\nundue influence,” with “undue influence” defined as “a sense\nof obligation” or “grat[itude],” id. at 144–45. Importantly,\nCongress also has an interest in preventing the circumvention\nof these limits—and so can use broad prophylaxes—because\n“candidates, donors, and parties test the limits of the current\nlaw.” Id. at 144. In sum, McConnell defines the “interest” so\nbroadly it is hard to imagine regulations that are not properly\ndrawn to it. See id. at 356–57 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).\n\n     Following from such an encompassing statement of the\ninterest, the McConnell Court facially upheld many onerous\nrestrictions on the use of soft money. The Court emphasized,\nfor example, that even a complete ban on soliciting nonfederal\nfunds would still “leave open ample opportunities for\nsoliciting federal funds,” and noted such restrictions “increase\nthe dissemination of information by forcing parties,\ncandidates, and officeholders to solicit from a wider array of\npotential donors.” Id. at 139–40. The Court also upheld a\nban on any use of soft money by national parties, even for\nthose “minor parties” that are unlikely to have any tangible\nelectoral success, remarking only that “a nascent or struggling\nminor party can bring an as-applied challenge if § 323(a)\nprevents it from amassing the resources necessary for\neffective advocacy.” Id. at 159. While national parties do not\nalways act on behalf of or in concert with federal candidates,\na prophylactic prohibition on any soft money spending and\n\f                              23\nsoliciting by them is facially valid, given the “close\nconnection and alignment of interests” between national\nparties and federal candidates. Id. at 155.\n\n     The Court’s discussion of national parties by itself raises\ndifficulties for the court, especially because the Court already\nseemingly has held there is a “close connection and alignment\nof interests” between committees like EMILY’s List and\nfederal candidates.       In Cal-Med, the Court sustained\ncontribution limits to multicandidate committees. Four\njustices adopted the Conference Report’s conclusion that\nthese committees may “‘appear to be separate entities\npursuing their own ends, but are actually a means for\nadvancing a candidate’s campaign,’” 453 U.S. at 199 n.18\n(plurality opinion) (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-1057, pp.\n57–58 (1976)). Justice Blackmun penned a concurring\nopinion, but did not disclaim the Conference Report or\ndisagree with the Court’s ultimate holding. In fact, he\nexpressly said “contributions to multicandidate committees\nmay be limited to $5,000 per year as a means of preventing\nevasion [of contribution limits],” though he noted in dicta that\nhis conclusion would be different if the committee “makes\nonly independent expenditures” and so does not “pose a\nperceived threat of actual or potential corruption.” Id. at 203\n(opinion of Blackmun, J.) (emphasis added). If Congress can\nforbid all allocation and solicitation of soft money by national\nparties, how is it unconstitutional to forbid only some\nallocation and solicitation of soft money by multicandidate\ncommittees that are also closely aligned with federal\ncandidates?\n\n     The court disputes this reading of Cal-Med, claiming\nthere are not just two types of political committees (ones that\nonly make independent expenditures, and all others), but\nactually three: (1) those that only make independent\n\f                                   24\nexpenditures; (2) those that only contribute to candidates; and\n(3) those that make independent expenditures and contribute\nto candidates. Such political committees are, in the court’s\nview, entitled to raise and spend “unlimited money” for\nadvertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration\ndrives. Maj. Op. at 26. If these hybrid committees contribute\nto federal candidates, they must use hard money, says the\ncourt, but all other spending can be with soft money.\n\n     This novel argument is not without considerable charm,\nbut one must read Cal-Med with a squint to see that holding.14\nThere is no indication in Cal-Med that the committee did not\nmake independent expenditures, but the Court still sustained\nthe statute, without announcing the distinction the court draws\ntoday. The Court has consistently cited Cal-Med for the\nunqualified proposition that it is constitutional to limit\ncontributions to multicandidate committees. See, e.g., FEC v.\n\n14\n    The court relies heavily on Justice Blackmun’s concurring\nopinion in Cal-Med, arguing that it is controlling. But the opinion\nis controlling, if at all, only for “points that can be said to be fairly\nsubsumed within the reasoning of the plurality.” John C. Eastman,\nStrictly Scrutinizing Campaign Finance Restrictions (and the\nCourts that Judge Them), 50 CATH. U. L. REV. 13, 37 (2000); see\nMarks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977). This circuit has\nclarified it is only the narrowest opinion’s overlap with the broader\nopinion that counts. “Marks is workable—one opinion can be\nmeaningfully regarded as ‘narrower’ than another—only when one\nopinion is a logical subset of other, broader opinions. In essence,\nthe narrowest opinion must represent a common denominator of the\nCourt’s reasoning; it must embody a position implicitly approved\nby at least five Justices who support the judgment.” King v.\nPalmer, 950 F.2d 771, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (en banc). Presumably\nthen, the controlling part of Justice Blackmun’s opinion is the\nholding that the FEC may constitutionally regulate contributions to\nfund independent political expenditures without contravening the\nFirst Amendment—no more and no less.\n\f                              25\nColorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431,\n441–42 (2001); FEC v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 513 U.S.\n88, 97 (1994). See also Buckley, 424 U.S. at 38.\n\n    The infamous “footnote 48 of the McConnell opinion,”\nMaj. Op. at 23 n.13, also flatly contradicts the court:\n\n   Justice KENNEDY’s contention that Buckley limits\n   Congress to regulating contributions to a candidate\n   ignores Buckley itself. There, we upheld FECA’s\n   $25,000 limit on aggregate yearly contributions to\n   candidates, political committees, and party committees\n   out of recognition that FECA’s $1,000 limit on\n   candidate contributions would be meaningless if\n   individuals could instead make “huge contributions to\n   the candidate’s political party.” Likewise, in [Cal-\n   Med], we upheld FECA’s $5,000 limit on\n   contributions to multicandidate political committees.\n   It is no answer to say that such limits were justified as\n   a means of preventing individuals from using parties\n   and political committees as pass-throughs to\n   circumvent FECA’s $1,000 limit on individual\n   contributions to candidates. Given FECA’s definition\n   of “contribution,” the $5,000 and $25,000 limits\n   restricted not only the source and amount of funds\n   available to parties and political committees to make\n   candidate contributions, but also the source and\n   amount of funds available to engage in express\n   advocacy and numerous other noncoordinated\n   expenditures. If indeed the First Amendment\n   prohibited Congress from regulating contributions to\n   fund the latter, the otherwise-easy-to-remedy\n   exploitation of parties as pass-throughs (e.g., a strict\n   limit on donations that could be used to fund candidate\n\f                               26\n   contributions) would have provided insufficient\n   justification for such overbroad legislation.\n\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 152 n.48.\n\n      That the Court may have created a doctrinal anomaly\nmight suggest, as the court argues, see Maj. Op. at 23 n.13,\nthat it could not possibly have meant what it said, but that is a\nhard argument to make. Often cases are in tension as doctrine\nworks itself pure. Our duty as an intermediate court is not to\ntell the Court what it ought to have said, but to abide by what\nit did say.\n\n     But even leaving aside its treatment of national parties,\nMcConnell further undermines the court. Recognizing the\ndynamic—indeed, Sisyphean—character of campaign finance\nlaw, the Court noted “[m]oney, like water, will always find an\noutlet.” 540 U.S. at 224. Upon realizing structural forces\ninherent in a republic inevitably create incentives for those\nsubject to regulation to petition for relief and to campaign\nagainst those who are disinclined to grant it, the Court did not\nretreat to a more manageable and less burdensome “quid pro\nquo” standard. Id. at 296 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Instead,\nafter upholding § 323(a), the Court emphasized money would\nnow “corrupt” federal races by other, more subtle routes, so\nCongress, in anticipation of this new corruption, can enact\nbroad anti-circumvention measures. E.g., id. at 165–66.\nIndeed, without pointing to any evidence that local officials\n(e.g., county assessors) are connected to federal candidates\n(e.g., for President of the United States) or have been used to\ncircumvent the law, the Court held Congress prophylactically\ncan regulate them without facially offending the Constitution.\nSee id. at 184–85. If the First Amendment is flexible enough\nto allow regulating local officials because contributions might\nflow through them to federal candidates, then why can’t the\n\f                                27\nFEC also make an “eminently reasonable prediction” that\ncommittees like EMILY’s List—which actually do campaign\nfor candidates and give them money15—will be the next route\nfor corruption, and regulate accordingly? Id. at 185.\n\n     The court sidesteps McConnell by saying EMILY’s List\nis a nonprofit, not a political party, and so has more\nconstitutional rights.16 But EMILY’s List is not just a\nnonprofit; it is a multicandidate political committee that\ncampaigns for and contributes money to federal candidates.\nIn upholding § 323 in full, including § 323(f), McConnell\nblessed restrictions on local officeholders, who are not, of\ncourse, political parties. The rule then cannot be that parties\nand federal candidates are in one column, and everyone else is\nin another, because that does not explain McConnell. Instead,\nthere is a spectrum, N.C. Right to Life, 525 F.3d at 291, so we\nshould ask not whether an entity is a nonprofit, but instead\nwhere it falls on the spectrum. Specifically, is EMILY’s List\nmore or less likely than a local official to act as a conduit to\nfederal candidates? “Common sense” says such committees\n\n15\n   Britt Cocanour, EMILY’s List Chief of Staff, avowed her\ncommittee “has helped to elect sixty-eight Democratic women to\nCongress, thirteen to the U.S. Senate, eight to governorships, and\nover 350 to other state and local offices.” Joint Appendix at 70.\n16\n   The court suggests McConnell guarantees “‘interest groups’” the\nright “‘to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV\nactivities, mailings,’ and advertising.” Maj. Op. at 22 (quoting 540\nU.S. at 187). But McConnell only notes BCRA can treat interest\ngroups differently than parties without violating Due Process. See\n540 U.S. at 188. There is a difference between noting Congress has\nnot regulated and holding Congress cannot regulate. See N.C. Right\nto Life, 525 F.3d at 333–34 (Michael, J., dissenting) (discussing\nMcConnell’s reference to “interest groups”).\n\f                                28\nare the more natural path to “corruption,” McConnell, 540\nU.S. at 297 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), but if my colleagues are\ncorrect, Congress cannot regulate them the same way it\nregulates county directors of animal control.17 Precedent is\nplain: local officials must use hard money to attack federal\ncandidates, see id. at 184–85, but as the court now resolves\nthis case, multicandidate political committees cannot be so\nlimited. Can that be right?\n\n     The court’s opinion is boldly creative, and will, if\nfollowed, have profound results on campaign finance\nregulation. This case means:\n\n     1. Multicandidate political committees can spend\n        unlimited amounts of soft money to run ads attacking\n        or supporting federal candidates and political parties.\n     2. These committees can spend unlimited amounts of\n        soft money on get-out-the-vote activities that support\n        federal candidates and political parties.\n     3. These committees can solicit soft money by saying:\n        “Just like you, we want [federal candidate] to win.\n        You have already donated all the law allows to\n        [federal candidate], but there is no limit on how much\n        you can give to us to support [federal candidate].”\n     4. Congress can do nothing about any of this.\n\nThese results are in tension—perhaps irreconcilable tension—\nwith McConnell.\n\n\n\n\n17\n  Though these regulations go further than BCRA § 323(f), by the\ncourt’s opinion, it would not matter if they were exactly the same:\nnonprofits are categorically distinct. See Maj. Op. at 22.\n\f                              29\n\n                              C.\n\n    Recall how the Court in McConnell concluded its opinion:\n“‘To say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate\nlegislation to safeguard an election from the improper use of\nmoney to influence the result is to deny the nation in a vital\nparticular the power of self protection.’” 540 U.S. at 223–24\n(quoting Burroughs v. United States, 290 U.S. 534, 545\n(1934)). This “conviction” compelled the Court to uphold\n“Congress’s most recent effort to confine the ill effects of\naggregated wealth on our political system” by\n“control[ing]. . . soft money.” Id. at 224. But the Court was\n“under no illusion that BCRA will be the last congressional\nstatement on the matter”—“[m]oney, like water, will always\nfind an outlet.” Id.\n\n    While I have argued courts should not unnecessarily assail\nlegislative acts, political speech is the core of what the First\nAmendment protects. From Buckley to McConnell the Court\nhas relied on an ad hoc empiricism ill-suited to the complex\ninteractions of democratic politics. The government has\nunlimited resources, public and private, for touting its policy\nagenda. Those on the outside—whether voices of opposition,\nencouragement, or innovation—must rely on private wealth to\nmake their voices heard.          An increasingly anomalous\ncampaign finance jurisprudence only impoverishes this\nessential debate. McConnell’s careless invocation of access\nand influence (two integral aspects of political participation)\nas synonyms for corruption is instructive. Such an expansive,\nself-referential, and amorphous definition of corruption,\ncoupled with lax standards of scrutiny and a willingness to\naccept as “evidence” any plausible theory of corruption or\nclaim of circumvention, is likely to doom any argument for\nprotection of core political speech. Someday the Supreme\n\f                              30\nCourt may be persuaded to reconsider this approach. But that\ncannot be our task.\n\n                             ***\n\n     This should have been a straightforward application of\nadministrative law, not unlike countless agency cases decided\nby this circuit every year. Congress has enacted a statute; the\nagency has violated it; the rules must be vacated; done. I\nwould enforce the statute as written and call it a day. A good\nrule of thumb is we often do more for the law when we do\nless with the law. Per that rule, I concur only in part with the\ncourt’s opinion.\n\f",

It challenges several new Federal Election Commission regulations that restrict how non-profits may spend and raise money to advance their preferred policy positions and candidates. EMILY's List argues that the regulations violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, protects the right of individual citizens to spend unlimited amounts to express their views about policy issues and candidates for public office. Similarly, the First Amendment, as the Court has construed it, safeguards the right of citizens to band together and pool their resources as an unincorporated group or non-profit organization in order to express their views about policy issues and candidates for public office. We agree with EMILY's List that the new FEC regulations contravene those principles and violate the First Amendment. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and direct it to enter judgment for EMILY's List and to vacate the challenged regulations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In the wake of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the Supreme Court's 2003 decision in <i>McConnell v. FEC</i><i>,</i> the election season of 2004 erupted with bitter accusations about the activities of certain non-profit entities. The controversy was popularly known by a single term\"527s\"that refers to the section of the tax code applicable to nonprofits engaged in political activities. The debate arose after wealthy individuals contributed huge sums of money to nonprofits ranging from America Coming Together to MoveOn.org to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in order to support advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. In total during the 2004 campaign, these groups reportedly spent several hundred million dollars.</p>\n<p>As the campaign unfolded, many in both major partiesincluding President Bush and Senator Kerryquestioned the activities of certain non-profits. Some encouraged the FEC to ban large donations to non-profit entities in the same way that Congress in BCRA had banned large contributions to political parties. Proponents of additional regulation reasoned that non-profits had replaced political parties as the soft-money \"loophole\" in the campaign finance system. <i>See</i> Edward B. Foley &amp; Donald Tobin, <i>The New Loophole?: 527s, Political Committees, and McCain-Feingold,</i> BNA MONEY &amp; POL. REP., Jan. 7, 2004.</p>\n<p>In response, the FEC did not <i>ban</i> non-profits from receiving and spending large donations, as some had urged. But the FEC did <i>limit</i> how much non-profits such as EMILY's List could raise and spend. The FEC achieved this objective by dictating that covered non-profits pay for a large percentage of election-related activities out of their hard-money accounts. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. §§ 106.6(c), (f).<sup>[1]</sup> Because donations to those hard-money accounts are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> capped at $5000 annually for individual contributors, the FEC's allocation regulations substantially restrict the ability of non-profits to spend money for election-related activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. The regulations separately require that donations to non-profits be considered hard money subject to the $5000 cap if the corresponding solicitation indicated that donations would be used to support the election or defeat of a federal candidate. <i>See id.</i> § 100.57.</p>\n<p>In early 2005, EMILY's List filed suit, arguing that the new regulations violated the First Amendment and the Federal Election Campaign Act. In 2008, the District Court upheld the regulations in their entirety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>To assess the constitutionality of the new FEC regulations, we initially must address at some length the relevant First Amendment principles set forth by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law .. . abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. This guarantee \"has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.\" <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 15, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Amendment \"protects political association as well as political expression.\" <i>Id.</i>; <i>see also </i><i>NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,</i> 357 U.S. 449, 460, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958).</p>\n<p>In analyzing the interaction of the First Amendment and campaign finance laws, the Court has articulated several overarching principles of relevance here.</p>\n<p><i>First,</i> the Court has held that campaign contributions and expenditures constitute \"speech\" within the protection of the First Amendment. In <i>Buckley,</i> the foundational case, the Court definitively ruled that \"contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities.\" 424 U.S. at 14, 96 S.Ct. 612. The Court has never strayed from that cardinal tenet, notwithstanding some passionate objections. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Nixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov't PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 398, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (Stevens, J., concurring) (\"Money is property; it is not speech.\"); J. Skelly Wright, <i>Politics and the Constitution: Is Money Speech?,</i> 85 YALE L.J. 1001 (1976).</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> the Court has ruled that the Government cannot limit campaign contributions and expenditures to achieve \"equalization\"that is, it cannot restrict the speech of some so that others might have equal voice or influence in the electoral process. In perhaps the most important sentence in the Court's entire campaign finance jurisprudence, <i>Buckley</i> stated: \"[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" 424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612. The Court added that the Government's interest in \"equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections\" does not justify regulation. <i>Id.</i> at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>In <i>Davis v. FEC</i><i>,</i> the Court strongly reiterated that \"equalization\" is not a \"legitimate government objective.\" ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2773, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). The <i>Davis</i> Court approvingly quoted Justice Kennedy's observation in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> <i>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce</i> that \"the notion that the government has a legitimate interest in restricting the quantity of speech to equalize the relative influence of speakers on elections\" is \"antithetical to the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce,</i> 494 U.S. 652, 684, 110 S.Ct. 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 652 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"This illiberal free-speech principle of `one man, one minute' was proposed and soundly rejected in <i>Buckley</i>\").<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> the Court has recognized a strong governmental interest in combating corruption and the appearance thereof. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 45-48, 96 S.Ct. 612; <i>see also </i><i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 154, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). This, indeed, is the only interest the Court thus far has recognized as justifying campaign finance regulation. <i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2773 (\"Preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Importantly, the Court has emphasized that the anti-corruption rationale is not boundless. The core corruption that Government may permissibly target with campaign finance regulation \"is the financial <i>quid pro quo:</i> dollars for political favors.\" <i>FEC v. Nat'l Conservative PAC (NCPAC),</i> 470 U.S. 480, 497, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985). This anticorruption interest is implicated by contributions to <i>candidates:</i> \"To the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <i>quid pro quo</i> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. 612; <i>see also </i><i>Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley,</i> 454 U.S. 290, 296-97, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981) <i>(\"Buckley</i> identified a single narrow exception to the rule that limits on political activity were contrary to the First Amendment\"; the exception relates \"to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a <i>candidate</i>\"). Based on the close relationship between candidates and parties and record evidence demonstrating that political parties sold access to candidates in exchange for contributions, the Court has held that the anti-corruption interest also justifies limits on contributions to <i>parties. See </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 154, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>see also </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 38, 96 S.Ct. 612.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Fourth,</i> in applying the anti-corruption rationale, the Court has afforded stronger protection to <i>expenditures</i> by citizens and groups (for example, for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration activities) than it has provided to their <i>contributions</i> to candidates or parties. The Court has explained that contributions to a candidate or party pose a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> greater risk of <i>quid pro quo</i> corruption than do expenditures. <i>See </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 46-47, 96 S.Ct. 612. At the same time, the Court has stated that limits on contributions to candidates or parties pose only a \"marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20-21, 96 S.Ct. 612. By contrast, expenditure restrictions limit \"political expression at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms.\" <i>Id.</i> at 39, 96 S.Ct. 612 (internal quotation marks omitted). A \"restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Id.</i> at 19, 96 S.Ct. 612. The Court's jurisprudence, in short, reflects a \"fundamental constitutional difference between money <i>spent</i> to advertise one's views independently of the candidate's campaign and money <i>contributed</i> to the candidate to be spent on his campaign.\" <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 497, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (emphases added); <i>see also </i><i>Randall v. Sorrell,</i> 548 U.S. 230, 241-42, 126 S.Ct. 2479, 165 L.Ed.2d 482 (2006).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In maintaining this line between (i) contributions to candidates or parties and (ii) expenditures, the Court has acknowledged that a citizen's or group's large expenditure for example, in financing advertisements or get-out-the-vote activitiesmay confer some benefit on a candidate and thereby give influence to the spender. But the Court nonetheless has consistently dismissed the notion that expenditures implicate the anti-corruption interest. <i>See </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 47, 96 S.Ct. 612 (expenditures not \"a <i>quid pro quo</i> for improper commitments from the candidate\"); <i>see also </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 153, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"mere political favoritism or opportunity for influence alone is insufficient to justify regulation\"); <i>id.</i> at 156-57 n. 51, 124 S.Ct. 619 (Congress could not regulate talk show hosts or newspaper editors \"on the sole basis that their activities conferred a <i>benefit</i> on the candidate\"); <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 498, 105 S.Ct. 1459 (\"exchange of political favors for uncoordinated expenditures remains a hypothetical possibility and nothing more\").</p>\n<p><i>Fifth,</i> the Court has been somewhat more tolerant of regulation of for-profit corporations and labor unions. The Court has permitted statutory limits on contributions that for-profit corporations and unions make from their general treasuries to candidates and parties.<sup>[5]</sup> More controversially, the Court has carved out a significant exception to <i>Buckley's</i> holding on expenditures: The Court has upheld laws that prohibit for-profit corporations and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> unions from making expenditures for activities expressly advocating the election or defeat of a federal candidate. The Court has permitted those expenditure limits on the ground that they restrain the \"corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.\" <i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S. at 660, 110 S.Ct. 1391; <i>see also McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 204-05, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>but see </i><i>First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 776-77, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978); <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>To sum up so far: In reconciling the competing interests, the Supreme Court has generally approved statutory limits on <i>contributions</i> to candidates and political parties as consistent with the First Amendment. The Court has rejected <i>expenditure</i> limits on individuals, groups, candidates, and parties, even though expenditures may confer benefits on candidates. And the Court has upheld limits on for-profit corporations' and unions' use of their general treasury funds to make campaign contributions to candidates or political parties or to make expenditures for activities expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>This case does not involve regulation of candidates, parties, or for-profit corporations. Rather, this case concerns the FEC's regulation of <i>non-profit entities</i> that are not connected to a candidate, party, or for-profit corporation. We thus must consider how the constitutional principles outlined above apply to non-profitsand in particular to three different kinds of non-profits: (i) those that only make expenditures; (ii) those that only make contributions to candidates or parties; and (iii) those that do both. For purposes of the First Amendment analysis, the central issue turns out to be whether independent non-profits are treated like individual citizens (who under <i>Buckley</i> have the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates) or like political parties (which under <i>McConnell</i> do not have the right to raise and spend unlimited soft money).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The first relevant category of non-profit entities consists of those that only make expenditures for political activities such as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. Non-profits in this category make no contributions to federal candidates or parties.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's case law establishes that those nonprofit entities, like individual citizens, are constitutionally entitled to raise and spend unlimited money in support of candidates for elected officewith the narrow exception that, under <i>Austin,</i> the Government may restrict to some degree how non-profits spend donations received from the general treasuries of for-profit corporations or unions. <i>See </i><i>Cal. Med. Ass'n v. FEC,</i> 453 U.S. 182, 202-03, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981) (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <i>see also </i><i>FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL),</i> 479 U.S. 238, 259-65, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986); <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> 454 U.S. at 296-99, 102 S.Ct. 434; <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 47, 96 S.Ct. 612; <i>N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake,</i> 525 F.3d 274, 292-93 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Those principles were initially articulated in <i>Cal-Med.</i> There, Justice Blackmun determined that \"contributions to political committees can be limited only if those contributions implicate the governmental interest in preventing actual or potential corruption, and if the limitation is no broader than necessary to achieve that interest.\" <i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.). Applying that standard, he found that \"contributions to a committee that makes only independent expenditures pose no such threat\" of \"actual or potential corruption.\" <i>Id.</i> \"By pooling their resources, adherents of an association amplify their own voices; the association is but the medium through which its individual members seek to make more effective the expression of their own views.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Blackmun thus concluded that Government may not limit contributions to a non-profit that only makes expenditures.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court reinforced those principles a year later in <i>Citizens Against Rent Control.</i> There, the Court struck down limits on donations to a non-profit committee seeking to defeat a ballot measure. <i>See </i><i>Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> 454 U.S. at 296-99, 102 S.Ct. 434. Building on the established right of individuals to make unlimited expenditures, the Court stated that there are \"of course, some activities, legal if engaged in by one, yet illegal if performed in concert with others, but political expression is not one of them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 296, 102 S.Ct. 434. The Court further reasoned: \"Placing limits on contributions which in turn limit expenditures plainly impairs freedom of expression.\" <i>Id.</i> at 299, 102 S.Ct. 434. In the Court's words, to place \"a Spartan limitor indeed any limiton individuals wishing to band together to advance their views on a ballot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> measure, while placing none on individuals acting alone, is clearly a restraint on the right of association.\" <i>Id.</i> at 296, 102 S.Ct. 434.</p>\n<p>In <i>NCPAC,</i> the Court reiterated that the Government may not limit the spending of non-profits. The Court invalidated a law that restricted a group's expenditures in support of a candidate who had accepted public financing. <i>See NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459. The Court stated that citizens' \"collective action in pooling their resources to amplify their voices\" is \"entitled to full First Amendment protection....\" <i>Id.</i> at 495, 105 S.Ct. 1459.</p>\n<p>In <i>MCFL,</i> the Court again underscored that non-profit advocacy groups are generally entitled to raise and spend unlimited money on elections. The Court invalidated an expenditure limit imposed on a non-profit corporation that had distributed a newsletter promoting pro-life candidates. The Court noted that individuals \"contribute to a political organization in part because they regard such a contribution as a more effective means of advocacy than spending the money under their own personal direction.\" <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. at 261, 107 S.Ct. 616. The Court added that \"[v]oluntary political associations do not suddenly present the specter of corruption merely by assuming the corporate form.\" <i>Id.</i> at 263, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>see also </i><i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S. at 701, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) <i>(MCFL</i> held that \"a nonprofit corporation engaged in political discussion of candidates and elections has the full protection of the First Amendment\"). Adhering to <i>MCFL,</i> the <i>McConnell</i> Court ruled that BCRA's ban on certain electioneering communications could not validly be applied to non-profit corporations. <i>See McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 210-11, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>The principles set forth in <i>Cal-Med, Citizens Against Rent Control, NCPAC,</i> and <i>MCFL</i> are rooted in the Court's consistent holdings beginning with <i>Buckley</i> that individual citizens may spend money without limit (apart from the limit on their own contributions to candidates or parties) in support of the election of particular candidates. After all, if one person is constitutionally entitled to spend $1 million to run advertisements supporting a candidate (as <i>Buckley</i> held), it logically follows that 100 people are constitutionally entitled to donate $10,000 each to a non-profit group that will run advertisements supporting a candidate.<sup>[9]</sup> Put another way: \"If the First Amendment prohibits any limitation on how much money an independent political committee can spend on an independent-expenditure campaign, how can it permit limits on donations to committees that make only independent expenditures?\" Richard Briffault, <i>The 527 Problem and the</i> Buckley <i>Problem,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 949, 982 (2005); <i>see also</i> Edward B. Foley, <i>The \"Major Purpose\" Test: Distinguishing Between Election-Focused and Issue-Focused Groups,</i> 31 N. KY. L.REV. 341, 343 (2004) (stating \"baseline proposition that it would be unconstitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> to limit the contributions that individuals may give to ideological groups to be used for electoral purposes\"); Note, <i>The Unconstitutionality of Limitations on Contributions to Political Committees in the 1976 Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments,</i> 86 YALE L.J. 953 (1977).</p>\n<p>These Supreme Court decisions reflect, moreover, the commonsense proposition that regulation of non-profits does not fit within the anti-corruption rationale, which constitutes the sole basis for regulating campaign contributions and expenditures. <i>See </i><i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2773. As the Court has explained the anti-corruption principle, mere <i>donations</i> to non-profit groups cannot corrupt candidates and officeholders. In the words of the Fourth Circuit, it is \"implausible that contributions to independent expenditure political committees are corrupting.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 293 (internal quotation marks omitted). And to the extent a non-profit then <i>spends</i> its donations on activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives, those expenditures are not considered corrupting, even though they may generate gratitude from and influence with officeholders and candidates. Rather, under <i>Buckley,</i> those expenditures are constitutionally protected. Therefore, limiting donations to and spending by non-profits in order to prevent corruption of candidates and officeholders represents a kind of \"prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis\" regulation to which the Supreme Court has emphatically stated, \"Enough is enough.\" <i>FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL),</i> 551 U.S. 449, 478-79, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (controlling opinion of Roberts, C.J.).</p>\n<p>Writing for the Fourth Circuit, Judge Wilkinson recently summarized the relevant Supreme Court precedents, concluding that \"the Court has <i>never</i> held that it is constitutional to apply contribution limits to political committees that make solely independent expenditures.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 292. Those non-profit groups receive full First Amendment protection and are entitled to receive donations and make expenditures because they \"offer an opportunity for ordinary citizens to band together to speak on the issue or issues most important to them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 295. We agree with Judge Wilkinson's assessment of the state of the law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>The second relevant category of non-profits consists of those that only make contributions to federal candidates or political parties and make no expenditures. Given the constitutionally permissible caps on an individual donor's contributions to candidates or parties, the Supreme Court has acknowledged the risk that individuals might use non-profits to evade those limits. In order to prevent circumvention of limits on an individual donor's contributions to candidates and parties, the Court has held that non-profit entities can be required to make their own contributions to candidates and parties, as well as pay associated administrative expenses, out of a hard-money account that is subject to source and amount restrictions. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 198-99, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Marshall, J.); <i>id.</i> at 203-04, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.). As a majority of the Court pointed out in <i>Cal-Med,</i> doing so prevents non-profits from being used as \"conduits\" for illegal contributions to parties and candidates and thus prevents \"evasion of the limitations on contributions\" to a candidate. <i>Id.</i> at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <i>see also id.</i> at 198, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Marshall, J.) (limit on donations to non-profit prevents evasion of \"$1,000 limit on contributions to candidates ... by channeling <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> funds\" through the non-profit); <i>Cal. Med. Ass'n v. FEC,</i> 641 F.2d 619, 625 (9th Cir. 1980) (Kennedy, J.) (non-profit committee is \"natural conduit for candidate contributions and ... the essential purpose of the provision here in question <i>is to limit those contributions, not to limit expenditures for any other type of political advocacy\")</i> (emphasis added).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Consistent with <i>Cal-Med</i>'s ruling, FECA limits contributors to donating a maximum of $5000 per year to a non-profit's hard-money account. A non-profit in turn may contribute to a candidate or party only from that hard-money account. <i>See</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C). And an individual's contribution to a non-profit's hard-money account may count against the individual's aggregate annual contribution limits. <i>See</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>What about a non-profit entity that falls into both categoriesin other words, a non-profit that makes expenditures <i>and</i> makes contributions to candidates or parties? EMILY's List is a good example of such a hybrid non-profit: It makes expenditures for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives; it also makes direct contributions to candidates and parties. In all of its activities, its mission is to promote and safeguard abortion rights and to support the election of pro-choice Democratic women to federal, state, and local offices nationwide.</p>\n<p>The constitutional principles that govern such a hybrid non-profit entity follow ineluctably from the well-established principles governing the other two categories of non-profits. To prevent circumvention of contribution limits by individual donors, non-profit entities may be required to make their own contributions to federal candidates and parties out of a hard-money accountthat is, an account subject to source and amount limitations ($5000 annually per contributor). Similarly, non-profits also may be compelled to use their hard-money accounts to pay an appropriately tailored share of administrative expenses associated with their contributions. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 198-99 n. 19, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Marshall, J.). But non-profit entities are entitled to make their expendituressuch as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drivesout of a soft-money or general treasury account that is not subject to source and amount limits. Stated another way: A non-profit that makes expenditures to support federal candidates does not suddenly forfeit its First Amendment rights when it decides also to make direct contributions to parties or candidates. Rather, it simply must ensure, to avoid circumvention of individual contribution limits by its donors, that its contributions to parties or candidates come from a hard-money account.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> C</h2>\n<p>How does <i>McConnell</i> affect the above principles governing non-profits? <i>McConnell</i> upheld congressionally imposed limits on <i>political parties</i> receiving or spending soft money. Some have argued that the Government can similarly restrict soft-money contributions to and spending by <i>nonprofits.</i> In this case, the District Court accepted that reasoning in ruling for the FEC; it found non-profits similarly situated to political parties for purposes of the First Amendment analysis.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, however, <i>McConnell</i> does not support such regulation of non-profits. <i>McConnell</i> affirmed BCRA's limits on contributions to political parties because of the close ties between candidates and parties and the extensive record evidence of what it deemed a threat of actual or apparent corruptionspecifically, the <i>access</i> to federal officials and candidates that large soft-money contributors to <i>political parties</i> received in exchange for their contributions. The Court said that it was \"not unwarranted for Congress to conclude that the selling of access gives rise to the appearance of corruption.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 154, 124 S.Ct. 619. The Court expressly based its conclusion on the \"close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship....\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Unlike the political parties examined in <i>McConnell,</i> there is no record evidence that non-profit entities have sold access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large contributions. <i>See also</i> Craig Holman, <i>The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act: Limits and Opportunities for Non-Profit Groups in Federal Elections,</i> 31 N. KY. L.REV. 243, 280 (2004) (\"Today's electioneering non-profit groups ... can make no such promises of access in exchange for a soft money contribution.\").</p>\n<p>More fundamentally, non-profit groups do not have the same inherent relationship with federal candidates and officeholders that political parties do. The <i>McConnell</i> Court identified numerous \"real-world differences between political parties and interest groups.\" 540 U.S. at 188, 124 S.Ct. 619. \"Interest groups do not select slates of candidates for elections. Interest groups do not determine who will serve on legislative committees, elect congressional leadership, or organize legislative caucuses. Political parties have influence and power in the Legislature that vastly exceeds that of any interest group. As a result, it is hardly surprising that party affiliation is the primary way by which voters identify candidates, or that parties in turn have special access to and relationships with federal officeholders.\" <i>Id.</i> As noted in <i>McConnell,</i> Congress recognized these differences and enacted a statutory scheme under which \"[i]nterest groups ... remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,\" and advertising. <i>Id.</i> at 187, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>In sum, it will not work to simply transport <i>McConnell</i>'s holding from the political party context to the non-profit setting. On this question as well, we agree with Judge Wilkinson: \"It is ... not an exaggeration to say that <i>McConnell</i> views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 293.</p>\n<p>For non-profit entities, the most pertinent Supreme Court precedents remain <i>Buckley, Cal-Med, Citizens Against Rent Control, NCPAC,</i> and <i>MCFL.</i> As discussed above, those cases ultimately stand for the proposition that non-profit groups may accept unlimited donations to their soft-money accounts. And subject to the one <i>Austin</i>-based exception, non-profit groups like individual citizensmay spend unlimited amounts out of their soft-money accounts for election-related activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> III</h2>\n<p>We now consider whether the 2004 FEC regulations at issue in this case comport with the relevant constitutional principles. They do not.</p>\n<p>The fundamental flaw, as counsel for EMILY's List succinctly stated at oral argument, is that the Commission improperly \"brought to bear what was essentially a political party analysis to a non-connected, independent committee which is not under the control of, or associated with candidates in the fashion of a political party.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. at 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The rules set forth in §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 contain five relevant provisions. In our judgment, the provisions are not closely drawn to meet an important governmental interest.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Under the Supreme Court's precedents, non-profit entities may be required to use their hard-money accounts for their own contributions to candidates and parties and for an appropriately tailored share of administrative expenses associated with such contributions. But as explained above, non-profits may not be forced to use their hard-money accounts for expenditures such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. Non-profitslike individual citizensare entitled to spend and raise unlimited money for those activities. The FEC's five new regulatory provisions flout those principles.</p>\n<p>First, the regulations require covered<sup>[15]</sup> non-profit entities to use their hard-money accounts to pay at least 50% of the costs of their generic get-out-the-vote efforts and voter registration activities. 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). By \"generic,\" the regulations mean those activities that refer to a party but do not promote or oppose a particular candidate. <i>See id.</i> § 100.25. This provision violates the First Amendment because non-profits are constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of such voter drive activities out of their soft-money accounts. <i>See </i><i>Cal. Med. Ass'n v. FEC,</i> 453 U.S. 182, 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981) (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <i>see also </i><i>FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL),</i> 479 U.S. 238, 259-63, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986); <i>FEC v. Nat'l Conservative PAC (NCPAC),</i> 470 U.S. 480, 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985); <i>Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley,</i> 454 U.S. 290, 298-99, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981); <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 45-48, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> Second, the regulations mandate that covered non-profits use their hard-money accounts for 50% of any generic communications that refer to a party without referring to a candidate, for example, \"Support the Democratic party.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). This provision likewise violates the First Amendment because non-profits are constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of such communications out of their soft-money accounts. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <i>see also MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. at 259-63, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> 454 U.S. at 298-99, 102 S.Ct. 434; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 45-48, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>Third, the regulations direct covered non-profit entities to use their hard-money accounts to pay at least 50% of all administrative expenses. 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). Those administrative expenses include rent, utilities, office supplies, and salaries, among other costs. But a non-profit may be forced to use hard money for, at most, a percentage of administrative expenses that \"closely\" corresponds to the percentage of activities relating to its contributions as compared to its advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration activities. <i>See </i><i>Davis v. FEC,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2770, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008) (campaign finance regulations must at least be \"closely drawn\" to further an important governmental interest); <i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 198-99 n. 19, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Marshall, J.) (rejecting argument that non-profit was entitled to pay its <i>\"entire\"</i> administrative expenses with unlimited donations or soft-money account) (emphasis added). The tailoring must ensure that a hybrid non-profit is not unduly advantaged as compared to a non-profit that makes only contributions (and thus must fund certain administrative expenses with hard money) and is not unduly disadvantaged as compared to a non-profit that makes only expenditures (and thus may fund its administrative expenses with soft money). Section 106.6(c) does not attempt or purport to allocate administrative expenses in that way. And the \"desire for a bright-line rule ... hardly constitutes the <i>compelling</i> state interest necessary to justify any infringement on First Amendment freedom.\" <i>FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL),</i> 551 U.S. 449, 479, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (controlling opinion of Roberts, C.J.).</p>\n<p>Fourth, the regulations compel covered non-profit entities to use their hard-money accounts to pay 100% of the costs of advertisements or other communications that \"refer\" to a federal candidate. 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f)(1). If an advertisement or communication refers to a state candidate as well as a federal candidate, the non-profit must pay for it with a percentage of its hard-money account as determined by time and space allocation. <i>See id.</i> § 106.6(f)(3). Here again, the problem is that non-profits are constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of their advertisements and other communications out of a soft-money account. <i>See MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. at 251, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> 454 U.S. at 299, 102 S.Ct. 434; <i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 45-48, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the regulations create a new regime for solicitations indicating that donated funds will be used to support or oppose the election of a clearly identified federal candidate. 11 C.F.R. § 100.57. The regulations require that donations in response to such solicitations be treated as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> 100% hard money. <i>Id.</i> § 100.57(a)-(b)(1). This means that donations in response to such solicitations are subject to a $5000 cap. If a solicitation also refers to a state or local candidate, at least 50% of the responsive donations must go to the hard-money account. <i>Id.</i> § 100.57(b)(2). This provision is badly flawed. Non-profits are entitled to raise money for their soft-money accounts to help support their preferred candidates, yet this regulation prohibits non-profits from saying as much in their solicitations. \"Such notions run afoul of the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. at 477 n. 9, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2771 (provision that requires choice between \"unfettered political speech\" and \"discriminatory fundraising limitations\" violates First Amendment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In short, the new FEC regulations do not pass muster under the Supreme Court's First Amendment precedents. The regulations are not \"closely drawn\" to serve a cognizable anticorruption interest. <i>See </i><i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2770-71; <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. at 478-80, 127 S.Ct. 2652; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 496-97, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> 454 U.S. at 296-97, 102 S.Ct. 434; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 45-48, 96 S.Ct. 612. Donations to and spending by a <i>non-profit</i> cannot corrupt a candidate or officeholder, at least in the absence of some <i>McConnell</i>-like evidence establishing such corruption or the appearance thereof. <i>See </i><i>N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake,</i> 525 F.3d 274, 292-93 (4th Cir.2008); <i>see also</i> Richard Briffault, <i>The 527 Problem and the</i> Buckley <i>Problem,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 949, 999 (2005) (\"The 527s do not fit easily within <i>Buckley's</i> anticorruption paradigm, at least as the Supreme Court has defined corruption until now.\"); Gregg D. Polsky &amp; Guy-Uriel E. Charles, <i>Regulating Section 527 Organizations,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 1000, 1027-35 (2005).</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that the regulations do not serve a cognizable anti-corruption interest is not surprising because the decision to more tightly regulate entities like EMILY's List arose out of an entirely different concern: the influence of non-profits that raise and spend large amounts of money and thereby affect federal elections. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Comments of Democracy 21, Campaign Legal Center &amp; Center for Responsive Politics in Response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, No.2004-6, at 1-2 (Apr. 5, 2004) (criticizing \"the spending of tens of millions of dollars of soft money explicitly for the purpose of influencing the presidential election by section 527 groups\"). Responding to such complaints, the FEC adopted these new regulations to tamp down spending by non-profits and thereby better equalize the voices of citizens and groups who participate in the political process. Large donations to and spending by non-profits prompted these regulations, and limiting non-profits' expenditures is their intended and predictable effect.</p>\n<p>But the Supreme Court's First Amendment cases have repeatedly repudiated this equalization rationale as a basis for regulating campaign-related contributions or expenditures. <i>See </i><i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2773; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. 612. Under current law, therefore, these regulations are unsupportable. The concern with \"large individual donations to the 527s is that they permit a tiny group of Americansthe wealthiest ...to play an enormous role in the electoral process.... <i>Buckley,</i> however, rejected the protection of political equality as a basis for limiting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> the role of money in election campaigns.\" Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. at 954 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As a lower court, we must strictly adhere to the Supreme Court's precedents. The regulations contravene the First Amendment as it has been interpreted thus far by the Supreme Court.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As some commentators point out, it might seem incongruous to permit non-profits to receive and spend large soft-money donations when political parties and candidates cannot. <i>See</i> Samuel Issacharoff &amp; Pamela S. Karlan, <i>The Hydraulics of Campaign Finance Reform,</i> 77 TEX. L.REV. 1705, 1715 (1999). But this perceived anomaly has existed to some extent since <i>Buckley,</i> which recognized that contribution limitations \"alone would not reduce the greater potential voice of affluent persons and well-financed groups, who would remain free to spend unlimited sums directly to promote candidates and policies they favor in an effort to persuade voters.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 26 n. 26, 96 S.Ct. 612. And <i>McConnell</i> similarly took note of the fact that, even after that decision upholding regulations on contributions to parties, \"[i]nterest groups ... remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,\" and advertisements. <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 187, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003).</p>\n<p>If eliminating this perceived asymmetry is deemed necessary, the constitutionally permitted legislative solution, as the Court stated in an analogous situation in <i>Davis,</i> is \"to raise or eliminate\" limits on contributions to parties or candidates. 128 S.Ct. at 2774. But it is not permissible, at least under current Supreme Court precedents, to remove the incongruity by placing these limits on spending by or donations to non-profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In addition to its First Amendment challenge to the five regulatory provisions, EMILY's List alternatively contends that three of the five provisions exceed the FEC's statutory authority. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) (agency may not act \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\"). We agree.</p>\n<p>When enacting BCRA in 2002, Congress did not authorize the FEC to restrict donations to or spending by nonprofitseven though Congress was aware that BCRA's restrictions on political parties meant that independent non-profit groups would become more influential in the electoral process. Indeed, Senator Lieberman, speaking in the Senate at the time, anticipated that \"at least some of the soft money donors who will no longer be able to give to political parties will be looking for other ways to influence our elections. Donations to 527 groups will probably top many of their lists.\" 148 CONG. REC. S10779 (daily ed. Oct. 17, 2002) (statement of Sen. Lieberman). He was right. Yet in the seven years since BCRA was enacted, Congress still has not imposed limits on non-profits, apparently because of continuing constitutional and policy concerns about regulating them in such a manner.</p>\n<p>The statutory question, therefore, is whether the FEC's authority under the long-standing Federal Election Campaign Act justifies the challenged regulations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> Under FECA, the FEC's authority extends only to regulating donations and expenditures made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i). As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[d]onations made solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections are therefore unaffected by FECA's requirements and prohibitions.\" <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 122, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003).</p>\n<p>Under FECA, in other words, the FEC possesses statutory authority to require a non-profit to use its hard-money account to pay for federal activities, generic activities, and mixed federal-state-local activities. <i>See id.</i> at 122-23, 124 S.Ct. 619.<sup>[17]</sup> But the FEC exceeds its statutory authority when it requires non-profits to use hard money for <i>exclusively</i> state and local election activities. <i>See id.</i> at 122, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (step one).</p>\n<p>The three regulatory provisions that EMILY's List challenges under FECA cross the statute's boundaries.</p>\n<p>EMILY's List targets one of the provisions in § 106.6(c) as exceeding the FEC's statutory authoritynamely, the part requiring covered non-profits to use their hard-money accounts to pay for 50% of their administrative expenses. This requirement applies even if more than 50% of a nonprofit's administrative expenses are <i>exclusively</i> associated with state and local elections. That poses a problem because the FEC possesses no authority under FECA to require nonprofits to use their hard-money accounts for their exclusively state and local election activities. We thus concur with EMILY's List that this provision is overbroad and \"federalizes the funding and reporting of a large portion of such a committee's nonfederal receipts and disbursements, which are not made for the purpose of influencing federal elections.\" EMILY's List Br. at 39.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Next, EMILY's List argues that § 106.6(f) exceeds the FEC's statutory authority. Recall that this provision requires covered non-profits to use hard money for all or part of their public communications that merely \"refer\" to federal candidates. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. 106.6(f). The FEC runs roughshod over the limits on its statutory authority when it presumes that any public communications that merely \"refer\" to a federal candidate necessarily seek to influence a <i>federal</i> election.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> For example, § 106.6(f) would compel a covered nonprofit to use some hard money to pay for an advertisement running only in California in which Senator Jones from Maine endorses Candidate Smith for Governor of California. The sole purpose of such an advertisement is to influence the state election in Californiaa matter entirely outside the FEC's statutory authority.</p>\n<p>An incident illustrating § 106.6(f)'s statutory flaws occurred in 2005. EMILY's List sought to run advertisements featuring Senator Stabenow in order to support Democratic women candidates for state legislative offices. At the time, Senator Stabenow was a candidate for reelection to the U.S. Senate in Michigan. EMILY's List represented that the communication would not be distributed in Michigan, would not reference Senator Stabenow's federal candidacy, would not solicit funds for her federal candidacy, and would not refer to any clearly identified non-federal candidate. Rather, it would support non-federal Democratic women candidates as a class. Nonetheless, the FEC determined that the mere reference to Senator Stabenow meant that EMILY's List had to pay for the communications with 100% hard money. <i>See</i> FEC Adv. Op.2005-13, at 3-4 (Oct. 20, 2005).</p>\n<p>Finally, EMILY's List argues that the solicitation rule set forth in § 100.57 also exceeds the FEC's statutory power. We agree. To reiterate, § 100.57 requires covered non-profits to treat as hard-money \"contributions\" <i>all</i> funds given in response to solicitations indicating that \"<i>any</i> portion\" of the funds received will be used to support or oppose the election of a federal candidate. 11 C.F.R. §§ 100.57(a)-(b)(1) (emphasis added). If the communication indicates that the funds will support or oppose both a federal and non-federal candidate, then at least 50% of those funds must be treated as hard money. <i>See id.</i> § 100.57(b)(2). The statutory defect in the rule is that, depending on the particular solicitation at issue, it requires covered non-profits to treat as hard money certain donations that are not actually made \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections.</p>\n<p>Consider a fundraising pitch in which a non-profit such as EMILY's List tells donors that only 10% of their gift will be used to support identified federal candidates, with the rest to <i>exclusively</i> support state and local candidates. Each donor fully and correctly understands that only a small portion of his or her gift will be used \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections. And yet, § 100.57 requires that at least 50% of donations in response to such a solicitation be classified as a hard-money donation subject to the $5000 cap thereby simultaneously creating a separate $5000 cap on soft-money donations given in response to such a solicitation. This may require a non-profit to decline or return funds it receives for purely state and local elections. That is not permissible under FECA.</p>\n<p>In short, there is a significant mismatch between these challenged provisions and the FEC's authority under FECA. Therefore, we conclude that §§ 106.6(f) and 100.57, as well as the provision in § 106.6(c) that applies to administrative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> expenses, exceed the FEC's statutory authority.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Before concluding, we add a few words regarding the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p>To begin, it is important to emphasize the area of agreement between the opinion of the Court and the concurrence. All three judges on the panel have determined that §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 are unlawful and must be vacated.</p>\n<p>The concurrence advances two main points: (i) that under <i>McConnell,</i> the Federal Government constitutionally may regulate non-profits like political parties; and (ii) that we should not address the First Amendment issue in this case. Neither argument is convincing.</p>\n<p><i>First,</i> the concurrence contends that \"regulation of political parties is not McConnell's theme,\" and it reads McConnell to support regulation not only of political parties but also of independent non-profit groups. Concurring Op. at 34. As we have explained at length above, we do not find that a persuasive interpretation of McConnell. In upholding Title I of BCRA, the McConnell Court relied heavily on the \"unity of interest,\" \"close relationship,\" and \"close ties\" among candidates, officeholders, and political parties. The concurrence identifies no similar unity of interest between non-profits, on the one hand, and candidates, officeholders, or parties on the other. The McConnell Court also based its decision on the substantial record evidence of parties selling access in exchange for soft-money contributions. The Court repeatedly emphasized that \"Congress must show concrete evidence that a particular type of financial transaction is corrupting or gives rise to the appearance of corruption.... It has done so here.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 185-86 n. 72, 124 S.Ct. 619. The concurrence cites no similar record evidence showing that non-profits sell access to officeholders and candidates in exchange for large soft-money contributions.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, \"<i>McConnell</i> views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life v. Leake,</i> 525 F.3d 274, 293 (4th Cir.2008). We therefore disagree with the concurrence's attempt to stretch <i>McConnell</i>'s reasoning from political parties to nonprofits.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> Relatedly, the concurrence disputes our reading of <i>Cal-Med. See</i> Concurring Op. at 37. But our analysis of that case, including our reliance on Justice Blackmun's opinion, tracks the persuasive reasoning of the Fourth Circuit in <i>North Carolina Right to Life,</i> of several other courts, and of numerous commentators. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 292; <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Comm. on Jobs Candidate Advocacy Fund v. Herrera,</i> No. C 07-03199, 2007 WL 2790351, *4 (N.D.Cal. Sept.20, 2007); <i>Wash. State Republican Party v. Wash. State Pub. Disclosure Comm'n,</i> 141 Wash.2d 245, 4 P.3d 808, 825 (2000); Richard Briffault, <i>The 527 Problem and the</i> Buckley <i>Problem,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 949, 982-85 (2005); John C. Eastman, <i>Strictly Scrutinizing Campaign Finance Restrictions (and the Courts that Judge Them),</i> 50 CATH. U.L. RE. 13, 37 (2000); Gregg D. Polsky &amp; Guy-Uriel E. Charles, <i>Regulating Section 527 Organizations,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 1000, 1031 (2005). Moreover, the concurrence does not substantively address the several post-<i>Cal-Med</i> cases that similarly recognize the right of non-profits to raise and spend money to support their agendas and preferred candidates. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL),</i> 479 U.S. 238, 259-65, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986); <i>FEC v. Nat'l Conservative PAC (NCPAC),</i> 470 U.S. 480, 501, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985); <i>Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley,</i> 454 U.S. 290, 296-99, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981).</p>\n<p>The concurrence further contends that we have not received on-point briefing on the constitutional issue. We again respectfully disagree. The briefs and oral argument focused first and most extensively on the First Amendment and <i>McConnell</i> and debated the key question in this case: For First Amendment purposes, are non-profits more like individual citizens (who under <i>Buckley</i> have the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates) or more like political parties (which under <i>McConnell</i> do not)? <i>See </i><i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 44-51, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); <i>see also </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 155-56, 124 S.Ct. 619. Moreover, Cal-Med was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument. <i>See</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18, 32-33; FEC Br. at 21, 27, 28, 34; Amicus Br. at 21, 24; EMILY's List Reply Br. at 11, 19-20. Indeed, the FEC's brief noted that Cal-Med was a case \"chiefly relied upon.\" FEC Br. at iv. In short, the briefs and oral argument focused on and grappled with the critical issues posed by the First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>The concurrence suggests, however, that our holding goes further than the submission of EMILY's List. But EMILY's List forcefully argued that these regulations \"violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution,\" contended that <i>McConnell</i> and <i>Cal-Med</i> do not support the FEC's approach, and asked the Court to vacate the new regulations in their entirety. EMILY's List Br. at 19. In deciding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> this case, we have set forth the relevant constitutional principles as we discern them, and we then have applied those principles to the challenged regulations. In so doing, we have concluded that the regulations violate the First Amendment; we therefore have vacated the regulations, which is precisely the relief EMILY's List sought in advancing its First Amendment claims.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> apart from its substantive disagreement with our First Amendment analysis, the concurrence states that we should resolve this case on statutory grounds alone, and claims that it is \"gratuitous\" for us to address the First Amendment. We respectfully but firmly disagree.</p>\n<p>The threshold problem with the concurrence's preferred statutory-only approach is that EMILY's List raises a statutory challenge to only three of the five provisions at issue here. EMILY's List does not advance a statutory challenge to the provision in § 106.6(c) requiring that covered non-profits use their federal or hard-money accounts to pay for at least 50% of their generic get-out-the-vote and voter registration activities. Nor does EMILY's List raise a statutory challenge to the provision in § 106.6(c) requiring that covered nonprofits use hard money to pay for at least 50% of their generic communications. <i>Compare</i> EMILY's List Br. at 38-39 (discussing only administrative expenses provision of § 106.6(c) in statutory section of brief) <i>with</i> EMILY's List Br. at 32 (raising constitutional challenges to all provisions of § 106.6(c)). Indeed, footnote 11 of EMILY's List's brief all but concedes that, under the statute, the FEC may require use of hard money for these generic activities.</p>\n<p>EMILY's List's decision not to target these two provisions of § 106.6(c) on statutory grounds appears wise. Such an argument would be very difficult to square with <i>McConnell</i>'s several pointed statements that FECA permits the FEC to treat generic activities as entirely federal for purposes of contribution and expenditure limits. In fact, <i>McConnell</i> harshly criticized the FEC for not having previously treated political parties' generic activities as entirely federal activities subject to FECA's limits. <i>See </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 142, 124 S.Ct. 619 (by allowing generic activities to be funded largely with soft money, FEC's allocation regime \"subverted\" original FECA scheme); <i>id.</i> at 167, 124 S.Ct. 619 (FECA scheme \"eroded\" by FEC's allocation regime); <i>see also id.</i> at 142 n. 44, 124 S.Ct. 619.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Under the circumstances, we have no choice but to address EMILY's List's First Amendment argument. The concurrence apparently wants us to address a statutory argument that EMILY's List did not raise and then to accept that statutory claim even though we find it unpersuasive and inconsistent with precedent. We respectfully decline the concurrence's proposal.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>The FEC rules challenged by EMILY's List §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 violate the First Amendment. Sections 106.6(f) and 100.57 also exceed the FEC's authority under the Federal Election Campaign Act, as does the provision of § 106.6(c) that applies to administrative expenses. The FEC may not enforce §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), or 100.57. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and direct it to enter judgment for EMILY's List and to vacate the challenged regulations.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<p>BROWN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part:</p>\n<p>\"If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality... unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\" <i>Spector Motor Serv. v. McLaughlin,</i> 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 89 L.Ed. 101 (1944). \"Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter.\" <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Because these regulations must be vacated as contrary to the statute, we need not and should not reach the First Amendment issue. But if we're going to answer an unnecessary constitutional question, we at least ought to get it right. In light of <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003), I have grave doubts about the court's analysis, which bears at most a passing resemblance to the parties' briefs, and which will profoundly affect campaign finance law in this circuit. I thus respectfully concur only with Part IV of the court's opinion, except for footnotes 17, 18 and 20.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Though I do not join their First Amendment holding, I agree with my colleagues' conclusion that we must vacate the regulations challenged here (the <i>Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation,</i> 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f); the <i>Solicitation Regulation,</i> 11 C.F.R. § 100.57; and the <i>Administrative Costs Allocation Regulation,</i> 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c)). I begin with first principles. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an agency within the Executive Branch. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> The Executive Branch cannot make law, but instead executes laws enacted by the Legislative Branch. In executing the law, the FEC may issue \"necessary\" rules, 2 U.S.C. § 437d(a)(8), but, as with all agencies, the FEC acts contrary to law if it promulgates regulations \"in excess of [its] statutory jurisdiction,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). <i>See also </i><i>La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC,</i> 476 U.S. 355, 374, 106 S.Ct. 1890, 90 L.Ed.2d 369 (1986) (\"[A]n agency literally has no power to act ... unless and until Congress confers power upon it.\").</p>\n<p>By the plain language of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), the FEC lacks the power it now asserts. To fall within FEC jurisdiction, a \"gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value\" must be provided to a political committee \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\" 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i), and any money expended by such a committee must also have been done for that same purpose, <i>id.</i> § 431(9)(A)(i). There is no other reasonable way to read Congress's words. For the FEC to have any role, money must be used for the \"purpose\"defined as an \"objective, goal, or end,\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1356 (9th ed.2009)of \"influencing\" an \"election for Federal office.\" The inescapable corollary is the FEC has no authority over money given or spent \"solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections,\" an activity \"unaffected by FECA's requirements and prohibitions.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 122, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>Here, the FEC has set aside Congress's command that the agency's jurisdiction be bounded by the \"purpose\" for which money is spent. Instead of strictly minding this jurisdictional marker, the FEC conclusively presumes a federal purpose drives any spending that might influence a federal election.<sup>[1]</sup> The question though is not whether spending influences a federal election, but whether it was spent for that reason. Otherwise, the word \"purpose\" becomes superfluous, a result that this court cannot accept, <i>e.g., </i><i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979), especially for a jurisdictional provision like this one, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>N. Am. Van Lines, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 869 F.2d 596, 598 (D.C.Cir.1989). Under FECA, federal effects are simply not enough.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor does labeling spending that may affect both state and federal elections as \"mixed-purpose\" somehow solve the FEC's problem. Regulating on the basis of such a label still assumes there must be a federal purpose behind any spending that might influence, even tangentially, a federal campaign. Because that necessary assumption is false, these regulations remain invalid. Only <i>after</i> a federal purposemixed or otherwiseis identified does the FEC's power come into play. If a federal purpose can be shown, then allocation ratios like those promulgated here may well be appropriate under FECA, but just asserting that there must be a federal purpose skips the threshold jurisdictional question.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> B.</h2>\n<p>These regulations give short shrift to the \"purpose\" of spending and so must be vacated. Indeed, we have already rejected the FEC's view. Just fours years ago, in <i>Shays v. FEC,</i> we held FECA requires that \"to qualify as `expenditure' in the first place, spending must be undertaken `for the purpose of influencing' a federal election\" and agreed with the FEC that \"time, place, and content may be critical indicia of communicative purpose.\" 414 F.3d 76, 99 (D.C.Cir.2005). Though a federal</p>\n<blockquote>election-related intent is obvious ... in statements urging voters to \"elect\" or \"defeat\" a specified candidate or party, the same may not be true of ads identifying a federal politician but focusing on pending legislationa proposed budget, for example, or government reform initiativesand appearing three years before the next election. Nor is such purpose necessarily evident in statements referring, say, to a Connecticut senator but running only in San Francisco media markets.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>Shays</i> confirms what FECA says: context matters. Referencing a federal candidate \"may\" reveal a federal purpose, but if an ad will not be aired to her constituents or if it will run \"years before the next election,\" then absent some persuasive indicia of a federal purpose, a reference by itself to the candidate does not trigger FEC jurisdiction. This was the FEC's position in <i>Shays,</i> and it should be the FEC's position now. FECA's unambiguous text requires no less.</p>\n<p>Under the <i>Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation,</i> political committees must use hard money for \"[p]ublic communications that refer to one or more clearly identified Federal candidates, regardless of whether there is reference to a political party, but do not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f)(1). The rule is categorical. Even if a communication only says \"Vote No on State Ballot Initiative 123They Waste Enough Taxes in Washington, D.C.,\" merely referring (perhaps by means of a montage of grainy black-and-white photos) to United States Senators of both parties with a penchant for pork-barrel spending, the ad is <i>per se</i> deemed to have a federal purpose. This is true even if those big spenders hail from distant states, are not up for reelection for years, and the spot will not be shown anywhere near their voters. Whether such an ad could affect a federal race is doubtful, but the FEC goes further and says these ads <i>always</i> reflect a federal purpose. In an age when even pizza shops and used-car dealers invoke the stereotype of wasteful federal spending to sell their wares, the FEC's lack of sophistication is startling.</p>\n<p>The FEC's approach also ignores that a state campaign may be more effective if the campaigning group can mention a federal official's endorsement. Many federal politicians are of national stature, particularly those associated with hot button political issues. If, for example, a referendum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> would make it more difficult to get an abortion, a pro-choice group may trumpet a statement denouncing it from a prominent pro-choice United States senator, while a pro-life group may respond with a statement from an equally prominent pro-life senator. To say, as the FEC does, that citing these statements can <i>only</i> be done for the purpose of influencing federal elections is to pretend away the power of celebrity. Just as Michael J. Fox's name might be used in commercials for a stem cell amendment because his association makes for effective politics, <i>see</i> Alfonso Serrano, <i>Stem Cell Opponents To Air Celebrity Ad,</i> CBSNEWS.COM, Oct. 25, 2006, http://www.cbsnews.com/stori es/2006/10/25/politics/main2122383.shtml, an out-of-state and out-of-cycle Senator Debbie Stabenow's endorsement might be used to support state candidates because her association makes for effective state politics, particularly to targeted demographics.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The <i>Solicitation Regulation</i> respects Congress's language no better. The regulation declares any donation \"made by any person in response to any communication is a contribution to the person making the communication if the communication indicates that any portion of the funds received will be used to support or oppose the election of a clearly identified Federal candidate.\" 11 C.F.R. § 100.57(a). This rule applies even if a solicitation's banner headline says only a certain percentage of the donation will be used for federal activities. Hence, even if someone gives $1000 in response to a solicitation that unambiguously says 90% of what is received will be spent on local elections, the FEC asserts jurisdiction over the entire gift. If a gift is made subject to this disclaimer, how is the full $1000 given for the purpose of influencing a federal election?</p>\n<p>The <i>Solicitation Regulation</i> also says \"[i]f the solicitation does not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates, but does refer to a political party, in addition to [a] clearly identified Federal candidate,\" then the entire gift becomes subject to the FEC's authority, <i>id.</i> § 100.57(b)(1), and \"[i]f the solicitation refers to one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates, in addition to [a] clearly identified Federal candidate ..., at least fifty percent (50%) of the total funds received are contributions [subject to the FEC], whether or not the solicitation refers to a political party,\" <i>id.</i> § 100.57(b)(2). Even if the solicitation is unmistakable that the entire gift will be spent on local elections, the FEC nonetheless still claims jurisdiction over at least some of the resulting donations.</p>\n<p>This blindingly-bright line suffers from the same flaw as the <i>Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation</i>: it assumes merely referencing a federal candidate always unmasks a purpose of influencing a federal election and assumes those who give money in response to such a solicitation also unfailingly do so for the same purpose. That's just not true. Instead, a federal politician's name can be used for reasons tied solely to state electioneering. Again, consider an out-of-state and out-of-cycle Senator Stabenow. If she were to say \"EMILY's List supported a Democrat like me when I was running for state office, and I'm asking you to support EMILY's List now so it can continue to work on behalf of women who are seeking state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> office,\" then under the <i>Solicitation Regulation,</i> the entire amount of any donations is subject to the FEC.<sup>[5]</sup> That result conflicts with Congress's \"purpose\" requirement.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <i>Administrative Costs Allocation Regulation</i> is contrary to law. Under 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c), committees must use \"at least 50 percent Federal funds\" for \"administrative expenses, costs of generic voter drives, and costs of public communications that refer to any political party.\" An obvious problem is this rule applies in odd-numbered years when there are no federal elections. If later this November EMILY's List were to say \"vote a straight Democratic ticket for the city counsel\" in a broadcast in Walla Walla, Washington, no less than half of the cost would have to be expensed to a federal account, even though there is no federal race to influence. The FEC is explicit: if a communication mentions a political party, then context is irrelevant. <i>See</i> FEC Advisory Op.2005-13, at 4-5 (Oct. 20, 2005) (the duty to \"pay the costs of public communications that refer to a political party with at least 50 percent Federal funds does not change based on the activities of [the committee] in the particular State\").</p>\n<p>Contrary to this regulation's premise, moreover, certain \"administrative expenses\" do not always reflect a federal purpose, mixed or otherwise. A committee, for example, that opposes human cloning (and thus supports many different state and federal candidates and laws throughout the nation) may launch an outpost in a state that is considering an anticloning measure and organize a voter drive there,<sup>[6]</sup> even though the group has no intention of participating in any federal election. By this regulation, a full half of the costs must be expensed to the committee's federal account. In fact, the FEC would require the committee to use hard money for a leaflet that says \"both Democrats and Republicans\" endorse the initiative. Such a leaflet is not \"generic party advertising,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 123, 124 S.Ct. 619; it is an ad for a state ballot initiative, not a political party, and it defies reason to say otherwise.<sup>[7]</sup> FECA does not require this absurdity.</p>\n<p>The court says EMILY's List has waived part of its statutory claim. First, my colleagues concede EMILY's List has challenged every other subpart of these regulations, and agree the FEC has exceeded its statutory powers, but say because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> EMILY's List only mentions \"administrative expenses\" in one section of its brief, it waives its argument about \"costs of generic voter drives\" and \"costs of public communications that refer to any political party.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). This is so even though the clauses are in the exact same sentence of the exact same regulation, and even though they violate the exact same section of FECA for the exact same reason. This is perplexing. EMILY's List comprehensively says \"[n]or are <i>the regulations</i> permitted by FECA. FECA was passed to regulate contributions and expenditures made with `the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'\" EMILY's List Br. at 17 (emphasis added). And if there is any doubt, EMILY's List opens its reply brief by saying \"<i>[t]he regulations at issue in this case</i> violate the First Amendment, <i>Chevron[ ],</i> and the Administrative Procedure Act.\" EMILY's List Reply Br. at 1 (emphasis added). EMILY's List also contends § 106.6(c) requires using hard money for ads that state \"both Democrats and Republicans\" support a measure. <i>Id.</i> at 16. It goes without saying that EMILY's List never argues \"the regulations all violate FECA, except for the second and third clauses in the second sentence of 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c).\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Second and even more perplexingly, in order to buttress its waiver argument, the same judges that read <i>McConnell</i> narrowly as a case that \"views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees,\" Maj. Op. at 14, concludes EMILY's List could not have successfully challenged § 106.6(c)'s regulation of generic activities on statutory grounds because <i>McConnell</i> specifically approved regulation of contribution and expenditure limits for these funds. <i>Id.</i> at 23-24. If this were correct, it would mean the FEC can constitutionally regulate a committee like EMILY's List, and the court's constitutional analysis is critically undermined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>No one disputes the FEC can craft bright-line rules. An \"objective test,\" <i>Orloski v. FEC,</i> 795 F.2d 156, 162 (D.C.Cir. 1986), in fact, may be constitutionally required, <i>see </i><i>FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 467-69, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.). Communications calling for the election or defeat of federal candidates certainly fall within the agency's authority, and the FEC may have a bit more leeway to regulate ads directed at federal electorates or aired during federal elections. <i>Shays,</i> 414 F.3d at 99. FECA's unambiguous text, however, forbids the Commission from doing what it has done here: promulgating proxies for \"purpose\" that wholly ignore all relevant contextual clues. The regulations consequently must be vacated as contrary to congressional will.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Because this case can be decided on statutory grounds, we need not reach the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> constitutional question, and so should not reach the constitutional question. Our precedent is not wishy-washy: \"Federal courts should not decide constitutional questions unless it is necessary to do so. Before reaching a constitutional question, a federal court should therefore consider whether there is a nonconstitutional ground for deciding the case, and if there is, dispose of the case on that ground.\" <i>Kalka v. Hawk,</i> 215 F.3d 90, 97 (D.C.Cir. 2000). <i>See also </i><i>Meredith Corp. v. FCC,</i> 809 F.2d 863, 870 (D.C.Cir.1987); <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 572 F.3d 945, 952 (D.C.Cir.2009) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part). My colleagues duck this rule, preferring to summon the awesome power of <i>Marbury v. Madison.</i> But in their eagerness to play John Marshall, they do not follow him. The Great Chief Justice himself cautioned: \"No questions can be brought before a judicial tribunal of greater delicacy than those which involve the constitutionality of a legislative act. If they become indispensably necessary to the case, the court must meet and decide them,\" but if not, \"a just respect for the legislature requires, that the obligation of its laws should not be unnecessarily and wantonly assailed.\" <i>Ex parte Randolph,</i> 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (C.C.D.Va.1833) (No. 11,558).</p>\n<p>The reasons to be \"keenly mindful of our institutional role\" and \"fully appreciate\" the solemnity of constitutional adjudication are obvious. <i>Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2504, 2513, 174 L.Ed.2d 140 (2009). Meekness, for one, compels us to recognize we are not the Constitution's only friend each branch swears an oath to uphold it. <i>See</i> U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 8; <i>Rostker v. Goldberg,</i> 453 U.S. 57, 64, 101 S.Ct. 2646, 69 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981). And if we misread a statute, Congress can fix it; not so with the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The court, however, is not content just answering a gratuitous constitutional question. Its holding is broader than even the plaintiff requests. Instead of arguing nonprofits have a constitutional right to pay for ads attacking federal candidates with soft money, EMILY's List more modestly challenges the regulations as the \"functional equivalent of spending limits, prohibiting EMILY's List from supporting <i>state and local candidates</i> in certain ways when its federal funds are exhausted\" and claims they are not properly tailored because they \"restrict vast amounts of <i>nonfederal activity.</i>\" EMILY's List Br. at 17 (summary of argument) (emphasis added). The court holds, nonetheless, that EMILY's List is constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of its advertisements out of a soft-money account, even for ads that attack or promote <i>federal</i> candidates. Maj. Op. at 17-18.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Because EMILY's List's actual claims are not bold enough, the court <i>sua sponte</i> spins a more aggressive argumentmaking its waiver charge all the more curious. Nowhere does any party refer to Justice Blackmun's separate opinion in <i>California Medical Association v. FEC,</i> 453 U.S. 182, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*32</span> (<i>\"Cal-Med\"</i>). Nor does EMILY's List mention <i>FEC v. National Conservative PAC,</i> 470 U.S. 480, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985) (<i>\"NCPAC\"</i>), <i>FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.,</i> 479 U.S. 238, 107 S.Ct. 616, 93 L.Ed.2d 539 (1986) (<i>\"MCFL\"</i>), or <i>North Carolina Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake,</i> 525 F.3d 274 (4th Cir.2008)in other words, the cases upon which the court's holding depends, <i>see, e.g.,</i> Maj. Op. at 8-11, 14, 16.<sup>[10]</sup> None of the law review articles the court relies on are citedmuch less discussedeither.<sup>[11]</sup> And far from hashing out <i>McConnell</i>'s \"footnote 48,\" <i>id.</i> at 14-15 n. 13, neither party mentions it. The court today issues an expansive constitutional decision without the benefit of on-point briefing. Before deciding a complicated First Amendment issue, we ought to ask for the parties' views.</p>\n<p>In attempting to connect its decision to the parties' views, the court artfully re-imagines the \"key question in this case,\" describing it as whether \"non-profits [are] more like individual citizens (who under <i>Buckley</i> have the right to spend unlimited money ...) or more like political parties (which under <i>McConnell</i> do not).\" Maj. Op. at 23. The court notes \"<i>Cal-Med</i> was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. <i>Cal-Med</i> was cited and discussed by the parties, but never to support the proposition for which the court now relies on it. For instance, when asked by the court to respond to the FEC's reliance on <i>Cal-Med,</i> counsel for EMILY's List offered this succinct critique of the court's holding:</p>\n<blockquote>The Court: Can you deal with [FEC's counsel's] response on [<i>Cal-Med</i>]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>EMILY's List: Yes. I mean, <i>Cal</i>[-]<i>Med</i> is mysteriously produced here for the FEC's position. <i>Cal</i>[-]<i>Med</i> didn't raise any of the issues in this case. <i>Cal</i>[-]<i>Med</i> was a simple question of whether a committee that was making contributions to federal candidates had to observe a limit on contributions made to that federal program. That set a law now, that's certainly what EMILY's List does. I don't think it bears at all on this invasion of our state and local programs through the promulgation of these excessive federal regulatory schemes.</blockquote>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. at 32-33. How true.</p>\n<p>But even if it were judicially proper for me to do so, and even if the issues were briefed, I doubt I could join the court's opinion in full. This is not because I dislike its outcome. Indeed, I agree with what seems to be the unstated premise: if the Supreme Court's cases made any sense, the First Amendment would protect much more than pornography, profanity, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*33</span> and pyrotechnics. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 803, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000); <i>Cohen v. California,</i> 403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971); <i>Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). The amendment's \"purpose,\" after all, is \"to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail,\" <i>FCC v. League of Women Voters,</i> 468 U.S. 364, 377, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984)a principle that \"has its fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during a campaign for political office,\" <i>Eu v. S.F. County Democratic Cent. Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. 214, 223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989). If those beautifully fierce words \"Congress shall make no law\" are to do anything but condemn our constitutionalism as a failed experiment, then <i>at least</i> political speech in all its forms should be free of government constraint.</p>\n<p>My colleagues' distaste for the FEC's handiwork is to their credit. It shows they take the First Amendment seriously. And they are right, of course, that if constitutional law were better acquainted with the Constitution, regulations such as these would never survive Article III scrutiny. If an advertisement criticizes the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or the Chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, it can be a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to pay for that ad using money the federal government doesn't know about or that comes from sources the federal government deems to have already given enough. <i>See</i> 2 U.S.C. § 437g(d). The First Amendment, logically construed, cannot condone such a weighty burden on political speech at the same time it forbids penalizing the production of \"virtual child pornography,\" <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal.,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002).</p>\n<p>I also agree with the court that \"corruption\" should only be understood in terms of <i>quid pro quo</i>not a free-floating unease about money in politics. Once \"corruption\" is disconnected from \"pay to play,\" Congress has <i>carte blanche</i> to stifle speech, a license that is particularly pernicious as our overweening government ever enlarges itself. Power<i>government</i> poweris what generates passion in politics. Money only measures its depth. The more power is at stake, the more money will be used to shield, deflect, or co-opt it. So long as the government can take and redistribute a man's livelihood, there will always be money in politics. One man's corruption is another man's political accountability.</p>\n<p>But there is a rub. We sit on a lower court and \"must follow the binding Supreme Court precedent\" until the Court itself overrules it. <i>We the People Found., Inc. v. United States,</i> 485 F.3d 140, 144 (D.C.Cir.2007). Though we do not read the court above's precedent unduly expansively, we also do not drag our feet: \"it is not our role to fight a rearguard action\" against the logical implications of the Court's cases. <i>United States v. Gardellini,</i> 545 F.3d 1089, 1096 (D.C.Cir.2008). Instead, we take its holdings as we find them, applying them to cover all they fairly address. <i>Stare decisis</i> means nothing if we only are bound by those cases with which we already agree. Like it or not, we cannot ignore Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>Modesty is dictated by the difficulty of applying <i>McConnell</i>'s facial generalizations to real world events. It is hard to say exactly how contribution limits on hybrid committees, like EMILY's List, should be analyzed after <i>McConnell. McConnell</i> involved a wide-ranging facial challenge addressing the constitutionality of BCRA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> Trying to extrapolate from that case to this one is risky and reason enough to avoid the constitutional bog. Suffice it to say that the Supreme Court majority, the dissenters, and the commentators all have read <i>McConnell</i> as a maximalist opinion. <i>See</i> 540 U.S. at 192-93, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"[O]ur decisions in <i>Buckley</i> and <i>MCFL</i> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.\"); <i>id.</i> at 263, 107 S.Ct. 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"We have witnessed merely the second scene of Act I of what promises to be a lengthy tragedy.\"); <i>id.</i> at 264, 107 S.Ct. 616 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he Court today upholds what can only be described as the most significant abridgment of the freedoms of speech and association since the Civil War.\"); <i>id.</i> at 294, 124 S.Ct. 619 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\"This new definition of corruption sweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path.\"); <i>id.</i> at 357, 124 S.Ct. 619 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (\"Today's decision, by not requiring tailored restrictions, has significantly reduced the protection for political speech having little or nothing to do with corruption or the appearance of corruption.\"); <i>see also</i> Richard Briffault, <i>The 527 Problem ... and the</i> Buckley <i>Problem,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 949, 970 (2005) <i>(\"McConnell,</i> however, transformed the constitutional landscape.\").</p>\n<p>In both holding and discussion, the <i>McConnell</i> Court sided with the censor, going so far as to rely on theoretical anticipation to uphold a speech restriction, <i>see</i> 540 U.S. at 185, 124 S.Ct. 619 (upholding BCRA § 323(f), which forbids state and local officeholders and candidates from using soft money to support or attack federal candidates, based on the \"eminently reasonable prediction that ... state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the soft-money funding of sham issue advertising\"), and ending with an invitation for even more congressional action, <i>id.</i> at 224, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"We are under no illusion that BCRA will be the last congressional statement on the matter.\"). This is not the <i>modus operandi</i> of a tentative tribunal; the Court knew what it was doing, and said so. After <i>McConnell,</i> if these regulations are within the FEC's statutory power, then there is no obvious reason they <i>facially</i> violate the First Amendment.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>It is true <i>McConnell</i> upheld, against an equal protection challenge, a provision of BCRA regulating political parties. But regulation of political parties is not <i>McConnell</i>'s theme. The Court broadly recognized and deferred to governmental interests in preventing corruption, the appearance of corruption, and circumvention of election regulations. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 136-37, 143-45, 152-53, 124 S.Ct. 619. Arguably, this expansive corruption/circumvention/conduit rationale is broad enough to encompass some limits on independent expenditure committees, particularly for those political committees <span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> with a self-proclaimed electoral mission. <i>See</i> Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. at 986-87; Hasen, 153 U. PA. L.REV. at 67-68. EMILY's List is a multicandidate political committee that has as its primary purpose electing ideologically compatible candidates, EMILY's List Br. at 3.<sup>[13]</sup> As such, it supports Democratic candidates for federal office. <i>See</i> Matthew B. Stannard, <i>Cash is Key for Tauscher's Replacement,</i> S.F. CHRON., Aug. 24, 2009, at A1, <i>available at</i> 2009 WLNR 16474721 (noting that a candidate in a federal primary race \"has touted the endorsement of EMILY's List, a national fundraising organization that supported [former U.S. Representative Ellen Tauscher] and backs Democratic women who support abortion rights.\"). Thus, EMILY's List is much more like a political party than the Sierra Club or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>\n<p>Whether, under the high court's current precedents, EMILY's List could be regulated exactly like a political party is unknown. That it should not be regulated <i>more harshly</i> than a political party seems to be the committee's complaint with the FEC regulations challenged in this court. EMILY's List Br. at 39 (\"Bizarrely, [the regulation] also treats nonparty PACs more harshly than any other type of committee, save national parties and candidates themselves.\"). My point is not that <i>McConnell</i> mandates such treatment; only that nothing in the opinion's logic clearly precludes it. The court does not think this is \"a persuasive interpretation of <i>McConnell.</i>\" Maj. Op. at 22. Perhaps the court is right. But reading the case, as the court does, to sanction First Amendment immunity for all non-connected nonprofits seems even more implausible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Precedent holds allocation and solicitation rules are contribution limits. This is key, as such limits receive less than \"strict scrutiny,\" given they \"`entail only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication.'\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 134-35, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 20, 96 S.Ct. 612). The \"`overall effect' of dollar limits on contributions is [also] `merely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 136, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 21-22, 96 S.Ct. 612). Unlike strict scrutiny, which requires narrow tailoring to serve compelling governmental interests, a contribution limit is \"valid [if] it satisfies the lesser demand of being closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>After <i>McConnell,</i> allocation and solicitation rules are subject only to this lesser scrutiny. Facing BCRA § 323(a), which forbids national parties from soliciting and spending soft money, and § 323(b), which forbids state parties from spending soft money on \"federal election activities,\" the Court declined to apply strict scrutiny. 540 U.S. at 138-39, 124 S.Ct. 619. The Court held \"neither provision in any way limits the total amount of money parties can spend. Rather, they simply limit the source and individual amount of donations. That they do so by prohibiting the spending of soft money does not render them expenditure limitations.\" <i>Id.</i> at 139, 124 S.Ct. 619. We instead ask \"whether the mechanism adopted to implement the contribution limit, or to prevent circumvention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> of that limit, burdens speech in a way that a direct restriction on the contribution itself would not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 138-39, 124 S.Ct. 619. Using the Court's standard, I agree with the district court that while the FEC's regulations \"may affect the manner in which EMILY's List must fund the speech in which it chooses to engage, they do not in any way limit the political speech that EMILY's List may undertake.\" <i>EMILY's List,</i> 569 F.Supp.2d at 39.</p>\n<p>The issue we confront then is whether these regulations, facially, are closely drawn to match an important interest. To answer, we again ought to look to <i>McConnell.</i> In upholding BCRA § 323, the Court noted the \"interests that underlie contribution limitsinterests in preventing both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 136, 124 S.Ct. 619. The Court bluntly held these interests are \"not limited ... to the elimination of cash-for-vote exchanges,\" but \"extend to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 143, 124 S.Ct. 619. Congress must be able to \"address [these] more subtle but equally dispiriting forms of corruption\" by \"remov[ing] the temptation\" of \"large financial contributions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153, 124 S.Ct. 619. To combat \"cynical assumption[s],\" Congress can \"regulate the appearance of undue influence,\" with \"undue influence\" defined as \"a sense of obligation\" or \"grat[itude],\" <i>id.</i> at 144-45, 124 S.Ct. 619. Importantly, Congress also has an interest in preventing the circumvention of these limitsand so can use broad prophylaxesbecause \"candidates, donors, and parties test the limits of the current law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 144, 124 S.Ct. 619. In sum, <i>McConnell</i> defines the \"interest\" so broadly it is hard to imagine regulations that are not properly drawn to it. <i>See id.</i> at 356-57, 124 S.Ct. 619 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Following from such an encompassing statement of the interest, the <i>McConnell</i> Court facially upheld many onerous restrictions on the use of soft money. The Court emphasized, for example, that even a complete ban on soliciting nonfederal funds would still \"leave open ample opportunities for soliciting federal funds,\" and noted such restrictions \"increase the dissemination of information by forcing parties, candidates, and officeholders to solicit from a wider array of potential donors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 139-40, 124 S.Ct. 619. The Court also upheld a ban on any use of soft money by national parties, even for those \"minor parties\" that are unlikely to have any tangible electoral success, remarking only that \"a nascent or struggling minor party can bring an as-applied challenge if § 323(a) prevents it from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159, 124 S.Ct. 619. While national parties do not always act on behalf of or in concert with federal candidates, a prophylactic prohibition on any soft money spending and soliciting by them is facially valid, given the \"close connection and alignment of interests\" between national parties and federal candidates. <i>Id.</i> at 155, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>The Court's discussion of national parties by itself raises difficulties for the court, especially because the Court already seemingly has held there is a \"close connection and alignment of interests\" between committees like EMILY's List and federal candidates. In <i>Cal-Med,</i> the Court sustained contribution limits to multicandidate committees. Four justices adopted the Conference Report's conclusion that these committees may \"`appear to be separate entities pursuing their own ends, but are actually a means for advancing a candidate's campaign,'\" 453 U.S. at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> 199 n. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (plurality opinion) (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-1057, pp. 57-58 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 946, 972-74). Justice Blackmun penned a concurring opinion, but did not disclaim the Conference Report or disagree with the Court's ultimate holding. In fact, he expressly said \"<i>contributions to multicandidate committees may be limited to $5, 000 per year</i> as a means of preventing evasion [of contribution limits],\" though he noted in <i>dicta</i> that his conclusion would be different if the committee \"makes <i>only</i> independent expenditures\" and so does not \"pose a perceived threat of actual or potential corruption.\" <i>Id.</i> at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (emphasis added). If Congress can forbid all allocation and solicitation of soft money by national parties, how is it unconstitutional to forbid only some allocation and solicitation of soft money by multicandidate committees that are also closely aligned with federal candidates?</p>\n<p>The court disputes this reading of <i>Cal-Med,</i> claiming there are not just two types of political committees (ones that only make independent expenditures, and all others), but actually three: (1) those that only make independent expenditures; (2) those that only contribute to candidates; and (3) those that make independent expenditures <i>and</i> contribute to candidates. Such political committees are, in the court's view, entitled to raise and spend \"unlimited money\" for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. Maj. Op. at 16. If these hybrid committees contribute to federal candidates, they must use hard money, says the court, but all other spending can be with soft money.</p>\n<p>This novel argument is not without considerable charm, but one must read <i>Cal-Med</i> with a squint to see that holding.<sup>[14]</sup> There is no indication in <i>Cal-Med</i> that the committee did not make independent expenditures, but the Court still sustained the statute, without announcing the distinction the court draws today. The Court <i>has</i> consistently cited <i>Cal-Med</i> for the unqualified proposition that it is constitutional to limit contributions to multicandidate committees. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FEC v. Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm.,</i> 533 U.S. 431, 441-42, 121 S.Ct. 2351, 150 L.Ed.2d 461 (2001); <i>FEC v. NRA Political Victory Fund,</i> 513 U.S. 88, 97, 115 S.Ct. 537, 130 L.Ed.2d 439 (1994). <i>See also </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 38, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>The infamous \"footnote 48 of the <i>McConnell</i> opinion,\" Maj. Op. at 14 n. 13, also flatly contradicts the court:</p>\n<blockquote>Justice KENNEDY's contention that <i>Buckley</i> limits Congress to regulating contributions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> to a candidate ignores <i>Buckley</i> itself. There, we upheld FECA's $25,000 limit on aggregate yearly contributions to candidates, <i>political committees,</i> and <i>party committees</i> out of recognition that FECA's $1,000 limit on candidate contributions would be meaningless if individuals could instead make \"huge contributions to the candidate's political party.\" Likewise, in [<i>Cal-Med</i>], we upheld FECA's $5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political committees. It is no answer to say that such limits were justified as a means of preventing individuals from using parties and political committees as pass-throughs to circumvent FECA's $1,000 limit on individual contributions to candidates. Given FECA's definition of \"contribution,\" the $5,000 and $25,000 limits restricted not only the source and amount of funds available to parties and political committees to make candidate contributions, but also the source and amount of funds available to engage in express advocacy and numerous other noncoordinated expenditures. If indeed the First Amendment prohibited Congress from regulating contributions to fund the latter, the otherwise-easy-to-remedy exploitation of parties as pass-throughs (e.g., a strict limit on donations that could be used to fund candidate contributions) would have provided insufficient justification for such overbroad legislation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 152 n. 48, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>That the Court may have created a doctrinal anomaly might suggest, as the court argues, <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at 14-15 n. 13, that it could not possibly have meant what it said, but that is a hard argument to make. Often cases are in tension as doctrine works itself pure. Our duty as an intermediate court is not to tell the Court what it ought to have said, but to abide by what it did say.</p>\n<p>But even leaving aside its treatment of national parties, <i>McConnell</i> further undermines the court. Recognizing the dynamicindeed, Sisypheancharacter of campaign finance law, the Court noted \"[m]oney, like water, will always find an outlet.\" 540 U.S. at 224, 124 S.Ct. 619. Upon realizing structural forces inherent in a republic inevitably create incentives for those subject to regulation to petition for relief and to campaign against those who are disinclined to grant it, the Court did not retreat to a more manageable and less burdensome <i>\"quid pro quo\"</i> standard. <i>Id.</i> at 296, 124 S.Ct. 619 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Instead, after upholding § 323(a), the Court emphasized money would now \"corrupt\" federal races by other, more subtle routes, so Congress, in anticipation of this new corruption, can enact broad anti-circumvention measures. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 165-66, 124 S.Ct. 619. Indeed, without pointing to <i>any</i> evidence that local officials (<i>e.g.,</i> county assessors) are connected to federal candidates (<i>e.g.,</i> for President of the United States) or have been used to circumvent the law, the Court held Congress prophylactically can regulate them without facially offending the Constitution. <i>See id.</i> at 184-85, 124 S.Ct. 619. If the First Amendment is flexible enough to allow regulating local officials because contributions <i>might</i> flow through them to federal candidates, then why can't the FEC also make an \"eminently reasonable prediction\" that committees like EMILY's Listwhich <i>actually</i> do campaign for candidates and give them money<sup>[15]</sup>will be the next route for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> corruption, and regulate accordingly? <i>Id.</i> at 185, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>The court sidesteps <i>McConnell</i> by saying EMILY's List is a nonprofit, not a political party, and so has more constitutional rights.<sup>[16]</sup> But EMILY's List is not just a nonprofit; it is a multicandidate political committee that campaigns for and contributes money to federal candidates. In upholding § 323 in full, including § 323(f), <i>McConnell</i> blessed restrictions on local officeholders, who are not, of course, political parties. The rule then cannot be that parties and federal candidates are in one column, and everyone else is in another, because that does not explain <i>McConnell.</i> Instead, there is a spectrum, <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 291, so we should ask not whether an entity is a nonprofit, but instead where it falls on the spectrum. Specifically, is EMILY's List more or less likely than a local official to act as a conduit to federal candidates? \"Common sense\" says such committees are the more natural path to \"corruption,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 297, 124 S.Ct. 619 (Kennedy, J., dissenting), but if my colleagues are correct, Congress cannot regulate them the same way it regulates county directors of animal control.<sup>[17]</sup> Precedent is plain: local officials must use hard money to attack federal candidates, <i>see id.</i> at 184-85, 124 S.Ct. 619, but as the court now resolves this case, multicandidate political committees cannot be so limited. Can that be right?</p>\n<p>The court's opinion is boldly creative, and will, if followed, have profound results on campaign finance regulation. This case means:</p>\n<blockquote>1. Multicandidate political committees can spend unlimited amounts of soft money to run ads attacking or supporting federal candidates and political parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. These committees can spend unlimited amounts of soft money on get-out-the-vote activities that support federal candidates and political parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. These committees can solicit soft money by saying: \"Just like you, we want [<i>federal candidate</i>] to win. You have already donated all the law allows to [<i>federal candidate</i>], but there is no limit on how much you can give to us to support [<i>federal candidate</i>].\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Congress can do nothing about any of this.</blockquote>\n<p>These results are in tensionperhaps irreconcilable tensionwith <i>McConnell.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Recall how the Court in <i>McConnell</i> concluded <i>its</i> opinion: \"`To say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.'\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> 540 U.S. at 223-24, 124 S.Ct. 619 (quoting <i>Burroughs v. United States,</i> 290 U.S. 534, 545, 54 S.Ct. 287, 78 L.Ed. 484 (1934)). This \"conviction\" compelled the Court to uphold \"Congress's most recent effort to confine the ill effects of aggregated wealth on our political system\" by \"control[ing]... soft money.\" <i>Id.</i> at 224, 124 S.Ct. 619. But the Court was \"under no illusion that BCRA will be the last congressional statement on the matter\"\"[m]oney, like water, will always find an outlet.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>While I have argued courts should not unnecessarily assail legislative acts, political speech is the core of what the First Amendment protects. From <i>Buckley</i> to <i>McConnell</i> the Court has relied on an <i>ad hoc</i> empiricism ill-suited to the complex interactions of democratic politics. The government has unlimited resources, public and private, for touting its policy agenda. Those on the outsidewhether voices of opposition, encouragement, or innovationmust rely on private wealth to make their voices heard. An increasingly anomalous campaign finance jurisprudence only impoverishes this essential debate. <i>McConnell</i>'s careless invocation of access and influence (two integral aspects of political participation) as synonyms for corruption is instructive. Such an expansive, self-referential, and amorphous definition of corruption, coupled with lax standards of scrutiny and a willingness to accept as \"evidence\" any plausible theory of corruption or claim of circumvention, is likely to doom any argument for protection of core political speech. Someday the Supreme Court may be persuaded to reconsider this approach. But that cannot be our task.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>This should have been a straightforward application of administrative law, not unlike countless agency cases decided by this circuit every year. Congress has enacted a statute; the agency has violated it; the rules must be vacated; done. I would enforce the statute as written and call it a day. A good rule of thumb is we often do more for the law when we do less with the law. Per that rule, I concur only in part with the court's opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  A hard-money account is subject to source and amount limitations. For example, under the statute, EMILY's List cannot accept donations of more than $5000 annually into its hard-money account from any single contributor. 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C). A soft-money account may receive unlimited donations.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court's rejection of the equalization argument is consistent with its broader First Amendment jurisprudence: \"As a general matter, the American First Amendment tradition requires that the financial, political, or rhetorical imbalance between the proponents of competing arguments is insufficient to justify government intervention to correct that imbalance.\" Frederick Schauer &amp; Richard H. Pildes, <i>Electoral Exceptionalism and the First Amendment,</i> 77 TEX. L.REV. 1803, 1825 (1999); <i>see generally</i> Lillian R. BeVier, <i>Money and Politics: A Perspective on the First Amendment and Campaign Finance Reform,</i> 73 CAL. L.REV. 1045 (1985).</p>\n<p>[3]  Contributions include coordinated expenditures that is, expenditures coordinated with a candidate or party. <i>See </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 121, 124 S.Ct. 619; <i>FEC v. Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm.,</i> 533 U.S. 431, 443, 121 S.Ct. 2351, 150 L.Ed.2d 461 (2001); <i>see also</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441 a(a)(7)(B).</p>\n<p>[4]  Many have criticized the distinction between contributions and expenditures because, in their view, they are \"two sides of the same First Amendment coin.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 241, 96 S.Ct. 612 (opinion of Burger, C.J.). Some contend that limits on contributions and expenditures are both suspect under the First Amendment. <i>See id.</i>; <i>id.</i> at 290, 96 S.Ct. 612 (opinion of Blackmun, J); <i>see also </i><i>Shrink Mo. Gov't PAC,</i> 528 U.S. at 410 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Others argue that the interest in limiting contributions similarly justifies restricting expenditures. <i>See</i> Buckley, 424 U.S. at 260-62, 96 S.Ct. 612 (opinion of White, J.). The Court thus far has rebuffed both critiques and adhered to the <i>Buckley</i> divide. <i>See </i><i>Randall,</i> 548 U.S. at 242, 126 S.Ct. 2479 (\"Over the last 30 years, in considering the constitutionality of a host of different campaign finance statutes, this Court has repeatedly adhered to <i>Buckley's</i> constraints, including those on expenditure limits.\").</p>\n<p>[5]  The Court also has ruled that the Government may bar certain non-profit as well as for-profit corporations from making direct contributions to candidates or parties. <i>See </i><i>FEC v. Beaumont,</i> 539 U.S. 146, 159-60, 123 S.Ct. 2200, 156 L.Ed.2d 179 (2003).</p>\n<p>[6]  The Supreme Court is presently considering whether to overrule <i>Austin</i> (and <i>McConnell</i>'s reliance on it) to the extent <i>Austin</i> permitted the Government to limit for-profit corporations' and unions' expenditures. <i>See Citizens United v. FEC,</i> No. 08-205 (S.Ct. reargued Sept. 9, 2009); <i>cf. </i><i>Austin,</i> 494 U.S. at 702, 110 S.Ct. 1391 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\"Today's decision abandons [<i>Buckley's</i>] distinction and threatens once-protected political speech.\"). The regulations at issue here violate the First Amendment with or without <i>Austin</i> on the books. <i>See infra</i> note 11.</p>\n<p>[7]  In referring to non-profit entities, we mean non-connected non-profit corporations (usually advocacy or ideological or politically oriented non-profits) that engage in election-related activities and register with the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. § 527 or § 501(c), as well as unincorporated non-profit groups. \"Non-connected\" means that the non-profit is not a candidate committee, a party committee, or a committee established by a corporation or labor union. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(a). \"Non-connected\" for purposes of this opinion also excludes so-called leadership PACs.\n</p>\n<p>Some non-profits register with the FEC as political committees; others do not. Our constitutional analysis of donations to and spending by non-connected non-profits applies regardless whether a non-profit has registered as a political committee with the FEC. <i>See infra</i> note 15.</p>\n<p>[8]  In <i>Cal-Med,</i> there was no majority opinion on the First Amendment issue. Under the <i>Marks</i> principle, Justice Blackmun's opinion in <i>Cal-Med</i> appears to be controlling. <i>See </i><i>Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977); <i>cf., e.g., </i><i>Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. 265, 269-320, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Even if Justice Blackmun's opinion were not binding under the <i>Marks</i> principle or even if his discussion of expenditure-only nonprofits were considered dicta, his opinion's principles have been followed in subsequent decisions such as <i>Citizens Against Rent Control.</i> In that regard, we note that Justice Marshall's opinion in <i>Cal-Med</i> did not decide how the First Amendment applies to contributions to a non-profit that only makes expenditures. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 197 n. 17, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Marshall, J.) (\"American Civil Liberties Union suggests that § 441a(a)(1)(C) would violate the First Amendment if construed to limit the amount individuals could jointly expend to express their political views. We need not consider this hypothetical application....\").</p>\n<p>[9]  To be sure, some cases suggest that the First Amendment interest in donating to someone else for speech, while important, is less weighty than the First Amendment interest in speaking oneself. But those cases involve contributions to candidates or parties. <i>See </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 21, 96 S.Ct. 612. With respect to donations to groups other than candidates or political parties, the Court has said that there are \"of course, some activities, legal if engaged in by one, yet illegal if performed in concert with others, but political expression is not one of them.\" <i>Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> 454 U.S. at 296, 102 S.Ct. 434; <i>see also MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. at 261, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>NCPAC,</i> 470 U.S. at 495, 105 S.Ct. 1459; <i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <i>NAACP,</i> 357 U.S.at 460, 78 S.Ct. 1163.</p>\n<p>[10]  The requirement that certain administrative expenses be funded in part with hard money prevents a contributor from essentially taking control of a non-profit and thereby circumventing limits on individual contributions to candidates. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 198-99 n. 19, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Marshall, J.); <i>id.</i> at 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.). But as discussed above, the <i>Cal-Med</i> Court never stated that non-profits could be required to use hard money for advertisements, get-out-the-vote activities, and voter registration drives; indeed, Justice Blackmun's opinion stated the opposite.</p>\n<p>[11]  One additional wrinkle: To the extent a non-profit receives donations from for-profit corporations or unions, those donations cannot be placed in the non-profit's hard-money account (because for-profit corporate or union donations cannot be the source of contributions to parties or candidates). Moreover, under <i>Austin,</i> the soft-money account into which such donations are deposited cannot be used to fund express-advocacy election activities that for-profit corporations and unions are themselves banned from conducting. <i>Cf. WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. at 476-77, 127 S.Ct. 2652; <i>MCFL,</i> 479 U.S. at 259-64, 107 S.Ct. 616; <i>FEC v. NRA,</i> 254 F.3d 173, 191-92 (D.C.Cir. 2001). Justice Souter recently summarized these points: A \"nonprofit may use its general treasury to pay for clearly electioneering communications so long as it declines to serve as a conduit for money from business corporations and unions (and thus qualifies for the <i>MCFL</i> exception).\" <i>WRTL,</i> 551 U.S. at 521, 127 S.Ct. 2652 (Souter, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). If <i>Austin</i> were overruled, then non-profits would be able to make unlimited express-advocacy expenditures from their soft-money accounts even if they accepted donations from for-profit corporations or unions to those accounts.</p>\n<p>[12]  <i>See generally </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 130, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"both parties promised and provided special access to candidates and senior Government officials in exchange for large soft-money contributions\"); <i>id.</i> at 145, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"special relationship and unity of interest\" that candidates and officeholders share with parties); <i>id.</i> at 146, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"The evidence in the record shows that candidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the soft-money loophole, the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of officeholders, with the national parties serving as willing intermediaries.\"); <i>id.</i> at 150, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"The record in the present cases is replete with similar examples of national party committees peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large soft-money donations.\"); <i>id.</i> at 151, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"So pervasive is this practice that the six national party committees actually furnish their own menus of opportunities for access to would-be soft-money donors, with increased prices reflecting an increased level of access.\"); <i>id.</i> at 152, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"close ties that candidates and officeholders have with their parties\"); <i>id.</i> at 153-54, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"As the record demonstrates, it is the manner in which parties have <i>sold</i> access to federal candidates and officeholders that has given rise to the appearance of undue influence.\"); <i>id.</i> at 155, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"no meaningful separation between the national party committees and the public officials who control them\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>id.</i> (\"Given this close connection and alignment of interests, large soft-money contributions to national parties are likely to create actual or apparent indebtedness on the part of federal officeholders\"); <i>id.</i> (\"This close affiliation has also placed national parties in a position to sell access to federal officeholders in exchange for soft-money contributions\"); <i>id.</i> (\"Access to federal officeholders is the most valuable favor the national party committees are able to give in exchange for large donations.\"); <i>id.</i> at 156 n. 51, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"[T]he record demonstrates close ties between federal officeholders and the state and local committees of their parties. That close relationship makes state and local parties effective conduits for donors desiring to corrupt federal candidates and officeholders. Thus, in upholding §§ 323(b), (d), and (f), we rely not only on the fact that they regulate contributions used to fund activities influencing federal elections, but also that they regulate contributions to, or at the behest of, entities uniquely positioned to serve as conduits for corruption.\").</p>\n<p>[13]  Some have suggested that footnote 48 of the <i>McConnell</i> opinion, in the course of discussing contributions to parties, subtly re-interpreted <i>Cal-Med</i> to permit restrictions on large soft-money donations to non-profits. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Edward B. Foley &amp; Donald Tobin, <i>The New Loophole?: 527s, Political Committees, and McCain-Feingold,</i> BNA MONEY &amp; POL. REP., Jan. 7, 2004; Memorandum from Prof. Daniel R. Ortiz, Univ. of Va. School of Law, to Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center (Apr. 9, 2004). We decline to adopt that expansive reading of footnote 48.\n</p>\n<p>First, as explained by one leading election-law expert, such a reading would require overruling the Supreme Court's longstanding dichotomy between limits on contributions and expenditures. <i>See</i> Richard L. Hasen, Buckley <i>is Dead, Long Live</i> Buckley, 153 U. PA. L.REV. 31, 70 (2004). Limits on donations to non-profit entities are analytically akin to limits on expenditures by the donors. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 202, 101 S.Ct. 2712 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); <i>see also</i> Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. at 982 (\"[I]f George Soros's direct expenditure of $23 million on anti-Bush or pro-Kerry ads is constitutionally protected, how does he forfeit that protection if he combines his $23 million with $20 million from Peter Lewis and maybe another $10 million from some slightly smaller fry in a fund that takes out essentially the same ads and supports the same voter drives?\"). For that reason, a broad interpretation of footnote 48 would mean \"the entire <i>Buckley</i> edifice ... falls.\" Hasen, 153 U. PA. L.REV. at 70. \"Is that what the Court really intended buried in a few sentences of a footnote in one of the longest cases in Supreme Court history?\" <i>Id.</i> We think not.</p>\n<p>Second, footnote 48 simply cited <i>Cal-Med</i> together with <i>Buckley</i> in the course of establishing the constitutionality of limits on contributions to <i>political parties,</i> not to <i>non-profits</i> (which the Court had no need to address). In the key concluding sentence in the footnote, the Court rejected the idea that the government could only regulate \"<i>parties</i> as pass-throughs.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 152 n. 48, 124 S.Ct. 619 (emphasis added). Moreover, footnote 48 was responding to a point in Justice Kennedy's dissent that had nothing to do with non-profits. <i>See</i> Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. at 986 (\"importantly, the <i>McConnell</i> footnote was written in the course of the Court's analysis of BCRA's application of contribution limits to the activities of political parties\"). We would unfairly wrench footnote 48 from its context were we to adopt the broad interpretation some have proposed.</p>\n<p>Third, in a later passage in the <i>McConnell</i> opinion, the Court explained that, under the statute, \"[i]nterest groups ... remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,\" and advertisements. 540 U.S. at 187, 124 S.Ct. 619. That passageand the accompanying discussion would make little sense if footnote 48 were read to equate non-profits with political parties.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the Fourth Circuit in <i>North Carolina Right to Life</i> refused to adopt this broad reading of footnote 48; it eschewed the dissenting judge's extensive reliance on it. <i>See</i> 525 F.3d at 333-34 (Michael, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>In short, we decline to read this footnote addressing a different issue in <i>McConnell</i> to indirectly (i) overrule <i>Buckley,</i> (ii) discard Justice Blackmun's opinion in <i>Cal-Med,</i> and (iii) equate non-profits with political parties, contrary to other discussion in <i>McConnell.</i></p>\n<p>[14]  We need not decide whether the regulations are subject to the strictest scrutiny applicable to spending restrictions or the still \"rigorous\" but slightly lesser \"closely drawn\" scrutiny applicable to contribution restrictions. <i>See generally </i><i>Davis v. FEC,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2759, 2770-72, 171 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008); <i>FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL),</i> 551 U.S. 449, 464, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007); <i>Buckley v.

Under either permutation of this \"exacting\" scrutiny, <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 16, 96 S.Ct. 612, the regulations violate the First Amendment. That said, the allocation and \"mere reference\" regulations of §§ 106.6(c) and 106.6(f) are best considered spending restrictions under the analysis set forth in <i>Wisconsin Right to Life.</i> 551 U.S. at 457, 477 n. 9, 478-79, 127 S.Ct. 2652; <i>see also </i><i>Cal. Med. Ass'n v. FEC,</i> 453 U.S. 182, 203, 101 S.Ct. 2712, 69 L.Ed.2d 567 (1981) (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (limits on donations to non-profits subject to strict scrutiny). In <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> the Court indicated that forcing an entity to spend out of a segregated fund subject to source and amount limitations, rather than its general treasury, was a spending restriction. 551 U.S. at 477 n. 9, 127 S.Ct. 2652. So too here. Unlike BCRA's rules for political parties, moreover, these regulations do not limit how much someone can contribute to EMILY's List or other covered non-profits. Rather, these regulations force non-profit entities to pay for a large percentage of their varied political activities out of hard-money accounts subject to source and amount ($5000) limits rather than out of soft-money accounts that may receive unlimited donations. Through this mechanism, the regulations limit how much non-profits ultimately can spend on advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. These regulations therefore \"reduce[] the quantity of expression\" for groups like EMILY's List \"by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 19, 96 S.Ct. 612. As a rough analogy, consider a law that requires home buyers to pay a 50% cash down payment to obtain a mortgage. That kind of law would significantly limit how much buyers could afford to spend for a new house. A similar dynamic is at play as a result of these regulations.</p>\n<p>[15]  The regulations apply only to those non-profits that must register with the FEC as political committeesnamely, groups that receive or spend more than $1000 annually for the purpose of influencing a federal election and whose \"major purpose\" involves federal elections. <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 79, 96 S.Ct. 612; <i>see</i> 2 U.S.C. §§ 431-434, 441a; <i>supra</i> note 7. Our constitutional analysis of donations and spending limits applies both to non-connected non-profits registered as political committees with the FEC and to non-connected non-profits that are not so registered. The fact that a non-profit spends a certain amount or percentage of its money in relation to federal elections cannot be a basis, at least under the anti-corruption rationale, for restricting its ability to accept large donations to support those expenditures. That conclusion follows from the Supreme Court's consistent holdings that large expenditures are constitutionally protected and the corresponding principle that non-profits are constitutionally entitled to accept large donations to their soft-money accounts to support advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration activities. Of course, because of the lesser First Amendment protection against disclosure, the major purpose test is permissible under current precedent for determining non-profits' disclosure obligations. <i>See </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 79, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>[16]  This case does not involve reporting and disclosure obligations. The Government has a freer hand in imposing reporting and disclosure requirements than it does in limiting contributions and expenditures. <i>See </i><i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 121-22, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64-68, 96 S.Ct. 612.</p>\n<p>[17]  As explained earlier in this opinion, those approaches run into severe First Amendment obstacles. For purposes of this discussion, however, we analyze the statute as written without regard to constitutional implications.</p>\n<p>[18]  As discussed above, § 106.6(c) also requires non-profits to use their federal or hard-money accounts to pay for (i) at least 50% of their generic get-out-the vote and voter registration activities and (ii) at least 50% of their generic communications, which refer to a party but not a candidate. In its brief, EMILY's List does not raise statutory challenges to those two provisions. <i>See</i> EMILY's List Br. at 35-40; <i>id.</i> at 38 (challenging under the statute only that provision in § 106.6(c) that sets forth a \"`Minimum Percentages' Rule for Administrative Costs\"). Presumably, EMILY's List has not challenged these two provisions under FECA because <i>McConnell</i> indicated that these generic activities qualify under the statute as activities and communications \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections. <i>See </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 123, 124 S.Ct. 619 (\"Although <i>a literal reading of FECA's definition of `contribution' would have required such activities to be funded with hard money,</i> the FEC ruled that political parties could fund mixed-purpose activitiesincluding get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertisingin part with soft money.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[19]  The original FEC proposal was far narrower and would have covered only communications that promote, attack, support, or oppose federal candidates, similar to BCRA's requirement for state and local parties. <i>See</i> 69 Fed. Reg. at 11,753, 11,757-11,758 (Mar. 11, 2004) (notice of proposed rulemaking). After initially considering that limited proposal, the FEC ultimately decided to regulate broadly and to saddle non-profits with even greater restrictions than Congress in BCRA chose to impose on state and local parties.</p>\n<p>[20]  EMILY's List separately argues that three of the five regulatory provisions at issue in this case are also arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. EMILY's List Br. at 40-44. We are less persuaded by EMILY's List's freestanding arbitrary and capricious argument. Putting aside the constitutional and statutory-authority problems with the challenged rules, the provisions are not otherwise arbitrary and capricious. Agencies generally do not violate the APA's deferential arbitrary-and-capricious standard when they employ bright-line rules for reasons of administrative convenience, so long as those rules fall within a zone of reasonableness and are reasonably explained. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>ExxonMobil Gas Mktg. Co. v. FERC,</i> 297 F.3d 1071, 1084 (D.C.Cir.2002); <i>WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC,</i> 238 F.3d 449, 461-62 (D.C.Cir.2001).\n</p>\n<p>EMILY's List does not bring a challenge under either FECA or the APA to § 106.6(c)'s requirement that covered non-profits pay at least 50% of the cost of their generic communications out of their hard-money accounts. <i>See</i> EMILY's List Br. at 35-44. EMILY's List raises only a constitutional challenge to that provision.</p>\n<p>[21]  The concurrence notes that <i>McConnell</i> upheld § 323(f) of BCRA, which prohibits state and local candidates and officeholders from using soft money for communications that promote, support, attack, or oppose a federal candidate. We fail to see how this aspect of <i>McConnell</i> justifies upholding limits on <i>non-profits. McConnell,</i> as we read it, relied in part on the fact that officeholders, candidates, and parties at all levels share a close relationship and apparent unity of interest. And the Court also based its conclusion with respect to state and local candidates and officeholdersas elsewhereon \"the record in this litigation,\" 540 U.S. at 185, 124 S.Ct. 619, emphasizing that \"Congress must show concrete evidence that a particular type of financial transaction is corrupting or gives rise to the appearance of corruption.... It has done so here.\" <i>Id.</i> at 185-86 n. 72, 124 S.Ct. 619.\n</p>\n<p>The concurrence also raises concern about the activities of non-profit committees that are \"closely aligned\" with federal candidates. Concurring Op. at 36-37. But our constitutional analysis of non-profits applies only to <i>non-connected</i> non-profits. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(a); <i>supra</i> note 7. Moreover, expenditures by individuals or non-profits that are coordinated with a candidate may be considered contributions to that candidate.</p>\n<p>[22]  The concurrence finds \"perplexing[ ]\" our reading of <i>McConnell</i>'s statutory discussion. Concurring Op. at 30. We think it's straightforward. <i>McConnell</i> said the statutory phrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections covers generic activities. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 167, 124 S.Ct. 619. That seems to foreclose any <i>statutory</i> challenge to the new regulatory provisions applicable to generic activities. But that of course does not resolve EMILY's List's <i>constitutional</i> challenge.</p>\n<p>[23]  Even if EMILY's List had put forward meritorious statutory challenges to all of the regulatory provisions that it has challenged under the First Amendment, we still would possess discretion to rule in the alternative on both statutory and constitutional grounds. The avoidance principle cited by the concurrence is prudential, not jurisdictional. And it is not uncommon for lower courts to rule on alternative statutory and constitutional grounds when appropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 572 F.3d 945, 949-51 (D.C.Cir.2009); <i>Time Warner Entm't Co., L.P. v. FCC,</i> 240 F.3d 1126, 1128 (D.C.Cir.2001); <i>see generally</i> Richard H. Fallon, Jr. &amp; Daniel J. Meltzer, <i>New Law, Non-Retroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies,</i> 104 HARV. L.REV. 1731, 1801 (1991) (\"Simply as a routine matter, the Supreme Court, in common with the lower federal courts, may choose to discuss either or both of alternative grounds for reaching a decision.\").\n</p>\n<p>Given that the complaint in this case was filed four and a half years ago, that the parties and the District Court overwhelmingly focused their attention on the constitutional issue, that resolution of the case only on statutory grounds would not alleviate the continuing legal uncertainty, and that this is an area of law demanding prompt and clear judicial decisionmaking, it would not be an inappropriate exercise of judicial discretion for an intermediate court to resolve this case on alternative constitutional and statutory grounds.</p>\n<p>In any event, we need not cross that discretionary bridge here because, as we have explained, we must address the Constitution's application to non-profits' election-related spending and fundraising in order to resolve the appeal.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>See, e.g.,</i> Political Committee Status, Definition of Contribution, and Allocation for Separate Segregated Funds and Nonconnected Committees, 69 Fed.Reg. 68,056, 68,062 (Nov. 23, 2004) (Final Rules) (\"[R]eferences solely to a political party inherently influence both Federal and non-Federal elections.\").</p>\n<p>[2]  <i>Cf.</i> 42 U.S.C. § 1973c (under the Voting Rights Act, certain jurisdictions cannot alter their voting procedures without showing the change \"neither has the <i>purpose</i> nor will have the <i>effect</i> of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>[3]  It is also no defense to say that under <i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976), <i>everything</i> political committees do reflects federal purposes. <i>See </i><i>EMILY's List v. FEC,</i> 569 F.Supp.2d 18, 44 (D.D.C.2008) (\"EMILY's List is undoubtedly correct that its status as a political committee does not automatically give the FEC authority to regulate its legitimately nonfederal election activities.\"). In <i>Buckley,</i> the Court explained \"[e]xpenditures of ... `political committees'... can be assumed to fall within the core area sought to be addressed by Congress.\" 424 U.S. at 79, 96 S.Ct. 612. This \"assum[ption],\" however, is rebutted when it is unreasonable to posit a federal purpose. <i>See </i><i>Akins v. FEC,</i> 101 F.3d 731, 742 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (en banc) <i>vac'd on other grounds</i> 524 U.S. 1, 118 S.Ct. 1772, 141 L.Ed.2d 1 (1998) <i>(Buckley</i> only \"creat[es] a presumption\" of a federal purpose).</p>\n<p>[4]  \"[R]eferring to Senator Stabenow might well inspire recipients outside of her home state to contribute to her campaign, and thus influence her federal election, or might otherwise raise her national profile and ultimately influence her election,\" <i>EMILY's List,</i> 569 F.Supp.2d. at 48, but if such speculative brainstorming can satisfy FECA's \"purpose\" requirement, there is no \"purpose\" requirement.</p>\n<p>[5]  My hypothetical is similar to one EMILY's List posed to the FEC, with the only material difference being the inclusion of a party label. While the FEC said EMILY's List's solicitation was fine, <i>see</i> FEC Advisory Op.2005-13, at 5-6 (Oct. 20, 2005), it could not have said the same for mine: including \"Democrat\" an important label in state politics too causes the gift to be hard money.</p>\n<p>[6]  A \"generic voter drive\" includes \"any . . . activities that urge the general public to .. . support candidates ... <i>associated with a particular issue,</i> without mentioning a specific candidate.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(b)(1)(iii) (emphasis added). Thus, if a committee says \"support candidates for the General Assembly who oppose human cloning\" in an odd-numbered year, hard money is required.</p>\n<p>[7]  \"Generic party advertising\" is not in the United States Code or the Code of Federal Regulations. It was used by the <i>McConnell</i> district court to mean, naturally, ads that support a party. <i>See</i> 251 F.Supp.2d 176, 199 (D.D.C.2003) (per curiam) (\"[N]ational parties expended $14 million in nonfederal funds for `generic' party advertising, consisting predominantly of television advertisements that did not mention candidates names, but urged viewers to simply vote for a particular party or stressed themes from the presidential campaigns.\"); <i>id.</i> at 1994 (separate opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (\"generic party advertising (that is, `Vote Republican!')\").</p>\n<p>[8]  Even if we assume EMILY's List has inadequately raised this issue, waiver is a prudential doctrinenot jurisdictional. <i>E.g., </i><i>Mitchell v. Fishbein,</i> 377 F.3d 157, 164-65 (2d Cir.2004). And though my colleagues are mistaken on waiver, if they were truly concerned about this, we could order additional briefing. <i>E.g., </i><i>U.S. Nat'l Bank v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc.,</i> 508 U.S. 439, 444-48, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (holding the D.C. Circuit did not err in ordering supplemental briefing on a subject not raised because \"when an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law\").</p>\n<p>[9]  Consistent with its briefing, during oral argument counsel for EMILY's List was more circumspect than the court is today:\n</p>\n<p>The Court: Would your position preclude say regulation of get out the vote drives, or voter registration, or that sort of thing? Do you think that would be beyond the FEC's purview?</p>\n<p>EMILY's List: No, Your Honor, we don't take that position, we take the position that reasonable regulations to account for the federal election related impact of that activity are permissible.</p>\n<p>Tr. of Oral Arg. at 9. <i>Cf.</i> Maj. Op. at 17 (\"[N]on-profits are constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of such voter drive activities out of their soft-money accounts.\").</p>\n<p>[10]  In fact, EMILY's List does not mention <i>Cal-Med</i> until its reply brief, and neither party cites <i>Cal-Med</i> for a proposition integral to the court's holding. EMILY's List does cite, once, as a \"see also,\" <i>Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley,</i> 454 U.S. 290, 102 S.Ct. 434, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981), but for a background principle. EMILY's List Br. at 23-24. The FEC cites <i>MCFL</i> in a footnote for an immaterial point, FEC Br. at 23 n. 17, but does not mention <i>NCPAC, Citizens Against Rent Control,</i> or <i>North Carolina Right to Life.</i></p>\n<p>[11]  Many of the articles do not support the court, and not one squarely does. <i>E.g.,</i> Edward B. Foley, <i>The \"Major Purpose\" Test: Distinguishing Between Election-Focused and Issue-Focused Groups,</i> 31 N. KY. L.REV. 341, 344 (2004) (\"[I]n my judgment contributions to political committees should be classified under the First Amendment with contributions to political parties....\"); Richard L. Hasen, Buckley <i>is Dead, Long Live</i> Buckley, 153 U. PA. L.REV. 31, 72 (2004) (explaining that because of the \"considerable deference\" it displayed, \"[l]ower courts showing fidelity to <i>McConnell</i> will have a difficult time striking down most campaign finance regulation\").</p>\n<p>[12]  This a facial challenge. For such claims, \"exercising judicial restraint ... frees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.\" <i>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party,</i> 552 U.S. 442, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 1190-91, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008). As a rule, a law is facially repugnant only if it \"is unconstitutional in all of its applications,\" but there is a narrow First Amendment exception where \"a law may be overturned [if] a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,\" <i>id.</i> at 1191 n. 6. Those seeking this \"strong medicine,\" <i>id.,</i> however, face a \"heavy burden,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 207, 124 S.Ct. 619.</p>\n<p>[13]  In defining its mission, EMILY's List explains that it \"is committed to a three-pronged strategy to elect pro-choice Democratic women: recruiting and funding viable women candidates; helping them build and run effective campaign organizations; and mobilizing women voters to help elect progressive candidates across the nation.\" EMILY's List, Our Mission, <i>http://emilyslist.org/about/mission/</i> (last visited Aug. 28, 2009).</p>\n<p>[14]  The court relies heavily on Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in <i>Cal-Med,</i> arguing that it is controlling. But the opinion is controlling, if at all, only for \"points that can be said to be fairly subsumed within the reasoning of the plurality.\" John C. Eastman, <i>Strictly Scrutinizing Campaign Finance Restrictions (and the Courts that Judge Them),</i> 50 CATH. U.L. REV. 13, 37 (2000); <i>see </i><i>Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). This circuit has clarified it is only the narrowest opinion's overlap with the broader opinion that counts. \"<i>Marks</i> is workableone opinion can be meaningfully regarded as `narrower' than another only when one opinion is a logical subset of other, broader opinions. In essence, the narrowest opinion must represent a common denominator of the Court's reasoning; it must embody a position implicitly approved by at least five Justices who support the judgment.\" <i>King v. Palmer,</i> 950 F.2d 771, 781 (D.C.Cir.1991) (en banc). Presumably then, the controlling part of Justice Blackmun's opinion is the holding that the FEC may constitutionally regulate contributions to fund independent political expenditures without contravening the First Amendmentno more and no less.</p>\n<p>[15]  Britt Cocanour, EMILY's List Chief of Staff, avowed her committee \"has helped to elect sixty-eight Democratic women to Congress, thirteen to the U.S. Senate, eight to governorships, and over 350 to other state and local offices.\" Joint Appendix at 70.</p>\n<p>[16]  The court suggests <i>McConnell</i> guarantees \"`interest groups'\" the right \"`to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,' and advertising.\" Maj. Op. at 14 (quoting 540 U.S. at 187, 124 S.Ct. 619). But <i>McConnell</i> only notes BCRA can treat interest groups differently than parties without violating Due Process. <i>See</i> 540 U.S. at 188, 124 S.Ct. 619. There is a difference between noting Congress has not regulated and holding Congress cannot regulate. <i>See </i><i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 333-34 (Michael, J., dissenting) (discussing <i>McConnell</i>'s reference to \"interest groups\").</p>\n<p>[17]  Though these regulations go further than BCRA § 323(f), by the court's opinion, it would not matter if they were exactly the same: nonprofits are categorically distinct. <i>See</i> Maj.

It challenges several new Federal Election Commission regulations that restrict how non-profits may spend and raise money to advance their preferred policy positions and candidates. EMILY's List argues that the regulations violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, protects the right of individual citizens to spend unlimited amounts to express their views about policy issues and candidates for public office. Similarly, the First Amendment, as the Court has construed it, safeguards the right of citizens to band together and pool their resources as an unincorporated group or non-profit organization in order to express their views about policy issues and candidates for public office. We agree with EMILY's List that the new FEC regulations contravene those principles and violate the First Amendment. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and direct it to enter judgment for EMILY's List and to vacate the challenged regulations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In the wake of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the Supreme Court's 2003 decision in <i>McConnell v. FEC</i><i>,</i> the election season of 2004 erupted with bitter accusations about the activities of certain non-profit entities. The controversy was popularly known by a single term\"527s\"that refers to the section of the tax code applicable to nonprofits engaged in political activities. The debate arose after wealthy individuals contributed huge sums of money to nonprofits ranging from America Coming Together to MoveOn.org to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in order to support advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. In total during the 2004 campaign, these groups reportedly spent several hundred million dollars.</p>\n<p>As the campaign unfolded, many in both major partiesincluding President Bush and Senator Kerryquestioned the activities of certain non-profits. Some encouraged the FEC to ban large donations to non-profit entities in the same way that Congress in BCRA had banned large contributions to political parties. Proponents of additional regulation reasoned that non-profits had replaced political parties as the soft-money \"loophole\" in the campaign finance system. <i>See</i> Edward B. Foley &amp; Donald Tobin, <i>The New Loophole?: 527s, Political Committees, and McCain-Feingold,</i> BNA MONEY &amp; POL. REP., Jan. 7, 2004.</p>\n<p>In response, the FEC did not <i>ban</i> non-profits from receiving and spending large donations, as some had urged. But the FEC did <i>limit</i> how much non-profits such as EMILY's List could raise and spend. The FEC achieved this objective by dictating that covered non-profits pay for a large percentage of election-related activities out of their hard-money accounts. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. §§ 106.6(c), (f).<sup>[1]</sup> Because donations to those hard-money accounts are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> capped at $5000 annually for individual contributors, the FEC's allocation regulations substantially restrict the ability of non-profits to spend money for election-related activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. The regulations separately require that donations to non-profits be considered hard money subject to the $5000 cap if the corresponding solicitation indicated that donations would be used to support the election or defeat of a federal candidate. <i>See id.</i> § 100.57.</p>\n<p>In early 2005, EMILY's List filed suit, arguing that the new regulations violated the First Amendment and the Federal Election Campaign Act. In 2008, the District Court upheld the regulations in their entirety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>To assess the constitutionality of the new FEC regulations, we initially must address at some length the relevant First Amendment principles set forth by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law .. . abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const. amend.

In perhaps the most important sentence in the Court's entire campaign finance jurisprudence, <i>Buckley</i> stated: \"[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" 424 U.S. at 48-49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court has rejected <i>expenditure</i> limits on individuals, groups, candidates, and parties, even though expenditures may confer benefits on candidates. And the Court has upheld limits on for-profit corporations' and unions' use of their general treasury funds to make campaign contributions to candidates or political parties or to make expenditures for activities expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>This case does not involve regulation of candidates, parties, or for-profit corporations. Rather, this case concerns the FEC's regulation of <i>non-profit entities</i> that are not connected to a candidate, party, or for-profit corporation. We thus must consider how the constitutional principles outlined above apply to non-profitsand in particular to three different kinds of non-profits: (i) those that only make expenditures; (ii) those that only make contributions to candidates or parties; and (iii) those that do both. For purposes of the First Amendment analysis, the central issue turns out to be whether independent non-profits are treated like individual citizens (who under <i>Buckley</i> have the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates) or like political parties (which under <i>McConnell</i> do not have the right to raise and spend unlimited soft money).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The first relevant category of non-profit entities consists of those that only make expenditures for political activities such as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. Non-profits in this category make no contributions to federal candidates or parties.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's case law establishes that those nonprofit entities, like individual citizens, are constitutionally entitled to raise and spend unlimited money in support of candidates for elected officewith the narrow exception that, under <i>Austin,</i> the Government may restrict to some degree how non-profits spend donations received from the general treasuries of for-profit corporations or unions. <i>See </i><i>Cal.

After all, if one person is constitutionally entitled to spend $1 million to run advertisements supporting a candidate (as <i>Buckley</i> held), it logically follows that 100 people are constitutionally entitled to donate $10,000 each to a non-profit group that will run advertisements supporting a candidate.<sup>[9]</sup> Put another way: \"If the First Amendment prohibits any limitation on how much money an independent political committee can spend on an independent-expenditure campaign, how can it permit limits on donations to committees that make only independent expenditures?\" Richard Briffault, <i>The 527 Problem and the</i> Buckley <i>Problem,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 949, 982 (2005); <i>see also</i> Edward B. Foley, <i>The \"Major Purpose\" Test: Distinguishing Between Election-Focused and Issue-Focused Groups,</i> 31 N. KY. L.REV. 341, 343 (2004) (stating \"baseline proposition that it would be unconstitutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> to limit the contributions that individuals may give to ideological groups to be used for electoral purposes\"); Note, <i>The Unconstitutionality of Limitations on Contributions to Political Committees in the 1976 Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments,</i> 86 YALE L.J. 953 (1977).</p>\n<p>These Supreme Court decisions reflect, moreover, the commonsense proposition that regulation of non-profits does not fit within the anti-corruption rationale, which constitutes the sole basis for regulating campaign contributions and expenditures. <i>See </i><i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2773. As the Court has explained the anti-corruption principle, mere <i>donations</i> to non-profit groups cannot corrupt candidates and officeholders. In the words of the Fourth Circuit, it is \"implausible that contributions to independent expenditure political committees are corrupting.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 293 (internal quotation marks omitted). And to the extent a non-profit then <i>spends</i> its donations on activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives, those expenditures are not considered corrupting, even though they may generate gratitude from and influence with officeholders and candidates. Rather, under <i>Buckley,</i> those expenditures are constitutionally protected. Therefore, limiting donations to and spending by non-profits in order to prevent corruption of candidates and officeholders represents a kind of \"prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis\" regulation to which the Supreme Court has emphatically stated, \"Enough is enough.\" <i>FEC v.

Those non-profit groups receive full First Amendment protection and are entitled to receive donations and make expenditures because they \"offer an opportunity for ordinary citizens to band together to speak on the issue or issues most important to them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 295. We agree with Judge Wilkinson's assessment of the state of the law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>The second relevant category of non-profits consists of those that only make contributions to federal candidates or political parties and make no expenditures. Given the constitutionally permissible caps on an individual donor's contributions to candidates or parties, the Supreme Court has acknowledged the risk that individuals might use non-profits to evade those limits. In order to prevent circumvention of limits on an individual donor's contributions to candidates and parties, the Court has held that non-profit entities can be required to make their own contributions to candidates and parties, as well as pay associated administrative expenses, out of a hard-money account that is subject to source and amount restrictions. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 198-99, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(non-profit committee is \"natural conduit for candidate contributions and ... the essential purpose of the provision here in question <i>is to limit those contributions, not to limit expenditures for any other type of political advocacy\")</i> (emphasis added).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Consistent with <i>Cal-Med</i>'s ruling, FECA limits contributors to donating a maximum of $5000 per year to a non-profit's hard-money account. A non-profit in turn may contribute to a candidate or party only from that hard-money account. <i>See</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C). And an individual's contribution to a non-profit's hard-money account may count against the individual's aggregate annual contribution limits. <i>See</i> 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(3).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>What about a non-profit entity that falls into both categoriesin other words, a non-profit that makes expenditures <i>and</i> makes contributions to candidates or parties? EMILY's List is a good example of such a hybrid non-profit: It makes expenditures for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives; it also makes direct contributions to candidates and parties. In all of its activities, its mission is to promote and safeguard abortion rights and to support the election of pro-choice Democratic women to federal, state, and local offices nationwide.</p>\n<p>The constitutional principles that govern such a hybrid non-profit entity follow ineluctably from the well-established principles governing the other two categories of non-profits. To prevent circumvention of contribution limits by individual donors, non-profit entities may be required to make their own contributions to federal candidates and parties out of a hard-money accountthat is, an account subject to source and amount limitations ($5000 annually per contributor). Similarly, non-profits also may be compelled to use their hard-money accounts to pay an appropriately tailored share of administrative expenses associated with their contributions. <i>See </i><i>Cal-Med,</i> 453 U.S. at 198-99 n. 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2712</span></a></span> (opinion of Marshall, J.). But non-profit entities are entitled to make their expendituressuch as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drivesout of a soft-money or general treasury account that is not subject to source and amount limits. Stated another way: A non-profit that makes expenditures to support federal candidates does not suddenly forfeit its First Amendment rights when it decides also to make direct contributions to parties or candidates. Rather, it simply must ensure, to avoid circumvention of individual contribution limits by its donors, that its contributions to parties or candidates come from a hard-money account.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> C</h2>\n<p>How does <i>McConnell</i> affect the above principles governing non-profits? <i>McConnell</i> upheld congressionally imposed limits on <i>political parties</i> receiving or spending soft money. Some have argued that the Government can similarly restrict soft-money contributions to and spending by <i>nonprofits.</i> In this case, the District Court accepted that reasoning in ruling for the FEC; it found non-profits similarly situated to political parties for purposes of the First Amendment analysis.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, however, <i>McConnell</i> does not support such regulation of non-profits. <i>McConnell</i> affirmed BCRA's limits on contributions to political parties because of the close ties between candidates and parties and the extensive record evidence of what it deemed a threat of actual or apparent corruptionspecifically, the <i>access</i> to federal officials and candidates that large soft-money contributors to <i>political parties</i> received in exchange for their contributions. The Court said that it was \"not unwarranted for Congress to conclude that the selling of access gives rise to the appearance of corruption.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 154, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court expressly based its conclusion on the \"close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship....\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Unlike the political parties examined in <i>McConnell,</i> there is no record evidence that non-profit entities have sold access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large contributions. <i>See also</i> Craig Holman, <i>The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act: Limits and Opportunities for Non-Profit Groups in Federal Elections,</i> 31 N. KY. L.REV. 243, 280 (2004) (\"Today's electioneering non-profit groups ... can make no such promises of access in exchange for a soft money contribution.\").</p>\n<p>More fundamentally, non-profit groups do not have the same inherent relationship with federal candidates and officeholders that political parties do. The <i>McConnell</i> Court identified numerous \"real-world differences between political parties and interest groups.\" 540 U.S. at 188, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. \"Interest groups do not select slates of candidates for elections. Interest groups do not determine who will serve on legislative committees, elect congressional leadership, or organize legislative caucuses. Political parties have influence and power in the Legislature that vastly exceeds that of any interest group. As a result, it is hardly surprising that party affiliation is the primary way by which voters identify candidates, or that parties in turn have special access to and relationships with federal officeholders.\" <i>Id.</i> As noted in <i>McConnell,</i> Congress recognized these differences and enacted a statutory scheme under which \"[i]nterest groups ... remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,\" and advertising. <i>Id.</i> at 187, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In sum, it will not work to simply transport <i>McConnell</i>'s holding from the political party context to the non-profit setting. On this question as well, we agree with Judge Wilkinson: \"It is ... not an exaggeration to say that <i>McConnell</i> views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 293.</p>\n<p>For non-profit entities, the most pertinent Supreme Court precedents remain <i>Buckley, Cal-Med, Citizens Against Rent Control, NCPAC,</i> and <i>MCFL.</i> As discussed above, those cases ultimately stand for the proposition that non-profit groups may accept unlimited donations to their soft-money accounts. And subject to the one <i>Austin</i>-based exception, non-profit groups like individual citizensmay spend unlimited amounts out of their soft-money accounts for election-related activities such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> III</h2>\n<p>We now consider whether the 2004 FEC regulations at issue in this case comport with the relevant constitutional principles. They do not.</p>\n<p>The fundamental flaw, as counsel for EMILY's List succinctly stated at oral argument, is that the Commission improperly \"brought to bear what was essentially a political party analysis to a non-connected, independent committee which is not under the control of, or associated with candidates in the fashion of a political party.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. at 4.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The rules set forth in §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 contain five relevant provisions. In our judgment, the provisions are not closely drawn to meet an important governmental interest.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Under the Supreme Court's precedents, non-profit entities may be required to use their hard-money accounts for their own contributions to candidates and parties and for an appropriately tailored share of administrative expenses associated with such contributions. But as explained above, non-profits may not be forced to use their hard-money accounts for expenditures such as advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. Non-profitslike individual citizensare entitled to spend and raise unlimited money for those activities. The FEC's five new regulatory provisions flout those principles.</p>\n<p>First, the regulations require covered<sup>[15]</sup> non-profit entities to use their hard-money accounts to pay at least 50% of the costs of their generic get-out-the-vote efforts and voter registration activities. 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). By \"generic,\" the regulations mean those activities that refer to a party but do not promote or oppose a particular candidate. <i>See id.</i> § 100.25.

Donations to and spending by a <i>non-profit</i> cannot corrupt a candidate or officeholder, at least in the absence of some <i>McConnell</i>-like evidence establishing such corruption or the appearance thereof. <i>See </i><i>N.C. Right to Life, Inc. v. Leake,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1025593\"><a href=\"/opinion/1025593/north-carolina-right-to-life-inc-v-leake/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 292-93 (4th Cir.2008); <i>see also</i> Richard Briffault, <i>The 527 Problem and the</i> Buckley <i>Problem,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 949, 999 (2005) (\"The 527s do not fit easily within <i>Buckley's</i> anticorruption paradigm, at least as the Supreme Court has defined corruption until now.\"); Gregg D. Polsky &amp; Guy-Uriel E. Charles, <i>Regulating Section 527 Organizations,</i> 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. 1000, 1027-35 (2005).</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that the regulations do not serve a cognizable anti-corruption interest is not surprising because the decision to more tightly regulate entities like EMILY's List arose out of an entirely different concern: the influence of non-profits that raise and spend large amounts of money and thereby affect federal elections. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Comments of Democracy 21, Campaign Legal Center &amp; Center for Responsive Politics in Response to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, No.2004-6, at 1-2 (Apr. 5, 2004) (criticizing \"the spending of tens of millions of dollars of soft money explicitly for the purpose of influencing the presidential election by section 527 groups\"). Responding to such complaints, the FEC adopted these new regulations to tamp down spending by non-profits and thereby better equalize the voices of citizens and groups who participate in the political process. Large donations to and spending by non-profits prompted these regulations, and limiting non-profits' expenditures is their intended and predictable effect.</p>\n<p>But the Supreme Court's First Amendment cases have repeatedly repudiated this equalization rationale as a basis for regulating campaign-related contributions or expenditures. <i>See </i><i>Davis,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2773; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 48-49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>. Under current law, therefore, these regulations are unsupportable. The concern with \"large individual donations to the 527s is that they permit a tiny group of Americansthe wealthiest ...to play an enormous role in the electoral process.... <i>Buckley,</i> however, rejected the protection of political equality as a basis for limiting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> the role of money in election campaigns.\" Briffault, 73 GEO. WASH. L.REV. at 954 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>As a lower court, we must strictly adhere to the Supreme Court's precedents. The regulations contravene the First Amendment as it has been interpreted thus far by the Supreme Court.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As some commentators point out, it might seem incongruous to permit non-profits to receive and spend large soft-money donations when political parties and candidates cannot. <i>See</i> Samuel Issacharoff &amp; Pamela S. Karlan, <i>The Hydraulics of Campaign Finance Reform,</i> 77 TEX. L.REV. 1705, 1715 (1999). But this perceived anomaly has existed to some extent since <i>Buckley,</i> which recognized that contribution limitations \"alone would not reduce the greater potential voice of affluent persons and well-financed groups, who would remain free to spend unlimited sums directly to promote candidates and policies they favor in an effort to persuade voters.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 26 n. 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>. And <i>McConnell</i> similarly took note of the fact that, even after that decision upholding regulations on contributions to parties, \"[i]nterest groups ... remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,\" and advertisements. <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 187, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span> (2003).</p>\n<p>If eliminating this perceived asymmetry is deemed necessary, the constitutionally permitted legislative solution, as the Court stated in an analogous situation in <i>Davis,</i> is \"to raise or eliminate\" limits on contributions to parties or candidates. 128 S.Ct. at 2774. But it is not permissible, at least under current Supreme Court precedents, to remove the incongruity by placing these limits on spending by or donations to non-profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>In addition to its First Amendment challenge to the five regulatory provisions, EMILY's List alternatively contends that three of the five provisions exceed the FEC's statutory authority. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C) (agency may not act \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\"). We agree.</p>\n<p>When enacting BCRA in 2002, Congress did not authorize the FEC to restrict donations to or spending by nonprofitseven though Congress was aware that BCRA's restrictions on political parties meant that independent non-profit groups would become more influential in the electoral process. Indeed, Senator Lieberman, speaking in the Senate at the time, anticipated that \"at least some of the soft money donors who will no longer be able to give to political parties will be looking for other ways to influence our elections. Donations to 527 groups will probably top many of their lists.\" 148 CONG. REC. S10779 (daily ed. Oct. 17, 2002) (statement of Sen. Lieberman). He was right. Yet in the seven years since BCRA was enacted, Congress still has not imposed limits on non-profits, apparently because of continuing constitutional and policy concerns about regulating them in such a manner.</p>\n<p>The statutory question, therefore, is whether the FEC's authority under the long-standing Federal Election Campaign Act justifies the challenged regulations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> Under FECA, the FEC's authority extends only to regulating donations and expenditures made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\" 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i). As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[d]onations made solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections are therefore unaffected by FECA's requirements and prohibitions.\" <i>McConnell v. FEC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 122, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984) (step one).</p>\n<p>The three regulatory provisions that EMILY's List challenges under FECA cross the statute's boundaries.</p>\n<p>EMILY's List targets one of the provisions in § 106.6(c) as exceeding the FEC's statutory authoritynamely, the part requiring covered non-profits to use their hard-money accounts to pay for 50% of their administrative expenses. This requirement applies even if more than 50% of a nonprofit's administrative expenses are <i>exclusively</i> associated with state and local elections. That poses a problem because the FEC possesses no authority under FECA to require nonprofits to use their hard-money accounts for their exclusively state and local election activities. We thus concur with EMILY's List that this provision is overbroad and \"federalizes the funding and reporting of a large portion of such a committee's nonfederal receipts and disbursements, which are not made for the purpose of influencing federal elections.\" EMILY's List Br. at 39.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p>Next, EMILY's List argues that § 106.6(f) exceeds the FEC's statutory authority. Recall that this provision requires covered non-profits to use hard money for all or part of their public communications that merely \"refer\" to federal candidates. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. 106.6(f). The FEC runs roughshod over the limits on its statutory authority when it presumes that any public communications that merely \"refer\" to a federal candidate necessarily seek to influence a <i>federal</i> election.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> For example, § 106.6(f) would compel a covered nonprofit to use some hard money to pay for an advertisement running only in California in which Senator Jones from Maine endorses Candidate Smith for Governor of California. The sole purpose of such an advertisement is to influence the state election in Californiaa matter entirely outside the FEC's statutory authority.</p>\n<p>An incident illustrating § 106.6(f)'s statutory flaws occurred in 2005. EMILY's List sought to run advertisements featuring Senator Stabenow in order to support Democratic women candidates for state legislative offices. At the time, Senator Stabenow was a candidate for reelection to the U.S. Senate in Michigan. EMILY's List represented that the communication would not be distributed in Michigan, would not reference Senator Stabenow's federal candidacy, would not solicit funds for her federal candidacy, and would not refer to any clearly identified non-federal candidate. Rather, it would support non-federal Democratic women candidates as a class. Nonetheless, the FEC determined that the mere reference to Senator Stabenow meant that EMILY's List had to pay for the communications with 100% hard money. <i>See</i> FEC Adv. Op.2005-13, at 3-4 (Oct. 20, 2005).</p>\n<p>Finally, EMILY's List argues that the solicitation rule set forth in § 100.57 also exceeds the FEC's statutory power. We agree. To reiterate, § 100.57 requires covered non-profits to treat as hard-money \"contributions\" <i>all</i> funds given in response to solicitations indicating that \"<i>any</i> portion\" of the funds received will be used to support or oppose the election of a federal candidate. 11 C.F.R. §§ 100.57(a)-(b)(1) (emphasis added). If the communication indicates that the funds will support or oppose both a federal and non-federal candidate, then at least 50% of those funds must be treated as hard money. <i>See id.</i> § 100.57(b)(2). The statutory defect in the rule is that, depending on the particular solicitation at issue, it requires covered non-profits to treat as hard money certain donations that are not actually made \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections.</p>\n<p>Consider a fundraising pitch in which a non-profit such as EMILY's List tells donors that only 10% of their gift will be used to support identified federal candidates, with the rest to <i>exclusively</i> support state and local candidates. Each donor fully and correctly understands that only a small portion of his or her gift will be used \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections. And yet, § 100.57 requires that at least 50% of donations in response to such a solicitation be classified as a hard-money donation subject to the $5000 cap thereby simultaneously creating a separate $5000 cap on soft-money donations given in response to such a solicitation. This may require a non-profit to decline or return funds it receives for purely state and local elections. That is not permissible under FECA.</p>\n<p>In short, there is a significant mismatch between these challenged provisions and the FEC's authority under FECA. Therefore, we conclude that §§ 106.6(f) and 100.57, as well as the provision in § 106.6(c) that applies to administrative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> expenses, exceed the FEC's statutory authority.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>Before concluding, we add a few words regarding the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p>To begin, it is important to emphasize the area of agreement between the opinion of the Court and the concurrence. All three judges on the panel have determined that §§ 106.6(c), 106.6(f), and 100.57 are unlawful and must be vacated.</p>\n<p>The concurrence advances two main points: (i) that under <i>McConnell,</i> the Federal Government constitutionally may regulate non-profits like political parties; and (ii) that we should not address the First Amendment issue in this case. Neither argument is convincing.</p>\n<p><i>First,</i> the concurrence contends that \"regulation of political parties is not McConnell's theme,\" and it reads McConnell to support regulation not only of political parties but also of independent non-profit groups. Concurring Op. at 34. As we have explained at length above, we do not find that a persuasive interpretation of McConnell. In upholding Title I of BCRA, the McConnell Court relied heavily on the \"unity of interest,\" \"close relationship,\" and \"close ties\" among candidates, officeholders, and political parties. The concurrence identifies no similar unity of interest between non-profits, on the one hand, and candidates, officeholders, or parties on the other. The McConnell Court also based its decision on the substantial record evidence of parties selling access in exchange for soft-money contributions. The Court repeatedly emphasized that \"Congress must show concrete evidence that a particular type of financial transaction is corrupting or gives rise to the appearance of corruption.... It has done so here.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 185-86 n. 72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. The concurrence cites no similar record evidence showing that non-profits sell access to officeholders and candidates in exchange for large soft-money contributions.</p>\n<p>In our judgment, \"<i>McConnell</i> views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees.\" <i>N.C. Right to Life v.

We therefore disagree with the concurrence's attempt to stretch <i>McConnell</i>'s reasoning from political parties to nonprofits.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> Relatedly, the concurrence disputes our reading of <i>Cal-Med.

We again respectfully disagree. The briefs and oral argument focused first and most extensively on the First Amendment and <i>McConnell</i> and debated the key question in this case: For First Amendment purposes, are non-profits more like individual citizens (who under <i>Buckley</i> have the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates) or more like political parties (which under <i>McConnell</i> do not)? <i>See </i><i>Buckley v.

Moreover, Cal-Med was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument. <i>See</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18, 32-33; FEC Br. at 21, 27, 28, 34; Amicus Br. at 21, 24; EMILY's List Reply Br. at 11, 19-20. Indeed, the FEC's brief noted that Cal-Med was a case \"chiefly relied upon.\" FEC Br. at iv. In short, the briefs and oral argument focused on and grappled with the critical issues posed by the First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>The concurrence suggests, however, that our holding goes further than the submission of EMILY's List. But EMILY's List forcefully argued that these regulations \"violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution,\" contended that <i>McConnell</i> and <i>Cal-Med</i> do not support the FEC's approach, and asked the Court to vacate the new regulations in their entirety. EMILY's List Br. at 19. In deciding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> this case, we have set forth the relevant constitutional principles as we discern them, and we then have applied those principles to the challenged regulations. In so doing, we have concluded that the regulations violate the First Amendment; we therefore have vacated the regulations, which is precisely the relief EMILY's List sought in advancing its First Amendment claims.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> apart from its substantive disagreement with our First Amendment analysis, the concurrence states that we should resolve this case on statutory grounds alone, and claims that it is \"gratuitous\" for us to address the First Amendment. We respectfully but firmly disagree.</p>\n<p>The threshold problem with the concurrence's preferred statutory-only approach is that EMILY's List raises a statutory challenge to only three of the five provisions at issue here. EMILY's List does not advance a statutory challenge to the provision in § 106.6(c) requiring that covered non-profits use their federal or hard-money accounts to pay for at least 50% of their generic get-out-the-vote and voter registration activities. Nor does EMILY's List raise a statutory challenge to the provision in § 106.6(c) requiring that covered nonprofits use hard money to pay for at least 50% of their generic communications. <i>Compare</i> EMILY's List Br. at 38-39 (discussing only administrative expenses provision of § 106.6(c) in statutory section of brief) <i>with</i> EMILY's List Br. at 32 (raising constitutional challenges to all provisions of § 106.6(c)). Indeed, footnote 11 of EMILY's List's brief all but concedes that, under the statute, the FEC may require use of hard money for these generic activities.</p>\n<p>EMILY's List's decision not to target these two provisions of § 106.6(c) on statutory grounds appears wise. Such an argument would be very difficult to square with <i>McConnell</i>'s several pointed statements that FECA permits the FEC to treat generic activities as entirely federal for purposes of contribution and expenditure limits. In fact, <i>McConnell</i> harshly criticized the FEC for not having previously treated political parties' generic activities as entirely federal activities subject to FECA's limits. <i>See </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I begin with first principles. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an agency within the Executive Branch. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> The Executive Branch cannot make law, but instead executes laws enacted by the Legislative Branch. In executing the law, the FEC may issue \"necessary\" rules, 2 U.S.C. § 437d(a)(8), but, as with all agencies, the FEC acts contrary to law if it promulgates regulations \"in excess of [its] statutory jurisdiction,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). <i>See also </i><i>La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111672\"><a href=\"/opinion/111672/louisiana-pub-serv-commn-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span>, 374, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111672\"><a href=\"/opinion/111672/louisiana-pub-serv-commn-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span> (1986) (\"[A]n agency literally has no power to act ... unless and until Congress confers power upon it.\").</p>\n<p>By the plain language of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), the FEC lacks the power it now asserts. To fall within FEC jurisdiction, a \"gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value\" must be provided to a political committee \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\" 2 U.S.C. § 431(8)(A)(i), and any money expended by such a committee must also have been done for that same purpose, <i>id.</i> § 431(9)(A)(i). There is no other reasonable way to read Congress's words. For the FEC to have any role, money must be used for the \"purpose\"defined as an \"objective, goal, or end,\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1356 (9th ed.2009)of \"influencing\" an \"election for Federal office.\" The inescapable corollary is the FEC has no authority over money given or spent \"solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections,\" an activity \"unaffected by FECA's requirements and prohibitions.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 122, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Here, the FEC has set aside Congress's command that the agency's jurisdiction be bounded by the \"purpose\" for which money is spent. Instead of strictly minding this jurisdictional marker, the FEC conclusively presumes a federal purpose drives any spending that might influence a federal election.<sup>[1]</sup> The question though is not whether spending influences a federal election, but whether it was spent for that reason. Otherwise, the word \"purpose\" becomes superfluous, a result that this court cannot accept, <i>e.g., </i><i>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (1979), especially for a jurisdictional provision like this one, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>N. Am. Van Lines, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"519488\"><a href=\"/opinion/519488/north-american-van-lines-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">869</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 598 (D.C.Cir.1989). Under FECA, federal effects are simply not enough.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor does labeling spending that may affect both state and federal elections as \"mixed-purpose\" somehow solve the FEC's problem. Regulating on the basis of such a label still assumes there must be a federal purpose behind any spending that might influence, even tangentially, a federal campaign. Because that necessary assumption is false, these regulations remain invalid. Only <i>after</i> a federal purposemixed or otherwiseis identified does the FEC's power come into play. If a federal purpose can be shown, then allocation ratios like those promulgated here may well be appropriate under FECA, but just asserting that there must be a federal purpose skips the threshold jurisdictional question.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> B.</h2>\n<p>These regulations give short shrift to the \"purpose\" of spending and so must be vacated. Indeed, we have already rejected the FEC's view. Just fours years ago, in <i>Shays v. FEC,</i> we held FECA requires that \"to qualify as `expenditure' in the first place, spending must be undertaken `for the purpose of influencing' a federal election\" and agreed with the FEC that \"time, place, and content may be critical indicia of communicative purpose.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186503\"><a href=\"/opinion/186503/shays-christopher-v-fec/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 99 (D.C.Cir.2005). Though a federal</p>\n<blockquote>election-related intent is obvious ... in statements urging voters to \"elect\" or \"defeat\" a specified candidate or party, the same may not be true of ads identifying a federal politician but focusing on pending legislationa proposed budget, for example, or government reform initiativesand appearing three years before the next election. Nor is such purpose necessarily evident in statements referring, say, to a Connecticut senator but running only in San Francisco media markets.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>Shays</i> confirms what FECA says: context matters. Referencing a federal candidate \"may\" reveal a federal purpose, but if an ad will not be aired to her constituents or if it will run \"years before the next election,\" then absent some persuasive indicia of a federal purpose, a reference by itself to the candidate does not trigger FEC jurisdiction. This was the FEC's position in <i>Shays,</i> and it should be the FEC's position now. FECA's unambiguous text requires no less.</p>\n<p>Under the <i>Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation,</i> political committees must use hard money for \"[p]ublic communications that refer to one or more clearly identified Federal candidates, regardless of whether there is reference to a political party, but do not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(f)(1). The rule is categorical. Even if a communication only says \"Vote No on State Ballot Initiative 123They Waste Enough Taxes in Washington, D.C.,\" merely referring (perhaps by means of a montage of grainy black-and-white photos) to United States Senators of both parties with a penchant for pork-barrel spending, the ad is <i>per se</i> deemed to have a federal purpose. This is true even if those big spenders hail from distant states, are not up for reelection for years, and the spot will not be shown anywhere near their voters. Whether such an ad could affect a federal race is doubtful, but the FEC goes further and says these ads <i>always</i> reflect a federal purpose. In an age when even pizza shops and used-car dealers invoke the stereotype of wasteful federal spending to sell their wares, the FEC's lack of sophistication is startling.</p>\n<p>The FEC's approach also ignores that a state campaign may be more effective if the campaigning group can mention a federal official's endorsement. Many federal politicians are of national stature, particularly those associated with hot button political issues. If, for example, a referendum <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> would make it more difficult to get an abortion, a pro-choice group may trumpet a statement denouncing it from a prominent pro-choice United States senator, while a pro-life group may respond with a statement from an equally prominent pro-life senator. To say, as the FEC does, that citing these statements can <i>only</i> be done for the purpose of influencing federal elections is to pretend away the power of celebrity. Just as Michael J. Fox's name might be used in commercials for a stem cell amendment because his association makes for effective politics, <i>see</i> Alfonso Serrano, <i>Stem Cell Opponents To Air Celebrity Ad,</i> CBSNEWS.COM, Oct. 25, 2006, http://www.cbsnews.com/stori es/2006/10/25/politics/main2122383.shtml, an out-of-state and out-of-cycle Senator Debbie Stabenow's endorsement might be used to support state candidates because her association makes for effective state politics, particularly to targeted demographics.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The <i>Solicitation Regulation</i> respects Congress's language no better. The regulation declares any donation \"made by any person in response to any communication is a contribution to the person making the communication if the communication indicates that any portion of the funds received will be used to support or oppose the election of a clearly identified Federal candidate.\" 11 C.F.R. § 100.57(a). This rule applies even if a solicitation's banner headline says only a certain percentage of the donation will be used for federal activities. Hence, even if someone gives $1000 in response to a solicitation that unambiguously says 90% of what is received will be spent on local elections, the FEC asserts jurisdiction over the entire gift. If a gift is made subject to this disclaimer, how is the full $1000 given for the purpose of influencing a federal election?</p>\n<p>The <i>Solicitation Regulation</i> also says \"[i]f the solicitation does not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates, but does refer to a political party, in addition to [a] clearly identified Federal candidate,\" then the entire gift becomes subject to the FEC's authority, <i>id.</i> § 100.57(b)(1), and \"[i]f the solicitation refers to one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates, in addition to [a] clearly identified Federal candidate ..., at least fifty percent (50%) of the total funds received are contributions [subject to the FEC], whether or not the solicitation refers to a political party,\" <i>id.</i> § 100.57(b)(2). Even if the solicitation is unmistakable that the entire gift will be spent on local elections, the FEC nonetheless still claims jurisdiction over at least some of the resulting donations.</p>\n<p>This blindingly-bright line suffers from the same flaw as the <i>Multiple Candidate Allocation Regulation</i>: it assumes merely referencing a federal candidate always unmasks a purpose of influencing a federal election and assumes those who give money in response to such a solicitation also unfailingly do so for the same purpose. That's just not true. Instead, a federal politician's name can be used for reasons tied solely to state electioneering. Again, consider an out-of-state and out-of-cycle Senator Stabenow. If she were to say \"EMILY's List supported a Democrat like me when I was running for state office, and I'm asking you to support EMILY's List now so it can continue to work on behalf of women who are seeking state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> office,\" then under the <i>Solicitation Regulation,</i> the entire amount of any donations is subject to the FEC.<sup>[5]</sup> That result conflicts with Congress's \"purpose\" requirement.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <i>Administrative Costs Allocation Regulation</i> is contrary to law. Under 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c), committees must use \"at least 50 percent Federal funds\" for \"administrative expenses, costs of generic voter drives, and costs of public communications that refer to any political party.\" An obvious problem is this rule applies in odd-numbered years when there are no federal elections. If later this November EMILY's List were to say \"vote a straight Democratic ticket for the city counsel\" in a broadcast in Walla Walla, Washington, no less than half of the cost would have to be expensed to a federal account, even though there is no federal race to influence. The FEC is explicit: if a communication mentions a political party, then context is irrelevant. <i>See</i> FEC Advisory Op.2005-13, at 4-5 (Oct. 20, 2005) (the duty to \"pay the costs of public communications that refer to a political party with at least 50 percent Federal funds does not change based on the activities of [the committee] in the particular State\").</p>\n<p>Contrary to this regulation's premise, moreover, certain \"administrative expenses\" do not always reflect a federal purpose, mixed or otherwise. A committee, for example, that opposes human cloning (and thus supports many different state and federal candidates and laws throughout the nation) may launch an outpost in a state that is considering an anticloning measure and organize a voter drive there,<sup>[6]</sup> even though the group has no intention of participating in any federal election. By this regulation, a full half of the costs must be expensed to the committee's federal account. In fact, the FEC would require the committee to use hard money for a leaflet that says \"both Democrats and Republicans\" endorse the initiative. Such a leaflet is not \"generic party advertising,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 123, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>; it is an ad for a state ballot initiative, not a political party, and it defies reason to say otherwise.<sup>[7]</sup> FECA does not require this absurdity.</p>\n<p>The court says EMILY's List has waived part of its statutory claim. First, my colleagues concede EMILY's List has challenged every other subpart of these regulations, and agree the FEC has exceeded its statutory powers, but say because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> EMILY's List only mentions \"administrative expenses\" in one section of its brief, it waives its argument about \"costs of generic voter drives\" and \"costs of public communications that refer to any political party.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c). This is so even though the clauses are in the exact same sentence of the exact same regulation, and even though they violate the exact same section of FECA for the exact same reason. This is perplexing. EMILY's List comprehensively says \"[n]or are <i>the regulations</i> permitted by FECA. FECA was passed to regulate contributions and expenditures made with `the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'\" EMILY's List Br. at 17 (emphasis added). And if there is any doubt, EMILY's List opens its reply brief by saying \"<i>[t]he regulations at issue in this case</i> violate the First Amendment, <i>Chevron[ ],</i> and the Administrative Procedure Act.\" EMILY's List Reply Br. at 1 (emphasis added). EMILY's List also contends § 106.6(c) requires using hard money for ads that state \"both Democrats and Republicans\" support a measure. <i>Id.</i> at 16. It goes without saying that EMILY's List never argues \"the regulations all violate FECA, except for the second and third clauses in the second sentence of 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(c).\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Second and even more perplexingly, in order to buttress its waiver argument, the same judges that read <i>McConnell</i> narrowly as a case that \"views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees,\" Maj. Op. at 14, concludes EMILY's List could not have successfully challenged § 106.6(c)'s regulation of generic activities on statutory grounds because <i>McConnell</i> specifically approved regulation of contribution and expenditure limits for these funds. <i>Id.</i> at 23-24. If this were correct, it would mean the FEC can constitutionally regulate a committee like EMILY's List, and the court's constitutional analysis is critically undermined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>No one disputes the FEC can craft bright-line rules.

And if we misread a statute, Congress can fix it; not so with the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The court, however, is not content just answering a gratuitous constitutional question. Its holding is broader than even the plaintiff requests. Instead of arguing nonprofits have a constitutional right to pay for ads attacking federal candidates with soft money, EMILY's List more modestly challenges the regulations as the \"functional equivalent of spending limits, prohibiting EMILY's List from supporting <i>state and local candidates</i> in certain ways when its federal funds are exhausted\" and claims they are not properly tailored because they \"restrict vast amounts of <i>nonfederal activity.</i>\" EMILY's List Br. at 17 (summary of argument) (emphasis added). The court holds, nonetheless, that EMILY's List is constitutionally entitled to pay 100% of the costs of its advertisements out of a soft-money account, even for ads that attack or promote <i>federal</i> candidates.

The court notes \"<i>Cal-Med</i> was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. <i>Cal-Med</i> was cited and discussed by the parties, but never to support the proposition for which the court now relies on it.

I mean, <i>Cal</i>[-]<i>Med</i> is mysteriously produced here for the FEC's position. <i>Cal</i>[-]<i>Med</i> didn't raise any of the issues in this case. <i>Cal</i>[-]<i>Med</i> was a simple question of whether a committee that was making contributions to federal candidates had to observe a limit on contributions made to that federal program.

If those beautifully fierce words \"Congress shall make no law\" are to do anything but condemn our constitutionalism as a failed experiment, then <i>at least</i> political speech in all its forms should be free of government constraint.</p>\n<p>My colleagues' distaste for the FEC's handiwork is to their credit. It shows they take the First Amendment seriously. And they are right, of course, that if constitutional law were better acquainted with the Constitution, regulations such as these would never survive Article III scrutiny. If an advertisement criticizes the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or the Chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, it can be a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to pay for that ad using money the federal government doesn't know about or that comes from sources the federal government deems to have already given enough. <i>See</i> 2 U.S.C. § 437g(d). The First Amendment, logically construed, cannot condone such a weighty burden on political speech at the same time it forbids penalizing the production of \"virtual child pornography,\" <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2002).</p>\n<p>I also agree with the court that \"corruption\" should only be understood in terms of <i>quid pro quo</i>not a free-floating unease about money in politics. Once \"corruption\" is disconnected from \"pay to play,\" Congress has <i>carte blanche</i> to stifle speech, a license that is particularly pernicious as our overweening government ever enlarges itself. Power<i>government</i> poweris what generates passion in politics. Money only measures its depth. The more power is at stake, the more money will be used to shield, deflect, or co-opt it. So long as the government can take and redistribute a man's livelihood, there will always be money in politics. One man's corruption is another man's political accountability.</p>\n<p>But there is a rub. We sit on a lower court and \"must follow the binding Supreme Court precedent\" until the Court itself overrules it. <i>We the People Found., Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186927\"><a href=\"/opinion/186927/we-people-fdn-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 144 (D.C.Cir.2007). Though we do not read the court above's precedent unduly expansively, we also do not drag our feet: \"it is not our role to fight a rearguard action\" against the logical implications of the Court's cases. <i>United States v. Gardellini,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187253\"><a href=\"/opinion/187253/united-states-v-gardellini/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1089</span></a></span>, 1096 (D.C.Cir.2008). Instead, we take its holdings as we find them, applying them to cover all they fairly address. <i>Stare decisis</i> means nothing if we only are bound by those cases with which we already agree. Like it or not, we cannot ignore Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>Modesty is dictated by the difficulty of applying <i>McConnell</i>'s facial generalizations to real world events. It is hard to say exactly how contribution limits on hybrid committees, like EMILY's List, should be analyzed after <i>McConnell. McConnell</i> involved a wide-ranging facial challenge addressing the constitutionality of BCRA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> Trying to extrapolate from that case to this one is risky and reason enough to avoid the constitutional bog.

WASH. L.REV. at 986-87; Hasen, 153 U. PA. L.REV. at 67-68. EMILY's List is a multicandidate political committee that has as its primary purpose electing ideologically compatible candidates, EMILY's List Br. at 3.<sup>[13]</sup> As such, it supports Democratic candidates for federal office. <i>See</i> Matthew B. Stannard, <i>Cash is Key for Tauscher's Replacement,</i> S.F. CHRON., Aug. 24, 2009, at A1, <i>available at</i> 2009 WLNR 16474721 (noting that a candidate in a federal primary race \"has touted the endorsement of EMILY's List, a national fundraising organization that supported [former U.S. Representative Ellen Tauscher] and backs Democratic women who support abortion rights.\"). Thus, EMILY's List is much more like a political party than the Sierra Club or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>\n<p>Whether, under the high court's current precedents, EMILY's List could be regulated exactly like a political party is unknown. That it should not be regulated <i>more harshly</i> than a political party seems to be the committee's complaint with the FEC regulations challenged in this court. EMILY's List Br. at 39 (\"Bizarrely, [the regulation] also treats nonparty PACs more harshly than any other type of committee, save national parties and candidates themselves.\"). My point is not that <i>McConnell</i> mandates such treatment; only that nothing in the opinion's logic clearly precludes it. The court does not think this is \"a persuasive interpretation of <i>McConnell.</i>\" Maj. Op. at 22. Perhaps the court is right. But reading the case, as the court does, to sanction First Amendment immunity for all non-connected nonprofits seems even more implausible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Precedent holds allocation and solicitation rules are contribution limits.

Facing BCRA § 323(a), which forbids national parties from soliciting and spending soft money, and § 323(b), which forbids state parties from spending soft money on \"federal election activities,\" the Court declined to apply strict scrutiny. 540 U.S. at 138-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To answer, we again ought to look to <i>McConnell.</i> In upholding BCRA § 323, the Court noted the \"interests that underlie contribution limitsinterests in preventing both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 136, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. The Court bluntly held these interests are \"not limited ... to the elimination of cash-for-vote exchanges,\" but \"extend to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 143, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. Congress must be able to \"address [these] more subtle but equally dispiriting forms of corruption\" by \"remov[ing] the temptation\" of \"large financial contributions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To combat \"cynical assumption[s],\" Congress can \"regulate the appearance of undue influence,\" with \"undue influence\" defined as \"a sense of obligation\" or \"grat[itude],\" <i>id.</i> at 144-45, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. Importantly, Congress also has an interest in preventing the circumvention of these limitsand so can use broad prophylaxesbecause \"candidates, donors, and parties test the limits of the current law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 144, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. In sum, <i>McConnell</i> defines the \"interest\" so broadly it is hard to imagine regulations that are not properly drawn to it. <i>See id.</i> at 356-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Following from such an encompassing statement of the interest, the <i>McConnell</i> Court facially upheld many onerous restrictions on the use of soft money. The Court emphasized, for example, that even a complete ban on soliciting nonfederal funds would still \"leave open ample opportunities for soliciting federal funds,\" and noted such restrictions \"increase the dissemination of information by forcing parties, candidates, and officeholders to solicit from a wider array of potential donors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 139-40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. The Court also upheld a ban on any use of soft money by national parties, even for those \"minor parties\" that are unlikely to have any tangible electoral success, remarking only that \"a nascent or struggling minor party can bring an as-applied challenge if § 323(a) prevents it from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 159, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. While national parties do not always act on behalf of or in concert with federal candidates, a prophylactic prohibition on any soft money spending and soliciting by them is facially valid, given the \"close connection and alignment of interests\" between national parties and federal candidates. <i>Id.</i> at 155, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Cal-Med,</i> the Court sustained contribution limits to multicandidate committees. Four justices adopted the Conference Report's conclusion that these committees may \"`appear to be separate entities pursuing their own ends, but are actually a means for advancing a candidate's campaign,'\" 453 U.S. at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> 199 n. 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Justice Blackmun penned a concurring opinion, but did not disclaim the Conference Report or disagree with the Court's ultimate holding. In fact, he expressly said \"<i>contributions to multicandidate committees may be limited to $5, 000 per year</i> as a means of preventing evasion [of contribution limits],\" though he noted in <i>dicta</i> that his conclusion would be different if the committee \"makes <i>only</i> independent expenditures\" and so does not \"pose a perceived threat of actual or potential corruption.\" <i>Id.</i> at 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110551\"><a href=\"/opinion/110551/california-medical-assn-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If Congress can forbid all allocation and solicitation of soft money by national parties, how is it unconstitutional to forbid only some allocation and solicitation of soft money by multicandidate committees that are also closely aligned with federal candidates?</p>\n<p>The court disputes this reading of <i>Cal-Med,</i> claiming there are not just two types of political committees (ones that only make independent expenditures, and all others), but actually three: (1) those that only make independent expenditures; (2) those that only contribute to candidates; and (3) those that make independent expenditures <i>and</i> contribute to candidates. Such political committees are, in the court's view, entitled to raise and spend \"unlimited money\" for advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. Maj. Op. at 16. If these hybrid committees contribute to federal candidates, they must use hard money, says the court, but all other spending can be with soft money.</p>\n<p>This novel argument is not without considerable charm, but one must read <i>Cal-Med</i> with a squint to see that holding.<sup>[14]</sup> There is no indication in <i>Cal-Med</i> that the committee did not make independent expenditures, but the Court still sustained the statute, without announcing the distinction the court draws today. The Court <i>has</i> consistently cited <i>Cal-Med</i> for the unqualified proposition that it is constitutional to limit contributions to multicandidate committees. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FEC v.

Op. at 14 n. 13, also flatly contradicts the court:</p>\n<blockquote>Justice KENNEDY's contention that <i>Buckley</i> limits Congress to regulating contributions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> to a candidate ignores <i>Buckley</i> itself. There, we upheld FECA's $25,000 limit on aggregate yearly contributions to candidates, <i>political committees,</i> and <i>party committees</i> out of recognition that FECA's $1,000 limit on candidate contributions would be meaningless if individuals could instead make \"huge contributions to the candidate's political party.\" Likewise, in [<i>Cal-Med</i>], we upheld FECA's $5,000 limit on contributions to multicandidate political committees. It is no answer to say that such limits were justified as a means of preventing individuals from using parties and political committees as pass-throughs to circumvent FECA's $1,000 limit on individual contributions to candidates. Given FECA's definition of \"contribution,\" the $5,000 and $25,000 limits restricted not only the source and amount of funds available to parties and political committees to make candidate contributions, but also the source and amount of funds available to engage in express advocacy and numerous other noncoordinated expenditures. If indeed the First Amendment prohibited Congress from regulating contributions to fund the latter, the otherwise-easy-to-remedy exploitation of parties as pass-throughs (e.g., a strict limit on donations that could be used to fund candidate contributions) would have provided insufficient justification for such overbroad legislation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 152 n. 48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>That the Court may have created a doctrinal anomaly might suggest, as the court argues, <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at 14-15 n. 13, that it could not possibly have meant what it said, but that is a hard argument to make. Often cases are in tension as doctrine works itself pure. Our duty as an intermediate court is not to tell the Court what it ought to have said, but to abide by what it did say.</p>\n<p>But even leaving aside its treatment of national parties, <i>McConnell</i> further undermines the court. Recognizing the dynamicindeed, Sisypheancharacter of campaign finance law, the Court noted \"[m]oney, like water, will always find an outlet.\" 540 U.S. at 224, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. Upon realizing structural forces inherent in a republic inevitably create incentives for those subject to regulation to petition for relief and to campaign against those who are disinclined to grant it, the Court did not retreat to a more manageable and less burdensome <i>\"quid pro quo\"</i> standard. <i>Id.</i> at 296, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Instead, after upholding § 323(a), the Court emphasized money would now \"corrupt\" federal races by other, more subtle routes, so Congress, in anticipation of this new corruption, can enact broad anti-circumvention measures. <i>E.g., id.</i> at 165-66, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. Indeed, without pointing to <i>any</i> evidence that local officials (<i>e.g.,</i> county assessors) are connected to federal candidates (<i>e.g.,</i> for President of the United States) or have been used to circumvent the law, the Court held Congress prophylactically can regulate them without facially offending the Constitution. <i>See id.</i> at 184-85, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. If the First Amendment is flexible enough to allow regulating local officials because contributions <i>might</i> flow through them to federal candidates, then why can't the FEC also make an \"eminently reasonable prediction\" that committees like EMILY's Listwhich <i>actually</i> do campaign for candidates and give them money<sup>[15]</sup>will be the next route for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> corruption, and regulate accordingly? <i>Id.</i> at 185, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In upholding § 323 in full, including § 323(f), <i>McConnell</i> blessed restrictions on local officeholders, who are not, of course, political parties. The rule then cannot be that parties and federal candidates are in one column, and everyone else is in another, because that does not explain <i>McConnell.</i> Instead, there is a spectrum, <i>N.C. Right to Life,</i> 525 F.3d at 291, so we should ask not whether an entity is a nonprofit, but instead where it falls on the spectrum. Specifically, is EMILY's List more or less likely than a local official to act as a conduit to federal candidates? \"Common sense\" says such committees are the more natural path to \"corruption,\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 297, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Can that be right?</p>\n<p>The court's opinion is boldly creative, and will, if followed, have profound results on campaign finance regulation. This case means:</p>\n<blockquote>1. Multicandidate political committees can spend unlimited amounts of soft money to run ads attacking or supporting federal candidates and political parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. These committees can spend unlimited amounts of soft money on get-out-the-vote activities that support federal candidates and political parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. These committees can solicit soft money by saying: \"Just like you, we want [<i>federal candidate</i>] to win. You have already donated all the law allows to [<i>federal candidate</i>], but there is no limit on how much you can give to us to support [<i>federal candidate</i>].\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4.

But the Court was \"under no illusion that BCRA will be the last congressional statement on the matter\"\"[m]oney, like water, will always find an outlet.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>While I have argued courts should not unnecessarily assail legislative acts, political speech is the core of what the First Amendment protects. From <i>Buckley</i> to <i>McConnell</i> the Court has relied on an <i>ad hoc</i> empiricism ill-suited to the complex interactions of democratic politics. The government has unlimited resources, public and private, for touting its policy agenda. Those on the outsidewhether voices of opposition, encouragement, or innovationmust rely on private wealth to make their voices heard. An increasingly anomalous campaign finance jurisprudence only impoverishes this essential debate. <i>McConnell</i>'s careless invocation of access and influence (two integral aspects of political participation) as synonyms for corruption is instructive. Such an expansive, self-referential, and amorphous definition of corruption, coupled with lax standards of scrutiny and a willingness to accept as \"evidence\" any plausible theory of corruption or claim of circumvention, is likely to doom any argument for protection of core political speech. Someday the Supreme Court may be persuaded to reconsider this approach. But that cannot be our task.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>This should have been a straightforward application of administrative law, not unlike countless agency cases decided by this circuit every year. Congress has enacted a statute; the agency has violated it; the rules must be vacated; done. I would enforce the statute as written and call it a day. A good rule of thumb is we often do more for the law when we do less with the law.

For example, under the statute, EMILY's List cannot accept donations of more than $5000 annually into its hard-money account from any single contributor. 2 U.S.C. § 441a(a)(1)(C). A soft-money account may receive unlimited donations.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court's rejection of the equalization argument is consistent with its broader First Amendment jurisprudence: \"As a general matter, the American First Amendment tradition requires that the financial, political, or rhetorical imbalance between the proponents of competing arguments is insufficient to justify government intervention to correct that imbalance.\" Frederick Schauer &amp; Richard H.

We decline to adopt that expansive reading of footnote 48.\n</p>\n<p>First, as explained by one leading election-law expert, such a reading would require overruling the Supreme Court's longstanding dichotomy between limits on contributions and expenditures. <i>See</i> Richard L. Hasen, Buckley <i>is Dead, Long Live</i> Buckley, 153 U. PA. L.REV. 31, 70 (2004).

For that reason, a broad interpretation of footnote 48 would mean \"the entire <i>Buckley</i> edifice ... falls.\" Hasen, 153 U. PA. L.REV. at 70. \"Is that what the Court really intended buried in a few sentences of a footnote in one of the longest cases in Supreme Court history?\" <i>Id.</i> We think not.</p>\n<p>Second, footnote 48 simply cited <i>Cal-Med</i> together with <i>Buckley</i> in the course of establishing the constitutionality of limits on contributions to <i>political parties,</i> not to <i>non-profits</i> (which the Court had no need to address). In the key concluding sentence in the footnote, the Court rejected the idea that the government could only regulate \"<i>parties</i> as pass-throughs.\" <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 152 n. 48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

L.REV. at 986 (\"importantly, the <i>McConnell</i> footnote was written in the course of the Court's analysis of BCRA's application of contribution limits to the activities of political parties\"). We would unfairly wrench footnote 48 from its context were we to adopt the broad interpretation some have proposed.</p>\n<p>Third, in a later passage in the <i>McConnell</i> opinion, the Court explained that, under the statute, \"[i]nterest groups ... remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,\" and advertisements. 540 U.S. at 187, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That passageand the accompanying discussion would make little sense if footnote 48 were read to equate non-profits with political parties.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the Fourth Circuit in <i>North Carolina Right to Life</i> refused to adopt this broad reading of footnote 48; it eschewed the dissenting judge's extensive reliance on it. <i>See</i> 525 F.3d at 333-34 (Michael, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>In short, we decline to read this footnote addressing a different issue in <i>McConnell</i> to indirectly (i) overrule <i>Buckley,</i> (ii) discard Justice Blackmun's opinion in <i>Cal-Med,</i> and (iii) equate non-profits with political parties, contrary to other discussion in <i>McConnell.</i></p>\n<p>[14]  We need not decide whether the regulations are subject to the strictest scrutiny applicable to spending restrictions or the still \"rigorous\" but slightly lesser \"closely drawn\" scrutiny applicable to contribution restrictions. <i>See generally </i><i>Davis v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span> (1981) (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (limits on donations to non-profits subject to strict scrutiny). In <i>Wisconsin Right to Life,</i> the Court indicated that forcing an entity to spend out of a segregated fund subject to source and amount limitations, rather than its general treasury, was a spending restriction. 551 U.S. at 477 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145706\"><a href=\"/opinion/145706/federal-election-comn-v-wisconsin-right-to-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2652</span></a></span>. So too here. Unlike BCRA's rules for political parties, moreover, these regulations do not limit how much someone can contribute to EMILY's List or other covered non-profits. Rather, these regulations force non-profit entities to pay for a large percentage of their varied political activities out of hard-money accounts subject to source and amount ($5000) limits rather than out of soft-money accounts that may receive unlimited donations. Through this mechanism, the regulations limit how much non-profits ultimately can spend on advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration drives. These regulations therefore \"reduce[] the quantity of expression\" for groups like EMILY's List \"by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\" <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>. As a rough analogy, consider a law that requires home buyers to pay a 50% cash down payment to obtain a mortgage. That kind of law would significantly limit how much buyers could afford to spend for a new house. A similar dynamic is at play as a result of these regulations.</p>\n<p>[15]  The regulations apply only to those non-profits that must register with the FEC as political committeesnamely, groups that receive or spend more than $1000 annually for the purpose of influencing a federal election and whose \"major purpose\" involves federal elections. <i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>; <i>see</i> 2 U.S.C. §§ 431-434, 441a; <i>supra</i> note 7. Our constitutional analysis of donations and spending limits applies both to non-connected non-profits registered as political committees with the FEC and to non-connected non-profits that are not so registered. The fact that a non-profit spends a certain amount or percentage of its money in relation to federal elections cannot be a basis, at least under the anti-corruption rationale, for restricting its ability to accept large donations to support those expenditures. That conclusion follows from the Supreme Court's consistent holdings that large expenditures are constitutionally protected and the corresponding principle that non-profits are constitutionally entitled to accept large donations to their soft-money accounts to support advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and voter registration activities. Of course, because of the lesser First Amendment protection against disclosure, the major purpose test is permissible under current precedent for determining non-profits' disclosure obligations. <i>See </i><i>Buckley,</i> 424 U.S. at 79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Government has a freer hand in imposing reporting and disclosure requirements than it does in limiting contributions and expenditures. <i>See </i><i>McConnell v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[17]  As explained earlier in this opinion, those approaches run into severe First Amendment obstacles. For purposes of this discussion, however, we analyze the statute as written without regard to constitutional implications.</p>\n<p>[18]  As discussed above, § 106.6(c) also requires non-profits to use their federal or hard-money accounts to pay for (i) at least 50% of their generic get-out-the vote and voter registration activities and (ii) at least 50% of their generic communications, which refer to a party but not a candidate. In its brief, EMILY's List does not raise statutory challenges to those two provisions. <i>See</i> EMILY's List Br. at 35-40; <i>id.</i> at 38 (challenging under the statute only that provision in § 106.6(c) that sets forth a \"`Minimum Percentages' Rule for Administrative Costs\"). Presumably, EMILY's List has not challenged these two provisions under FECA because <i>McConnell</i> indicated that these generic activities qualify under the statute as activities and communications \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections. <i>See </i><i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 123, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span> (\"Although <i>a literal reading of FECA's definition of `contribution' would have required such activities to be funded with hard money,</i> the FEC ruled that political parties could fund mixed-purpose activitiesincluding get-out-the-vote drives and generic party advertisingin part with soft money.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[19]  The original FEC proposal was far narrower and would have covered only communications that promote, attack, support, or oppose federal candidates, similar to BCRA's requirement for state and local parties. <i>See</i> 69 Fed. Reg. at 11,753, 11,757-11,758 (Mar. 11, 2004) (notice of proposed rulemaking). After initially considering that limited proposal, the FEC ultimately decided to regulate broadly and to saddle non-profits with even greater restrictions than Congress in BCRA chose to impose on state and local parties.</p>\n<p>[20]  EMILY's List separately argues that three of the five regulatory provisions at issue in this case are also arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. EMILY's List Br. at 40-44. We are less persuaded by EMILY's List's freestanding arbitrary and capricious argument. Putting aside the constitutional and statutory-authority problems with the challenged rules, the provisions are not otherwise arbitrary and capricious. Agencies generally do not violate the APA's deferential arbitrary-and-capricious standard when they employ bright-line rules for reasons of administrative convenience, so long as those rules fall within a zone of reasonableness and are reasonably explained. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>ExxonMobil Gas Mktg. Co. v. FERC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185778\"><a href=\"/opinion/185778/exxonmobil-gas-mkt-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span>, 1084 (D.C.Cir.2002); <i>WorldCom, Inc. v.

EMILY's List raises only a constitutional challenge to that provision.</p>\n<p>[21]  The concurrence notes that <i>McConnell</i> upheld § 323(f) of BCRA, which prohibits state and local candidates and officeholders from using soft money for communications that promote, support, attack, or oppose a federal candidate. We fail to see how this aspect of <i>McConnell</i> justifies upholding limits on <i>non-profits. McConnell,</i> as we read it, relied in part on the fact that officeholders, candidates, and parties at all levels share a close relationship and apparent unity of interest. And the Court also based its conclusion with respect to state and local candidates and officeholdersas elsewhereon \"the record in this litigation,\" 540 U.S. at 185, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, emphasizing that \"Congress must show concrete evidence that a particular type of financial transaction is corrupting or gives rise to the appearance of corruption.... It has done so here.\" <i>Id.</i> at 185-86 n. 72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>.\n</p>\n<p>The concurrence also raises concern about the activities of non-profit committees that are \"closely aligned\" with federal candidates. Concurring Op. at 36-37. But our constitutional analysis of non-profits applies only to <i>non-connected</i> non-profits. <i>See</i> 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(a); <i>supra</i> note 7. Moreover, expenditures by individuals or non-profits that are coordinated with a candidate may be considered contributions to that candidate.</p>\n<p>[22]  The concurrence finds \"perplexing[ ]\" our reading of <i>McConnell</i>'s statutory discussion. Concurring Op. at 30. We think it's straightforward. <i>McConnell</i> said the statutory phrase \"for the purpose of influencing\" federal elections covers generic activities. <i>McConnell,</i> 540 U.S. at 167, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>. That seems to foreclose any <i>statutory</i> challenge to the new regulatory provisions applicable to generic activities. But that of course does not resolve EMILY's List's <i>constitutional</i> challenge.</p>\n<p>[23]  Even if EMILY's List had put forward meritorious statutory challenges to all of the regulatory provisions that it has challenged under the First Amendment, we still would possess discretion to rule in the alternative on both statutory and constitutional grounds. The avoidance principle cited by the concurrence is prudential, not jurisdictional. And it is not uncommon for lower courts to rule on alternative statutory and constitutional grounds when appropriate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

While the FEC said EMILY's List's solicitation was fine, <i>see</i> FEC Advisory Op.2005-13, at 5-6 (Oct. 20, 2005), it could not have said the same for mine: including \"Democrat\" an important label in state politics too causes the gift to be hard money.</p>\n<p>[6]  A \"generic voter drive\" includes \"any . . . activities that urge the general public to .. . support candidates ... <i>associated with a particular issue,</i> without mentioning a specific candidate.\" 11 C.F.R. § 106.6(b)(1)(iii) (emphasis added). Thus, if a committee says \"support candidates for the General Assembly who oppose human cloning\" in an odd-numbered year, hard money is required.</p>\n<p>[7]  \"Generic party advertising\" is not in the United States Code or the Code of Federal Regulations.

For such claims, \"exercising judicial restraint ... frees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.\" <i>Wash.

As a rule, a law is facially repugnant only if it \"is unconstitutional in all of its applications,\" but there is a narrow First Amendment exception where \"a law may be overturned [if] a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,\" <i>id.</i> at 1191 n. 6.

But the opinion is controlling, if at all, only for \"points that can be said to be fairly subsumed within the reasoning of the plurality.\" John C. Eastman, <i>Strictly Scrutinizing Campaign Finance Restrictions (and the Courts that Judge Them),</i> 50 CATH. U.L. REV. 13, 37 (2000); <i>see </i><i>Marks v.

This circuit has clarified it is only the narrowest opinion's overlap with the broader opinion that counts. \"<i>Marks</i> is workableone opinion can be meaningfully regarded as `narrower' than another only when one opinion is a logical subset of other, broader opinions. In essence, the narrowest opinion must represent a common denominator of the Court's reasoning; it must embody a position implicitly approved by at least five Justices who support the judgment.\" <i>King v.

Presumably then, the controlling part of Justice Blackmun's opinion is the holding that the FEC may constitutionally regulate contributions to fund independent political expenditures without contravening the First Amendmentno more and no less.</p>\n<p>[15]  Britt Cocanour, EMILY's List Chief of Staff, avowed her committee \"has helped to elect sixty-eight Democratic women to Congress, thirteen to the U.S. Senate, eight to governorships, and over 350 to other state and local offices.\" Joint Appendix at 70.</p>\n<p>[16]  The court suggests <i>McConnell</i> guarantees \"`interest groups'\" the right \"`to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings,' and advertising.\" Maj. Op. at 14 (quoting 540 U.S. at 187, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
