Brown (“Brown”) and Susan Brown-Thill (“Brown-Thill”), the\nchildren of Eugene D. Brown and Saurine L. Brown, became the sole co-trustees of\nthe complex Eugene D. Brown Trust (“EDB Trust”) after the death of their mother,\nthe surviving spouse under that Trust. Unable to resolve many conflicts about\nmanaging the EDB Trust and other family trusts and partnerships, in March 2010\nBrown and Brown-Thill signed an Arbitration Agreement for resolving a broad range\nof disputes. The Agreement provided “that the first matter to be taken up by the\narbitrator will be all issues associated with the documentation for and means of\npayment of the estate taxes due on the estate of Saurine L. Brown.” These\nconsolidated appeals involve two of the many awards that followed that initial\narbitration -- a March 14, 2011, award that authorized distributions from family-\nowned limited partnerships to family trusts, and a December 12, 2011, award that (i)\ndeclared invalid Brown’s attempt to resign as co-trustee and name his successor, and\n(ii) removed Brown as co-trustee, applying the Uniform Trust Code’s standards for\nthe statutory removal of a trustee as adopted in Missouri, the situs of the controversy,\nand Florida, the situs of the EDB Trust. The district court1 denied Brown’s attempt\nto vacate both awards and Brown-Thill’s request for a contractual award of attorneys’\nfees in both lawsuits. Brown and Brown-Thill cross-appeal these rulings. With one\nmodification that does not affect the status of EDB Trust administration following the\nawards, we affirm.\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri, presided in both cases.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                             I. The Underlying Impasse.\n\n       Eugene and Saurine Brown created several entities to hold and manage Brown\nfamily assets, including two trusts, the EDB Trust and the Saurine L. Brown Trust\n(“SLB Trust”); a limited liability corporation, Brown Bear LLC (“Brown Bear”); and\ntwo family limited partnerships, 7219 Metcalf Partnership, L.P. (“FLP I”) and 7219\nMetcalf Partnership II, L.P. (“FLP II”). At the times in question, Brown and Brown-\nThill were the co-trustees of the EDB Trust. Attorney James Cooper was the sole\ntrustee of the SLB Trust. Brown Bear was the general partner of FLP I and FLP II.\nThe EDB Trust and the SLB Trust each owned 50% of Brown Bear. Thus, for Brown\nBear to cause FLP I or FLP II to take an action such as distributing income to other\nfamily entities, Brown, Brown-Thill, and Cooper must all agree.\n\n       In early 2011, due to the decision-making impasse between Brown and Brown-\nThill, FLP I and FLP II had issued no partnership distributions since 2008. On\nFebruary 22, with tax deadlines approaching, Cooper emailed a partnership\ndistribution proposal (“Trust Funding Proposal”) to counsel for Brown and Brown-\nThill, and to the arbitrator specifically named in an April 6, 2010, amendment to the\nArbitration Agreement, Richard McLeod. The email stated, “The SLB Trust approves\nthis plan, and we need the approval of the EDB Trust, which may or may not require\narbitration. . . . If that approval is not given by the end of the day on March 3rd, I will\nschedule a Partnership meeting for FLP I, FLP II and Brown Bear, LLC for a vote on\nthe proposal.” Brown did not agree to the proposal and the issue was submitted to\narbitrator McLeod, resulting in the March 14 award at issue.\n\n       While the siblings litigated Brown’s application to vacate the March 14 award,\nthey continued to disagree about management of the EDB Trust. Before Brown-Thill\nsubmitted a planned proposal to arbitrate whether Brown should be removed as co-\ntrustee, Brown signed a notice resigning “[e]ffective upon the appointment of John\nL. Rubenstein as my Successor Co-Trustee,” and a separate document appointing\n\n                                           -3-\n\fRubenstein as successor co-trustee, which Rubenstein accepted. Brown-Thill took\nthe position that Brown could not unilaterally appoint a successor co-trustee, but that\nRubenstein’s appointment would be effective if she agreed to it. After discussions\nand actions suggesting that Brown-Thill would agree to Rubenstein’s appointment,\nshe decided she would not approve Rubenstein and advised Brown she would submit\nto arbitration (i) whether Brown’s conditional resignation and unilateral appointment\nof Rubenstein were ineffective, (ii) whether Brown should be removed as co-trustee,\nand (iii) whether an employee of FLP I should be given an employment contract that\nBrown opposed. The dispute was submitted to arbitrator McLeod, resulting in the\nDecember 12, 2011, award at issue.\n\n                II. Brown’s Challenges to the Arbitration Awards.\n\n       The general provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-\n16, govern our judicial review of the arbitration awards at issue. Because Brown\nchallenges the awards on nearly every conceivable basis, it is important at the outset\nto reiterate the deferential standards that govern our review.\n\n       First, an arbitrator’s authority is contractual. Therefore, the threshold question\nwhether the parties to the Arbitration Agreement agreed to arbitrate a particular\ndispute -- the dispute’s “substantive arbitrability” -- is a question for the court (unless\nthe parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability). First Options of\nChicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 942-44 (1995). Here, Brown seeks this level\nof de novo review by characterizing some of his arguments as issues of substantive\narbitrability. We reject this contention based upon the breadth of the Arbitration\nAgreement, which provided that Brown and Brown-Thill agreed:\n\n              All existing and future disputes and controversies between the\n       parties, whether in their individual capacities, their capacities as co-\n       beneficiaries and/or co-trustees of [the EDB and SLB trusts], or in their\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f      capacities as co-owners, partners, or members of any business entity,\n      including [Brown Bear, FLP I, and FLP II] . . . which arise out of or\n      relate to the administration and investment of the trusts, partnerships and\n      assets of the [EDB and SLB] estates, the payment of estate taxes of such\n      estates, or the division of assets of such estates, shall be submitted to\n      binding arbitration pursuant to the following procedures.\n\nEvery issue submitted to and resolved by the arbitrator in his March 14 and December\n12 awards fell within this comprehensive agreement to arbitrate. Thus, the many\nissues raised in Brown’s two appeals are not issues of substantive arbitrability.\n\n       Second, judicial review of the merits of an arbitrator’s award is conducted\nunder an extremely deferential standard of review. Section 9 of the FAA provides\nthat a reviewing court “must” confirm an award unless it is “vacated, modified, or\ncorrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11.” Therefore, the Supreme Court held,\nresolving a conflict in the circuits, “§§ 10 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the\nreview provided by the statute.” Hall St. Assoc., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576,\n590 (2008). Applying this deferential standard, “[c]ourts have no authority to\nreconsider the merits of an arbitration award, even when the parties allege that the\naward rests on factual errors or on a misinterpretation of the underlying contract.”\nMedicine Shoppe Intern., Inc. v. Turner Inv., Inc., 614 F.3d 485, 488 (8th Cir. 2010).\n\n                            A. The March 14 Award.\n\n      The March 14 award ordered Brown “as co-trustee of the EDB [Trust to] timely\nexecute all documentation necessary to effectuate both of the proposed distributions”\nfrom FLP I and FLP II. Brown challenges this award on several grounds.\n\n      1. Brown first argues that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding a\ndispute that was not submitted in accordance with procedures mandated by the\nArbitration Agreement. The Agreement as amended in April 2010 provided:\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      A. Either party may give email notice to the other that they deem an\n      issue to be a subject for arbitration, which notice shall specify the issue\n      and the proposed resolution. If the parties fail to resolve such issue\n      within seven calendar days of such notice, the issue will be submitted to\n      an arbitrator for mediation, and, if the mediation is unsuccessful, for\n      binding arbitration.\n\n                                 *    *   *     *   *\n\n      D. The arbitrator shall establish procedures to be followed for each\n      arbitration. If either party fails to follow or abide by the arbitrator’s\n      required procedures within the time frames set out by the arbitrator, the\n      arbitrator shall be authorized to resolve the issue without the full\n      participation of the non-abiding party and both parties shall be bound by\n      the arbitrator’s decision.\n\nBrown asserts that Cooper was a non-party who could not submit a dispute to\narbitration; that Brown-Thill never specified the issue and her proposed resolution;\nthat the dispute was not submitted to the arbitrator within seven days; and that the\narbitrator conducted no mediation and failed to establish procedures for the\narbitration. As these contractual “prerequisites” were not followed, he argues that the\ndispute was not arbitrable.\n\n       The district court properly characterized these contentions as raising issues of\n“procedural arbitrability.” When raised in a lawsuit to enjoin a demand for\narbitration, “procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final\ndisposition are presumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator.” Howsam v.\nDean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002) (emphasis in original, quotation\nomitted); see Pro Tech Indus., Inc. v. URS Corp, 377 F.3d 868, 871-72 (8th Cir.\n2004). Thus, it was for arbitrator McLeod to decide in the first instance procedural\nquestions such as whether the dispute was properly submitted, whether mediation was\nrequired, and whether specific arbitration procedures needed to be established for\nparties who had previously arbitrated numerous disputes.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f        When an arbitration has been completed and a court is asked to vacate the\naward because the arbitrator was guilty of or permitted the prevailing party to commit\nprocedural irregularities, “we must . . . accord even greater deference to the\narbitrator’s decisions on procedural matters than those bearing on substantive\ngrounds.” Stroh Container Co. v. Delphi Indus., Inc., 783 F.2d 743, 748-49 (8th\nCir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1141 (1986), followed in El Dorado Sch. Dist. No. 15 v.\nContinental Cas. Co., 247 F.3d 843, 846-47 (8th Cir. 2001). Bearing in mind the\nSupreme Court’s recent teaching in Hall Street Associates, we conclude that an award\nmay not be vacated on this ground unless a procedural irregularity resulted in non-\ncompliance with the mandates of FAA §§ 10 and 11.\n\n      2. Proceeding on that alternative basis, Brown also argues that the arbitrator’s\nprocedural errors violated FAA §§ 10(a)(2), (3), and (4), which provide that an award\nmay be vacated:\n\n         (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,\n      or either of them;\n\n         (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to\n      postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear\n      evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other\n      misbehavior by which the rights of a party have been prejudiced; or\n\n         (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\n      executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject\n      matter submitted was not made.\n\n      a. § 10(a)(2). Brown argues that the arbitrator’s ex parte contacts with Cooper\nand Brown-Thill before the arbitration hearing established his evident partiality and\nrequire vacating the March 14 award under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2). This contention is\nwithout merit. First, Brown makes no showing that he raised this contention to the\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\farbitrator, meaning it was waived. Delta Mine Holding Co. v. AFC Coal Props., Inc.,\n280 F.3d 815, 821 (8th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 817 (2002).\n\n       Second, on the merits, the district court concluded that Brown made no\nshowing “that McLeod did anything improper.” We agree. Because arbitration\nawards are favored, a party seeking to vacate on this ground has “a high burden of\ndemonstrating objective facts inconsistent with impartiality.” Kolel Beth Yechiel\nMechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Trust, 729 F.3d 99, 105 (2d Cir. 2013)\n(quotation omitted); see M&A Elec. Power Coop. v. Local Union No. 702, IBEW,\n977 F.2d 1235, 1238 (8th Cir. 1992) (party seeking to vacate “must demonstrate that\nthe conduct influenced the outcome of the arbitration”). Brown has not come close\nto meeting this burden. Arbitrator McLeod was hand-picked by the parties to the\nArbitration Agreement, including Brown, and had mediated and arbitrated many\nearlier disputes. In these circumstances, prior contacts -- ex parte and otherwise,\ndisclosed and undisclosed -- were inevitable, requiring a specific showing that\nparticular contacts influenced the arbitrator’s resolution of this dispute. See Dow\nCorning Corp. v. Safety Nat’l Cas. Corp., 335 F.3d 742, 750-52 (8th Cir. 2003), cert.\ndenied, 540 U.S. 1219 (2004). Brown made no such showing.\n\n      b. § 10(a)(3). Brown argues that the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct or\nmisbehavior warranting vacating the award because he “did not conduct any hearing\nor otherwise provide the parties with an opportunity to present evidence and\nargument,” and because he did not notify Brown that he “would convert the\ntelephonic partnership meeting into an arbitration hearing.” A party seeking to vacate\nan award for misconduct under § 10(a)(3) must show that he was “deprived of a fair\nhearing.” Grahams Serv. Inc. v. Teamsters Local 975, 700 F.2d 420, 422 (8th Cir.\n1982). The district court found “no reason to infer that [the arbitrator] engaged in any\nmisconduct or misbehavior” or deprived Brown of a fair opportunity to present\nevidence and argument in support of his position. We agree.\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f       The arbitrator was faced with a procedurally unusual dispute that presented\nserious time pressures -- whether, at a scheduled meeting of the family partnerships,\nthe EDB Trust should vote for or against a proposal to distribute funds urgently\nneeded to meet obligations of other family entities. The arbitrator held a telephonic\nhearing on March 10. Prior to that hearing, Brown, Brown-Thill, Cooper, and the\narbitrator exchanged several emails concerning whether the EDB Trust would vote\nin favor of Cooper’s Trust Funding Proposal. Brown-Thill expressed her support for\nthe proposal noting that, if Brown did not agree, “[t]he dispute would be submitted\nto [the arbitrator] for his resolution.” Brown’s attorney conveyed Brown’s objection\non March 3. That day, Cooper sent a Notice of Partnership Meeting on March 10,\ncopying arbitrator McLeod “so that he is aware of what is happening and will be\nprepared in the event a dispute arises between the Trustees of the EDB Trust.”\n(emphasis in original). Before the March 10 hearing, Brown had notice that the\narbitrator would attend the partnership meeting and would enter an award resolving\nany dispute between Brown and Brown-Thill over the Trust Funding Proposal.\nBrown’s attorney objected that “an award based on . . . a phone conversation . . . does\nnot comply with the arbitration agreement.”\n\n       The telephonic hearing was conducted during the partnership meeting. Brown-\nThill and Cooper voted in favor of the Trust Funding Proposal. Brown did not attend\nbut, through counsel, voted against and “objected to the timing of the meeting and the\nmeeting process.” After the meeting, Brown reiterated his substantive objections to\nthe arbitrator by email, claiming that he lacked necessary information and was “given\nneither the opportunity to vote nor the opportunity to present a case” because he had\nnot been available to attend on March 10. Brown’s attorney submitted further written\nsubstantive objections. The arbitrator issued his award on March 14. Particularly in\nlight of the need to promptly resolve this long-simmering dispute, we cannot\nconclude that the arbitrator denied Brown and his counsel fair opportunity to present\nevidence and argument or deprived Brown of a fair hearing.\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f       c. § 10(a)(4). Brown argues that the March 14 award should be vacated under\n§ 10(a)(4) because the arbitrator “exceeded his powers” by making an award that\n“manifestly disregard[ed]” the unambiguous procedural requirements of the\nArbitration Agreement. After closely examining the evidence in the record, the\ndistrict court concluded that the arbitrator adequately followed the relatively informal\nprocedures set forth in the Arbitration Agreement. Again, we agree.\n\n       For Brown to prevail on this claim, “[i]t is not enough to show that the\narbitrator committed an error -- or even a serious error. Because the parties bargained\nfor the arbitrator’s construction of their agreement, an arbitral decision even arguably\nconstruing or applying the contract must stand, regardless of a court’s view of its\n(de)merits.” Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, 133 S. Ct. 2064, 2068 (2013)\n(quotations and citations omitted). This review must be particularly deferential when\nthe arbitrator is accused of violating the procedural limits of his authority.\n“[A]rbitrators are the experts about the meaning of their own rules, and are\ncomparatively better able to interpret and to apply them than courts.” Pro Tech, 377\nF.3d at 872. Here, Brown had adequate notice of the proceeding and the Trust\nFunding Proposal, and the arbitrator made himself available for mediation and gave\nBrown an adequate opportunity to present and argue his position. It was for the\narbitrator to determine whether the Arbitration Agreement’s procedural guidelines\nrequired more in resolving this procedurally unusual dispute.2\n\n       3. Turning to the substantive merits of the March 14 award, Brown argues that\nit should be vacated under § 10(a)(4) because the arbitrator exceeded his powers\nwhen he manifestly disregarded the EDB Trust Agreement by acting as if he were a\ntrustee in voting to approve the Trust Funding Proposal, substituting his own\n\n\n      2\n       As Brown “raised these issues to the arbitrator,” we may not vacate the award\nsimply because the arbitrator did not make an express finding that the Arbitration\nAgreement’s procedures were satisfied. El Dorado, 247 F.3d at 847.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fdiscretionary judgment for the judgment of co-trustee Brown that was required by the\nTrust Agreement. This strange argument is unsound for at least three reasons.\n\n       First, the Arbitration Agreement applied to “[a]ll existing and future disputes\nand controversies between the parties . . . in their . . . capacities as . . . co-trustees of\n[the EDB Trust] which arise out of or relate to the administration and investment of\nthe trusts, partnerships and assets of the [EDB and SLB] estates.” Thus, if sound, this\nargument would compel the conclusion that the Agreement was, to a very large\nextent, void ab initio. Yet Brown willingly entered into the Agreement and\nparticipated without objection in numerous prior arbitrations, most of which no doubt\nentailed disputes between Brown and Brown-Thill acting in their capacities as co-\ntrustees. Second, Brown points to no provision in the EDB Trust Agreement\nreflecting the settlor’s intent to prohibit this type of sensible co-trustee dispute\nresolution. Third, the contention’s factual premise is wrong. Arbitrator McLeod did\nnot exercise his judgment as a non-appointed co-trustee. Rather, he decided which\nof the conflicting judgments of the appointed co-trustees should be given effect.\nBrown did not argue to the arbitrator that Brown-Thill’s vote in favor of the Trust\nFunding Proposal violated her fiduciary duties as co-trustee. State law might require\nan arbitrator to consider that argument. Nor did Brown argue that the Trust Funding\nProposal conflicted with terms of the Trust Agreement. Thus, in resolving this\ndispute, the arbitrator acted squarely within the authority granted by the Arbitration\nAgreement, not as a trustee.\n\n       4. Finally, Brown argues the arbitrator exceeded his powers by signing\ndocuments implementing the Trust Funding Proposal, post-arbitration, when Brown\nfailed to comply with the order that he timely do so. This action is not grounds for\nvacating the award under FAA § 10. Nor was this action the type of improper post-\narbitration actions falling within the “functus officio” doctrine. See Legion Ins. Co.\nv. VCW, Inc., 198 F.3d 718 (8th Cir. 1999). Moreover, it would appear that the\narbitrator’s signature on documents was not necessary to carry out the award; the\n\n                                            -11-\n\fArbitration Agreement provided, “The arbitrator’s decision shall have the effect of\na joint instruction and/or authorization from Richard Lotman Brown and Susan L.\nBrown-Thill and may be presented as such to third-parties.” As the issue does not\naffect the award’s validity, we decline to consider it further.\n\n                           B. The December 12 Award.\n\n      After Brown-Thill decided not to approve Rubenstein as successor co-trustee,\nshe notified Brown that an arbitration hearing would be held on December 5, 2011,\nto determine whether Brown’s conditional resignation and unilateral appointment\nwere ineffective, and whether Brown should be removed as co-trustee. Brown made\nseveral motions seeking to prevent this arbitration, which arbitrator McLeod denied.\nBrown also executed an unconditional notice of intent to resign as trustee on\nDecember 2, effective thirty days later. The arbitration proceeded as scheduled on\nDecember 5. Brown-Thill presented extensive testimony and exhibits. Brown\ndeclined to attend or to present evidence but submitted his own proposed award.\n\n      The arbitrator determined that, under the EDB Trust Agreement, (i) Brown\ncould not unilaterally appoint a successor co-trustee while he and Brown-Thill\ncontinued to act as co-trustees; (ii) Brown-Thill did not consent to the appointment\nof Rubenstein; and (iii) Brown’s conditional resignation was ineffective because he\ndid not give thirty days notice, as the Trust Agreement required, and because it was\nconditioned upon Rubenstein’s appointment, which was ineffective. Turning to\nBrown-Thill’s request to remove Brown, the arbitrator found no provision in the\nTrust Agreement permitting one co-trustee to remove the other. However, both\nFlorida and Missouri statutes provide that the court may remove a trustee if “lack of\ncooperation among co-trustees substantially impairs the administration of the trust,”\nor “because of unfitness, unwillingness, or persistent failure of the trustee to\nadminister the trust effectively.” Mo. Rev. Stat. § 456.7-706(2), (3); see Fla. Stat.\nAnn. § 736.0706(2)(b), (c). Invoking these statutes, the arbitrator granted Brown-\n\n                                        -12-\n\fThill’s petition to remove Brown, finding that he had “failed to adequately cooperate\nwith Brown-Thill to ensure the effective administration of the EDB Trusts on\nnumerous occasions,” causing an “impasse” that was likely to continue in the future.\n\n       1. On appeal, Brown first argues the district court erred in interpreting the\nEDB Trust Agreement to preclude his unilateral appointment of Rubenstein as co-\ntrustee, and to render his October 10 conditional resignation ineffective. The\nargument is misfocused. It was not the district court’s function to interpret the Trust\nAgreement. The Arbitration Agreement authorized the arbitrator to resolve any\ndispute submitted by Brown or Brown-Thill that arose out of or related to the\nadministration of the EDB Trust. The FAA mandates that an arbitrator’s award not\nbe vacated so long as the arbitrator was “even arguably construing or applying the\ncontract” he was commissioned to interpret. Oxford Health Plans, 133 S. Ct. at 2068;\nsee United Paperworkers Int’l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 37-38 (1987). After\ncarefully considering the Trust Agreement provisions relating to trustee resignation\nand the appointment of successors, arbitrator McLeod concluded that Brown’s initial\nresignation was ineffective both procedurally -- for lack of the required notice -- and\nsubstantively -- because conditioned on Brown’s unauthorized unilateral appointment\nof a successor. As these conclusions drew their essence from the underlying Trust\nAgreement, the award may not be vacated under FAA § 10. Likewise, given our\ndeferential review of the arbitrator’s award, Brown’s contentions that Brown-Thill’s\nacceptance of Rubenstein resolved the dispute before it was submitted to arbitration,\nand that the arbitrator never considered Brown’s December 2 resignation, are not\ngrounds for vacating the award under FAA § 10.\n\n       2. Brown further argues the district court erred in rejecting his contention that\nthe method for removing a trustee contained in the EDB Trust Agreement reflected\nthe settlor’s intent to preclude the arbitrator’s statutory removal of a co-trustee. In a\nsection titled, “Removal of Trustee,” the Trust Agreement authorized a majority of\nthe income beneficiaries to remove a trustee and to designate a successor trustee by\n\n                                          -13-\n\fwritten notice, “without hearing or order by any court.” Though the Agreement did\nnot explicitly provide that this provision was intended to be the exclusive way to\nremove a trustee, Brown suggests that “[p]resumably the settlor never intended that\nhis two-income beneficiary children be engaged in court or arbitration proceedings\nto remove one another for alleged failure to cooperate or unfitness.”\n\n       For centuries, Anglo-American courts of equity have exercised jurisdiction to\nremove trustees when necessary for effective trust administration or to protect the\ninterests of trust beneficiaries. See Bogert, Bogert, & Hess, The Law of Trusts and\nTrustees § 519. Like the district court, we doubt that state courts would construe a\ntrust agreement as precluding judicial review of whether a trustee was fulfilling his\nfiduciary duties. See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 456.2-201, 456.2-202.3(9); 2 Rest.\n(Third) of Trusts § 29 cmt. m (2003) (“a trust provision may not be enforced if to do\nso would undermine proper administration of the trust”). The only non-controlling\ncase Brown cites to support his assertion that the statutory removal provisions on\nwhich the arbitrator relied are “non-mandatory” is so distinguishable that it requires\nno discussion. Bellamy v. Langfitt, 86 So.3d 1170, 1173-75 (Fla. App. 2012).\nMoreover, if state law would permit a trust agreement to foreclose judicial\nsupervision of its fiduciaries, such an intent would need to be explicitly stated. Cf.\nDavis v. U.S. Bank N.A., 243 S.W.3d 425, 431 (Mo. App. 2007). Therefore, the\narbitrator’s interpretation of the Trust Agreement’s removal provision is not a ground\nfor vacating the award.\n\n       3. Brown also argues that arbitrator McLeod’s decision to invoke the statutory\nremoval provisions “exceeded his powers” under Florida and Missouri law, requiring\nthat the award be vacated under FAA § 10(a)(4). This contention raises a more\ninteresting and difficult issue. The Florida and Missouri Trust Codes permit\n“interested persons” to “enter into a binding nonjudicial settlement agreement with\nrespect to any matter involving a trust.” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 736.011(2); Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§ 456.1-111.2. Brown argues that his children as “qualified beneficiaries” and\n\n                                        -14-\n\fRubenstein as successor co-trustee were interested persons “for purposes of\nconsensual trustee removal.” Therefore, the arbitrator exceeded his powers by\nresolving this dispute in a binding nonjudicial settlement agreement in which fewer\nthan all interested persons participated.\n\n       Both Florida and Missouri statutes provide, “The settlor, a cotrustee, or a\nbeneficiary may request the court to remove a trustee, or a trustee may be removed\nby the court on the court’s own initiative.” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 736.0706; see Mo. Rev.\nStat. § 456.7-706. After reviewing the Florida and Missouri cases Brown cited in\nsupport of this theory,3 the district court concluded that, while as a general rule “all\nbeneficiaries are persons needed for just adjudication of an action to remove trustees\nand require an accounting or restoration of trust assets,” Tick, 787 F.2d at 1494, these\ncases do not establish that beneficiaries must be parties in a trustee removal action\nthat does not involve an accounting or otherwise impact trust assets. The district\ncourt determined that any objection to Brown’s removal by his minor children, had\nthey been joined, “would have been similar to Brown’s,” and that Rubenstein was not\na necessary party because Brown’s attempt to appoint him was ineffective.\n\n       We take a somewhat different view of this issue. This trustee removal dispute\nwas substantively arbitrable under the Arbitration Agreement. The purpose of\nstatutes authorizing a “binding nonjudicial settlement agreement” is to “facilitate[]\nthe making of such agreements by giving them the same effect as if approved by the\ncourt,” not to preclude other types of agreements. Unif. Trust Code § 111 cmt., 7C\nU.L.A. 450-51 (2006). Thus, arbitrator McLeod did not exceed his powers simply\nby taking up the removal issue. However, the award was not based on McLeod’s\n\n      3\n       Tick v. Cohen, 787 F.2d 1490, 1494 (11th Cir. 1986) (per curiam); Grilley v.\nMarion Mortg. Co., 182 So. 297, 300 (Fla. 1937); Crescenze v. Bothe, 4 So.3d 31, 32-\n33 (Fla. App. 2009); Riggs v. Moise, 128 S.W.2d 632, 636 (Mo. banc 1939); Davis,\n243 S.W.3d at 429-30; Weldon Revocable Trust v. Weldon, 231 S.W.3d 158, 168-70\n(Mo. App. 2007); Roth v. Lehmann, 741 S.W.2d 860, 862-63 (Mo. App. 1987).\n                                         -15-\n\finterpretation of a contractual removal provision. Lacking a contractual mandate, he\nreached outside the Trust Agreement and the Arbitration Agreement and based\nremoval on grounds that are, by statute, exclusively judicial. In so doing, he exercised\na judicial power that “calls for the exercise of sound judicial discretion” and “should\nbe used sparingly.” Weldon Revocable Trust, 231 S.W.3d at 178. As the district\ncourt recognized and the cases cited in footnote 3 demonstrate, we doubt that a court\nwould have ordered Brown removed at the request of Brown-Thill unless all trust\nbeneficiaries were made parties to the action. See Bogert, Bogert, & Hess at § 522.\n\n       “If an arbitral decision is based solely upon the arbitrator’s view of the\nrequirements of enacted legislation, rather than on an interpretation of the\n[underlying] agreement, the arbitrator has exceeded the scope of the submission, and\nthe award will not be enforced.” Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 53\n(1974) (quotation omitted); see Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., 130\nS. Ct. 1758, 1767-68 (2010). That is not an easy standard to apply in this situation.\nHaving studied the few relevant authorities and the extensive record on appeal, we\nconclude that (i) Brown-Thill properly submitted the removal issue under the\nArbitration Agreement; (ii) arbitrator McLeod then had power to construe and apply\nthe Trust Agreement’s removal provision and to make findings regarding the statutory\nstandards for removal which Brown-Thill could present in a judicial proceeding under\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 736.0706 and Mo. Rev. Stat. § 456.7-706; but (iii) the arbitrator\nexceeded his powers by exercising the exclusively judicial function of removing\nBrown on statutory grounds. However, this decision is of no practical importance\nbecause Brown’s unconditional resignation on December 2, which was not effective\nwhen the arbitration award was made, is now effective. Therefore, Brown is not now,\nand has not been since the December 12 award, a co-trustee of the EDB Trust.\n\n     4. Finally, Brown raises the same FAA § 10(a)(2) challenge to the December\n12 award as he did in challenging the March 14 award, based on the same evidence\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fof evident partiality, the arbitrator’s alleged ex parte contacts with Brown-Thill and\nCooper. We reject this contention for the reasons stated above.\n\n           III. Brown-Thill’s Appeal of the Denial of Attorneys’ Fees\n\n       Brown-Thill appeals the district court’s denial of her request for attorneys’ fees\nand costs in defending against Brown’s actions to vacate the awards. Missouri\nsubscribes to the “American Rule” -- parties bear their own attorneys’ fees unless fee\nshifting is authorized by contract or statute. See generally Trimble v. Pracna, 167\nS.W.3d 706, 714 (Mo. banc 2005). Brown-Thill argues she is entitled to fee awards\nunder the unambiguous terms of the Arbitration Agreement, which provided in\nrelevant part:\n\n      C. . . . The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on the parties.\n      Judgment may be entered upon any award rendered by the arbitrator in\n      accordance with applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n                                  *    *    *     *   *\n\n      E. . . . If either party pursues any claim, dispute or controversy against\n      the other in a proceeding other than the arbitration provided herein, the\n      responding party shall be entitled to dismissal or injunctive relief\n      regarding such action and recovery of all costs, losses and attorneys’\n      fees relating to such action.\n\n      The district court concluded that the “judgment” referred to in paragraph C. of\nthe Arbitration Agreement “would include motions to confirm or vacate an arbitration\naward,” and therefore those motions are not “other” proceedings for which attorneys’\nfees may be awarded under paragraph E. Brown-Thill concedes she is not entitled to\nattorneys’ fees incurred in seeking a judgment confirming the December 12 award,\nbut argues she is contractually entitled to recover her attorneys’ fees in responding\nto Brown’s Application To Vacate the March 14 award and his Motion To Vacate the\n\n                                           -17-\n\fDecember 12 award. She argues that the Arbitration Agreement did not “reference[]\nthe parties’ right to challenge an arbitration award.” Rather, its intent was to allow\nan award to be quickly and efficiently confirmed “without the need to relitigate the\nsame arbitrable dispute.”\n\n       Brown-Thill’s attempt to segregate proceedings to confirm and to vacate an\naward ignores the Supreme Court’s interpretation of FAA §§ 9-11 as “mechanisms\nfor enforcing arbitration awards,” with § 9 expressly providing that an award must be\nconfirmed “unless” it is vacated, modified, or corrected under §§ 10-11. Hall Street\nAssoc., 552 U.S. at 582. The enforceability of an award is an essential part of\narbitration as authorized by the FAA. See FAA § 2. Thus, if a contract does not\nauthorize an award of attorneys’ fees incurred in the arbitration itself, like the\nArbitration Agreement in this case, it also does not authorize an award of attorneys’\nfees incurred in enforcing or defending the award in proceedings under FAA §§ 9-11.\nWe agree with the district court that the relevant provisions of the Arbitration\nAgreement were “clearly meant to compel the parties to arbitrate their disputes, not\nto prevent them from seeking to vacate or confirm an award in a court.” As\nconfirmation or vacation of an award is part of the arbitration process, Brown-Thill\nis not entitled to recover attorneys’ fees.\n\n       The judgments of the district court are affirmed, with the modification noted\nin Part II.B.3 of this opinion. Brown’s motion to take judicial notice is denied.\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f",

Brown (“Brown”) and Susan Brown-Thill (“Brown-Thill”), the\nchildren of Eugene D. Brown and Saurine L. Brown, became the sole co-trustees of\nthe complex Eugene D. Brown Trust (“EDB Trust”) after the death of their mother,\nthe surviving spouse under that Trust. Unable to resolve many conflicts about\nmanaging the EDB Trust and other family trusts and partnerships, in March 2010\nBrown and Brown-Thill signed an Arbitration Agreement for resolving a broad range\nof disputes. The Agreement provided “that the first matter to be taken up by the\narbitrator will be all issues associated with the documentation for and means of\npayment of the estate taxes due on the estate of Saurine L. Brown.” These\nconsolidated appeals involve two of the many awards that followed that initial\narbitration -- a March 14, 2011, award that authorized distributions from family-\nowned limited partnerships to family trusts, and a December 12, 2011, award that (i)\ndeclared invalid Brown’s attempt to resign as co-trustee and name his successor, and\n(ii) removed Brown as co-trustee, applying the Uniform Trust Code’s standards for\nthe statutory removal of a trustee as adopted in Missouri, the situs of the controversy,\nand Florida, the situs of the EDB Trust. The district court1 denied Brown’s attempt\nto vacate both awards and Brown-Thill’s request for a contractual award of attorneys’\nfees in both lawsuits. Brown and Brown-Thill cross-appeal these rulings. With one\nmodification that does not affect the status of EDB Trust administration following the\nawards, we affirm.\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri, presided in both cases.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                             I. The Underlying Impasse.\n\n       Eugene and Saurine Brown created several entities to hold and manage Brown\nfamily assets, including two trusts, the EDB Trust and the Saurine L. Brown Trust\n(“SLB Trust”); a limited liability corporation, Brown Bear LLC (“Brown Bear”); and\ntwo family limited partnerships, 7219 Metcalf Partnership, L.P. (“FLP I”) and 7219\nMetcalf Partnership II, L.P. (“FLP II”). At the times in question, Brown and Brown-\nThill were the co-trustees of the EDB Trust. Attorney James Cooper was the sole\ntrustee of the SLB Trust. Brown Bear was the general partner of FLP I and FLP II.\nThe EDB Trust and the SLB Trust each owned 50% of Brown Bear. Thus, for Brown\nBear to cause FLP I or FLP II to take an action such as distributing income to other\nfamily entities, Brown, Brown-Thill, and Cooper must all agree.\n\n       In early 2011, due to the decision-making impasse between Brown and Brown-\nThill, FLP I and FLP II had issued no partnership distributions since 2008. On\nFebruary 22, with tax deadlines approaching, Cooper emailed a partnership\ndistribution proposal (“Trust Funding Proposal”) to counsel for Brown and Brown-\nThill, and to the arbitrator specifically named in an April 6, 2010, amendment to the\nArbitration Agreement, Richard McLeod. The email stated, “The SLB Trust approves\nthis plan, and we need the approval of the EDB Trust, which may or may not require\narbitration. . . . If that approval is not given by the end of the day on March 3rd, I will\nschedule a Partnership meeting for FLP I, FLP II and Brown Bear, LLC for a vote on\nthe proposal.” Brown did not agree to the proposal and the issue was submitted to\narbitrator McLeod, resulting in the March 14 award at issue.\n\n       While the siblings litigated Brown’s application to vacate the March 14 award,\nthey continued to disagree about management of the EDB Trust. Before Brown-Thill\nsubmitted a planned proposal to arbitrate whether Brown should be removed as co-\ntrustee, Brown signed a notice resigning “[e]ffective upon the appointment of John\nL. Rubenstein as my Successor Co-Trustee,” and a separate document appointing\n\n                                           -3-\n\fRubenstein as successor co-trustee, which Rubenstein accepted. Brown-Thill took\nthe position that Brown could not unilaterally appoint a successor co-trustee, but that\nRubenstein’s appointment would be effective if she agreed to it. After discussions\nand actions suggesting that Brown-Thill would agree to Rubenstein’s appointment,\nshe decided she would not approve Rubenstein and advised Brown she would submit\nto arbitration (i) whether Brown’s conditional resignation and unilateral appointment\nof Rubenstein were ineffective, (ii) whether Brown should be removed as co-trustee,\nand (iii) whether an employee of FLP I should be given an employment contract that\nBrown opposed. The dispute was submitted to arbitrator McLeod, resulting in the\nDecember 12, 2011, award at issue.\n\n                II. Brown’s Challenges to the Arbitration Awards.\n\n       The general provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-\n16, govern our judicial review of the arbitration awards at issue. Because Brown\nchallenges the awards on nearly every conceivable basis, it is important at the outset\nto reiterate the deferential standards that govern our review.\n\n       First, an arbitrator’s authority is contractual. Therefore, the threshold question\nwhether the parties to the Arbitration Agreement agreed to arbitrate a particular\ndispute -- the dispute’s “substantive arbitrability” -- is a question for the court (unless\nthe parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability). First Options of\nChicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117937\"><a href=\"/opinion/117937/first-options-of-chicago-inc-v-kaplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942-44 (1995). Here, Brown seeks this level\nof de novo review by characterizing some of his arguments as issues of substantive\narbitrability. We reject this contention based upon the breadth of the Arbitration\nAgreement, which provided that Brown and Brown-Thill agreed:\n\n              All existing and future disputes and controversies between the\n       parties, whether in their individual capacities, their capacities as co-\n       beneficiaries and/or co-trustees of [the EDB and SLB trusts], or in their\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f      capacities as co-owners, partners, or members of any business entity,\n      including [Brown Bear, FLP I, and FLP II] . . . which arise out of or\n      relate to the administration and investment of the trusts, partnerships and\n      assets of the [EDB and SLB] estates, the payment of estate taxes of such\n      estates, or the division of assets of such estates, shall be submitted to\n      binding arbitration pursuant to the following procedures.\n\nEvery issue submitted to and resolved by the arbitrator in his March 14 and December\n12 awards fell within this comprehensive agreement to arbitrate. Thus, the many\nissues raised in Brown’s two appeals are not issues of substantive arbitrability.\n\n       Second, judicial review of the merits of an arbitrator’s award is conducted\nunder an extremely deferential standard of review. Section 9 of the FAA provides\nthat a reviewing court “must” confirm an award unless it is “vacated, modified, or\ncorrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11.” Therefore, the Supreme Court held,\nresolving a conflict in the circuits, “§§ 10 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the\nreview provided by the statute.” Hall St. Assoc., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145821\"><a href=\"/opinion/145821/hall-street-associates-llc-v-mattel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n590 (2008). Applying this deferential standard, “[c]ourts have no authority to\nreconsider the merits of an arbitration award, even when the parties allege that the\naward rests on factual errors or on a misinterpretation of the underlying contract.”\nMedicine Shoppe Intern., Inc. v. Turner Inv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151185\"><a href=\"/opinion/151185/medicine-shoppe-intern-v-turner-investments/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488 (8th Cir. 2010).\n\n                            A. The March 14 Award.\n\n      The March 14 award ordered Brown “as co-trustee of the EDB [Trust to] timely\nexecute all documentation necessary to effectuate both of the proposed distributions”\nfrom FLP I and FLP II. Brown challenges this award on several grounds.\n\n      1. Brown first argues that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by deciding a\ndispute that was not submitted in accordance with procedures mandated by the\nArbitration Agreement. The Agreement as amended in April 2010 provided:\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      A. Either party may give email notice to the other that they deem an\n      issue to be a subject for arbitration, which notice shall specify the issue\n      and the proposed resolution. If the parties fail to resolve such issue\n      within seven calendar days of such notice, the issue will be submitted to\n      an arbitrator for mediation, and, if the mediation is unsuccessful, for\n      binding arbitration.\n\n                                 *    *   *     *   *\n\n      D. The arbitrator shall establish procedures to be followed for each\n      arbitration. If either party fails to follow or abide by the arbitrator’s\n      required procedures within the time frames set out by the arbitrator, the\n      arbitrator shall be authorized to resolve the issue without the full\n      participation of the non-abiding party and both parties shall be bound by\n      the arbitrator’s decision.\n\nBrown asserts that Cooper was a non-party who could not submit a dispute to\narbitration; that Brown-Thill never specified the issue and her proposed resolution;\nthat the dispute was not submitted to the arbitrator within seven days; and that the\narbitrator conducted no mediation and failed to establish procedures for the\narbitration. As these contractual “prerequisites” were not followed, he argues that the\ndispute was not arbitrable.\n\n       The district court properly characterized these contentions as raising issues of\n“procedural arbitrability.” When raised in a lawsuit to enjoin a demand for\narbitration, “procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final\ndisposition are presumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator.” Howsam v.\nDean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122248\"><a href=\"/opinion/122248/howsam-v-dean-witter-reynolds-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (2002) (emphasis in original, quotation\nomitted); see Pro Tech Indus., Inc. v.

Thus, it was for arbitrator McLeod to decide in the first instance procedural\nquestions such as whether the dispute was properly submitted, whether mediation was\nrequired, and whether specific arbitration procedures needed to be established for\nparties who had previously arbitrated numerous disputes.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f        When an arbitration has been completed and a court is asked to vacate the\naward because the arbitrator was guilty of or permitted the prevailing party to commit\nprocedural irregularities, “we must . . . accord even greater deference to the\narbitrator’s decisions on procedural matters than those bearing on substantive\ngrounds.” Stroh Container Co. v.

Bearing in mind the\nSupreme Court’s recent teaching in Hall Street Associates, we conclude that an award\nmay not be vacated on this ground unless a procedural irregularity resulted in non-\ncompliance with the mandates of FAA §§ 10 and 11.\n\n      2. Proceeding on that alternative basis, Brown also argues that the arbitrator’s\nprocedural errors violated FAA §§ 10(a)(2), (3), and (4), which provide that an award\nmay be vacated:\n\n         (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,\n      or either of them;\n\n         (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to\n      postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear\n      evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other\n      misbehavior by which the rights of a party have been prejudiced; or\n\n         (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\n      executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject\n      matter submitted was not made.\n\n      a. § 10(a)(2). Brown argues that the arbitrator’s ex parte contacts with Cooper\nand Brown-Thill before the arbitration hearing established his evident partiality and\nrequire vacating the March 14 award under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2). This contention is\nwithout merit. First, Brown makes no showing that he raised this contention to the\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\farbitrator, meaning it was waived.

Brown has not come close\nto meeting this burden. Arbitrator McLeod was hand-picked by the parties to the\nArbitration Agreement, including Brown, and had mediated and arbitrated many\nearlier disputes. In these circumstances, prior contacts -- ex parte and otherwise,\ndisclosed and undisclosed -- were inevitable, requiring a specific showing that\nparticular contacts influenced the arbitrator’s resolution of this dispute.

Brown made no such showing.\n\n      b. § 10(a)(3). Brown argues that the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct or\nmisbehavior warranting vacating the award because he “did not conduct any hearing\nor otherwise provide the parties with an opportunity to present evidence and\nargument,” and because he did not notify Brown that he “would convert the\ntelephonic partnership meeting into an arbitration hearing.” A party seeking to vacate\nan award for misconduct under § 10(a)(3) must show that he was “deprived of a fair\nhearing.” Grahams Serv.

The district court found “no reason to infer that [the arbitrator] engaged in any\nmisconduct or misbehavior” or deprived Brown of a fair opportunity to present\nevidence and argument in support of his position. We agree.\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f       The arbitrator was faced with a procedurally unusual dispute that presented\nserious time pressures -- whether, at a scheduled meeting of the family partnerships,\nthe EDB Trust should vote for or against a proposal to distribute funds urgently\nneeded to meet obligations of other family entities. The arbitrator held a telephonic\nhearing on March 10. Prior to that hearing, Brown, Brown-Thill, Cooper, and the\narbitrator exchanged several emails concerning whether the EDB Trust would vote\nin favor of Cooper’s Trust Funding Proposal. Brown-Thill expressed her support for\nthe proposal noting that, if Brown did not agree, “[t]he dispute would be submitted\nto [the arbitrator] for his resolution.” Brown’s attorney conveyed Brown’s objection\non March 3. That day, Cooper sent a Notice of Partnership Meeting on March 10,\ncopying arbitrator McLeod “so that he is aware of what is happening and will be\nprepared in the event a dispute arises between the Trustees of the EDB Trust.”\n(emphasis in original). Before the March 10 hearing, Brown had notice that the\narbitrator would attend the partnership meeting and would enter an award resolving\nany dispute between Brown and Brown-Thill over the Trust Funding Proposal.\nBrown’s attorney objected that “an award based on . . . a phone conversation . . . does\nnot comply with the arbitration agreement.”\n\n       The telephonic hearing was conducted during the partnership meeting. Brown-\nThill and Cooper voted in favor of the Trust Funding Proposal. Brown did not attend\nbut, through counsel, voted against and “objected to the timing of the meeting and the\nmeeting process.” After the meeting, Brown reiterated his substantive objections to\nthe arbitrator by email, claiming that he lacked necessary information and was “given\nneither the opportunity to vote nor the opportunity to present a case” because he had\nnot been available to attend on March 10. Brown’s attorney submitted further written\nsubstantive objections. The arbitrator issued his award on March 14. Particularly in\nlight of the need to promptly resolve this long-simmering dispute, we cannot\nconclude that the arbitrator denied Brown and his counsel fair opportunity to present\nevidence and argument or deprived Brown of a fair hearing.\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f       c. § 10(a)(4). Brown argues that the March 14 award should be vacated under\n§ 10(a)(4) because the arbitrator “exceeded his powers” by making an award that\n“manifestly disregard[ed]” the unambiguous procedural requirements of the\nArbitration Agreement. After closely examining the evidence in the record, the\ndistrict court concluded that the arbitrator adequately followed the relatively informal\nprocedures set forth in the Arbitration Agreement. Again, we agree.\n\n       For Brown to prevail on this claim, “[i]t is not enough to show that the\narbitrator committed an error -- or even a serious error. Because the parties bargained\nfor the arbitrator’s construction of their agreement, an arbitral decision even arguably\nconstruing or applying the contract must stand, regardless of a court’s view of its\n(de)merits.” Oxford Health Plans LLC v.

This review must be particularly deferential when\nthe arbitrator is accused of violating the procedural limits of his authority.\n“[A]rbitrators are the experts about the meaning of their own rules, and are\ncomparatively better able to interpret and to apply them than courts.” Pro Tech, 377\nF.3d at 872. Here, Brown had adequate notice of the proceeding and the Trust\nFunding Proposal, and the arbitrator made himself available for mediation and gave\nBrown an adequate opportunity to present and argue his position. It was for the\narbitrator to determine whether the Arbitration Agreement’s procedural guidelines\nrequired more in resolving this procedurally unusual dispute.2\n\n       3. Turning to the substantive merits of the March 14 award, Brown argues that\nit should be vacated under § 10(a)(4) because the arbitrator exceeded his powers\nwhen he manifestly disregarded the EDB Trust Agreement by acting as if he were a\ntrustee in voting to approve the Trust Funding Proposal, substituting his own\n\n\n      2\n       As Brown “raised these issues to the arbitrator,” we may not vacate the award\nsimply because the arbitrator did not make an express finding that the Arbitration\nAgreement’s procedures were satisfied. El Dorado, 247 F.3d at 847.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fdiscretionary judgment for the judgment of co-trustee Brown that was required by the\nTrust Agreement. This strange argument is unsound for at least three reasons.\n\n       First, the Arbitration Agreement applied to “[a]ll existing and future disputes\nand controversies between the parties . . . in their . . . capacities as . . . co-trustees of\n[the EDB Trust] which arise out of or relate to the administration and investment of\nthe trusts, partnerships and assets of the [EDB and SLB] estates.” Thus, if sound, this\nargument would compel the conclusion that the Agreement was, to a very large\nextent, void ab initio. Yet Brown willingly entered into the Agreement and\nparticipated without objection in numerous prior arbitrations, most of which no doubt\nentailed disputes between Brown and Brown-Thill acting in their capacities as co-\ntrustees. Second, Brown points to no provision in the EDB Trust Agreement\nreflecting the settlor’s intent to prohibit this type of sensible co-trustee dispute\nresolution. Third, the contention’s factual premise is wrong. Arbitrator McLeod did\nnot exercise his judgment as a non-appointed co-trustee. Rather, he decided which\nof the conflicting judgments of the appointed co-trustees should be given effect.\nBrown did not argue to the arbitrator that Brown-Thill’s vote in favor of the Trust\nFunding Proposal violated her fiduciary duties as co-trustee. State law might require\nan arbitrator to consider that argument. Nor did Brown argue that the Trust Funding\nProposal conflicted with terms of the Trust Agreement. Thus, in resolving this\ndispute, the arbitrator acted squarely within the authority granted by the Arbitration\nAgreement, not as a trustee.\n\n       4. Finally, Brown argues the arbitrator exceeded his powers by signing\ndocuments implementing the Trust Funding Proposal, post-arbitration, when Brown\nfailed to comply with the order that he timely do so. This action is not grounds for\nvacating the award under FAA § 10. Nor was this action the type of improper post-\narbitration actions falling within the “functus officio” doctrine. See Legion Ins. Co.\nv. VCW, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767038\"><a href=\"/opinion/767038/legion-insurance-co-v-vcw-inc-preferred-administrative-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1999). Moreover, it would appear that the\narbitrator’s signature on documents was not necessary to carry out the award; the\n\n                                            -11-\n\fArbitration Agreement provided, “The arbitrator’s decision shall have the effect of\na joint instruction and/or authorization from Richard Lotman Brown and Susan L.\nBrown-Thill and may be presented as such to third-parties.” As the issue does not\naffect the award’s validity, we decline to consider it further.\n\n                           B. The December 12 Award.\n\n      After Brown-Thill decided not to approve Rubenstein as successor co-trustee,\nshe notified Brown that an arbitration hearing would be held on December 5, 2011,\nto determine whether Brown’s conditional resignation and unilateral appointment\nwere ineffective, and whether Brown should be removed as co-trustee. Brown made\nseveral motions seeking to prevent this arbitration, which arbitrator McLeod denied.\nBrown also executed an unconditional notice of intent to resign as trustee on\nDecember 2, effective thirty days later. The arbitration proceeded as scheduled on\nDecember 5. Brown-Thill presented extensive testimony and exhibits. Brown\ndeclined to attend or to present evidence but submitted his own proposed award.\n\n      The arbitrator determined that, under the EDB Trust Agreement, (i) Brown\ncould not unilaterally appoint a successor co-trustee while he and Brown-Thill\ncontinued to act as co-trustees; (ii) Brown-Thill did not consent to the appointment\nof Rubenstein; and (iii) Brown’s conditional resignation was ineffective because he\ndid not give thirty days notice, as the Trust Agreement required, and because it was\nconditioned upon Rubenstein’s appointment, which was ineffective. Turning to\nBrown-Thill’s request to remove Brown, the arbitrator found no provision in the\nTrust Agreement permitting one co-trustee to remove the other. However, both\nFlorida and Missouri statutes provide that the court may remove a trustee if “lack of\ncooperation among co-trustees substantially impairs the administration of the trust,”\nor “because of unfitness, unwillingness, or persistent failure of the trustee to\nadminister the trust effectively.” Mo. Rev. Stat. § 456.7-706(2), (3); see Fla. Stat.\nAnn. § 736.0706(2)(b), (c). Invoking these statutes, the arbitrator granted Brown-\n\n                                        -12-\n\fThill’s petition to remove Brown, finding that he had “failed to adequately cooperate\nwith Brown-Thill to ensure the effective administration of the EDB Trusts on\nnumerous occasions,” causing an “impasse” that was likely to continue in the future.\n\n       1. On appeal, Brown first argues the district court erred in interpreting the\nEDB Trust Agreement to preclude his unilateral appointment of Rubenstein as co-\ntrustee, and to render his October 10 conditional resignation ineffective. The\nargument is misfocused. It was not the district court’s function to interpret the Trust\nAgreement. The Arbitration Agreement authorized the arbitrator to resolve any\ndispute submitted by Brown or Brown-Thill that arose out of or related to the\nadministration of the EDB Trust. The FAA mandates that an arbitrator’s award not\nbe vacated so long as the arbitrator was “even arguably construing or applying the\ncontract” he was commissioned to interpret. Oxford Health Plans, 133 S. Ct. at 2068;\nsee United Paperworkers Int’l Union v. Misco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37-38 (1987). After\ncarefully considering the Trust Agreement provisions relating to trustee resignation\nand the appointment of successors, arbitrator McLeod concluded that Brown’s initial\nresignation was ineffective both procedurally -- for lack of the required notice -- and\nsubstantively -- because conditioned on Brown’s unauthorized unilateral appointment\nof a successor. As these conclusions drew their essence from the underlying Trust\nAgreement, the award may not be vacated under FAA § 10. Likewise, given our\ndeferential review of the arbitrator’s award, Brown’s contentions that Brown-Thill’s\nacceptance of Rubenstein resolved the dispute before it was submitted to arbitration,\nand that the arbitrator never considered Brown’s December 2 resignation, are not\ngrounds for vacating the award under FAA § 10.\n\n       2. Brown further argues the district court erred in rejecting his contention that\nthe method for removing a trustee contained in the EDB Trust Agreement reflected\nthe settlor’s intent to preclude the arbitrator’s statutory removal of a co-trustee. In a\nsection titled, “Removal of Trustee,” the Trust Agreement authorized a majority of\nthe income beneficiaries to remove a trustee and to designate a successor trustee by\n\n                                          -13-\n\fwritten notice, “without hearing or order by any court.” Though the Agreement did\nnot explicitly provide that this provision was intended to be the exclusive way to\nremove a trustee, Brown suggests that “[p]resumably the settlor never intended that\nhis two-income beneficiary children be engaged in court or arbitration proceedings\nto remove one another for alleged failure to cooperate or unfitness.”\n\n       For centuries, Anglo-American courts of equity have exercised jurisdiction to\nremove trustees when necessary for effective trust administration or to protect the\ninterests of trust beneficiaries. See Bogert, Bogert, & Hess, The Law of Trusts and\nTrustees § 519. Like the district court, we doubt that state courts would construe a\ntrust agreement as precluding judicial review of whether a trustee was fulfilling his\nfiduciary duties. See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 456.2-201, 456.2-202.3(9); 2 Rest.\n(Third) of Trusts § 29 cmt. m (2003) (“a trust provision may not be enforced if to do\nso would undermine proper administration of the trust”). The only non-controlling\ncase Brown cites to support his assertion that the statutory removal provisions on\nwhich the arbitrator relied are “non-mandatory” is so distinguishable that it requires\nno discussion. Bellamy v. Langfitt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173-75 (Fla. App. 2012).\nMoreover, if state law would permit a trust agreement to foreclose judicial\nsupervision of its fiduciaries, such an intent would need to be explicitly stated. Cf.\nDavis v. U.S. Bank N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431 (Mo. App. 2007). Therefore, the\narbitrator’s interpretation of the Trust Agreement’s removal provision is not a ground\nfor vacating the award.\n\n       3. Brown also argues that arbitrator McLeod’s decision to invoke the statutory\nremoval provisions “exceeded his powers” under Florida and Missouri law, requiring\nthat the award be vacated under FAA § 10(a)(4). This contention raises a more\ninteresting and difficult issue. The Florida and Missouri Trust Codes permit\n“interested persons” to “enter into a binding nonjudicial settlement agreement with\nrespect to any matter involving a trust.” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 736.011(2); Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§ 456.1-111.2. Brown argues that his children as “qualified beneficiaries” and\n\n                                        -14-\n\fRubenstein as successor co-trustee were interested persons “for purposes of\nconsensual trustee removal.” Therefore, the arbitrator exceeded his powers by\nresolving this dispute in a binding nonjudicial settlement agreement in which fewer\nthan all interested persons participated.\n\n       Both Florida and Missouri statutes provide, “The settlor, a cotrustee, or a\nbeneficiary may request the court to remove a trustee, or a trustee may be removed\nby the court on the court’s own initiative.” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 736.0706; see Mo. Rev.\nStat. § 456.7-706. After reviewing the Florida and Missouri cases Brown cited in\nsupport of this theory,3 the district court concluded that, while as a general rule “all\nbeneficiaries are persons needed for just adjudication of an action to remove trustees\nand require an accounting or restoration of trust assets,” Tick, 787 F.2d at 1494, these\ncases do not establish that beneficiaries must be parties in a trustee removal action\nthat does not involve an accounting or otherwise impact trust assets. The district\ncourt determined that any objection to Brown’s removal by his minor children, had\nthey been joined, “would have been similar to Brown’s,” and that Rubenstein was not\na necessary party because Brown’s attempt to appoint him was ineffective.\n\n       We take a somewhat different view of this issue. This trustee removal dispute\nwas substantively arbitrable under the Arbitration Agreement. The purpose of\nstatutes authorizing a “binding nonjudicial settlement agreement” is to “facilitate[]\nthe making of such agreements by giving them the same effect as if approved by the\ncourt,” not to preclude other types of agreements. Unif. Trust Code § 111 cmt., 7C\nU.L.A. 450-51 (2006). Thus, arbitrator McLeod did not exceed his powers simply\nby taking up the removal issue. However, the award was not based on McLeod’s\n\n      3\n       Tick v.

Lacking a contractual mandate, he\nreached outside the Trust Agreement and the Arbitration Agreement and based\nremoval on grounds that are, by statute, exclusively judicial. In so doing, he exercised\na judicial power that “calls for the exercise of sound judicial discretion” and “should\nbe used sparingly.” Weldon Revocable Trust, 231 S.W.3d at 178. As the district\ncourt recognized and the cases cited in footnote 3 demonstrate, we doubt that a court\nwould have ordered Brown removed at the request of Brown-Thill unless all trust\nbeneficiaries were made parties to the action. See Bogert, Bogert, & Hess at § 522.\n\n       “If an arbitral decision is based solely upon the arbitrator’s view of the\nrequirements of enacted legislation, rather than on an interpretation of the\n[underlying] agreement, the arbitrator has exceeded the scope of the submission, and\nthe award will not be enforced.” Alexander v.

That is not an easy standard to apply in this situation.\nHaving studied the few relevant authorities and the extensive record on appeal, we\nconclude that (i) Brown-Thill properly submitted the removal issue under the\nArbitration Agreement; (ii) arbitrator McLeod then had power to construe and apply\nthe Trust Agreement’s removal provision and to make findings regarding the statutory\nstandards for removal which Brown-Thill could present in a judicial proceeding under\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 736.0706 and Mo. Rev. Stat. § 456.7-706; but (iii) the arbitrator\nexceeded his powers by exercising the exclusively judicial function of removing\nBrown on statutory grounds. However, this decision is of no practical importance\nbecause Brown’s unconditional resignation on December 2, which was not effective\nwhen the arbitration award was made, is now effective. Therefore, Brown is not now,\nand has not been since the December 12 award, a co-trustee of the EDB Trust.\n\n     4. Finally, Brown raises the same FAA § 10(a)(2) challenge to the December\n12 award as he did in challenging the March 14 award, based on the same evidence\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fof evident partiality, the arbitrator’s alleged ex parte contacts with Brown-Thill and\nCooper. We reject this contention for the reasons stated above.\n\n           III. Brown-Thill’s Appeal of the Denial of Attorneys’ Fees\n\n       Brown-Thill appeals the district court’s denial of her request for attorneys’ fees\nand costs in defending against Brown’s actions to vacate the awards. Missouri\nsubscribes to the “American Rule” -- parties bear their own attorneys’ fees unless fee\nshifting is authorized by contract or statute. See generally Trimble v. Pracna, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1629348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1629348/trimble-v-pracna/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 714 (Mo. banc 2005). Brown-Thill argues she is entitled to fee awards\nunder the unambiguous terms of the Arbitration Agreement, which provided in\nrelevant part:\n\n      C. . . . The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on the parties.\n      Judgment may be entered upon any award rendered by the arbitrator in\n      accordance with applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n                                  *    *    *     *   *\n\n      E. . . . If either party pursues any claim, dispute or controversy against\n      the other in a proceeding other than the arbitration provided herein, the\n      responding party shall be entitled to dismissal or injunctive relief\n      regarding such action and recovery of all costs, losses and attorneys’\n      fees relating to such action.\n\n      The district court concluded that the “judgment” referred to in paragraph C. of\nthe Arbitration Agreement “would include motions to confirm or vacate an arbitration\naward,” and therefore those motions are not “other” proceedings for which attorneys’\nfees may be awarded under paragraph E. Brown-Thill concedes she is not entitled to\nattorneys’ fees incurred in seeking a judgment confirming the December 12 award,\nbut argues she is contractually entitled to recover her attorneys’ fees in responding\nto Brown’s Application To Vacate the March 14 award and his Motion To Vacate the\n\n                                           -17-\n\fDecember 12 award. She argues that the Arbitration Agreement did not “reference[]\nthe parties’ right to challenge an arbitration award.” Rather, its intent was to allow\nan award to be quickly and efficiently confirmed “without the need to relitigate the\nsame arbitrable dispute.”\n\n       Brown-Thill’s attempt to segregate proceedings to confirm and to vacate an\naward ignores the Supreme Court’s interpretation of FAA §§ 9-11 as “mechanisms\nfor enforcing arbitration awards,” with § 9 expressly providing that an award must be\nconfirmed “unless” it is vacated, modified, or corrected under §§ 10-11. Hall Street\nAssoc., 552 U.S. at 582. The enforceability of an award is an essential part of\narbitration as authorized by the FAA. See FAA § 2. Thus, if a contract does not\nauthorize an award of attorneys’ fees incurred in the arbitration itself, like the\nArbitration Agreement in this case, it also does not authorize an award of attorneys’\nfees incurred in enforcing or defending the award in proceedings under FAA §§ 9-11.\nWe agree with the district court that the relevant provisions of the Arbitration\nAgreement were “clearly meant to compel the parties to arbitrate their disputes, not\nto prevent them from seeking to vacate or confirm an award in a court.” As\nconfirmation or vacation of an award is part of the arbitration process, Brown-Thill\nis not entitled to recover attorneys’ fees.\n\n       The judgments of the district court are affirmed, with the modification noted\nin Part II.B.3 of this opinion. Brown’s motion to take judicial notice is denied.\n                         ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f</pre>",
