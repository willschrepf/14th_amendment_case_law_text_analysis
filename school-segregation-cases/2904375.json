Public Citizen Health\n\n                             5\n\fResearch Group and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry,\nRubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service\nWorker’s International Union, (collectively “HRG”) join in\narguing that OSHA violated its statutory mandate in adopting a\nstandard that under-regulates Cr(VI) exposure. The Edison\nElectric Institute (“EEI”) separately argues that OSHA\nimproperly adopted a standard that is over-inclusive of coal and\nnuclear electric power generating plants. For the reasons stated\nbelow, we will grant HRG’s petition with regard to the\nemployee exposure notification requirements of the standard.\nWe will deny both petitions on all other grounds.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n        Cr(VI) is a state of the metal chromium that generally\nresults from man-made processes. Occupational Exposure to\nHexavalent Chromium, 71 Fed. Reg. 10,100, 10,104 (Feb. 28,\n2006). Compounds containing Cr(VI) can exist in mist, dust, or\nfume form, and have long been known to jeopardize the health\nof workers when inhaled, or upon contact with skin. Cr(VI) has\nbeen known to cause lung cancer, asthma, and damage to skin\nand the lining of the nasal passage. Id. at 10,108. Compounds\ncontaining Cr(VI) are used intentionally to perform metal\nelectroplating, and in the production of chemical catalysts and\npigments for textile dyes, paints, inks, glass, and plastics.\nCr(VI) compounds are also encountered incidentally, for\nexample as a by-product of certain welding processes, and as an\nimpurity found in portland cement. Id. According to OSHA,\n\n                               6\n\fthere are over 30 industry sectors in which workers may be\nexposed to Cr(VI). Id. at 10,246-55.\n\n        In 1971, OSHA adopted a permissible exposure limit\n(“PEL”) of 52 micrograms of Cr(VI) per cubic meter, or\n52 µg/m 3 , which had been a recommended industry limit since\n1943. Id. at 10,101-03. The early standard was established to\nprotect nasal tissues from irritation and damage, but, over time,\ngovernment and private organizations came to recognize Cr(VI)\nas a carcinogen. Id. at 10,103. In 1998, this Court denied a\npetition by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union and\nPublic Citizen’s Health Research Group to compel OSHA to\nestablish a lower PEL for Cr(VI). Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers\nUnion v. OSHA, 145 F.3d 120 (3d Cir. 1998). In 2002,\nhowever, this Court directed OSHA to “proceed expeditiously\nwith its [Cr(VI)] rulemaking” after finding that OSHA’s delay\nin promulgating a new standard had become unreasonable. Pub.\nCitizen Health Research Group v. Chao, 314 F.3d 143, 159\n(3d Cir. 2002).\n\n       OSHA subsequently proposed a new Cr(VI) standard in\n2004, and opened the matter for comment. The proposed rule\ncontemplated reducing the PEL from 52 to 1 µg/m 3 .\nOccupational Exposure to Hexavalent Chromium, 69 Fed.\nReg. 59,306 (Oct. 4, 2004). After extensive comments and\nhearings, OSHA issued its final rule on February 28, 2006.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,100. Upon examining the health risks to\nworkers, and the feasibility of implementing various PELs,\n\n                               7\n\fOSHA replaced the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL with a universal PEL\nof 5 µg/m 3 . 71 Fed. Reg. 10,100-385. OSHA issued corrections\nto the final rule on June 23, 2006, and a minor amendment on\nOctober 30, 2006, reflecting a settlement agreement with\nvarious parties. 71 Fed. Reg. 36,008 (June 23, 2006); 71 Fed.\nReg. 63,238 (Oct. 30, 2006).\n\n       HRG and EEI level a number of attacks on the\nmethodology employed and conclusions reached by OSHA. We\naccordingly summarize OSHA’s relevant methodology and\nfindings as background for our decision.\n\n               A. Estimation of Health Risk\n\n        In adopting a new standard, OSHA must establish that\nworkers face a significant risk of material harm. OSHA\nconsidered more than 40 studies of workers in order to assess\nthe relationship between exposure to Cr(VI) and lung cancer.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,175. OSHA decided to base its risk analysis on\nthe so-called “Gibb” and “Luippold” cohorts, which were both\nderived from studies of workers in chromate production\nfacilities. Id. at 10,176, 10,220. According to OSHA,\n\n      the Gibb cohort and the Luippold cohort, were\n      found to be the strongest data sets for quantitative\n      assessment . . . . Of the various studies, these two\n      had the most extensive and best documented\n      Cr(VI) exposures spanning three or four decades.\n\n                               8\n\f       Both cohort studies characterized observed and\n       expected lung cancer mortality and reported a\n       statistically significant positive association\n       between lung cancer risk and cumulative Cr(VI)\n       exposure.\n\nId. at 10,176.\n\n       OSHA found that a “linear relative risk model” best\ndescribed the relationship between Cr(VI) exposure and lung\ncancer, whereby the exposure level over the course of a\nhypothetical 45-year career was directly correlated to the risk of\ncancer. Id. at 10,194. OSHA used the Gibb and Luippold\ncohorts to establish upper and lower estimates of cancer cases\nper 1000 workers, and tabulated the estimated cases for\nexposure levels ranging from 0.25 µg/m 3 to the pre-existing PEL\nof 52 µg/m 3 . Id. at 10,195. According to the resulting table,\nexposure at 1 µg/m 3 would result in an estimated 2.1 to 9.1\ncancer cases, exposure at 5 µg/m 3 would result in 10 to 45 cases,\nand exposure at the pre-existing PEL would result in 101 to 351\ncases. Id.\n\n       Based in part on this information, OSHA concluded that\n“Cr(VI) causes ‘material impairment of health or functional\ncapacity’ within the meaning of the OSH Act.” Id. at 10,221.\nOSHA further determined that the cancer risk of 100 to 350\ncases under exposure at the pre-existing 52 µg/m 3 PEL was\n“clearly significant.” Id. at 10,224. OSHA also found that the\n\n                                9\n\festimated 10 to 45 cases at a career exposure level of 5 µg/m 3 ,\nthe PEL ultimately selected, would represent a substantial\nimprovement, but the risk of impairment would remain “clearly\nsignificant.” Id.\n\n                   B. Feasibility Analysis\n\n        By law, OSHA is required to demonstrate both the\n“technological” and “economic” feasibility of a standard. After\nexploring the technological and economic feasibility of\nalternative Cr(VI) PELs, OSHA concluded that implementation\nof the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL would not be feasible. Although\nthe agency recognized that a PEL of 5 µg/m 3 still presented\nsignificant health risks to workers, the agency found the higher\nlevel to be feasible, and adopted it as a universal PEL. A\nsummary of OSHA’s relevant technological and economic\nfeasibility analyses follows.\n\n                 1. Technological Feasibility\n\n       To assess technological feasibility, OSHA expressly\napplied the standard articulated by the Court of Appeals for the\nD.C. Circuit in United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC\nv. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“Lead”). 71 Fed.\nReg. 10,335. The Lead decision provides:\n\n       [W]ithin the limits of the best available evidence,\n       and subject to the court’s search for substantial\n\n                               10\n\f       evidence, OSHA must prove a reasonable\n       possibility that the typical firm will be able to\n       develop and install engineering and work practice\n       controls that can meet the PEL in most of its\n       operations.\n\n647 F.2d at 1272. OSHA explained that, in harmony with the\nLead standard, it favored engineering and work practice controls\nto reduce the presence of toxins in the air over reliance on\nrespirators.1 OSHA explained its “long-held view” that\nextensive reliance on respirators to achieve a PEL should be\navoided due to independent health, safety, and reliability\nproblems that arise when workers are required to perform tasks\nwith respirators. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,335.\n\n\n\n\n 1\n  “‘Engineering controls’ employ mechanical means or process\nredesign to eliminate, contain, divert, dilute, or collect [toxin]\nemissions at their source.” Occupational Exposure to Lead,\n43 Fed. Reg. 52,952, 52,989 (Nov. 14, 1978). “‘Work practice\ncontrols’ . . . accomplish the same results as engineering\ncontrols, but rely upon employees to repeatedly perform certain\nactivities in a specified manner so that airborne lead\nconcentrations are eliminated or reduced,” and include\nadministrative controls, such as “moving the employee to a\nplace of lower exposure or reducing his work hours.” Id. at\n52,989.\n\n                               11\n\f       For technological feasibility purposes, OSHA chose to\ndefine employee exposure in terms of “application groups,” or\n“groups of firms where employees are exposed to Cr(VI) when\nperforming a particular function,” rather than in terms of\nproduct-based industries. Id. at 10,226. OSHA justified this\napproach as follows:\n\n       This methodology is appropriate to exposure to\n       Cr(VI) where a widely used chemical like\n       chromium may lead to exposures in many kinds of\n       firms in many industries but the processes used,\n       exposures generated, and controls needed to\n       achieve compliance may be the same. For\n       example, because a given type of welding\n       produces Cr(VI) exposures that are essentially the\n       same regardless of whether the welding occurs in\n       a ship, or a construction site, as part of a\n       manufacturing process, or as part of a repair\n       process, it is appropriate to analyze such\n       processes as a group.\n\nId. OSHA accordingly identified and analyzed dozens of\napplication groups in which employees were exposed to Cr(VI).\nId. at 10,228-44.\n\n      OSHA concluded that a PEL of 1 µg/m 3 was not\ntechnologically feasible based on several determinations. First,\nOSHA positively concluded that it was technologically\n\n                              12\n\finfeasible for the sectors of welding and aerospace painting to\nachieve a 1 µg/m 3 through engineering and work controls alone.\nOSHA, Final Economic and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for\nOSHA’s Final Standard for Occupational Exposure to\nHexavalent Chromium, III-331, Feb. 23, 2006 (“FEA”). For\nwelding, OSHA examined several types of welding processes\nemployed in general industry, shipyards, and construction. Id.\nat III-332. OSHA found that two of the “most common”\nwelding operations, shielded metal arc welding (“SMAW”) on\nstainless steel, and stainless steel welding in confined and\nenclosed spaces, could not conform to a 1 µg/m 3 PEL by altering\nwork processes or through engineering controls. Id. at III-333-\n36. Although OSHA recognized that the standard may be\nfeasible for less common welding operations, “the fact that\nwelding is not easily separated into high and low exposure\noperations render[ed] OSHA unable to conclude that the\nproposed PEL of 1 µg/m 3 is technologically feasible for any\nwelding operations.” Id. at III-336.\n\n        OSHA also determined that “approximately two thirds”\nof aerospace painting operations could not achieve the 1 µg/m 3\nPEL with engineering or work practice controls. Although\nsmaller parts could be painted in compliance with the PEL\nthrough use of enclosed and ventilated rooms, such treatment for\nlarger parts and assemblies was impractical. Thus, the proposed\nPEL was “not generally feasible for aerospace painting.” Id. at\nIII-336-37.\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f       While OSHA positively concluded that the proposed\n1 µg/m 3 PEL was technologically infeasible for welding and\naerospace painting operations, it also found that “the evidence\nin the record [wa]s insufficient” for it to conclude that the\n1 µg/m 3 would be technologically feasible for four other\nindustries with relatively few employees. Id. at III-338. For the\nthree operations of chromate pigment production, chromium\ncatalyst production, and chromium dye production, OSHA found\na “lack of clear evidence” that it would be technologically\nfeasible to install protective enclosures to avert widespread\nrespirator use in order to achieve the proposed PEL. Id. at\nIII-340. For hard chrome electroplating, OSHA found that the\ndiversity of such operations, and the lack of evidence as to\nwhether involved facilities could employ fume suppressants, left\nit “unable to conclude that the proposed PEL of 1 µg/m 3 would\nbe technologically feasible for all hard chrome electroplating\noperations.” Id. at III-341.\n\n                   2. Economic Feasibility\n\n       OSHA analyzed economic feasibility by questioning\nwhether a standard under consideration would eliminate or alter\nthe competitive structure of an industry. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,301.\nOSHA determined that the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL was\neconomically infeasible for electroplating job shops, which are\nbusinesses dedicated to providing electroplating services to\nothers. OSHA concluded that these shops could not be expected\nto absorb the costs to comply with a 1 µg/m 3 standard. The\n\n                               14\n\fAgency found that compliance costs would “represent 2.7\npercent of revenues and 65 percent of profits.” Id. Under prior\nstandards, OSHA had ensured that the most affected industries\nwere not confronted with costs over 2 percent of revenues. Id.\nAlso, OSHA found that the costs to electroplating job shops\nwould not be significantly lower even if the shops were\npermitted to achieve the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL through use of\nrespirators. Id. OSHA further found that the high costs of\ncompliance would be similar across various types of plating\nshops. Id. On this analysis, OSHA concluded that the proposed\n1 µg/m 3 PEL would “alter the competitive structure of the\nindustry.” Id. In comparison, OSHA determined that the\nindustry could feasibly absorb the estimated compliance costs of\n1.24 percent of revenues associated with a PEL of 5 µg/m 3 . Id.\n\n                    3. Overall Feasibility\n\n        In considering the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL, OSHA\ndetermined that the technological and economic infeasibility\ndeterminations discussed above affected “almost 56% of the\ntotal number of employees occupationally exposed to Cr(VI).”\nId. at 10,246-54. OSHA calculated this figure using the\nfollowing estimates of affected employees:\n\n       •      270,000 in welding\n\n       •      33,400 in electroplating job shops\n\n\n\n                              15\n\f       •       8,300 in aerospace painting\n\n       •       469 in chromium pigment, catalyst, and\n               dye production\n\nId. at 10,337. This totals 312,169 employees, or 55.9% of the\nestimated 558,431 employees exposed to Cr(VI). OSHA did not\ninclude employees in hard chrome electroplating in order to\navoid double counting workers included in the job shop\nelectroplating figure. Id. OSHA stated that it “did not receive\ndata or recommendations regarding setting the PEL at any levels\nbetween 1 µg/m 3 and 5 µg/m 3 ,” 2 but found that a PEL of\n5 µg/m 3 was technologically and economically feasible for “all\nindustries.” Id.\n\n           C. Application of a Uniform 5 µg/m 3 PEL\n\n        OSHA selected a universal PEL of 5 µg/m 3 that applies\nto all industries. Id. at 10,338. OSHA stated that it “has not\ninterpreted [29 U.S.C. § 6(b)(5)] to require setting multiple\nPELs based on the lowest level particular industries or\noperations could achieve,” and that, in the face of statutory\nsilence, “OSHA has the authority to adopt the reasonable\n\n\n 2\n  Likewise, neither petitioner points to any evidence, nor raises\nany argument, suggesting that OSHA should have considered\nother exposure limits. Thus, only OSHA’s analyses of the\n1 µg/m 3 and 5 µg/m 3 PELs are subject to our review.\n\n                               16\n\finterpretation that it judges will best carry out the purposes of\nthe Act.” Id.\n\n       Although OSHA recognized that “lower PELs might be\nachievable in some industries and operations,” which would\nreduce risks to workers, it determined that “these benefits would\nbe offset by the significant disadvantages of attempting to\nestablish and apply multiple PELs for the diverse group of\nindustries and operations covered by the standard.” Id. OSHA\nsupported this conclusion by stating that multiple PELs would\nplace an “enormous evidentiary burden on OSHA to ascertain\nand establish the specific situations, if any, in which a lower\nPEL could be reached,” causing delays in the implementation of\nhealth standards. Id.\n\n        Also, OSHA asserted, “the demanding burden of setting\nmultiple PELs would be complicated by the difficulties inherent\nin precisely defining and clearly distinguishing between affected\nindustries and operations.” Id. The “definitional and line\ndrawing problem is far less significant when OSHA uses a unit\nof industries and operations for analytical but not compliance\npurposes,” because the “consequences of imprecise\nclassifications” for compliance purposes “would become much\nmore significant.” Id. OSHA determined that the existing\nNorth American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) for\ncategorizing businesses would not be appropriate for delineating\nmultiple PELs because NAICS categorizes businesses by\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fprimary activity, and sub-operations involving Cr(VI) would not\nnecessarily be captured. Id.\n\n        OSHA also concluded that “disaggregation by operation\nhas major practical disadvantages,” in part because “many firms\nhave exposures in two or more different categories.” Id.\nMultiple PELs could therefore require single firms to achieve\nmultiple standards in the same workplace, and possibly with the\nsame employees. Employers would also have to monitor for\nmultiple exposure levels in the same workplace, where the\nexposure of a particular employee might not be traceable to a\nsingle task. Id. OSHA determined that a single standard would\nmake it easier for employers to understand and comply, and\nwould simplify government enforcement. Id. at 10,338-39.\n\n                  D. Resulting Regulations\n\n        The final rule applies the 5 µg/m 3 PEL through separate\nregulatory treatment for general industry, construction, and\nshipyards. Id. at 10,100. Only the distinctions pertaining to\ngeneral industry, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1026, and construction,\n§ 1926.1126, are relevant to the instant petitions. The PEL\npertains to “occupational exposures to [Cr(VI)] in all forms and\ncompounds, except” for exposures governed by other\ngovernment agencies, exposures to portland cement, or where\nemployers are exempted by demonstrating that “a specific\nprocess, operation, or activity involving [Cr(VI)] cannot release\ndusts, fumes, or mists of [Cr(VI)] in concentrations above 0.5\n\n                               18\n\fµg/m 3 . . . under any expected conditions of use.” 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 1910.1026(a)(4), 1926.1126(a)(4).\n\n       Employers are required to use “engineering and work\npractice controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to\n[Cr(VI)] to or below the PEL unless the employer can\ndemonstrate that such controls are not feasible.”               Id.\n§§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(i), 1926.1126(e)(1)(i). Where further\nreductions are not feasible, employers must supplement the\nengineering and work practice controls with respiratory\nprotection. Id. Also, if an “employer can demonstrate that a\nprocess or task does not result in any employee exposure to\n[Cr(VI)] above the PEL for 30 or more days per year,” the\nemployer may use respiratory protection in lieu of engineering\nand work practice controls to achieve the PEL.                  Id.\n§§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii), (g)(1)(iv), 1926.1126(e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(iv).\n\n       Employers are required to educate all affected employees\nabout the contents of the controlling regulation, and about the\napplicable medical surveillance program. Id. §§ 1910.1026(l),\n1926.1126(j). The regulations also establish an employee\nexposure “action level” of 2.5 µg/m 3 , or one half of the PEL, at\nwhich employers are subject to heightened monitoring burdens.\nId. §§ 1910.1026(b), (d)(2)(iii), 1926.1126(b), (d)(2)(iii).\n\n       Employers are also required to notify an employee when\nrequired monitoring procedures indicate that the employee was\nexposed to Cr(VI) levels in excess of the PEL.             Id.\n\n                                19\n\f§§ 1910.1026(d)(4), 1926.1126(d)(4). This provision marks a\nchange from the proposed rule, which would have required\nemployers to notify employees of all monitoring results,\nregardless of the level of exposure detected. 69 Fed.\nReg. 59,450-51.\n\n       The predominant difference between the general industry\nand construction regulations is that the general industry\nregulation has additional requirements for employers. First,\nemployers subject to the general industry rules must establish\ndefined and access-controlled “regulated areas” wherever “an\nemployee’s exposure to airborne concentrations of [Cr(VI)] is,\nor reasonably can be expected to be, in excess of the PEL.” Id.\n§ 1910.1026(e). Such employers must also comply with detailed\n“housekeeping” requirements for the removal and disposal of\nCr(VI). § 1910.1026(j).\n\n        The general industry regulation also provides a special\ncompliance requirement applicable only to the “painting of\naircraft or large aircraft parts in the aerospace industry.” Id.\n§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii). For such activities, employers need only\nachieve Cr(VI) concentrations of 25 µg/m 3 through engineering\nand work practice controls, if feasible. Id. Respiratory\nprotection may be used to achieve the PEL beyond that point.\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\f                        II. Jurisdiction\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the instant petitions pursuant\nto 29 U.S.C. § 655(f), which allows “[a]ny person who may be\nadversely affected by” an OSHA standard to “file a petition\nchallenging the validity of such standard with the United States\ncourt of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or\nhas a principal place of business.” Id. HRG’s petition was\ntimely filed in this Court on behalf of member workers subject\nto Cr(VI) exposure. EEI’s member businesses include coal and\nnuclear electric power generating facilities that are subject to the\nCr(VI) standard, and its petition was transferred from the D.C.\nCircuit pursuant to a consolidation order by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a)(3).\n\n              III. Review of OSHA Rulemaking\n\n        Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970\n(“OSH Act”), as codified in 29 U.S.C. § 655, the Secretary of\nLabor is charged with promulgating occupational safety and\nhealth standards. The Secretary’s rulemaking authority has been\ndelegated to the head of OSHA, the Assistant Secretary for\nOccupational Safety and Health. 72 Fed. Reg. 31,160 (June 5,\n2007); 67 Fed. Reg. 65,007 (Oct. 22, 2002). Section 655(b)(5)\naddresses rulemaking for toxic materials, and provides:\n\n       The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing\n       with toxic materials or harmful physical agents\n\n                                21\n\f       under this subsection, shall set the standard which\n       most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on\n       the basis of the best available evidence, that no\n       employee will suffer material impairment of\n       health or functional capacity even if such\n       employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt\n       with by such standard for the period of his\n       working life.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 655(b)(5). When OSHA promulgates a new\nstandard, it must “include a statement of the reasons for such\naction, which shall be published in the Federal Register.” Id.\n§ 655(e).\n\n       Our review of an OSHA standard is limited and\ndeferential. In executing its statutory mandate, the Agency must\nboth find facts and make decisions that are ultimately legislative\npolicy judgments. Am. Iron and Steel Inst. v. OSHA, 577 F.2d\n825, 833-34 (3d Cir. 1978) (“AISI”). Our role in reviewing\nfactual findings is expressly limited by the OSH Act, which\nprovides that the“determinations of the Secretary shall be\nconclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record\nconsidered as a whole.” 29 U.S.C. § 655(f). Evidence is\n“substantial” when “an inference of the fact may be drawn\nreasonably.” AISI, 577 F.2d at 831 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                               22\n\f       Our review of OSHA’s legislative policy judgment is\nsimilarly restrained. We have recognized\n\n       that because judicial review of legislative-like\n       decisions inevitably runs the risk of becoming\n       arbitrary supervision and revision of the\n       Secretary’s efforts to effectuate the legislative\n       purposes in an area where various responses\n       might each be legitimate in the sight of Congress,\n       [a court should] remand only those provisions of\n       [a] standard which le[ave] “nagging questions . .\n       . as to the reason and rationale for the Secretary’s\n       particular choices.”\n\nAISI, 577 F.2d at 834 (quoting Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v.\nHodgson, 499 F.2d 467, 488 (D.C. Cir. 1974); internal brackets\nremoved). In applying these considerations to our review of a\nPEL for coke oven emissions, we concluded that the Secretary’s\n\n       ultimate determination of the appropriate\n       exposure level is a legislative decision in the\n       exercise of congressionally delegated powers.\n       Even though we might have drawn different\n       inferences from the information before the\n       Secretary, his conclusion was reasonably drawn\n       from the record and, therefore, it must be upheld.\n\nId. at 833. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Cr(VI) PEL, or\n\n                               23\n\fother policy determination in the instant standard, as long as we\nconclude that OSHA’s decision was reasonably drawn from the\nrecord.\n\n      We have identified five separate inquiries to organize our\nreview of standards under section 655(f):\n\n       (1) determine whether the Secretary’s notice of\n       proposed rulemaking adequately informs\n       interested persons of the action taken;\n\n       (2) determine whether the Secretary’s\n       promulgation adequately sets forth reasons for his\n       action;\n\n       (3) determine whether the statement of reasons\n       reflects consideration of factors relevant under the\n       statute;\n\n       (4) determine whether presently available\n       alternatives were at least considered; and\n\n       (5) determine whether substantial evidence in the\n       record as a whole supports the Secretary’s\n       determination, if it is based in whole or in part on\n       factual m atters subject to evidentiary\n       development.\n\n\n\n                               24\n\fAISI, 577 F.2d at 830. We have not labored through each\ninquiry in every case, but have limited our consideration to the\nparticular issues raised by petitioners. See, e.g, id. at 830-41.\n\n        In promulgating a standard for toxic materials under\nsection 655(b)(5), OSHA first bears the burden to demonstrate\nthat there is a “significant risk” of material harm to workers in\na workplace. AFL-CIO v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607,\n655 (1980) (“Benzene”) (plurality opinion). The Agency need\nnot calculate risk with mathematical precision, nor does the\nsubstantial evidence standard require it to support a risk finding\n“with anything approaching scientific certainty.” Id. at 655-56.\nFurthermore, the “best available evidence” requirement affords\nlatitude, and “so long as they are supported by a body of\nreputable scientific thought, the Agency is free to use\nconservative assumptions in interpreting the data with respect\nto carcinogens, risking error on the side of overprotection rather\nthan underprotection.” Id. at 656.\n\n         Once OSHA demonstrates the existence of a significant\nrisk, it must then satisfy the feasibility requirement of section\n655(b)(5). This requires OSHA to demonstrate that the standard\nis both technologically and economically feasible. AISI, 577\nF.2d at 832. While the OSH Act does not define feasibility,\nthese inquiries are guided by prior decisions. As OSHA did in\nexplaining the instant standard, numerous courts have relied on\nthe careful and comprehensive review of OSHA’s lead standard\n\n\n\n                               25\n\fin United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Marshall,\n647 F.2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“Lead”).\n\n       The technological feasibility test articulated in Lead is\nparticularly helpful because OSHA’s lead and Cr(VI) standards\nfollow a similar pattern with regard to the methods employers\nmay use to control exposure to airborne toxins. As with the\nCr(VI) standard, OSHA established a hierarchy of controls for\nlead exposure, preferring engineering controls first, then work\npractice controls, and finally personal protective equipment\n(primarily respirators). 43 Fed. Reg. 52,990. OSHA stated that\n“[r]espiratory protection is relegated to the bottom of the\ncompliance priority list because it is an ineffective, unreliable,\nand unsafe method of reducing employee exposure.” Id.\nAlthough respirators are generally a more economical\nalternative for employers, OSHA found that they do not\neliminate the source of exposure, and also introduce independent\noccupational hazards, such as restrictions to vision, hearing, and\nmobility. Id. OSHA accordingly found respirators to be useful\nonly on supplementary, interim, or short term bases. Id.\n\n      In an effort “to supply the systemic analysis” of\ntechnological feasibility that had previously been lacking, the\nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit incorporated OSHA’s\ncompliance hierarchy into the following test:\n\n       [W]ithin the limits of the best available evidence,\n       and subject to the court’s search for substantial\n\n                               26\n\f       evidence, OSHA must prove a reasonable\n       possibility that the typical firm will be able to\n       develop and install engineering and work practice\n       controls that can meet the PEL in most of its\n       operations . . . . The effect of such proof is to\n       establish a presumption that industry can meet the\n       PEL without relying on respirators . . . .\n       Insufficient proof of technological feasibility for\n       a few isolated operations within an industry, or\n       even OSHA’s concession that respirators will be\n       necessary in a few such operations, will not\n       undermine this general presumption in favor of\n       feasibility.\n\nLead, 647 F.2d at 1272. The court stated that OSHA could\nsatisfy its burden by pointing to available technologies, and to\nemergent technologies that were “reasonably capable of\nexperimental refinement and distribution within the standard’s\ndeadlines.” Id. In light of the D.C. Circuit’s careful and\ncomprehensive opinion, and the close parallels between\nOSHA’s lead and Cr(VI) standards, we deem it appropriate to\nconduct our technological feasibility analysis in accordance with\nthe Lead methodology.\n\n       The court in Lead also distilled a comprehensive review\nof economic feasibility considerations into a concise standard:\n\n\n\n\n                               27\n\f       [A]s for economic feasibility, OSHA must\n       construct a reasonable estimate of compliance\n       costs and demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that\n       these costs will not threaten the existence or\n       competitive structure of an industry, even if it\n       does portend disaster for some marginal firms.\n\nId. at 1272. We join our sister courts of appeals in applying this\nmethodology. See, e.g., Color Pigments Mfrs. Ass’n, Inc. v.\nOSHA, 16 F.3d 1157, 1163 (11th Cir. 1994); Nat’l Grain &\nFeed Ass’n, Inc. v. OSHA, 903 F.2d 308, 311 (5th Cir. 1990);\nForging Indus. Ass’n v. Sec’y of Labor, 773 F.2d 1436, 1453\n(4th Cir. 1985). We note that the Supreme Court has\nconclusively ruled that economic feasibility does not involve a\ncost-benefit analysis. Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan,\n452 U.S. 490, 513 (1981).\n\n                   IV. HRG’s Arguments\n\n       HRG contends that, contrary to the OSH Act, past\npractice, and prior judicial decisions, OSHA promulgated a\nCr(VI) standard that is insufficiently protective of workers.\nHRG does not challenge OSHA’s risk determinations, but\nargues: (1) OSHA’s determination that a 1 µg/m 3 is infeasible\nwas factually and legally inadequate; (2) OSHA’s decision to\nimplement a uniform 5 µg/m 3 PEL for all industries is not\nsupported by substantial evidence, and departs from judicial and\nAgency precedent; and (3) OSHA’s decisions to set the\n\n                               28\n\fmonitoring “action level” at one half of the PEL, and to only\nrequire employee notification of detected exposures exceeding\nthe PEL, were arbitrary and unexplained. For the reasons stated\nbelow, we will deny HRG’s petition except with regard to\nOSHA’s decision to set the employee notification requirement\nat the PEL.\n\n              A. Infeasibility of 1 µg/m 3 PEL\n\n       As discussed above, OSHA concluded that the proposed\nPEL of 1 µg/m 3 was infeasible because the Agency could not\nprove feasibility in workplaces employing nearly 56% of the\nworkers exposed to Cr(VI), or 312,169 out of 558,431 workers.\nTo conduct its analysis, OSHA categorized workers by\napplication groups, defined by common tasks, rather than\nindustries defined by end products. OSHA affirmatively\nconcluded that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL was technologically infeasible in\nwelding and aerospace painting, accounting for 270,000 and\n8,300 workers respectively. Furthermore, OSHA concluded that\nit could not meet its burden to prove that the standard was\ntechnologically feasible for the 469 workers in chromium\npigment, catalyst, and dye production.        Finally, OSHA\ndetermined that it would be economically infeasible for\nelectroplating job shops, employing 33,400 workers, to comply\nwith a 1 µg/m 3 PEL. HRG challenges OSHA’s determinations\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\ffor each of these workplace categories.3\n\n                         1. Welding\n\n       With regard to welding, HRG argues that the finding of\ninfeasibility was flawed on two grounds. First, HRG challenges\nOSHA’s use of application groups, instead of industries, to\ndelineate groups of workers. HRG argues that OSHA must\ndemonstrate that a typical firm will be able to comply with a\nPEL in most of its operations most of the time, and, since\nwelding describes a single operation within a firm, rather than\na type of firm defined by an industry, OSHA did not conduct an\nappropriate analysis.\n\n        We disagree. As an initial matter, nothing in 29 U.S.C.\n§ 655(b)(5) requires OSHA to analyze employee groups by\nindustry, nor does the term “industry” even appear. In the face\nof this statutory silence, HRG presents no argument as to why\nthe Agency’s choice of methodology to implement the statute\n\n\n 3\n   HRG also challenges OSHA’s conclusion that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL\nwas infeasible in hard chrome electroplating operations. In\norder to avoid the potential double counting of workers in\nelectroplating job shops, OSHA did not count hard chrome\nelectroplating workers in its overall feasibility assessment.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,337. Thus, OSHA’s feasibility findings with\nregard to these operations are immaterial to the overall\nfeasibility determination.\n\n                              30\n\fshould not be afforded deference under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44\n(1984). We also note that OSHA has employed the application\ngroup methodology in prior standards. See Occupational\nExposure to Methylene Chloride, 62 Fed. Reg. 1,494, 1,564\n(Jan. 10, 1997). OSHA explained that the application group\n“methodology is appropriate to exposure to Cr(VI) where a\nwidely used chemical like chromium may lead to exposures in\nmany kinds of firms in many industries but the processes used,\nexposures generated, and controls needed to achieve compliance\nmay be the same.” 71 Fed. Reg. 10,226. The Agency\nspecifically stated that “a given type of welding produces Cr(VI)\nexposures that are essentially the same . . . [and] it is appropriate\nto analyze such processes as a group.” Id. In light of OSHA’s\nstated reasons for utilizing the application group methodology,\nwe will not substitute another.\n\n        Also, we find that the application group methodology is\nconsistent with Lead. OSHA determined that technology did not\nexist that would permit certain welding operations to achieve\nexposure levels of 1 µg/m 3 without reliance on respirators. An\nemployer would thus be unable to achieve the PEL in those\noperations, regardless of whether the operations constituted all\nor a portion of the employer’s business. HRG would apparently\nhave us require OSHA to research all operations of all\nemployers with Cr(VI) exposure, including operations that do\nnot involve Cr(VI), to determine whether a typical firm could\nmeet the PEL in most of its operations. Such an interpretation\n\n                                 31\n\fwould severely hinder OSHA’s ability to regulate exposure to\ncommon toxins, a result that would appear to run afoul of\nHRG’s own interests. Furthermore, in a review of the lead\nstandard that followed its Lead decision, the D.C. Circuit upheld\na technological feasibility determination by OSHA that\nconsidered only the specific operations in leaded steel\nproduction that caused exposure to airborne lead. Am. Iron &\nSteel Inst. v. OSHA, 939 F.2d 975, 983-86 (D.C. Cir. 1991). We\naccordingly conclude that it was appropriate for OSHA to\nconsider only those operations involving Cr(VI) exposure in\nassessing the technological feasibility of the proposed 1 µg/m 3\nPEL.\n\n        HRG also argues that the technological infeasibility\ndetermination with regard to welding was not supported by\nsubstantial evidence because the record demonstrates that most\nwelding operations could comply with the 1 µg/m 3 most of the\ntime without respirators. OSHA’s feasibility concerns regarding\nwelding focused on the common practices of stainless steel\nshielded metal arc welding (“SMAW”), and stainless steel\nwelding in confined spaces. HRG points to evidence in the\nrecord that “only” 22.3% of all stainless steel welders, and 29%\nof SMAW welders, would require respirators to meet a 1 µg/m 3\nPEL. See FEA at ES-34; 71 Fed. Reg. 10,335. HRG contends\nthat the record therefore demonstrates that the 1 µg/m 3 PEL is\nfeasible for all welding operations.\n\n       HRG’s argument is flawed for at least two reasons. First,\n\n                               32\n\fHRG asserts a novel rule for technological feasibility that has\nnever been applied by OSHA, nor recognized in any court.\nHRG twists the Lead methodology, and would have us require\nOSHA to find a PEL to be technologically feasible so long as a\nmajority of a typical employer’s workers performing an\noperation would not have to wear respirators. If this were the\nrule, no employer would be required to further remove toxins\nfrom the air, or further limit employee presence in contaminated\nair, so long as exposure could be kept at or below a PEL with\n49% of the employees wearing respirators.\n\n       Neither the Lead decision nor logic support HRG’s\nposition. In crafting its feasibility rule in Lead, the D.C. Circuit\naccepted OSHA’s hierarchy of compliance controls and simply\nincorporated them into a manageable standard of proof. This\nhierarchy, the same one at issue here, strongly disfavors\nrespirators as “an ineffective, unreliable, and unsafe method of\nreducing employee exposure,” and generally restricts their use\nto supplementary, interim or short term purposes. 43 Fed.\nReg. 52,990; see Lead, 647 F.2d at 1205 n.12 (“This key\nprovision of the lead standard is based on OSHA’s view that\nrespirators are an inferior and inadequate means of protecting\nworkers.”). Nothing in Lead, nor in any case reviewing an\nairborne toxin standard, can be read to support a technological\nfeasibility rule that would effectively encourage the routine and\n\n\n\n\n                                33\n\fwidespread use of respirators to comply with a PEL.4 In fact,\nHRG’s support for such a rule is surprising since the purpose of\nOSHA’s hierarchy is to drive employers to use more effective\nmeans than respirators to protect workers from toxins.\n\n       Second, OSHA amply explained why compliance\nproblems in stainless steel SMAW and enclosed space welding\noperations rendered a 1 µg/m 3 PEL technologically infeasible\nfor welding generally. OSHA stated:\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    In reply, HRG points to Building and Construction Trades\nDepartment v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258 (D.C. Cir. 1988), and\nASARCO, Inc. v. OSHA, 746 F.2d 483 (9th Cir. 1984), to\nsupport its assertion that OSHA is bound to conclude a PEL is\nfeasible as long as firms can meet the PEL without respirators\nin most operations, most of the time. This reliance is misplaced.\nIn Building and Construction, the D.C. Circuit upheld an\nasbestos PEL in which more than 90% of the affected workforce\nwould not be regularly required to wear respirators. 838 F.2d at\n1268. In ASARCO, the Ninth Circuit upheld an arsenic standard\nin which 11 of 16 smelters at issue could achieve the PEL with\n“with engineering and work practices and only very limited use\nof respirators,” and the remaining four could comply with\n“limited to moderate” respirator use. 746 F.2d at 496-97\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In neither case did OSHA\ndepart from its strong disfavor of respirators, nor did either court\nconstrain OSHA’s discretion with regard to technological\nfeasibility.\n\n                                34\n\f       Welders are not generally assigned to a particular\n       welding process. Instead, welders frequently\n       perform different types of welding on different\n       types of metals in different environments —\n       sometimes even during the same shift. [citing\n       comments from industry] For example, a welder\n       may spend part of his shift performing a task for\n       which exposures cannot be reduced below the\n       PEL, e.g., SMAW on stainless steel in a confined\n       space, and other parts of his shift performing\n       welding tasks for which exposures may be below\n       1 µg/m 3 .\n\nFEA at III-336. Furthermore, “workers performing different\nwelding tasks often work next to one another,” rendering it\n“impractical to separate employees on an operation by operation\nbasis.” Id. Accordingly,\n\n       Although a PEL of 1 µg/m 3 may be\n       technologically feasible for some less common\n       welding processes, the fact that welding is not\n       easily separated into high and low exposure\n       operations renders OSHA unable to conclude that\n       the proposed PEL of 1 µg/m 3 is technologically\n       feasible for any welding operations.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                              35\n\f       Thus, OSHA’s conclusion that a PEL of 1 µg/m 3 was\ntechnologically infeasible for welding operations is supported by\nsubstantial evidence, was adequately explained, and also\ncomports with both past practice and prior decisions.\n\n                    2. Aerospace Painting\n\n       HRG argues that OSHA’s conclusion that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL\nwould be infeasible for aerospace painting was flawed for two\nreasons. First, HRG again challenges the use of application\ngroups, asserting that the technological feasibility analysis was\nimproper because aerospace painting is an operation rather than\nan industry. This argument fails for the same reasons discussed\nabove.\n\n        HRG’s second argument is particularly confusing and\nequally unavailing. OSHA found that the painting of whole\naircraft or large aerospace structures, activities comprising\napproximately two thirds of aerospace painting, could not be\nconducted in compliance with either a 1 µg/m 3 PEL or a 5 µg/m 3\nPEL without reliance on respirators. FEA at III-337. OSHA\naccordingly built an exception into the final rule, whereby\nemployers engaged in these activities need only achieve airborne\nCr(VI) concentrations of 25 µg/m 3 through engineering and\nwork practice controls, and could rely on respirators to further\nreduce exposure to the 5 µg/m 3 PEL.                 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n                               36\n\f       HRG does not dispute OSHA’s conclusion that a majority\nof aerospace painting operations cannot achieve either a 1µg/m 3\nPELor a 5µg/m 3 PEL through engineering and work practice\ncontrols. Neither does HRG challenge OSHA’s explanation for\nthe aerospace painting exception. Instead, HRG argues that,\nbecause OSHA found it acceptable for one third of the workers\nin aerospace painting to wear respirators in order to comply with\na 5µg/m 3 PEL, the Agency was required to explain why more\nwidespread respirator use would not have been acceptable to\nsupport a 1µg/m 3 PEL.\n\n        This argument is illogical. OSHA carved out an\naerospace painting exception from its general rule disfavoring\nrespirators, a rule adopted for the benefit of workers, in order to\ninstitute a lower uniform PEL of 5µg/m 3 . In exercising its\ndiscretion to make this exception, OSHA had no obligation to\nexplain why it did not accept a greater deviation from the rule.\nSince HRG offers nothing to challenge the adequacy of OSHA’s\ndecision as explained in the record and written into the final\nrule, HRG’s argument pertaining to aerospace painting must\nfail.\n\n         3. Pigment, Catalyst, and Dye Production\n\n      HRG also challenges OSHA’s conclusion that the\nAgency could not prove the technological feasibility of a\n1 µg/m 3 PEL in the chromium pigment, catalyst, and dye\nproduction industries, industries that together accounted for only\n\n                                37\n\f469 workers in the feasibility analysis. OSHA identified\nenclosures which, when combined with ventilation systems,\ncould generally achieve Cr(VI) exposures of 1µg/m 3 or less.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,337. However, OSHA pointed to industry\nevidence that the ventilation systems could cause “significant\nand intolerable” product loss by extracting the fine powders that\ncontained Cr(VI). Id. OSHA also pointed to evidence that some\nplants, especially older facilities, would not be able to physically\naccommodate enclosures. Id. OSHA estimated that 44% or\nmore of the workers in these industries would require respirators\nto achieve 1µg/m 3 concentrations, and accordingly concluded\nthat it could not meet its burden to prove the technological\nfeasibility of a PEL set at that level. Id.\n\n        HRG argues that OSHA’s analysis of these three\nindustries was flawed because, in considering whether existing\nplants could physically accommodate available technology, the\nAgency improperly incorporated an economic consideration into\nthe technological analysis. Even if we were to conclude that\ntechnological feasibility requires OSHA to accept that\nemployers may be forced to alter or abandon their physical\nplants, OSHA also found that ventilation systems could cause\nintolerable product loss. This concern squarely involved the\nsuitability of available technology.     Moreover, the 469\nemployees at issue were a minute portion of the 312,169\nemployees in operations where a 1µg/m 3 PEL was not deemed\nfeasible, and their exclusion from consideration would have\nbeen immaterial. We therefore will not disturb OSHA’s\n\n                                38\n\ftechnological feasibility analysis as it pertains to the chromium\npigment, catalyst, and dye production industries.\n\n                4. Electroplating Job Shops\n\n       HRG argues that OSHA’s determination that a 1µg/m 3\nPEL was economically infeasible for the electroplating job shop\nindustry was neither supported by substantial evidence nor\nadequately explained. Electroplating job shops are facilities that\nperform electroplating services for other persons or businesses.\nAs discussed above, OSHA reached its infeasibility\ndetermination upon finding and explaining that costs of\ncompliance would amount to 2.7 percent of revenues and\n65 percent of profits, and that costs of compliance would be\nsimilar across various types of plating shops. On this analysis,\nOSHA concluded that the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL would “alter\nthe competitive structure of the industry.” 71 Fed. Reg. 10,301.\n\n       HRG bases its argument on part of a single statement by\nOSHA that the costs of compliance “might not be passed\nforward, particularly by older and less profitable segments of the\nindustry.” Id. at 10,301-02. HRG asserts that this statement\nderives from improper speculation that some marginal firms\nmight suffer, and economic feasibility allows that certain\nmarginal firms might fail.\n\n       HRG paints an incomplete picture of OSHA’s economic\nanalysis. OSHA determined that the estimated costs to job shop\n\n                               39\n\felectroplaters of 2.7% of revenues was more than the Agency\nhad deemed economically feasible under previous health\nstandards, and was well in excess of the sector’s average annual\nnominal price increase of 1.6%. FEA at V-94. OSHA also\ndetermined that it would be unable to mitigate costs through\nlonger phase-in times or a greater reliance on respirators,\ntechniques that had been used in the past to address economic\ndifficulties where costs might otherwise have been in excess of\n2% of revenues. Id. OSHA further found that the costs for\ncompliance would be approximately equal across different types\nof job shops. Factoring in these costs, OSHA stated that “a\nprice increase that would assure continued profitability for the\nentire industry would require almost tripling the annual nominal\nprice increase.” Id. (emphasis added). It is clear from the\nrecord that OSHA considered and explained how costs would\naffect the job shop electroplating industry as a whole, and was\nwithin its discretion to conclude that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL would alter\nthe competitive structure of the industry.\n\n                       B. Uniform PEL\n\n       HRG argues that the uniform PEL of 5 µg/m 3 must be set\naside on two grounds. First, HRG claims that evidence in the\nrecord demonstrates that the feasibility problems of a 1µg/m 3\nPEL noted by OSHA, even if correct, only affect a minority of\nall exposed workers, and the lower PEL should therefore have\nbeen selected. According to HRG, at most only 107,380 of the\n558,431 exposed employees worked in operations where the\n\n                               40\n\flower PEL is infeasible, counting 67,000 workers performing\nstainless steel SMAW welding, 3,921 in aerospace painting,\n2,590 in hard chrome electroplating, 33,400 in electroplating job\nshops, and 469 workers in pigment, catalyst, and dye production.\nTo the contrary, OSHA concluded that 312,169 employees\nworked in operations where the lower PEL was not deemed\nfeasible: 270,000 in welding, 33,400 in electroplating job\nshops, 8,300 in aerospace painting, and 469 in pigment, catalyst,\nand dye production.\n\n       Welding accounts for a dispositive difference of 203,000\nworkers between the opposing figures. HRG contends that only\nstainless steel SMAW welders should be included in the\nnumber. As discussed above, OSHA explained and sufficiently\nsupported its conclusion that a 1µg/m 3 PEL is infeasible for all\nwelding operations because welding is not readily segregated\ninto high and low exposure operations. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,336;\nFEA at III-337. HRG offers no explanation to justify its lower\nfigure for aerospace painters, and does not explain why it did\nnot include workers engaged in enclosed space welding.\n\n       Second, HRG contends that the selection of a uniform\nPEL for all industries, where many industries can accommodate\na lower PEL, is contrary to law and past practice. HRG points\nto OSHA’s final lead standard, which HRG claims implemented\ndifferent PELs to accommodate different technological\nfeasibility findings in certain industries. HRG claims that the\nlead standard incorporates a 50 µg/m 3 PEL for large foundries,\n\n                               41\n\fand a 75 µg/m 3 PEL for smaller foundries and the brass and\nbronze ingot industry. HRG argues that OSHA should have\naccordingly adopted separate PELs to achieve the lowest\nexposures feasible for each industry or operation.\n\n        HRG mischaracterizes the lead standard and OSHA’s\npast practice. It is true that, based on feasibility concerns,\nOSHA made special allowances in amendments to the lead\nstandard for small foundries and the brass and bronze ingot\nindustries. 55 Fed. Reg. 3,146 (Jan. 30, 1990); 60 Fed.\nReg. 52,856 (Oct. 11, 1995). However, these allowances only\npertain to the time for compliance, and to the exposure level the\nindustries were required to meet through engineering and work\nprocess controls alone. 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1025(e). The standard\nexpressly provides that “[w]here engineering and work practice\ncontrols do not reduce employee exposure at or below the\n50 µg/m 3 [PEL], the employer shall supplement these controls\nwith respirators . . . .” Id. § 1910.1025(e)(2). Thus, all\nemployers are subject to a single, universal PEL of 50 µg/m 3 .\nId. § 1910.1025(c). We fail to see how the respirator exceptions\nOSHA made in the lead standard are any different functionally\nfrom the exceptions the Agency made for aerospace painting in\nthe instant Cr(VI) standard. See 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii).\n\n       In fact, uniform PELs for the control of occupational\nexposure to airborne toxins have been the rule in OSHA\nstandards.    E.g. 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1001(c) (asbestos);\n1910.1017(c) (vinyl chloride); 1910.1018(c) (inorganic arsenic);\n\n                               42\n\f1910.1028 (benzene); 1910.1048(c) (formaldehyde);\n1910.1051(c) (1,3-butadiene); 1910.1052(c) (methylene\nchloride). As it had similarly done in other standards, the\nAgency recently explained that it set the PEL for methylene\nchloride at the “lowest level for which OSHA c[ould] currently\ndocument feasibility across the affected application groups and\nindustries.” 62 Fed. Reg. 1,575 (Nov. 22, 2006). HRG provides\nno argument explaining why the Agency’s longstanding\ninterpretation of its responsibilities under section 655(b)(5)\nshould not be afforded Chevron deference. Nor does HRG point\nto a single case in which a court invalidated a uniform PEL on\ngrounds that certain industries could comply with a more\nrestrictive standard.5\n\n\n    5\n     HRG argues that two cases, Building and Construction\nTrades Deptartment, AFL CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258 (D.C.\nCir. 1988), and Industrial Union Deptartment, AFL CIO v.\nHodgson, 499 F.2d 467 (D.C. Cir. 1974), impose a burden on\nOSHA to explain why it is adopting a uniform PEL when\nsignificant risk could be feasibly be eliminated in certain\nindustries. Hodgson merely states that OSHA is “authorized” to\nstructure standards according to “the compliance capabilities of\nvarious industries.” 499 F.2d at 480 n.31. Brock stands only for\nthe proposition that an enforcement efficiency justification in\nsupport of uniform regulatory treatment “seems to completely\ndisappear” when the subcategory at issue consisted of\n“93 percent of affected workers.” 838 F.2d at 1273. Moreover,\neven if OSHA had some special burden of explanation, HRG\nfails to demonstrate why the Agency’s asserted reasons for\n\n                              43\n\f        OSHA’s decision to select a uniform exposure limit is a\nlegislative policy decision that we will uphold as long as it was\nreasonably drawn from the record. See AISI, 577 F.2d at 833.\nOSHA acknowledges that a lower PEL was feasible for certain\nindustries representing a minority of exposed workers.\nHowever, the Agency provided ample reasons for selecting a\nuniform standard. OSHA explained that multiple PELs would\ncreate an “enormous evidentiary burden,” and associated\nimplementation delays, in order for the Agency to define the\nprecise situations under which employers would be required to\nmeet a lower PEL.6 71 Fed. Reg. 10,338. OSHA further\nexplained that multiple PELs would create compliance and\nenforcement problems because many workplaces, and even\nindividual workers, are subject to multiple categories of Cr(VI)\nexposure. This would make it “virtually impossible to\ndistinguish exposures from one source versus the other.” Id.\n\n\nadopting a uniform PEL were factually unsupported or legally\ninadequate.\n    6\n      HRG argues that OSHA’s existing feasibility analysis\nalready contains the information necessary to identify which\nactivities should be subject to a lower PEL. However, OSHA\nexplained that the “definitional and line drawing problem is far\nless significant when OSHA uses a unit of industries and\noperations for analytical but not compliance purposes,” because\nthe “consequences of imprecise classifications” for compliance\npurposes “would become much more significant.” 71 Fed.\nReg. 10,338.\n\n                               44\n\fOSHA concluded that “a uniform PEL will ultimately make the\nstandard more effective by” facilitating employer understanding\nand compliance, and enhancing OSHA’s ability “to provide\nclear guidance to the regulated community and identify\nnon-compliant conditions.” Id.\n\n       In light of OSHA’s stated reasons for adopting a uniform\nPEL, and the Agency’s similar practice in prior standards, we\nconclude that OSHA’s decision was reasonably drawn from the\nrecord. While HRG may provide reasons to disagree with\nOSHA, it provides no grounds upon which we could conclude\nthat the agency operated outside of its discretion in\nimplementing section 655(b)(5).\n\n                       C. Action Level\n\n       HRG argues that OSHA did not adequately explain why\nit set the “action level”, the level that triggers additional\nmonitoring and surveillance obligations, at one half of the PEL.\nSee 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1026(b), (d)(2)(iii), 1926.1126(b),\n(d)(2)(iii). HRG argues that this action level was unjustified\ngiven the significant risks to employee health that remain at both\nthe PEL and one half of the PEL. HRG points to no case in\nwhich a court invalidated the action level of a previous standard.\n\n      OSHA explained that, given the variable nature of Cr(VI)\nconcentrations in workplaces, the action level is a tool that\n“provides increased assurance that employees will not be\n\n                               45\n\fexposed to Cr(VI) at levels above the PEL on days when no\nexposure measurements are made in the workplace.” 71 Fed.\nReg. 10,331. By setting the level at one half of the PEL, the\naction level also “effectively encourages employers, where\nfeasible, to reduce exposures below the action level to avoid the\nadded costs of required compliance with provisions triggered by\nthe action level.” Id. at 10,332. Set as it is, OSHA explained\nthat the action level provides a “very real and necessary further\nreduction in risk beyond that provided by the PEL alone.” Id.\nOSHA adopted this practice in the Cr(VI) standard after\n“successful experience with an action level of one-half the PEL\nin other standards.” Id. at 10,331. See, e.g., 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 1910.18 (inorganic arsenic); 1910.1047 (ethylene oxide);\n1910.1028 (benzene); 1910.1052 (methylene chloride). OSHA\npointed to numerous comments on the proposed rule, from\nindustry and labor, submitted in support of its selected action\nlevel. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,331.\n\n        Much like the selection of an exposure level, selection of\nan action level is primarily a legislative policy decision that we\nwill uphold so long as it was reasonably drawn from the record.\nSee AISI, 577 F.2d at 833. To the extent the decision may have\nrelied on factual findings, we will not disturb those findings as\nlong as they are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 655(f). OSHA has no statutory obligation to implement action\nlevels, but has developed the concept as a means to promulgate\nmore effective standards. As OSHA explained, one reason for\nimplementing the action level was to provide confidence that\n\n                               46\n\fday-to-day exposures do not exceed the PEL. The action level\nis also intended to encourage employers to reduce employee\nexposure below the PEL where possible. As for setting the level\nat one-half of the PEL, OSHA explained that it followed a\npractice it had found successful in prior standards, and identified\ndiverse comments in the record supporting its approach.\n\n       We conclude that it is eminently reasonable for OSHA to\nbase a tool for PEL compliance on the PEL, and that the past\nexperience and positive comments cited by OSHA provide\nsubstantial evidence in support of the chosen action level. We\nwill accordingly not disturb the Agency’s decision.\n\n               D. Employee Notification Level\n\n        The Cr(VI) standard requires an employer to notify an\nemployee whenever monitoring results indicate that the\nemployee was exposed to Cr(VI) levels in excess of the 5 µg/m 3\nPEL. 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1026(d)(4), 1926.1126(d)(4). The\nproposed rule would have required an employer to notify an\nemployee of all monitoring results. 69 Fed. Reg. 59,450-51.\nHRG argues that OSHA’s decision not to adopt the proposed\nrule and, instead, to set the notification level at the PEL is\narbitrary and unexplained.\n\n       OSHA argues that the notification trigger complies\nprecisely with a statutory requirement for employers to notify\nemployees of exposure to toxins “at levels which exceed those\n\n                                47\n\fprescribed by an applicable [OSHA] standard.” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 657(c)(3). OSHA also contends that its general record access\nstandard provides all employees the right to access their records,\nthus permitting them to discover monitoring results on their\nown. See 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1020(e)(1)(i) (“Whenever an\nemployee . . . requests access to a record, the employer shall\nassure that access is provided in a reasonable time, place, and\nmanner.”). OSHA further argues that it opened the notification\nissue up to comment, and that the final rule was more protective\nthan the proposed rule because the final rule expanded the\nmonitoring requirements to include shipyards and construction.\nFinally, OSHA asserts that the Cr(VI) standard requires all\nemployers to educate affected employees about the risks of\nCr(VI) exposure. See 29 C.F.R. 1910.1020.\n\n        While all of these arguments may be true, they are beside\nthe point. OSHA does not deny that the final Cr(VI) standard\ndeparted significantly from the notification requirement of the\nproposed standard, or that every prior standard that required\nmonitoring also required the employers to notify their employees\nof all monitoring results. E.g., 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1001(d)(7)(i)\n(asbestos); 1910.1017(n) (vinyl chloride); 1910.1018(e)(5)(i)\n(inorganic arsenic); 1910.1025(d)(8)(i) (lead). While we\nrecognize that OSHA operates with substantial discretion in\npromulgating standards, rules, and decisions, the Agency must\nalways include a statement of its reasons for any such action in\nthe Federal Register. 29 U.S.C. § 655(e). We are particularly\ncurious as to OSHA’s reasons for setting the notification level\n\n                               48\n\fat the PEL, since the Agency does not deny that this decision\ndeparts from both its proposed rule and its past practice.\n\n       In its brief and at oral argument, OSHA failed to point us\nto a statement in the record justifying the altered notification\nrequirement, or attempt to explain the agency’s reasoning.\nWhile we find extensive discussion in the Federal Register\nregarding the methods employers may use to measure exposure,\nand a discussion of the notification requirement in its final form,\nwe find no explanation for why OSHA replaced the proposed\nnotification requirement. See 71 Fed. Reg. 10,339-43. OSHA\naccordingly failed to provide a statement of reasons for its\nactions as required by section 655(e), and we will accordingly\ngrant HRG’s petition on this ground.7\n\n                     V. EEI’s Arguments\n\n       EEI challenges the applicability of the Cr(VI) standard to\nemployees performing maintenance and repair work in coal and\nnuclear electric utility power plants. These employees may be\n\n\n  7\n    OSHA cites National Grain and Feed Ass’n v. OSHA, 866\nF.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), for the proposition that HRG bears the\nburden to demonstrate that any rule alteration it proposes would\nhave “more than a de minimis benefit for . . . worker safety.” Id.\nat 737. Since we do not here consider an alternative provision,\nbut rather conclude that OSHA failed to adequately explain its\nactions, we find National Grain to be inapplicable.\n\n                                49\n\fexposed to Cr(VI) through contact with “fly ash” in coal plants,\nor through welding in either coal or nuclear plants, during\noccasional periods of maintenance and repair. EEI argues:\n(1) OSHA impermissibly relied on medical data from other\nindustries to establish the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds in\nelectric plants; (2) OSHA’s decision not to exempt electric\nplants from the Cr(VI) standard is not supported by substantial\nevidence; (3) OSHA’s conclusion that the Cr(VI) standard is\nfeasible for coal and nuclear electric plants is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence; and (4) the standard is arbitrary and\ncapricious because OSHA failed to address conflicts with other\nregulatory requirements. For the reasons stated below, we will\ndeny EEI’s petition on all grounds.\n\n   A. Toxicity of Cr(VI) Compounds in Electric Power\n                         Plants\n\n        EEI challenges OSHA’s reliance on the Gibb and\nLuippold cohorts, studies drawn from the chromate production\nindustry, to establish the toxicity of the Cr(VI) compounds\nfound in electric power plants. EEI points to portions of a\nstatement by Dr. Herman Gibb, of the Gibb study, suggesting\nthat the relative toxicity of different forms of Cr(VI) compounds\nencountered in different industries may vary. (See Ex. 47-8,\nPost-Hearing Comments From Herman Gibb on the Proposed\nHexavalent Chromium Rule, Mar. 21, 2005 (“Gibb\nComments”)). EEI also points to two cases, Texas Independent\nGinners Ass’n v. Marshall, 630 F.2d 398, 403 (5th Cir. 1980),\n\n                               50\n\fand Color Pigments Manufacturer’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OSHA, 16\nF.3d 1157 (11th Cir. 1994), to support its assertion that evidence\nof health risks in one industry may not be relied on to establish\nhealth risks in a second industry. EEI identifies no evidence, in\nthe record or otherwise, suggesting that Cr(VI) compounds\nencountered in electric power plants are any less carcinogenic\nthan Cr(VI) compounds encountered in chromate production.\n\n        In reaching a conclusion as to the existence of significant\nrisk, OSHA need not calculate risk with mathematical precision,\nnor does the substantial evidence standard require the Agency to\nsupport its risk determination “with anything approaching\nscientific certainty.” Benzene, 448 U.S. at 655-56. Under the\n“best available evidence” standard, “so long as they are\nsupported by a body of reputable scientific thought, the Agency\nis free to use conservative assumptions in interpreting the data\nwith respect to carcinogens, risking error on the side of\noverprotection rather than underprotection.” Id. at 656.\n\n       During rulemaking, OSHA considered arguments that\nrisk estimates derived from Cr(VI) compounds found in the\nchromate production industry were not applicable to other\nindustries. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,334. However, OSHA ultimately\ndetermined that “all Cr(VI) compounds” are carcinogenic, and\nthat the risk estimates derived from the Gibb and Luippold\ncohorts were “reasonably representative of the risks expected\nfrom equivalent exposures to different Cr(VI) compounds in\nother industries.” Id. During rulemaking, the Agency\n\n                                51\n\fspecifically asked for Dr. Gibb’s opinion on this precise matter\nthrough a post-hearing question. Dr. Gibb’s response, taken in\nits entirety, provides no support for EEI’s position:\n\n       Should the exposure response observed in the\n       chromium chemical production worker studies be\n       restricted to setting a PEL only for the chemical\n       production industry?\n\n       Answer: It is conceivable that differences in\n       exposure (e.g. practical size, nature of the aerosol,\n       etc) between some industries (e.g. steel,\n       aerospace, lead chromate pigment production) and\n       the chromium chemical production industry could\n       lead to differences in cancer risk, but the\n       available data are inadequate to evaluate whether\n       such differences exist . . . . It is unlikely that\n       adequate studies of all industries affected by this\n       proposed rule will ever be conducted. In the\n       absence of more definitive information regarding\n       specific industries, it is prudent to regard\n       exposure to any hexavalent chromium compound\n       as presenting an excess lung cancer risk and that\n       the exposure response observed in the chromium\n       chemicals production industry should apply to\n       other industries with occupational exposure to\n       hexavalent chromium.\n\n\n\n                                52\n\f(Gibb Comments at 5 (emphasis added).)\n\n       In explaining its final risk determinations regarding\nCr(VI), OSHA stated that “the Gibb cohort and the Luippold\ncohort, were found to be the strongest data sets for quantitative\nassessment” because, in part, the “two had the most extensive\nand best documented Cr(VI) exposures spanning three or four\ndecades.” 71 Fed. Reg. 10,176. Dr. Gibb’s comments bolster\nOSHA’s conclusion that the Agency based its health risk\ndetermination on the “best quantitative estimates of excess\nlifetime lung cancer risks” available. Id. at 10,220. To the\nextent that OSHA’s reliance on these estimates might\nconceivably have been conservative, Benzene permits the\nAgency to risk error on the side of overprotection. Since\nDr. Gibb expressly recommended that OSHA rely on the\nchromate production studies to establish the toxicity of Cr(VI)\ncompounds generally, his testimony is of no help to EEI.\n\n        EEI’s reliance on Color Pigments and Texas Independent\nis also misplaced. EEI points to portions of both cases in which\nthe relevant issue was not the inherent toxicity of certain\ncompounds, but the amounts of known toxins encountered in\ndifferent industries. There is no dispute here that different\noperations naturally generate different concentrations of Cr(VI).\nThe Cr(VI) standard accounts for these differences by requiring\nall employers to comply with a uniform exposure limit.\n\n\n\n\n                               53\n\f        In Texas Independent, the cotton dust standard at issue\ndid not establish an exposure limit or require employers to limit\ncotton dust emissions. See Texas Independent, 630 F.2d at 403.\nOSHA did not measure exposure levels in the cotton gin\nindustry, but sought to impose medical surveillance\nrequirements on that industry on the basis of negative health\neffects observed in cotton textile manufacturing processes. Id.\nat 409. The court determined that OSHA’s risk assessment\nlacked substantial evidence because the concentration of cotton\ndust in cotton gin operations was “substantially lower” than the\nconcentrations encountered in cotton manufacturing. Id. at 409.\nThus, the disputed issue was the amount of occupational\nexposure to a particular substance in disparate industries, not the\ntoxicity of the substance itself.\n\n       Color Pigments is similarly inapplicable. OSHA’s\ntechnological feasibility analysis for the cadmium standard at\nissue was based upon the extent to which employers could\nreduce toxin concentrations below an initial exposure level.\n16 F.3d at 1162-63. Proper calculation of the initial exposure\nlevel in a given industry was therefore “vital.” Id. at 1163.\nOSHA established the initial exposure level in the chemical\nmixer industry by using data captured from the dry color\nformulator industry. Id. at 1162. The court ruled that this\nmethodology was inadequate because OSHA failed to account\nfor variables between the industries that would affect the\namount of cadmium to which employees were exposed. Id.\nThus, the disputed issue was again the level of exposure to a\n\n                                54\n\ftoxic substance in disparate industries, not the toxicity of the\nsubstance itself.\n\n       EEI identifies no case in which a court faulted OSHA for\nusing medical data derived from one industry to establish the\ntoxicity of a substance generally. In fact, in another portion of\nthe Color Pigments decision, the Eleventh Circuit rejected an\nargument that mirrors the one made here by EEI. The cadmium\npigment industry argued that OSHA should have excluded it\nfrom the cadmium standard because exposure to cadmium\npigment was allegedly “less toxic and carcinogenic[] than other\nforms of cadmium.” Id. at 1161. The court disagreed:\n\n       Given the absence of definiteness on the issue, the\n       volume of evidence that points at least implicitly\n       to the dangers of cadmium pigments, and the\n       serious potential health risks present if cadmium\n       exposure is as great in pigment form as in other\n       compounds, we believe that OSHA was justified\n       in choosing to include cadmium pigments in the\n       PEL, despite the existence of an equally rational\n       alternative.\n\nId. EEI’s argument is no more availing.\n\n       OSHA’s conclusion that health risk data derived from the\nchromate production industry was sufficient to establish the\ntoxicity of Cr(VI) compounds generally is supported by the best\n\n                               55\n\favailable evidence and by substantial evidence.        We will\ntherefore not disturb the Agency’s decision.\n\n          B. Exemption for Electric Power Plants\n\n        EEI also argues that, even assuming that Cr(VI)\ncompounds encountered in electric plants are carcinogenic, the\nconcentrations of such compounds in electric plants are so low\nas to warrant a general exemption from the standard. OSHA\ndenied EEI’s request for such an exemption during rulemaking.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,330-31. EEI argues that the amount of Cr(VI)\ncontained in “fly ash,” a residue of coal combustion encountered\nduring the maintenance and repair of boilers in coal-fired\nelectric plants, results in exposure levels that are below the\nAgency’s exemption level. See FEA at II-24. Because this\nargument does not pertain to welding, the only identified source\nof Cr(VI) exposure in nuclear plants, and an additional source\nin coal-fired plants, we consider the exemption argument to be\nlimited in scope to fly ash encountered in coal-fired plants.\n\n       EEI points to a statement by OSHA indicating that the\nCr(VI) content found in samples of fly ash provided to the\nAgency demonstrated that the worker exposure to Cr(VI) would\nbe “well below 0.5 µg/m 3 .” FEA at III-362. Under the final\nCr(VI) standard, any employer, including an employer operating\nan electric power plant, may be granted an exemption by\ndemonstrating with “objective data” that “a specific process,\noperation, or activity involving [Cr(VI)] cannot release dusts,\n\n                              56\n\ffumes, or mists of [Cr(VI)] in concentrations above 0.5 µg/m 3\n. . . under any expected conditions of use.” 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 1910.1026(a)(4), 1926.1126(a)(4). EEI argues that exposures\nto fly ash should have been completely exempted from the\nstandard during rulemaking under this same standard, just as\nexposures to portland cement were exempted in the final rule.\nSee id. § 1910.1026(a)(3).\n\n        OSHA asserts, and the record demonstrates, that the\nAgency only received nine samples of fly ash from EEI during\nrulemaking, despite there being more than 1,000 coal-fired\nelectric plants in operation. Furthermore, EEI did not fully\nidentify the types of coal involved, or where the samples\noriginated. While the samples provided did indicate that\nexposures from fly ash would be low, OSHA explained that\nthere was insufficient evidence “to establish that all coal ash\nfrom all sources will necessarily have comparable Cr(VI)\ncontent [to the exempted portland cement].”            71 Fed.\n                                   8\nReg. 10,330-31 (emphasis added). This was in contrast to\ncomprehensive data pertaining to portland cement, which\ndemonstrated that employee exposures would be below\n0.3 µg/m 3 . Id. at 10,328.\n\n\n   8\n     In fact, one of the nine samples provided by EEI had a\nCr(VI) content of 45 micrograms per gram of fly ash. FEA at\nIII-361. In its brief, OSHA states that this translates to an\ninhalation exposure level of 0.675 µg/m 3 , above the exemption\nlevel of 0.5 µg/m 3 .\n\n                              57\n\f        In this argument, EEI does not deny that Cr(VI) is toxic,\nand that Cr(VI) is present in fly ash. The sole issue is whether\nthe evidence of Cr(VI) concentration levels in the record\nrequired the Agency to exempt all fly ash exposure in coal-fired\nelectric plants from the standard. OSHA is required to\npromulgate protective standards on the basis of the best\navailable evidence. The Agency rejected EEI’s requested\nexemption upon finding that the available evidence was\ninsufficient to demonstrate that employee exposure to Cr(VI)\nfrom fly ash would be sufficiently and uniformly low. OSHA’s\ndetermination that there was an insufficient basis for exemption\nis supported by substantial evidence in the record indicating that\nEEI only provided OSHA with nine samples of ash during\nrulemaking that were incompletely labeled. To the extent this\ndecision involved legislative policy decisions on the part of the\nAgency, we find it to be reasonably drawn from the record. We\nwill therefore not disturb the OSHA’s decision to deny a general\nexemption for fly ash exposures in coal-fired electric power\nplants.\n\n C. Feasibility of the Standard for Electric Power Plants\n\n       EEI argues that OSHA failed to prove that the Cr(VI)\nstandard is economically and technologically feasible for coal\nand nuclear electric utility power plants. First, EEI argues that\nOSHA failed to prove economic feasibility because it did not\nshow that the costs of compliance would be reasonably related\nto the benefits to be derived from employee protection. This\n\n                               58\n\fargument is predicated on a clear misstatement of law. EEI\nrelies on a concurring opinion by Justice Powell in Industrial\nUnion Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute,\n448 U.S. 607 (1980), in which he argued for a proportionality\nrequirement. Id. at 663. The Court squarely rejected Justice\nPowell’s position the next year in American Textile\nManufacturer’s Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490 (1981),\nafter reasoning that a “cost-benefit analysis on the issuance of\n§ 6(b)(5) standards would eviscerate the ‘to the extent feasible’\nrequirement.” Id. at 513. We therefore reject EEI’s argument\nwith regard to economic feasibility.9\n\n       Second, EEI devotes just over a page in its brief to argue\nthat OSHA made no findings regarding the technological\nfeasibility of the Cr(VI) standard in electric power generation\nplants. However, the record demonstrates that, for the purposes\nof assessing feasibility, OSHA included electric utilities within\n\n\n\n    9\n      In its reply brief, EEI adds an additional argument that\nOSHA’s cost estimates for welding were not appropriately\ntailored to the electric utility industry. During hearings, OSHA\nspecifically asked EEI to supply additional information to\nsupport its asserted cost figures, but EEI does not deny that it\nnever complied. Furthermore, EEI offers no argument or\nevidence that, under the correct standard for economic\nfeasibility, the costs of compliance would have threatened the\nexistence or altered the competitive structure of the electric\nutility industry.\n\n                               59\n\fthe welding applications group. FEA at II-24. EEI points to no\nevidence indicating that welding in electric utilities differs\nsubstantially from welding generally, but, in its reply brief, EEI\nattacks the application group methodology generally. As we\ndiscussed above in considering HRG’s similar argument, OSHA\nacted within its discretion to assess feasibility through use of\napplication groups. We will therefore not disturb OSHA’s\nfindings with regard to the feasibility of the Cr(VI) standard in\nthe electric utility industry.\n\n     D. Relationship of the Cr(VI) Standard to Other\n                       Regulations\n\n       EEI argues that OSHA failed to harmonize the Cr(VI)\nstandard with regulatory requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (“NRC”), and OSHA’s own arsenic standard as it\napplies to fly ash.\n\n       With regard to workers in nuclear plants, EEI points to\n10 C.F.R. § 20.1101(b), which requires employers subject to\nNRC licenses to “use, to the extent practical, procedures and\nengineering controls based on sound radiation protection\nprinciples to achieve operational doses . . . that are as low as is\nreasonably achievable (ALARA).” Id. EEI contends that the\ncontrols required to comply with the new Cr(VI) standard would\nrisk increasing the time workers spend in radioactive areas,\nparticularly through use of respirators, and the total number of\nemployees exposed to radiation.          However, the record\n\n                                60\n\fdemonstrates that OSHA entered into an agreement with the\nNRC in 1988, which delineates jurisdiction regarding\noccupational safety and health at nuclear power plants.\nMemorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. NRC and\nOSHA, Oct. 21, 1988 (“MOU”). By the terms of the MOU,\nOSHA has jurisdiction to regulate “[p]lant conditions which\nresult in occupational risk, but do not affect the safety of\nlicensed radioactive materials,” conditions which might include\n“exposure to toxic nonradioactive materials and other industrial\nhazards in the workplace.” Id. Moreover, a regulatory guide\npublished by the NRC expressly provides that “if an NRC\nlicensee is using respiratory protection to protect workers\nagainst nonradiological hazards, the OSHA requirements apply.”\nNRC Regulatory Guide 8.15, Acceptable Programs for\nRespiratory Protection, Rev. 1, Oct. 1999. Thus, we conclude\nthat the Cr(VI) standard is fully compatible with NRC’s\nALARA requirement.\n\n        With regard to coal-fired power plants, EEI argues that\nOSHA failed to rectify the Cr(VI) standard with its existing\nstandard for inorganic arsenic, another toxin present in coal fly\nash. EEI points to language in the preamble of the arsenic\nstandard by which OSHA responded to EEI’s argument that coal\nplants should be exempt because exposure from cleaning boilers\nis “intermittent.” Occupational Exposure to Inorganic Arsenic,\n48 Fed. Reg. 1,864, 1,895 (Jan. 14, 1983). OSHA found no\nbasis to exclude the plants from the standard, but stated “[i]f it\nis a maintenance operation with intermittent exposures, the\n\n                               61\n\farsenic standard indicates that a good respirator program with\nsign posting, training, and hygiene facilities . . . may be an\nappropriate control strategy. If exposures are continuous,\nadditional control strategies would be appropriate.” Id. at 1985.\n\n        EEI contends that, by this language, OSHA excluded coal\npower plants from the arsenic standard’s requirement to\nmaintain regulated areas and to comply with certain\nhousekeeping standards. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1018(f), (g). In\nview of OSHA’s alleged past practice regarding toxins in fly\nash, EEI contends that it was therefore inexplicable and arbitrary\nfor the Agency to include maintenance and repair activities in\nelectric plants in the general industry provisions of the Cr(VI)\nstandard. EEI contends that the construction provisions of the\nCr(VI) standard, which do not include regulated area and\nhousekeeping requirements, would have been more appropriate.\n\n        OSHA flatly denies that the arsenic regulations contain\nany exemption for electric utilities with regard to maintenance\nand repair work. We note that both the arsenic standard and the\ngeneral industry provisions of the Cr(VI) standard contain\nvirtually identical requirements for regulated areas and\nhousekeeping. Compare 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1018(f), (g) with\n§§ 1910.1026(e), (j). Nothing in the text of the arsenic\nregulations indicates that electric utilities are subject to an\nexemption, and we find EEI’s reliance on the language in the\npreamble to be unconvincing.\n\n\n\n                               62\n\f       Moreover, even if electric plants were required to do\nmore to control fly ash under the Cr(VI) standard, EEI identifies\nno legal basis for this Court to disturb a standard merely because\ntwo disparately regulated toxins happen to exist in a single\nsubstance found in a workplace. Each standard was written to\nmitigate the risks of a different hazardous substance, and we fail\nto see why it would be at all improper for OSHA to expect an\nemployer to comply with the more restrictive standard.\n\n                         VI. Remedy\n\n        Because we conclude that OSHA failed to provide a\nstatement of its reasons for setting the employee exposure\nnotification level at the PEL, we must select an appropriate\nremedy. Where, as here, the only identified defect in a standard\nis the lack of an adequate statement of reasons, the appropriate\ncourse of action is to remand the matter to OSHA for further\nconsideration and explanation, without disturbing the rule itself.\nAFL-CIO v. Brennan, 530 F.2d 109, 124 (3d Cir. 1975); see also\nInt’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Federal Mine Safety\nand Health Admin. 920 F.2d 960, 966 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“We\nhave commonly remanded without vacating an agency’s rule or\norder where the failure lay in lack of reasoned\ndecisionmaking.”). We will accordingly remand the matter to\nOSHA for further consideration and explanation, consistent with\nthis opinion. Given the length of time that has passed in\nfinalizing the rule before us, and the need for certainty, we\nexpect that OSHA will act expeditiously in either providing an\n\n                               63\n\fexplanation for its chosen notification requirements, or taking\nsuch further action as may be appropriate.\n\n                      VII. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we will GRANT HRG’s\npetition for review with regard to the employee notification\nrequirements of the Cr(VI) standard, and REMAND the matter\nto OSHA for further consideration. We will DENY HRG’s\npetition for review on all other grounds. We will DENY EEI’s\npetition for review on all grounds.\n\n___________\n\n\n\n\n                              64\n\f",

Public Citizen Health\n\n                             5\n\fResearch Group and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry,\nRubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service\nWorker’s International Union, (collectively “HRG”) join in\narguing that OSHA violated its statutory mandate in adopting a\nstandard that under-regulates Cr(VI) exposure. The Edison\nElectric Institute (“EEI”) separately argues that OSHA\nimproperly adopted a standard that is over-inclusive of coal and\nnuclear electric power generating plants. For the reasons stated\nbelow, we will grant HRG’s petition with regard to the\nemployee exposure notification requirements of the standard.\nWe will deny both petitions on all other grounds.\n\n                       I. Background\n\n        Cr(VI) is a state of the metal chromium that generally\nresults from man-made processes. Occupational Exposure to\nHexavalent Chromium, 71 Fed. Reg. 10,100, 10,104 (Feb. 28,\n2006). Compounds containing Cr(VI) can exist in mist, dust, or\nfume form, and have long been known to jeopardize the health\nof workers when inhaled, or upon contact with skin. Cr(VI) has\nbeen known to cause lung cancer, asthma, and damage to skin\nand the lining of the nasal passage. Id. at 10,108. Compounds\ncontaining Cr(VI) are used intentionally to perform metal\nelectroplating, and in the production of chemical catalysts and\npigments for textile dyes, paints, inks, glass, and plastics.\nCr(VI) compounds are also encountered incidentally, for\nexample as a by-product of certain welding processes, and as an\nimpurity found in portland cement. Id. According to OSHA,\n\n                               6\n\fthere are over 30 industry sectors in which workers may be\nexposed to Cr(VI). Id. at 10,246-55.\n\n        In 1971, OSHA adopted a permissible exposure limit\n(“PEL”) of 52 micrograms of Cr(VI) per cubic meter, or\n52 µg/m 3 , which had been a recommended industry limit since\n1943. Id. at 10,101-03. The early standard was established to\nprotect nasal tissues from irritation and damage, but, over time,\ngovernment and private organizations came to recognize Cr(VI)\nas a carcinogen. Id. at 10,103. In 1998, this Court denied a\npetition by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union and\nPublic Citizen’s Health Research Group to compel OSHA to\nestablish a lower PEL for Cr(VI).

In 2002,\nhowever, this Court directed OSHA to “proceed expeditiously\nwith its [Cr(VI)] rulemaking” after finding that OSHA’s delay\nin promulgating a new standard had become unreasonable.

The proposed rule\ncontemplated reducing the PEL from 52 to 1 µg/m 3 .\nOccupational Exposure to Hexavalent Chromium, 69 Fed.\nReg. 59,306 (Oct. 4, 2004). After extensive comments and\nhearings, OSHA issued its final rule on February 28, 2006.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,100. Upon examining the health risks to\nworkers, and the feasibility of implementing various PELs,\n\n                               7\n\fOSHA replaced the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL with a universal PEL\nof 5 µg/m 3 . 71 Fed. Reg. 10,100-385. OSHA issued corrections\nto the final rule on June 23, 2006, and a minor amendment on\nOctober 30, 2006, reflecting a settlement agreement with\nvarious parties. 71 Fed. Reg. 36,008 (June 23, 2006); 71 Fed.\nReg. 63,238 (Oct. 30, 2006).\n\n       HRG and EEI level a number of attacks on the\nmethodology employed and conclusions reached by OSHA. We\naccordingly summarize OSHA’s relevant methodology and\nfindings as background for our decision.\n\n               A. Estimation of Health Risk\n\n        In adopting a new standard, OSHA must establish that\nworkers face a significant risk of material harm. OSHA\nconsidered more than 40 studies of workers in order to assess\nthe relationship between exposure to Cr(VI) and lung cancer.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,175. OSHA decided to base its risk analysis on\nthe so-called “Gibb” and “Luippold” cohorts, which were both\nderived from studies of workers in chromate production\nfacilities. Id. at 10,176, 10,220. According to OSHA,\n\n      the Gibb cohort and the Luippold cohort, were\n      found to be the strongest data sets for quantitative\n      assessment . . . . Of the various studies, these two\n      had the most extensive and best documented\n      Cr(VI) exposures spanning three or four decades.\n\n                               8\n\f       Both cohort studies characterized observed and\n       expected lung cancer mortality and reported a\n       statistically significant positive association\n       between lung cancer risk and cumulative Cr(VI)\n       exposure.\n\nId. at 10,176.\n\n       OSHA found that a “linear relative risk model” best\ndescribed the relationship between Cr(VI) exposure and lung\ncancer, whereby the exposure level over the course of a\nhypothetical 45-year career was directly correlated to the risk of\ncancer. Id. at 10,194. OSHA used the Gibb and Luippold\ncohorts to establish upper and lower estimates of cancer cases\nper 1000 workers, and tabulated the estimated cases for\nexposure levels ranging from 0.25 µg/m 3 to the pre-existing PEL\nof 52 µg/m 3 . Id. at 10,195. According to the resulting table,\nexposure at 1 µg/m 3 would result in an estimated 2.1 to 9.1\ncancer cases, exposure at 5 µg/m 3 would result in 10 to 45 cases,\nand exposure at the pre-existing PEL would result in 101 to 351\ncases. Id.\n\n       Based in part on this information, OSHA concluded that\n“Cr(VI) causes ‘material impairment of health or functional\ncapacity’ within the meaning of the OSH Act.” Id. at 10,221.\nOSHA further determined that the cancer risk of 100 to 350\ncases under exposure at the pre-existing 52 µg/m 3 PEL was\n“clearly significant.” Id. at 10,224. OSHA also found that the\n\n                                9\n\festimated 10 to 45 cases at a career exposure level of 5 µg/m 3 ,\nthe PEL ultimately selected, would represent a substantial\nimprovement, but the risk of impairment would remain “clearly\nsignificant.” Id.\n\n                   B. Feasibility Analysis\n\n        By law, OSHA is required to demonstrate both the\n“technological” and “economic” feasibility of a standard. After\nexploring the technological and economic feasibility of\nalternative Cr(VI) PELs, OSHA concluded that implementation\nof the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL would not be feasible. Although\nthe agency recognized that a PEL of 5 µg/m 3 still presented\nsignificant health risks to workers, the agency found the higher\nlevel to be feasible, and adopted it as a universal PEL. A\nsummary of OSHA’s relevant technological and economic\nfeasibility analyses follows.\n\n                 1. Technological Feasibility\n\n       To assess technological feasibility, OSHA expressly\napplied the standard articulated by the Court of Appeals for the\nD.C. Circuit in United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC\nv. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“Lead”). 71 Fed.\nReg. 10,335. The Lead decision provides:\n\n       [W]ithin the limits of the best available evidence,\n       and subject to the court’s search for substantial\n\n                               10\n\f       evidence, OSHA must prove a reasonable\n       possibility that the typical firm will be able to\n       develop and install engineering and work practice\n       controls that can meet the PEL in most of its\n       operations.\n\n647 F.2d at 1272. OSHA explained that, in harmony with the\nLead standard, it favored engineering and work practice controls\nto reduce the presence of toxins in the air over reliance on\nrespirators.1 OSHA explained its “long-held view” that\nextensive reliance on respirators to achieve a PEL should be\navoided due to independent health, safety, and reliability\nproblems that arise when workers are required to perform tasks\nwith respirators. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,335.\n\n\n\n\n 1\n  “‘Engineering controls’ employ mechanical means or process\nredesign to eliminate, contain, divert, dilute, or collect [toxin]\nemissions at their source.” Occupational Exposure to Lead,\n43 Fed. Reg. 52,952, 52,989 (Nov. 14, 1978). “‘Work practice\ncontrols’ . . . accomplish the same results as engineering\ncontrols, but rely upon employees to repeatedly perform certain\nactivities in a specified manner so that airborne lead\nconcentrations are eliminated or reduced,” and include\nadministrative controls, such as “moving the employee to a\nplace of lower exposure or reducing his work hours.” Id. at\n52,989.\n\n                               11\n\f       For technological feasibility purposes, OSHA chose to\ndefine employee exposure in terms of “application groups,” or\n“groups of firms where employees are exposed to Cr(VI) when\nperforming a particular function,” rather than in terms of\nproduct-based industries. Id. at 10,226. OSHA justified this\napproach as follows:\n\n       This methodology is appropriate to exposure to\n       Cr(VI) where a widely used chemical like\n       chromium may lead to exposures in many kinds of\n       firms in many industries but the processes used,\n       exposures generated, and controls needed to\n       achieve compliance may be the same. For\n       example, because a given type of welding\n       produces Cr(VI) exposures that are essentially the\n       same regardless of whether the welding occurs in\n       a ship, or a construction site, as part of a\n       manufacturing process, or as part of a repair\n       process, it is appropriate to analyze such\n       processes as a group.\n\nId. OSHA accordingly identified and analyzed dozens of\napplication groups in which employees were exposed to Cr(VI).\nId. at 10,228-44.\n\n      OSHA concluded that a PEL of 1 µg/m 3 was not\ntechnologically feasible based on several determinations. First,\nOSHA positively concluded that it was technologically\n\n                              12\n\finfeasible for the sectors of welding and aerospace painting to\nachieve a 1 µg/m 3 through engineering and work controls alone.\nOSHA, Final Economic and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for\nOSHA’s Final Standard for Occupational Exposure to\nHexavalent Chromium, III-331, Feb. 23, 2006 (“FEA”). For\nwelding, OSHA examined several types of welding processes\nemployed in general industry, shipyards, and construction. Id.\nat III-332. OSHA found that two of the “most common”\nwelding operations, shielded metal arc welding (“SMAW”) on\nstainless steel, and stainless steel welding in confined and\nenclosed spaces, could not conform to a 1 µg/m 3 PEL by altering\nwork processes or through engineering controls. Id. at III-333-\n36. Although OSHA recognized that the standard may be\nfeasible for less common welding operations, “the fact that\nwelding is not easily separated into high and low exposure\noperations render[ed] OSHA unable to conclude that the\nproposed PEL of 1 µg/m 3 is technologically feasible for any\nwelding operations.” Id. at III-336.\n\n        OSHA also determined that “approximately two thirds”\nof aerospace painting operations could not achieve the 1 µg/m 3\nPEL with engineering or work practice controls. Although\nsmaller parts could be painted in compliance with the PEL\nthrough use of enclosed and ventilated rooms, such treatment for\nlarger parts and assemblies was impractical. Thus, the proposed\nPEL was “not generally feasible for aerospace painting.” Id. at\nIII-336-37.\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f       While OSHA positively concluded that the proposed\n1 µg/m 3 PEL was technologically infeasible for welding and\naerospace painting operations, it also found that “the evidence\nin the record [wa]s insufficient” for it to conclude that the\n1 µg/m 3 would be technologically feasible for four other\nindustries with relatively few employees. Id. at III-338. For the\nthree operations of chromate pigment production, chromium\ncatalyst production, and chromium dye production, OSHA found\na “lack of clear evidence” that it would be technologically\nfeasible to install protective enclosures to avert widespread\nrespirator use in order to achieve the proposed PEL. Id. at\nIII-340. For hard chrome electroplating, OSHA found that the\ndiversity of such operations, and the lack of evidence as to\nwhether involved facilities could employ fume suppressants, left\nit “unable to conclude that the proposed PEL of 1 µg/m 3 would\nbe technologically feasible for all hard chrome electroplating\noperations.” Id. at III-341.\n\n                   2. Economic Feasibility\n\n       OSHA analyzed economic feasibility by questioning\nwhether a standard under consideration would eliminate or alter\nthe competitive structure of an industry. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,301.\nOSHA determined that the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL was\neconomically infeasible for electroplating job shops, which are\nbusinesses dedicated to providing electroplating services to\nothers. OSHA concluded that these shops could not be expected\nto absorb the costs to comply with a 1 µg/m 3 standard. The\n\n                               14\n\fAgency found that compliance costs would “represent 2.7\npercent of revenues and 65 percent of profits.” Id. Under prior\nstandards, OSHA had ensured that the most affected industries\nwere not confronted with costs over 2 percent of revenues. Id.\nAlso, OSHA found that the costs to electroplating job shops\nwould not be significantly lower even if the shops were\npermitted to achieve the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL through use of\nrespirators. Id. OSHA further found that the high costs of\ncompliance would be similar across various types of plating\nshops. Id. On this analysis, OSHA concluded that the proposed\n1 µg/m 3 PEL would “alter the competitive structure of the\nindustry.” Id. In comparison, OSHA determined that the\nindustry could feasibly absorb the estimated compliance costs of\n1.24 percent of revenues associated with a PEL of 5 µg/m 3 . Id.\n\n                    3. Overall Feasibility\n\n        In considering the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL, OSHA\ndetermined that the technological and economic infeasibility\ndeterminations discussed above affected “almost 56% of the\ntotal number of employees occupationally exposed to Cr(VI).”\nId. at 10,246-54. OSHA calculated this figure using the\nfollowing estimates of affected employees:\n\n       •      270,000 in welding\n\n       •      33,400 in electroplating job shops\n\n\n\n                              15\n\f       •       8,300 in aerospace painting\n\n       •       469 in chromium pigment, catalyst, and\n               dye production\n\nId. at 10,337. This totals 312,169 employees, or 55.9% of the\nestimated 558,431 employees exposed to Cr(VI). OSHA did not\ninclude employees in hard chrome electroplating in order to\navoid double counting workers included in the job shop\nelectroplating figure. Id. OSHA stated that it “did not receive\ndata or recommendations regarding setting the PEL at any levels\nbetween 1 µg/m 3 and 5 µg/m 3 ,” 2 but found that a PEL of\n5 µg/m 3 was technologically and economically feasible for “all\nindustries.” Id.\n\n           C. Application of a Uniform 5 µg/m 3 PEL\n\n        OSHA selected a universal PEL of 5 µg/m 3 that applies\nto all industries. Id. at 10,338. OSHA stated that it “has not\ninterpreted [29 U.S.C. § 6(b)(5)] to require setting multiple\nPELs based on the lowest level particular industries or\noperations could achieve,” and that, in the face of statutory\nsilence, “OSHA has the authority to adopt the reasonable\n\n\n 2\n  Likewise, neither petitioner points to any evidence, nor raises\nany argument, suggesting that OSHA should have considered\nother exposure limits. Thus, only OSHA’s analyses of the\n1 µg/m 3 and 5 µg/m 3 PELs are subject to our review.\n\n                               16\n\finterpretation that it judges will best carry out the purposes of\nthe Act.” Id.\n\n       Although OSHA recognized that “lower PELs might be\nachievable in some industries and operations,” which would\nreduce risks to workers, it determined that “these benefits would\nbe offset by the significant disadvantages of attempting to\nestablish and apply multiple PELs for the diverse group of\nindustries and operations covered by the standard.” Id. OSHA\nsupported this conclusion by stating that multiple PELs would\nplace an “enormous evidentiary burden on OSHA to ascertain\nand establish the specific situations, if any, in which a lower\nPEL could be reached,” causing delays in the implementation of\nhealth standards. Id.\n\n        Also, OSHA asserted, “the demanding burden of setting\nmultiple PELs would be complicated by the difficulties inherent\nin precisely defining and clearly distinguishing between affected\nindustries and operations.” Id. The “definitional and line\ndrawing problem is far less significant when OSHA uses a unit\nof industries and operations for analytical but not compliance\npurposes,” because the “consequences of imprecise\nclassifications” for compliance purposes “would become much\nmore significant.” Id. OSHA determined that the existing\nNorth American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) for\ncategorizing businesses would not be appropriate for delineating\nmultiple PELs because NAICS categorizes businesses by\n\n\n\n                               17\n\fprimary activity, and sub-operations involving Cr(VI) would not\nnecessarily be captured. Id.\n\n        OSHA also concluded that “disaggregation by operation\nhas major practical disadvantages,” in part because “many firms\nhave exposures in two or more different categories.” Id.\nMultiple PELs could therefore require single firms to achieve\nmultiple standards in the same workplace, and possibly with the\nsame employees. Employers would also have to monitor for\nmultiple exposure levels in the same workplace, where the\nexposure of a particular employee might not be traceable to a\nsingle task. Id. OSHA determined that a single standard would\nmake it easier for employers to understand and comply, and\nwould simplify government enforcement. Id. at 10,338-39.\n\n                  D. Resulting Regulations\n\n        The final rule applies the 5 µg/m 3 PEL through separate\nregulatory treatment for general industry, construction, and\nshipyards. Id. at 10,100. Only the distinctions pertaining to\ngeneral industry, 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1026, and construction,\n§ 1926.1126, are relevant to the instant petitions. The PEL\npertains to “occupational exposures to [Cr(VI)] in all forms and\ncompounds, except” for exposures governed by other\ngovernment agencies, exposures to portland cement, or where\nemployers are exempted by demonstrating that “a specific\nprocess, operation, or activity involving [Cr(VI)] cannot release\ndusts, fumes, or mists of [Cr(VI)] in concentrations above 0.5\n\n                               18\n\fµg/m 3 . . . under any expected conditions of use.” 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 1910.1026(a)(4), 1926.1126(a)(4).\n\n       Employers are required to use “engineering and work\npractice controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to\n[Cr(VI)] to or below the PEL unless the employer can\ndemonstrate that such controls are not feasible.”               Id.\n§§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(i), 1926.1126(e)(1)(i). Where further\nreductions are not feasible, employers must supplement the\nengineering and work practice controls with respiratory\nprotection. Id. Also, if an “employer can demonstrate that a\nprocess or task does not result in any employee exposure to\n[Cr(VI)] above the PEL for 30 or more days per year,” the\nemployer may use respiratory protection in lieu of engineering\nand work practice controls to achieve the PEL.                  Id.\n§§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii), (g)(1)(iv), 1926.1126(e)(1)(i), (f)(1)(iv).\n\n       Employers are required to educate all affected employees\nabout the contents of the controlling regulation, and about the\napplicable medical surveillance program. Id. §§ 1910.1026(l),\n1926.1126(j). The regulations also establish an employee\nexposure “action level” of 2.5 µg/m 3 , or one half of the PEL, at\nwhich employers are subject to heightened monitoring burdens.\nId. §§ 1910.1026(b), (d)(2)(iii), 1926.1126(b), (d)(2)(iii).\n\n       Employers are also required to notify an employee when\nrequired monitoring procedures indicate that the employee was\nexposed to Cr(VI) levels in excess of the PEL.             Id.\n\n                                19\n\f§§ 1910.1026(d)(4), 1926.1126(d)(4). This provision marks a\nchange from the proposed rule, which would have required\nemployers to notify employees of all monitoring results,\nregardless of the level of exposure detected. 69 Fed.\nReg. 59,450-51.\n\n       The predominant difference between the general industry\nand construction regulations is that the general industry\nregulation has additional requirements for employers. First,\nemployers subject to the general industry rules must establish\ndefined and access-controlled “regulated areas” wherever “an\nemployee’s exposure to airborne concentrations of [Cr(VI)] is,\nor reasonably can be expected to be, in excess of the PEL.” Id.\n§ 1910.1026(e). Such employers must also comply with detailed\n“housekeeping” requirements for the removal and disposal of\nCr(VI). § 1910.1026(j).\n\n        The general industry regulation also provides a special\ncompliance requirement applicable only to the “painting of\naircraft or large aircraft parts in the aerospace industry.” Id.\n§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii). For such activities, employers need only\nachieve Cr(VI) concentrations of 25 µg/m 3 through engineering\nand work practice controls, if feasible. Id. Respiratory\nprotection may be used to achieve the PEL beyond that point.\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\f                        II. Jurisdiction\n\n       We have jurisdiction over the instant petitions pursuant\nto 29 U.S.C. § 655(f), which allows “[a]ny person who may be\nadversely affected by” an OSHA standard to “file a petition\nchallenging the validity of such standard with the United States\ncourt of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or\nhas a principal place of business.” Id. HRG’s petition was\ntimely filed in this Court on behalf of member workers subject\nto Cr(VI) exposure. EEI’s member businesses include coal and\nnuclear electric power generating facilities that are subject to the\nCr(VI) standard, and its petition was transferred from the D.C.\nCircuit pursuant to a consolidation order by the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a)(3).\n\n              III.

When OSHA promulgates a new\nstandard, it must “include a statement of the reasons for such\naction, which shall be published in the Federal Register.” Id.\n§ 655(e).\n\n       Our review of an OSHA standard is limited and\ndeferential.

Cir. 1980) (“Lead”).\n\n       The technological feasibility test articulated in Lead is\nparticularly helpful because OSHA’s lead and Cr(VI) standards\nfollow a similar pattern with regard to the methods employers\nmay use to control exposure to airborne toxins. As with the\nCr(VI) standard, OSHA established a hierarchy of controls for\nlead exposure, preferring engineering controls first, then work\npractice controls, and finally personal protective equipment\n(primarily respirators). 43 Fed. Reg. 52,990. OSHA stated that\n“[r]espiratory protection is relegated to the bottom of the\ncompliance priority list because it is an ineffective, unreliable,\nand unsafe method of reducing employee exposure.” Id.\nAlthough respirators are generally a more economical\nalternative for employers, OSHA found that they do not\neliminate the source of exposure, and also introduce independent\noccupational hazards, such as restrictions to vision, hearing, and\nmobility. Id. OSHA accordingly found respirators to be useful\nonly on supplementary, interim, or short term bases. Id.\n\n      In an effort “to supply the systemic analysis” of\ntechnological feasibility that had previously been lacking, the\nCourt of Appeals for the D.C.

The effect of such proof is to\n       establish a presumption that industry can meet the\n       PEL without relying on respirators . . . .\n       Insufficient proof of technological feasibility for\n       a few isolated operations within an industry, or\n       even OSHA’s concession that respirators will be\n       necessary in a few such operations, will not\n       undermine this general presumption in favor of\n       feasibility.\n\nLead, 647 F.2d at 1272. The court stated that OSHA could\nsatisfy its burden by pointing to available technologies, and to\nemergent technologies that were “reasonably capable of\nexperimental refinement and distribution within the standard’s\ndeadlines.” Id. In light of the D.C. Circuit’s careful and\ncomprehensive opinion, and the close parallels between\nOSHA’s lead and Cr(VI) standards, we deem it appropriate to\nconduct our technological feasibility analysis in accordance with\nthe Lead methodology.\n\n       The court in Lead also distilled a comprehensive review\nof economic feasibility considerations into a concise standard:\n\n\n\n\n                               27\n\f       [A]s for economic feasibility, OSHA must\n       construct a reasonable estimate of compliance\n       costs and demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that\n       these costs will not threaten the existence or\n       competitive structure of an industry, even if it\n       does portend disaster for some marginal firms.\n\nId. at 1272.

HRG’s Arguments\n\n       HRG contends that, contrary to the OSH Act, past\npractice, and prior judicial decisions, OSHA promulgated a\nCr(VI) standard that is insufficiently protective of workers.\nHRG does not challenge OSHA’s risk determinations, but\nargues: (1) OSHA’s determination that a 1 µg/m 3 is infeasible\nwas factually and legally inadequate; (2) OSHA’s decision to\nimplement a uniform 5 µg/m 3 PEL for all industries is not\nsupported by substantial evidence, and departs from judicial and\nAgency precedent; and (3) OSHA’s decisions to set the\n\n                               28\n\fmonitoring “action level” at one half of the PEL, and to only\nrequire employee notification of detected exposures exceeding\nthe PEL, were arbitrary and unexplained. For the reasons stated\nbelow, we will deny HRG’s petition except with regard to\nOSHA’s decision to set the employee notification requirement\nat the PEL.\n\n              A. Infeasibility of 1 µg/m 3 PEL\n\n       As discussed above, OSHA concluded that the proposed\nPEL of 1 µg/m 3 was infeasible because the Agency could not\nprove feasibility in workplaces employing nearly 56% of the\nworkers exposed to Cr(VI), or 312,169 out of 558,431 workers.\nTo conduct its analysis, OSHA categorized workers by\napplication groups, defined by common tasks, rather than\nindustries defined by end products. OSHA affirmatively\nconcluded that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL was technologically infeasible in\nwelding and aerospace painting, accounting for 270,000 and\n8,300 workers respectively. Furthermore, OSHA concluded that\nit could not meet its burden to prove that the standard was\ntechnologically feasible for the 469 workers in chromium\npigment, catalyst, and dye production.        Finally, OSHA\ndetermined that it would be economically infeasible for\nelectroplating job shops, employing 33,400 workers, to comply\nwith a 1 µg/m 3 PEL. HRG challenges OSHA’s determinations\n\n\n\n\n                              29\n\ffor each of these workplace categories.3\n\n                         1. Welding\n\n       With regard to welding, HRG argues that the finding of\ninfeasibility was flawed on two grounds. First, HRG challenges\nOSHA’s use of application groups, instead of industries, to\ndelineate groups of workers. HRG argues that OSHA must\ndemonstrate that a typical firm will be able to comply with a\nPEL in most of its operations most of the time, and, since\nwelding describes a single operation within a firm, rather than\na type of firm defined by an industry, OSHA did not conduct an\nappropriate analysis.\n\n        We disagree. As an initial matter, nothing in 29 U.S.C.\n§ 655(b)(5) requires OSHA to analyze employee groups by\nindustry, nor does the term “industry” even appear. In the face\nof this statutory silence, HRG presents no argument as to why\nthe Agency’s choice of methodology to implement the statute\n\n\n 3\n   HRG also challenges OSHA’s conclusion that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL\nwas infeasible in hard chrome electroplating operations. In\norder to avoid the potential double counting of workers in\nelectroplating job shops, OSHA did not count hard chrome\nelectroplating workers in its overall feasibility assessment.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,337. Thus, OSHA’s feasibility findings with\nregard to these operations are immaterial to the overall\nfeasibility determination.\n\n                              30\n\fshould not be afforded deference under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843-44\n(1984). We also note that OSHA has employed the application\ngroup methodology in prior standards. See Occupational\nExposure to Methylene Chloride, 62 Fed. Reg. 1,494, 1,564\n(Jan. 10, 1997). OSHA explained that the application group\n“methodology is appropriate to exposure to Cr(VI) where a\nwidely used chemical like chromium may lead to exposures in\nmany kinds of firms in many industries but the processes used,\nexposures generated, and controls needed to achieve compliance\nmay be the same.” 71 Fed. Reg. 10,226. The Agency\nspecifically stated that “a given type of welding produces Cr(VI)\nexposures that are essentially the same . . . [and] it is appropriate\nto analyze such processes as a group.” Id. In light of OSHA’s\nstated reasons for utilizing the application group methodology,\nwe will not substitute another.\n\n        Also, we find that the application group methodology is\nconsistent with Lead. OSHA determined that technology did not\nexist that would permit certain welding operations to achieve\nexposure levels of 1 µg/m 3 without reliance on respirators. An\nemployer would thus be unable to achieve the PEL in those\noperations, regardless of whether the operations constituted all\nor a portion of the employer’s business. HRG would apparently\nhave us require OSHA to research all operations of all\nemployers with Cr(VI) exposure, including operations that do\nnot involve Cr(VI), to determine whether a typical firm could\nmeet the PEL in most of its operations. Such an interpretation\n\n                                 31\n\fwould severely hinder OSHA’s ability to regulate exposure to\ncommon toxins, a result that would appear to run afoul of\nHRG’s own interests. Furthermore, in a review of the lead\nstandard that followed its Lead decision, the D.C. Circuit upheld\na technological feasibility determination by OSHA that\nconsidered only the specific operations in leaded steel\nproduction that caused exposure to airborne lead. Am. Iron &\nSteel Inst. v. OSHA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565145\"><a href=\"/opinion/565145/united-states-court-of-appeals-district-of-columbia-circuit/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 983-86 (D.C. Cir. 1991). We\naccordingly conclude that it was appropriate for OSHA to\nconsider only those operations involving Cr(VI) exposure in\nassessing the technological feasibility of the proposed 1 µg/m 3\nPEL.\n\n        HRG also argues that the technological infeasibility\ndetermination with regard to welding was not supported by\nsubstantial evidence because the record demonstrates that most\nwelding operations could comply with the 1 µg/m 3 most of the\ntime without respirators. OSHA’s feasibility concerns regarding\nwelding focused on the common practices of stainless steel\nshielded metal arc welding (“SMAW”), and stainless steel\nwelding in confined spaces. HRG points to evidence in the\nrecord that “only” 22.3% of all stainless steel welders, and 29%\nof SMAW welders, would require respirators to meet a 1 µg/m 3\nPEL. See FEA at ES-34; 71 Fed. Reg. 10,335. HRG contends\nthat the record therefore demonstrates that the 1 µg/m 3 PEL is\nfeasible for all welding operations.\n\n       HRG’s argument is flawed for at least two reasons. First,\n\n                               32\n\fHRG asserts a novel rule for technological feasibility that has\nnever been applied by OSHA, nor recognized in any court.\nHRG twists the Lead methodology, and would have us require\nOSHA to find a PEL to be technologically feasible so long as a\nmajority of a typical employer’s workers performing an\noperation would not have to wear respirators. If this were the\nrule, no employer would be required to further remove toxins\nfrom the air, or further limit employee presence in contaminated\nair, so long as exposure could be kept at or below a PEL with\n49% of the employees wearing respirators.\n\n       Neither the Lead decision nor logic support HRG’s\nposition. In crafting its feasibility rule in Lead, the D.C. Circuit\naccepted OSHA’s hierarchy of compliance controls and simply\nincorporated them into a manageable standard of proof. This\nhierarchy, the same one at issue here, strongly disfavors\nrespirators as “an ineffective, unreliable, and unsafe method of\nreducing employee exposure,” and generally restricts their use\nto supplementary, interim or short term purposes. 43 Fed.\nReg. 52,990; see Lead, 647 F.2d at 1205 n.12 (“This key\nprovision of the lead standard is based on OSHA’s view that\nrespirators are an inferior and inadequate means of protecting\nworkers.”).

This reliance is misplaced.\nIn Building and Construction, the D.C. Circuit upheld an\nasbestos PEL in which more than 90% of the affected workforce\nwould not be regularly required to wear respirators. 838 F.2d at\n1268. In ASARCO, the Ninth Circuit upheld an arsenic standard\nin which 11 of 16 smelters at issue could achieve the PEL with\n“with engineering and work practices and only very limited use\nof respirators,” and the remaining four could comply with\n“limited to moderate” respirator use. 746 F.2d at 496-97\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In neither case did OSHA\ndepart from its strong disfavor of respirators, nor did either court\nconstrain OSHA’s discretion with regard to technological\nfeasibility.\n\n                                34\n\f       Welders are not generally assigned to a particular\n       welding process. Instead, welders frequently\n       perform different types of welding on different\n       types of metals in different environments —\n       sometimes even during the same shift. [citing\n       comments from industry] For example, a welder\n       may spend part of his shift performing a task for\n       which exposures cannot be reduced below the\n       PEL, e.g., SMAW on stainless steel in a confined\n       space, and other parts of his shift performing\n       welding tasks for which exposures may be below\n       1 µg/m 3 .\n\nFEA at III-336. Furthermore, “workers performing different\nwelding tasks often work next to one another,” rendering it\n“impractical to separate employees on an operation by operation\nbasis.” Id. Accordingly,\n\n       Although a PEL of 1 µg/m 3 may be\n       technologically feasible for some less common\n       welding processes, the fact that welding is not\n       easily separated into high and low exposure\n       operations renders OSHA unable to conclude that\n       the proposed PEL of 1 µg/m 3 is technologically\n       feasible for any welding operations.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                              35\n\f       Thus, OSHA’s conclusion that a PEL of 1 µg/m 3 was\ntechnologically infeasible for welding operations is supported by\nsubstantial evidence, was adequately explained, and also\ncomports with both past practice and prior decisions.\n\n                    2. Aerospace Painting\n\n       HRG argues that OSHA’s conclusion that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL\nwould be infeasible for aerospace painting was flawed for two\nreasons. First, HRG again challenges the use of application\ngroups, asserting that the technological feasibility analysis was\nimproper because aerospace painting is an operation rather than\nan industry. This argument fails for the same reasons discussed\nabove.\n\n        HRG’s second argument is particularly confusing and\nequally unavailing. OSHA found that the painting of whole\naircraft or large aerospace structures, activities comprising\napproximately two thirds of aerospace painting, could not be\nconducted in compliance with either a 1 µg/m 3 PEL or a 5 µg/m 3\nPEL without reliance on respirators. FEA at III-337. OSHA\naccordingly built an exception into the final rule, whereby\nemployers engaged in these activities need only achieve airborne\nCr(VI) concentrations of 25 µg/m 3 through engineering and\nwork practice controls, and could rely on respirators to further\nreduce exposure to the 5 µg/m 3 PEL.                 29 C.F.R.\n§ 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii).\n\n\n\n                               36\n\f       HRG does not dispute OSHA’s conclusion that a majority\nof aerospace painting operations cannot achieve either a 1µg/m 3\nPELor a 5µg/m 3 PEL through engineering and work practice\ncontrols. Neither does HRG challenge OSHA’s explanation for\nthe aerospace painting exception. Instead, HRG argues that,\nbecause OSHA found it acceptable for one third of the workers\nin aerospace painting to wear respirators in order to comply with\na 5µg/m 3 PEL, the Agency was required to explain why more\nwidespread respirator use would not have been acceptable to\nsupport a 1µg/m 3 PEL.\n\n        This argument is illogical. OSHA carved out an\naerospace painting exception from its general rule disfavoring\nrespirators, a rule adopted for the benefit of workers, in order to\ninstitute a lower uniform PEL of 5µg/m 3 . In exercising its\ndiscretion to make this exception, OSHA had no obligation to\nexplain why it did not accept a greater deviation from the rule.\nSince HRG offers nothing to challenge the adequacy of OSHA’s\ndecision as explained in the record and written into the final\nrule, HRG’s argument pertaining to aerospace painting must\nfail.\n\n         3. Pigment, Catalyst, and Dye Production\n\n      HRG also challenges OSHA’s conclusion that the\nAgency could not prove the technological feasibility of a\n1 µg/m 3 PEL in the chromium pigment, catalyst, and dye\nproduction industries, industries that together accounted for only\n\n                                37\n\f469 workers in the feasibility analysis. OSHA identified\nenclosures which, when combined with ventilation systems,\ncould generally achieve Cr(VI) exposures of 1µg/m 3 or less.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,337. However, OSHA pointed to industry\nevidence that the ventilation systems could cause “significant\nand intolerable” product loss by extracting the fine powders that\ncontained Cr(VI). Id. OSHA also pointed to evidence that some\nplants, especially older facilities, would not be able to physically\naccommodate enclosures. Id. OSHA estimated that 44% or\nmore of the workers in these industries would require respirators\nto achieve 1µg/m 3 concentrations, and accordingly concluded\nthat it could not meet its burden to prove the technological\nfeasibility of a PEL set at that level. Id.\n\n        HRG argues that OSHA’s analysis of these three\nindustries was flawed because, in considering whether existing\nplants could physically accommodate available technology, the\nAgency improperly incorporated an economic consideration into\nthe technological analysis. Even if we were to conclude that\ntechnological feasibility requires OSHA to accept that\nemployers may be forced to alter or abandon their physical\nplants, OSHA also found that ventilation systems could cause\nintolerable product loss. This concern squarely involved the\nsuitability of available technology.     Moreover, the 469\nemployees at issue were a minute portion of the 312,169\nemployees in operations where a 1µg/m 3 PEL was not deemed\nfeasible, and their exclusion from consideration would have\nbeen immaterial. We therefore will not disturb OSHA’s\n\n                                38\n\ftechnological feasibility analysis as it pertains to the chromium\npigment, catalyst, and dye production industries.\n\n                4. Electroplating Job Shops\n\n       HRG argues that OSHA’s determination that a 1µg/m 3\nPEL was economically infeasible for the electroplating job shop\nindustry was neither supported by substantial evidence nor\nadequately explained. Electroplating job shops are facilities that\nperform electroplating services for other persons or businesses.\nAs discussed above, OSHA reached its infeasibility\ndetermination upon finding and explaining that costs of\ncompliance would amount to 2.7 percent of revenues and\n65 percent of profits, and that costs of compliance would be\nsimilar across various types of plating shops. On this analysis,\nOSHA concluded that the proposed 1 µg/m 3 PEL would “alter\nthe competitive structure of the industry.” 71 Fed. Reg. 10,301.\n\n       HRG bases its argument on part of a single statement by\nOSHA that the costs of compliance “might not be passed\nforward, particularly by older and less profitable segments of the\nindustry.” Id. at 10,301-02. HRG asserts that this statement\nderives from improper speculation that some marginal firms\nmight suffer, and economic feasibility allows that certain\nmarginal firms might fail.\n\n       HRG paints an incomplete picture of OSHA’s economic\nanalysis. OSHA determined that the estimated costs to job shop\n\n                               39\n\felectroplaters of 2.7% of revenues was more than the Agency\nhad deemed economically feasible under previous health\nstandards, and was well in excess of the sector’s average annual\nnominal price increase of 1.6%. FEA at V-94. OSHA also\ndetermined that it would be unable to mitigate costs through\nlonger phase-in times or a greater reliance on respirators,\ntechniques that had been used in the past to address economic\ndifficulties where costs might otherwise have been in excess of\n2% of revenues. Id. OSHA further found that the costs for\ncompliance would be approximately equal across different types\nof job shops. Factoring in these costs, OSHA stated that “a\nprice increase that would assure continued profitability for the\nentire industry would require almost tripling the annual nominal\nprice increase.” Id. (emphasis added). It is clear from the\nrecord that OSHA considered and explained how costs would\naffect the job shop electroplating industry as a whole, and was\nwithin its discretion to conclude that a 1 µg/m 3 PEL would alter\nthe competitive structure of the industry.\n\n                       B. Uniform PEL\n\n       HRG argues that the uniform PEL of 5 µg/m 3 must be set\naside on two grounds. First, HRG claims that evidence in the\nrecord demonstrates that the feasibility problems of a 1µg/m 3\nPEL noted by OSHA, even if correct, only affect a minority of\nall exposed workers, and the lower PEL should therefore have\nbeen selected. According to HRG, at most only 107,380 of the\n558,431 exposed employees worked in operations where the\n\n                               40\n\flower PEL is infeasible, counting 67,000 workers performing\nstainless steel SMAW welding, 3,921 in aerospace painting,\n2,590 in hard chrome electroplating, 33,400 in electroplating job\nshops, and 469 workers in pigment, catalyst, and dye production.\nTo the contrary, OSHA concluded that 312,169 employees\nworked in operations where the lower PEL was not deemed\nfeasible: 270,000 in welding, 33,400 in electroplating job\nshops, 8,300 in aerospace painting, and 469 in pigment, catalyst,\nand dye production.\n\n       Welding accounts for a dispositive difference of 203,000\nworkers between the opposing figures. HRG contends that only\nstainless steel SMAW welders should be included in the\nnumber. As discussed above, OSHA explained and sufficiently\nsupported its conclusion that a 1µg/m 3 PEL is infeasible for all\nwelding operations because welding is not readily segregated\ninto high and low exposure operations. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,336;\nFEA at III-337. HRG offers no explanation to justify its lower\nfigure for aerospace painters, and does not explain why it did\nnot include workers engaged in enclosed space welding.\n\n       Second, HRG contends that the selection of a uniform\nPEL for all industries, where many industries can accommodate\na lower PEL, is contrary to law and past practice. HRG points\nto OSHA’s final lead standard, which HRG claims implemented\ndifferent PELs to accommodate different technological\nfeasibility findings in certain industries. HRG claims that the\nlead standard incorporates a 50 µg/m 3 PEL for large foundries,\n\n                               41\n\fand a 75 µg/m 3 PEL for smaller foundries and the brass and\nbronze ingot industry. HRG argues that OSHA should have\naccordingly adopted separate PELs to achieve the lowest\nexposures feasible for each industry or operation.\n\n        HRG mischaracterizes the lead standard and OSHA’s\npast practice. It is true that, based on feasibility concerns,\nOSHA made special allowances in amendments to the lead\nstandard for small foundries and the brass and bronze ingot\nindustries. 55 Fed. Reg. 3,146 (Jan. 30, 1990); 60 Fed.\nReg. 52,856 (Oct. 11, 1995). However, these allowances only\npertain to the time for compliance, and to the exposure level the\nindustries were required to meet through engineering and work\nprocess controls alone. 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1025(e). The standard\nexpressly provides that “[w]here engineering and work practice\ncontrols do not reduce employee exposure at or below the\n50 µg/m 3 [PEL], the employer shall supplement these controls\nwith respirators . . . .” Id. § 1910.1025(e)(2). Thus, all\nemployers are subject to a single, universal PEL of 50 µg/m 3 .\nId. § 1910.1025(c). We fail to see how the respirator exceptions\nOSHA made in the lead standard are any different functionally\nfrom the exceptions the Agency made for aerospace painting in\nthe instant Cr(VI) standard. See 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1026(f)(1)(ii).\n\n       In fact, uniform PELs for the control of occupational\nexposure to airborne toxins have been the rule in OSHA\nstandards.    E.g. 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1001(c) (asbestos);\n1910.1017(c) (vinyl chloride); 1910.1018(c) (inorganic arsenic);\n\n                               42\n\f1910.1028 (benzene); 1910.1048(c) (formaldehyde);\n1910.1051(c) (1,3-butadiene); 1910.1052(c) (methylene\nchloride). As it had similarly done in other standards, the\nAgency recently explained that it set the PEL for methylene\nchloride at the “lowest level for which OSHA c[ould] currently\ndocument feasibility across the affected application groups and\nindustries.” 62 Fed. Reg. 1,575 (Nov. 22, 2006). HRG provides\nno argument explaining why the Agency’s longstanding\ninterpretation of its responsibilities under section 655(b)(5)\nshould not be afforded Chevron deference. Nor does HRG point\nto a single case in which a court invalidated a uniform PEL on\ngrounds that certain industries could comply with a more\nrestrictive standard.5\n\n\n    5\n     HRG argues that two cases, Building and Construction\nTrades Deptartment, AFL CIO v.

Cir. 1974), impose a burden on\nOSHA to explain why it is adopting a uniform PEL when\nsignificant risk could be feasibly be eliminated in certain\nindustries. Hodgson merely states that OSHA is “authorized” to\nstructure standards according to “the compliance capabilities of\nvarious industries.” 499 F.2d at 480 n.31. Brock stands only for\nthe proposition that an enforcement efficiency justification in\nsupport of uniform regulatory treatment “seems to completely\ndisappear” when the subcategory at issue consisted of\n“93 percent of affected workers.” 838 F.2d at 1273. Moreover,\neven if OSHA had some special burden of explanation, HRG\nfails to demonstrate why the Agency’s asserted reasons for\n\n                              43\n\f        OSHA’s decision to select a uniform exposure limit is a\nlegislative policy decision that we will uphold as long as it was\nreasonably drawn from the record. See AISI, 577 F.2d at 833.\nOSHA acknowledges that a lower PEL was feasible for certain\nindustries representing a minority of exposed workers.\nHowever, the Agency provided ample reasons for selecting a\nuniform standard. OSHA explained that multiple PELs would\ncreate an “enormous evidentiary burden,” and associated\nimplementation delays, in order for the Agency to define the\nprecise situations under which employers would be required to\nmeet a lower PEL.6 71 Fed. Reg. 10,338. OSHA further\nexplained that multiple PELs would create compliance and\nenforcement problems because many workplaces, and even\nindividual workers, are subject to multiple categories of Cr(VI)\nexposure. This would make it “virtually impossible to\ndistinguish exposures from one source versus the other.” Id.\n\n\nadopting a uniform PEL were factually unsupported or legally\ninadequate.\n    6\n      HRG argues that OSHA’s existing feasibility analysis\nalready contains the information necessary to identify which\nactivities should be subject to a lower PEL. However, OSHA\nexplained that the “definitional and line drawing problem is far\nless significant when OSHA uses a unit of industries and\noperations for analytical but not compliance purposes,” because\nthe “consequences of imprecise classifications” for compliance\npurposes “would become much more significant.” 71 Fed.\nReg. 10,338.\n\n                               44\n\fOSHA concluded that “a uniform PEL will ultimately make the\nstandard more effective by” facilitating employer understanding\nand compliance, and enhancing OSHA’s ability “to provide\nclear guidance to the regulated community and identify\nnon-compliant conditions.” Id.\n\n       In light of OSHA’s stated reasons for adopting a uniform\nPEL, and the Agency’s similar practice in prior standards, we\nconclude that OSHA’s decision was reasonably drawn from the\nrecord. While HRG may provide reasons to disagree with\nOSHA, it provides no grounds upon which we could conclude\nthat the agency operated outside of its discretion in\nimplementing section 655(b)(5).\n\n                       C. Action Level\n\n       HRG argues that OSHA did not adequately explain why\nit set the “action level”, the level that triggers additional\nmonitoring and surveillance obligations, at one half of the PEL.\nSee 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1026(b), (d)(2)(iii), 1926.1126(b),\n(d)(2)(iii). HRG argues that this action level was unjustified\ngiven the significant risks to employee health that remain at both\nthe PEL and one half of the PEL. HRG points to no case in\nwhich a court invalidated the action level of a previous standard.\n\n      OSHA explained that, given the variable nature of Cr(VI)\nconcentrations in workplaces, the action level is a tool that\n“provides increased assurance that employees will not be\n\n                               45\n\fexposed to Cr(VI) at levels above the PEL on days when no\nexposure measurements are made in the workplace.” 71 Fed.\nReg. 10,331. By setting the level at one half of the PEL, the\naction level also “effectively encourages employers, where\nfeasible, to reduce exposures below the action level to avoid the\nadded costs of required compliance with provisions triggered by\nthe action level.” Id. at 10,332. Set as it is, OSHA explained\nthat the action level provides a “very real and necessary further\nreduction in risk beyond that provided by the PEL alone.” Id.\nOSHA adopted this practice in the Cr(VI) standard after\n“successful experience with an action level of one-half the PEL\nin other standards.” Id. at 10,331. See, e.g., 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 1910.18 (inorganic arsenic); 1910.1047 (ethylene oxide);\n1910.1028 (benzene); 1910.1052 (methylene chloride). OSHA\npointed to numerous comments on the proposed rule, from\nindustry and labor, submitted in support of its selected action\nlevel. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,331.\n\n        Much like the selection of an exposure level, selection of\nan action level is primarily a legislative policy decision that we\nwill uphold so long as it was reasonably drawn from the record.\nSee AISI, 577 F.2d at 833. To the extent the decision may have\nrelied on factual findings, we will not disturb those findings as\nlong as they are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C.\n§ 655(f). OSHA has no statutory obligation to implement action\nlevels, but has developed the concept as a means to promulgate\nmore effective standards. As OSHA explained, one reason for\nimplementing the action level was to provide confidence that\n\n                               46\n\fday-to-day exposures do not exceed the PEL. The action level\nis also intended to encourage employers to reduce employee\nexposure below the PEL where possible. As for setting the level\nat one-half of the PEL, OSHA explained that it followed a\npractice it had found successful in prior standards, and identified\ndiverse comments in the record supporting its approach.\n\n       We conclude that it is eminently reasonable for OSHA to\nbase a tool for PEL compliance on the PEL, and that the past\nexperience and positive comments cited by OSHA provide\nsubstantial evidence in support of the chosen action level. We\nwill accordingly not disturb the Agency’s decision.\n\n               D. Employee Notification Level\n\n        The Cr(VI) standard requires an employer to notify an\nemployee whenever monitoring results indicate that the\nemployee was exposed to Cr(VI) levels in excess of the 5 µg/m 3\nPEL. 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1026(d)(4), 1926.1126(d)(4). The\nproposed rule would have required an employer to notify an\nemployee of all monitoring results. 69 Fed. Reg. 59,450-51.\nHRG argues that OSHA’s decision not to adopt the proposed\nrule and, instead, to set the notification level at the PEL is\narbitrary and unexplained.\n\n       OSHA argues that the notification trigger complies\nprecisely with a statutory requirement for employers to notify\nemployees of exposure to toxins “at levels which exceed those\n\n                                47\n\fprescribed by an applicable [OSHA] standard.” 29 U.S.C.\n§ 657(c)(3). OSHA also contends that its general record access\nstandard provides all employees the right to access their records,\nthus permitting them to discover monitoring results on their\nown. See 29 C.F.R. § 1910.1020(e)(1)(i) (“Whenever an\nemployee . . . requests access to a record, the employer shall\nassure that access is provided in a reasonable time, place, and\nmanner.”). OSHA further argues that it opened the notification\nissue up to comment, and that the final rule was more protective\nthan the proposed rule because the final rule expanded the\nmonitoring requirements to include shipyards and construction.\nFinally, OSHA asserts that the Cr(VI) standard requires all\nemployers to educate affected employees about the risks of\nCr(VI) exposure. See 29 C.F.R. 1910.1020.\n\n        While all of these arguments may be true, they are beside\nthe point. OSHA does not deny that the final Cr(VI) standard\ndeparted significantly from the notification requirement of the\nproposed standard, or that every prior standard that required\nmonitoring also required the employers to notify their employees\nof all monitoring results. E.g., 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1001(d)(7)(i)\n(asbestos); 1910.1017(n) (vinyl chloride); 1910.1018(e)(5)(i)\n(inorganic arsenic); 1910.1025(d)(8)(i) (lead). While we\nrecognize that OSHA operates with substantial discretion in\npromulgating standards, rules, and decisions, the Agency must\nalways include a statement of its reasons for any such action in\nthe Federal Register. 29 U.S.C. § 655(e). We are particularly\ncurious as to OSHA’s reasons for setting the notification level\n\n                               48\n\fat the PEL, since the Agency does not deny that this decision\ndeparts from both its proposed rule and its past practice.\n\n       In its brief and at oral argument, OSHA failed to point us\nto a statement in the record justifying the altered notification\nrequirement, or attempt to explain the agency’s reasoning.\nWhile we find extensive discussion in the Federal Register\nregarding the methods employers may use to measure exposure,\nand a discussion of the notification requirement in its final form,\nwe find no explanation for why OSHA replaced the proposed\nnotification requirement. See 71 Fed. Reg. 10,339-43. OSHA\naccordingly failed to provide a statement of reasons for its\nactions as required by section 655(e), and we will accordingly\ngrant HRG’s petition on this ground.7\n\n                     V.

EEI argues:\n(1) OSHA impermissibly relied on medical data from other\nindustries to establish the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds in\nelectric plants; (2) OSHA’s decision not to exempt electric\nplants from the Cr(VI) standard is not supported by substantial\nevidence; (3) OSHA’s conclusion that the Cr(VI) standard is\nfeasible for coal and nuclear electric plants is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence; and (4) the standard is arbitrary and\ncapricious because OSHA failed to address conflicts with other\nregulatory requirements. For the reasons stated below, we will\ndeny EEI’s petition on all grounds.\n\n   A. Toxicity of Cr(VI) Compounds in Electric Power\n                         Plants\n\n        EEI challenges OSHA’s reliance on the Gibb and\nLuippold cohorts, studies drawn from the chromate production\nindustry, to establish the toxicity of the Cr(VI) compounds\nfound in electric power plants. EEI points to portions of a\nstatement by Dr. Herman Gibb, of the Gibb study, suggesting\nthat the relative toxicity of different forms of Cr(VI) compounds\nencountered in different industries may vary. (See Ex. 47-8,\nPost-Hearing Comments From Herman Gibb on the Proposed\nHexavalent Chromium Rule, Mar. 21, 2005 (“Gibb\nComments”)). EEI also points to two cases, Texas Independent\nGinners Ass’n v.

OSHA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663175\"><a href=\"/opinion/663175/color-pigments-manufacturers-association-inc-fka-dry-color/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1994), to support its assertion that evidence\nof health risks in one industry may not be relied on to establish\nhealth risks in a second industry. EEI identifies no evidence, in\nthe record or otherwise, suggesting that Cr(VI) compounds\nencountered in electric power plants are any less carcinogenic\nthan Cr(VI) compounds encountered in chromate production.\n\n        In reaching a conclusion as to the existence of significant\nrisk, OSHA need not calculate risk with mathematical precision,\nnor does the substantial evidence standard require the Agency to\nsupport its risk determination “with anything approaching\nscientific certainty.” Benzene, 448 U.S. at 655-56. Under the\n“best available evidence” standard, “so long as they are\nsupported by a body of reputable scientific thought, the Agency\nis free to use conservative assumptions in interpreting the data\nwith respect to carcinogens, risking error on the side of\noverprotection rather than underprotection.” Id. at 656.\n\n       During rulemaking, OSHA considered arguments that\nrisk estimates derived from Cr(VI) compounds found in the\nchromate production industry were not applicable to other\nindustries. 71 Fed. Reg. 10,334. However, OSHA ultimately\ndetermined that “all Cr(VI) compounds” are carcinogenic, and\nthat the risk estimates derived from the Gibb and Luippold\ncohorts were “reasonably representative of the risks expected\nfrom equivalent exposures to different Cr(VI) compounds in\nother industries.” Id. During rulemaking, the Agency\n\n                                51\n\fspecifically asked for Dr. Gibb’s opinion on this precise matter\nthrough a post-hearing question. Dr. Gibb’s response, taken in\nits entirety, provides no support for EEI’s position:\n\n       Should the exposure response observed in the\n       chromium chemical production worker studies be\n       restricted to setting a PEL only for the chemical\n       production industry?\n\n       Answer: It is conceivable that differences in\n       exposure (e.g. practical size, nature of the aerosol,\n       etc) between some industries (e.g. steel,\n       aerospace, lead chromate pigment production) and\n       the chromium chemical production industry could\n       lead to differences in cancer risk, but the\n       available data are inadequate to evaluate whether\n       such differences exist . . . . It is unlikely that\n       adequate studies of all industries affected by this\n       proposed rule will ever be conducted. In the\n       absence of more definitive information regarding\n       specific industries, it is prudent to regard\n       exposure to any hexavalent chromium compound\n       as presenting an excess lung cancer risk and that\n       the exposure response observed in the chromium\n       chemicals production industry should apply to\n       other industries with occupational exposure to\n       hexavalent chromium.\n\n\n\n                                52\n\f(Gibb Comments at 5 (emphasis added).)\n\n       In explaining its final risk determinations regarding\nCr(VI), OSHA stated that “the Gibb cohort and the Luippold\ncohort, were found to be the strongest data sets for quantitative\nassessment” because, in part, the “two had the most extensive\nand best documented Cr(VI) exposures spanning three or four\ndecades.” 71 Fed. Reg. 10,176. Dr. Gibb’s comments bolster\nOSHA’s conclusion that the Agency based its health risk\ndetermination on the “best quantitative estimates of excess\nlifetime lung cancer risks” available. Id. at 10,220. To the\nextent that OSHA’s reliance on these estimates might\nconceivably have been conservative, Benzene permits the\nAgency to risk error on the side of overprotection. Since\nDr. Gibb expressly recommended that OSHA rely on the\nchromate production studies to establish the toxicity of Cr(VI)\ncompounds generally, his testimony is of no help to EEI.\n\n        EEI’s reliance on Color Pigments and Texas Independent\nis also misplaced. EEI points to portions of both cases in which\nthe relevant issue was not the inherent toxicity of certain\ncompounds, but the amounts of known toxins encountered in\ndifferent industries. There is no dispute here that different\noperations naturally generate different concentrations of Cr(VI).\nThe Cr(VI) standard accounts for these differences by requiring\nall employers to comply with a uniform exposure limit.\n\n\n\n\n                               53\n\f        In Texas Independent, the cotton dust standard at issue\ndid not establish an exposure limit or require employers to limit\ncotton dust emissions. See Texas Independent, 630 F.2d at 403.\nOSHA did not measure exposure levels in the cotton gin\nindustry, but sought to impose medical surveillance\nrequirements on that industry on the basis of negative health\neffects observed in cotton textile manufacturing processes. Id.\nat 409. The court determined that OSHA’s risk assessment\nlacked substantial evidence because the concentration of cotton\ndust in cotton gin operations was “substantially lower” than the\nconcentrations encountered in cotton manufacturing. Id. at 409.\nThus, the disputed issue was the amount of occupational\nexposure to a particular substance in disparate industries, not the\ntoxicity of the substance itself.\n\n       Color Pigments is similarly inapplicable. OSHA’s\ntechnological feasibility analysis for the cadmium standard at\nissue was based upon the extent to which employers could\nreduce toxin concentrations below an initial exposure level.\n16 F.3d at 1162-63. Proper calculation of the initial exposure\nlevel in a given industry was therefore “vital.” Id. at 1163.\nOSHA established the initial exposure level in the chemical\nmixer industry by using data captured from the dry color\nformulator industry. Id. at 1162. The court ruled that this\nmethodology was inadequate because OSHA failed to account\nfor variables between the industries that would affect the\namount of cadmium to which employees were exposed. Id.\nThus, the disputed issue was again the level of exposure to a\n\n                                54\n\ftoxic substance in disparate industries, not the toxicity of the\nsubstance itself.\n\n       EEI identifies no case in which a court faulted OSHA for\nusing medical data derived from one industry to establish the\ntoxicity of a substance generally. In fact, in another portion of\nthe Color Pigments decision, the Eleventh Circuit rejected an\nargument that mirrors the one made here by EEI. The cadmium\npigment industry argued that OSHA should have excluded it\nfrom the cadmium standard because exposure to cadmium\npigment was allegedly “less toxic and carcinogenic[] than other\nforms of cadmium.” Id. at 1161. The court disagreed:\n\n       Given the absence of definiteness on the issue, the\n       volume of evidence that points at least implicitly\n       to the dangers of cadmium pigments, and the\n       serious potential health risks present if cadmium\n       exposure is as great in pigment form as in other\n       compounds, we believe that OSHA was justified\n       in choosing to include cadmium pigments in the\n       PEL, despite the existence of an equally rational\n       alternative.\n\nId. EEI’s argument is no more availing.\n\n       OSHA’s conclusion that health risk data derived from the\nchromate production industry was sufficient to establish the\ntoxicity of Cr(VI) compounds generally is supported by the best\n\n                               55\n\favailable evidence and by substantial evidence.        We will\ntherefore not disturb the Agency’s decision.\n\n          B. Exemption for Electric Power Plants\n\n        EEI also argues that, even assuming that Cr(VI)\ncompounds encountered in electric plants are carcinogenic, the\nconcentrations of such compounds in electric plants are so low\nas to warrant a general exemption from the standard. OSHA\ndenied EEI’s request for such an exemption during rulemaking.\n71 Fed. Reg. 10,330-31. EEI argues that the amount of Cr(VI)\ncontained in “fly ash,” a residue of coal combustion encountered\nduring the maintenance and repair of boilers in coal-fired\nelectric plants, results in exposure levels that are below the\nAgency’s exemption level. See FEA at II-24. Because this\nargument does not pertain to welding, the only identified source\nof Cr(VI) exposure in nuclear plants, and an additional source\nin coal-fired plants, we consider the exemption argument to be\nlimited in scope to fly ash encountered in coal-fired plants.\n\n       EEI points to a statement by OSHA indicating that the\nCr(VI) content found in samples of fly ash provided to the\nAgency demonstrated that the worker exposure to Cr(VI) would\nbe “well below 0.5 µg/m 3 .” FEA at III-362. Under the final\nCr(VI) standard, any employer, including an employer operating\nan electric power plant, may be granted an exemption by\ndemonstrating with “objective data” that “a specific process,\noperation, or activity involving [Cr(VI)] cannot release dusts,\n\n                              56\n\ffumes, or mists of [Cr(VI)] in concentrations above 0.5 µg/m 3\n. . . under any expected conditions of use.” 29 C.F.R.\n§§ 1910.1026(a)(4), 1926.1126(a)(4). EEI argues that exposures\nto fly ash should have been completely exempted from the\nstandard during rulemaking under this same standard, just as\nexposures to portland cement were exempted in the final rule.\nSee id. § 1910.1026(a)(3).\n\n        OSHA asserts, and the record demonstrates, that the\nAgency only received nine samples of fly ash from EEI during\nrulemaking, despite there being more than 1,000 coal-fired\nelectric plants in operation. Furthermore, EEI did not fully\nidentify the types of coal involved, or where the samples\noriginated. While the samples provided did indicate that\nexposures from fly ash would be low, OSHA explained that\nthere was insufficient evidence “to establish that all coal ash\nfrom all sources will necessarily have comparable Cr(VI)\ncontent [to the exempted portland cement].”            71 Fed.\n                                   8\nReg. 10,330-31 (emphasis added). This was in contrast to\ncomprehensive data pertaining to portland cement, which\ndemonstrated that employee exposures would be below\n0.3 µg/m 3 . Id. at 10,328.\n\n\n   8\n     In fact, one of the nine samples provided by EEI had a\nCr(VI) content of 45 micrograms per gram of fly ash. FEA at\nIII-361. In its brief, OSHA states that this translates to an\ninhalation exposure level of 0.675 µg/m 3 , above the exemption\nlevel of 0.5 µg/m 3 .\n\n                              57\n\f        In this argument, EEI does not deny that Cr(VI) is toxic,\nand that Cr(VI) is present in fly ash. The sole issue is whether\nthe evidence of Cr(VI) concentration levels in the record\nrequired the Agency to exempt all fly ash exposure in coal-fired\nelectric plants from the standard. OSHA is required to\npromulgate protective standards on the basis of the best\navailable evidence. The Agency rejected EEI’s requested\nexemption upon finding that the available evidence was\ninsufficient to demonstrate that employee exposure to Cr(VI)\nfrom fly ash would be sufficiently and uniformly low. OSHA’s\ndetermination that there was an insufficient basis for exemption\nis supported by substantial evidence in the record indicating that\nEEI only provided OSHA with nine samples of ash during\nrulemaking that were incompletely labeled. To the extent this\ndecision involved legislative policy decisions on the part of the\nAgency, we find it to be reasonably drawn from the record. We\nwill therefore not disturb the OSHA’s decision to deny a general\nexemption for fly ash exposures in coal-fired electric power\nplants.\n\n C. Feasibility of the Standard for Electric Power Plants\n\n       EEI argues that OSHA failed to prove that the Cr(VI)\nstandard is economically and technologically feasible for coal\nand nuclear electric utility power plants. First, EEI argues that\nOSHA failed to prove economic feasibility because it did not\nshow that the costs of compliance would be reasonably related\nto the benefits to be derived from employee protection. This\n\n                               58\n\fargument is predicated on a clear misstatement of law. EEI\nrelies on a concurring opinion by Justice Powell in Industrial\nUnion Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110340\"><a href=\"/opinion/110340/industrial-union-dept-afl-cio-v-american-petroleum-institute/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980), in which he argued for a proportionality\nrequirement. Id. at 663. The Court squarely rejected Justice\nPowell’s position the next year in American Textile\nManufacturer’s Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110527\"><a href=\"/opinion/110527/american-textile-mfrs-institute-inc-v-donovan/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981),\nafter reasoning that a “cost-benefit analysis on the issuance of\n§ 6(b)(5) standards would eviscerate the ‘to the extent feasible’\nrequirement.” Id. at 513. We therefore reject EEI’s argument\nwith regard to economic feasibility.9\n\n       Second, EEI devotes just over a page in its brief to argue\nthat OSHA made no findings regarding the technological\nfeasibility of the Cr(VI) standard in electric power generation\nplants. However, the record demonstrates that, for the purposes\nof assessing feasibility, OSHA included electric utilities within\n\n\n\n    9\n      In its reply brief, EEI adds an additional argument that\nOSHA’s cost estimates for welding were not appropriately\ntailored to the electric utility industry. During hearings, OSHA\nspecifically asked EEI to supply additional information to\nsupport its asserted cost figures, but EEI does not deny that it\nnever complied. Furthermore, EEI offers no argument or\nevidence that, under the correct standard for economic\nfeasibility, the costs of compliance would have threatened the\nexistence or altered the competitive structure of the electric\nutility industry.\n\n                               59\n\fthe welding applications group. FEA at II-24. EEI points to no\nevidence indicating that welding in electric utilities differs\nsubstantially from welding generally, but, in its reply brief, EEI\nattacks the application group methodology generally. As we\ndiscussed above in considering HRG’s similar argument, OSHA\nacted within its discretion to assess feasibility through use of\napplication groups. We will therefore not disturb OSHA’s\nfindings with regard to the feasibility of the Cr(VI) standard in\nthe electric utility industry.\n\n     D. Relationship of the Cr(VI) Standard to Other\n                       Regulations\n\n       EEI argues that OSHA failed to harmonize the Cr(VI)\nstandard with regulatory requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission (“NRC”), and OSHA’s own arsenic standard as it\napplies to fly ash.\n\n       With regard to workers in nuclear plants, EEI points to\n10 C.F.R. § 20.1101(b), which requires employers subject to\nNRC licenses to “use, to the extent practical, procedures and\nengineering controls based on sound radiation protection\nprinciples to achieve operational doses . . . that are as low as is\nreasonably achievable (ALARA).” Id. EEI contends that the\ncontrols required to comply with the new Cr(VI) standard would\nrisk increasing the time workers spend in radioactive areas,\nparticularly through use of respirators, and the total number of\nemployees exposed to radiation.          However, the record\n\n                                60\n\fdemonstrates that OSHA entered into an agreement with the\nNRC in 1988, which delineates jurisdiction regarding\noccupational safety and health at nuclear power plants.\nMemorandum of Understanding Between the U.S. NRC and\nOSHA, Oct. 21, 1988 (“MOU”). By the terms of the MOU,\nOSHA has jurisdiction to regulate “[p]lant conditions which\nresult in occupational risk, but do not affect the safety of\nlicensed radioactive materials,” conditions which might include\n“exposure to toxic nonradioactive materials and other industrial\nhazards in the workplace.” Id. Moreover, a regulatory guide\npublished by the NRC expressly provides that “if an NRC\nlicensee is using respiratory protection to protect workers\nagainst nonradiological hazards, the OSHA requirements apply.”\nNRC Regulatory Guide 8.15, Acceptable Programs for\nRespiratory Protection, Rev. 1, Oct. 1999. Thus, we conclude\nthat the Cr(VI) standard is fully compatible with NRC’s\nALARA requirement.\n\n        With regard to coal-fired power plants, EEI argues that\nOSHA failed to rectify the Cr(VI) standard with its existing\nstandard for inorganic arsenic, another toxin present in coal fly\nash. EEI points to language in the preamble of the arsenic\nstandard by which OSHA responded to EEI’s argument that coal\nplants should be exempt because exposure from cleaning boilers\nis “intermittent.” Occupational Exposure to Inorganic Arsenic,\n48 Fed. Reg. 1,864, 1,895 (Jan. 14, 1983). OSHA found no\nbasis to exclude the plants from the standard, but stated “[i]f it\nis a maintenance operation with intermittent exposures, the\n\n                               61\n\farsenic standard indicates that a good respirator program with\nsign posting, training, and hygiene facilities . . . may be an\nappropriate control strategy. If exposures are continuous,\nadditional control strategies would be appropriate.” Id. at 1985.\n\n        EEI contends that, by this language, OSHA excluded coal\npower plants from the arsenic standard’s requirement to\nmaintain regulated areas and to comply with certain\nhousekeeping standards. See 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1018(f), (g). In\nview of OSHA’s alleged past practice regarding toxins in fly\nash, EEI contends that it was therefore inexplicable and arbitrary\nfor the Agency to include maintenance and repair activities in\nelectric plants in the general industry provisions of the Cr(VI)\nstandard. EEI contends that the construction provisions of the\nCr(VI) standard, which do not include regulated area and\nhousekeeping requirements, would have been more appropriate.\n\n        OSHA flatly denies that the arsenic regulations contain\nany exemption for electric utilities with regard to maintenance\nand repair work. We note that both the arsenic standard and the\ngeneral industry provisions of the Cr(VI) standard contain\nvirtually identical requirements for regulated areas and\nhousekeeping. Compare 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.1018(f), (g) with\n§§ 1910.1026(e), (j). Nothing in the text of the arsenic\nregulations indicates that electric utilities are subject to an\nexemption, and we find EEI’s reliance on the language in the\npreamble to be unconvincing.\n\n\n\n                               62\n\f       Moreover, even if electric plants were required to do\nmore to control fly ash under the Cr(VI) standard, EEI identifies\nno legal basis for this Court to disturb a standard merely because\ntwo disparately regulated toxins happen to exist in a single\nsubstance found in a workplace. Each standard was written to\nmitigate the risks of a different hazardous substance, and we fail\nto see why it would be at all improper for OSHA to expect an\nemployer to comply with the more restrictive standard.\n\n                         VI. Remedy\n\n        Because we conclude that OSHA failed to provide a\nstatement of its reasons for setting the employee exposure\nnotification level at the PEL, we must select an appropriate\nremedy. Where, as here, the only identified defect in a standard\nis the lack of an adequate statement of reasons, the appropriate\ncourse of action is to remand the matter to OSHA for further\nconsideration and explanation, without disturbing the rule itself.\nAFL-CIO v.
