Branch Ministries and \nits pastor, Dan Little, challenge the revocation on the \ngrounds that (1) the Service acted beyond its statutory au-\nthority, (2) the revocation violated its right to the free exer-\ncise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment and the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, and (3) it was the victim \nof selective prosecution in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  \nBecause these objections are without merit, we affirm the \ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment to the Service.\n\n                          I. Background\n\nA.   Taxation of Churches\n\n     The Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\") exempts certain orga-\nnizations from taxation, including those organized and operat-\ned for religious purposes, provided that they do not engage in \ncertain activities, including involvement in \"any political cam-\n\npaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for \npublic office.\"  26 U.S.C. s 501(a), (c)(3) (1994).  Contribu-\ntions to such organizations are also deductible from the \ndonating taxpayer's taxable income.  Id. s 170(a).  Although \nmost organizations seeking tax-exempt status are required to \napply to the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\" or \"Service\") \nfor an advance determination that they meet the require-\nments of section 501(c)(3), id. s 508(a), a church may simply \nhold itself out as tax exempt and receive the benefits of that \nstatus without applying for advance recognition from the IRS.  \nId. s 508(c)(1)(A).\n\n     The IRS maintains a periodically updated \"Publication No. \n78,\" in which it lists all organizations that have received a \nruling or determination letter confirming the deductibility of \ncontributions made to them.  See Rev. Proc. 82-39, 1982-1 \nC.B. 759, ss 2.01, 2.03.  Thus, a listing in that publication will \nprovide donors with advance assurance that their contribu-\ntions will be deductible under section 170(a).  If a listed \norganization has subsequently had its tax-exempt status re-\nvoked, contributions that are made to it by a donor who is \nunaware of the change in status will generally be treated as \ndeductible if made on or before the date that the revocation is \npublicly announced.  Id. s 3.01.  Donors to a church that has \nnot received an advance determination of its tax-exempt \nstatus may also deduct their contributions;  but in the event \nof an audit, the taxpayer will bear the burden of establishing \nthat the church meets the requirements of section 501(c)(3).  \nSee generally id. s 3.04;  Rev. Proc. 80-24, 1980-1 C.B. 658, \ns 6 (discussing taxpayers' obligations in seeking a ruling or \ndetermination letter).\n\n     The unique treatment churches receive in the Internal \nRevenue Code is further reflected in special restrictions on \nthe IRS's ability to investigate the tax status of a church.  \nThe Church Audit Procedures Act (\"CAPA\") sets out the \ncircumstances under which the IRS may initiate an investiga-\ntion of a church and the procedures it is required to follow in \nsuch an investigation.  26 U.S.C. s 7611.  Upon a \"reason-\nable belief\" by a high-level Treasury official that a church \nmay not be exempt from taxation under section 501, the IRS \n\n\fmay begin a \"church tax inquiry.\"  Id. s 7611(a).  A church \ntax inquiry is defined, rather circularly, as\n\n     any inquiry to a church (other than an examination) to \n     serve as a basis for determining whether a church-\n     \n          (A) is exempt from tax under section 501(a) by reason \n     of its status as a church, or\n     \n          (B) is ... engaged in activities which may be subject \n     to taxation....\n     \nId. s 7611(h)(2).  If the IRS is not able to resolve its con-\ncerns through a church tax inquiry, it may proceed to the \nsecond level of investigation:  a \"church tax examination.\"  In \nsuch an examination, the IRS may obtain and review the \nchurch's records or examine its activities \"to determine \nwhether [the] organization claiming to be a church is a church \nfor any period.\"  Id. s 7611(b)(1)(A), (B).\n\nB.   Factual and Procedural History\n\n     Branch Ministries, Inc. operates the Church at Pierce \nCreek (\"Church\"), a Christian church located in Binghamton, \nNew York.  In 1983, the Church requested and received a \nletter from the IRS recognizing its tax-exempt status.  On \nOctober 30, 1992, four days before the presidential election, \nthe Church placed full-page advertisements in USA Today \nand the Washington Times.  Each bore the headline \"Chris-\ntians Beware\" and asserted that then-Governor Clinton's \npositions concerning abortion, homosexuality, and the distri-\nbution of condoms to teenagers in schools violated Biblical \nprecepts.  The following appeared at the bottom of each \nadvertisement:\n\n     This advertisement was co-sponsored by the Church at \n     Pierce Creek, Daniel J. Little, Senior Pastor, and by \n     churches and concerned Christians nationwide.  Tax-\n     deductible donations for this advertisement gladly ac-\n     cepted.  Make donations to:  The Church at Pierce \n     Creek.  [mailing address].\nAppendix (\"App.\") at Tab 5, Ex. E.\n\n     The advertisements did not go unnoticed.  They produced \nhundreds of contributions to the Church from across the \n\ncountry and were mentioned in a New York Times article and \nan Anthony Lewis column which stated that the sponsors of \nthe advertisement had almost certainly violated the Internal \nRevenue Code.  Peter Applebome, Religious Right Intensi-\nfies Campaign for Bush, N.Y. Times, Oct. 31, 1992, at A1;  \nAnthony Lewis, Tax Exempt Politics?, N.Y. Times, Dec. 1, \n1992, at A15.\n\n     The advertisements also came to the attention of the \nRegional Commissioner of the IRS, who notified the Church \non November 20, 1992 that he had authorized a church tax \ninquiry based on \"a reasonable belief ... that you may not be \ntax-exempt or that you may be liable for tax\" due to political \nactivities and expenditures.  Letter from Cornelius J. Cole-\nman, IRS Regional Commissioner, to The Church at Pierce \nCreek (Nov. 20, 1992), reprinted in App. at Tab 5, Ex. F.  \nThe Church denied that it had engaged in any prohibited \npolitical activity and declined to provide the IRS with certain \ninformation the Service had requested.  On February 11, \n1993, the IRS informed the Church that it was beginning a \nchurch tax examination.  Following two unproductive meet-\nings between the parties, the IRS revoked the Church's \nsection 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status on January 19, 1995, citing \nthe newspaper advertisements as prohibited intervention in a \npolitical campaign.\n\n     The Church and Pastor Little (collectively, \"Church\") com-\nmenced this lawsuit soon thereafter.  This had the effect of \nsuspending the revocation of the Church's tax exemption until \nthe district court entered its judgment in this case.  See 26 \nU.S.C. s 7428(c).  The Church challenged the revocation of \nits tax-exempt status, alleging that the IRS had no authority \nto revoke its tax exemption, that the revocation violated its \nright to free speech and to freely exercise its religion under \nthe First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct of 1993, 42 U.S.C. s 2000bb (1994) (\"RFRA\"), and that \nthe IRS engaged in selective prosecution in violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  After \nallowing discovery on the Church's selective prosecution \nclaim, Branch Ministries, Inc. v. Richardson, 970 F. Supp. 11 \n(D.D.C. 1997), the district court granted summary judgment \n\n\fin favor of the IRS.  Branch Ministries, Inc. v. Rossotti, 40 \nF. Supp. 2d 15 (D.D.C. 1999).\n\n     The Church filed a timely appeal, and we have jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. s 1291.  We review summary judg-\nment decisions de novo, see Everett v. United States, 158 F.3d \n1364, 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1132 (1999), \nand will affirm only if there is no genuine issue as to any \nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n                           II. Analysis\n\n     The Church advances a number of arguments in support of \nits challenges to the revocation.  We examine only those that \nwarrant analysis.\n\nA.   The Statutory Authority of the IRS\n\n     The Church argues that, under the Internal Revenue Code, \nthe IRS does not have the statutory authority to revoke the \ntax-exempt status of a bona fide church.  It reasons as \nfollows:  section 501(c)(3) refers to tax-exempt status for \nreligious organizations, not churches;  section 508, on the \nother hand, specifically exempts \"churches\" from the require-\nment of applying for advance recognition of tax-exempt sta-\ntus, id. s 508(c)(1)(A);  therefore, according to the Church, its \ntax-exempt status is derived not from section 501(c)(3), but \nfrom the lack of any provision in the Code for the taxation of \nchurches.  The Church concludes from this that it is not \nsubject to taxation and that the IRS is therefore powerless to \nplace conditions upon or to remove its tax-exempt status as a \nchurch.\n\n     We find this argument more creative than persuasive.  The \nsimple answer, of course, is that whereas not every religious \norganization is a church, every church is a religious organiza-\ntion.  More to the point, irrespective of whether it was \nrequired to do so, the Church applied to the IRS for an \nadvance determination of its tax-exempt status.  The IRS \ngranted that recognition and now seeks to withdraw it.  \nCAPA gives the IRS this power.\n\n\f     That statute, which pertains exclusively to churches, pro-\nvides authority for revocation of the tax-exempt status of a \nchurch through its references to other sections of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code.  The section of CAPA entitled \"Limita-\ntions on revocation of tax-exempt status, etc.\" provides that \nthe Secretary [of the Treasury] may \"determine that an orga-\nnization is not a church which [ ] (i) is exempt from taxation \nby reason of section 501(a), or (ii) is described in section \n170(c).\"  26 U.S.C. s 7611(d)(1)(A)(i), (ii).  Both of these \nsections condition tax-exempt status on non-intervention in \npolitical campaigns.  Section 501(a) states that \"[a]n organiza-\ntion described in subsection (c) ... shall be exempt from tax-\nation....\"  Id. s 501(a).  Those described in subsection (c) \ninclude\n\n     corporations ... organized and operated exclusively for \n     religious ... purposes ... which do[ ] not participate in, \n     or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing \n     of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in \n     opposition to) any candidate for public office.\n     \nId. s 501(c)(3).  Similarly, section 170(c) allows taxpayers to \ndeduct from their taxable income donations made to a corpo-\nration\n\n     organized and operated exclusively for religious ... pur-\n     poses ... which is not disqualified for tax exemption \n     under section 501(c)(3) by reason of attempting to ... \n     intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of \n     statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in \n     opposition to) any candidate for public office.\n     \nId. s 170(c)(2)(B), (D).\n\n     The Code, in short, specifically states that organizations \nthat fail to comply with the restrictions set forth in section \n501(c) are not qualified to receive the tax exemption that it \nprovides.  Having satisfied ourselves that the IRS had the \nstatutory authority to revoke the Church's tax-exempt status, \nwe now turn to the free exercise challenges.\n\n\fB.   First Amendment Claims and the RFRA\n\n     The Church claims that the revocation of its exemption \nviolated its right to freely exercise its religion under both the \nFirst Amendment and the RFRA.  To sustain its claim under \neither the Constitution or the statute, the Church must first \nestablish that its free exercise right has been substantially \nburdened.  See Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of \nEqualization, 493 U.S. 378, 384-85 (1990) (\"Our cases have \nestablished that the free exercise inquiry asks whether gov-\nernment has placed a substantial burden on the observation \nof a central religious belief or practice and, if so, whether a \ncompelling governmental interest justifies the burden.\") (in-\nternal quotation marks and brackets omitted);  42 U.S.C. \ns 2000bb-1(a), (b) (\"Government shall not substantially bur-\nden a person's exercise of religion\" in the absence of a \ncompelling government interest that is furthered by the least \nrestrictive means.).  We conclude that the Church has failed \nto meet this test.\n\n     The Church asserts, first, that a revocation would threaten \nits existence.  See Affidavit of Dan Little dated July 31, 1995 \nat p 22, reprinted in App. at Tab 8 (\"The Church at Pierce \nCreek will have to close due to the revocation of its tax \nexempt status, and the inability of congregants to deduct \ntheir contributions from their taxes.\").  The Church main-\ntains that a loss of its tax-exempt status will not only make its \nmembers reluctant to contribute the funds essential to its \nsurvival, but may obligate the Church itself to pay taxes.\n\n     The Church appears to assume that the withdrawal of a \nconditional privilege for failure to meet the condition is in \nitself an unconstitutional burden on its free exercise right.  \nThis is true, however, only if the receipt of the privilege (in \nthis case the tax exemption) is conditioned\n\n     upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or ... \n     denie[d] ... because of conduct mandated by religious \n     belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adher-\n     ent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.\n     \n\fJimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 391-92 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Although its adver-\ntisements reflected its religious convictions on certain ques-\ntions of morality, the Church does not maintain that a with-\ndrawal from electoral politics would violate its beliefs.  The \nsole effect of the loss of the tax exemption will be to decrease \nthe amount of money available to the Church for its religious \npractices.  The Supreme Court has declared, however, that \nsuch a burden \"is not constitutionally significant.\"  Id. at 391;  \nsee also Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 700 (1989) \n(the \"contention that an incrementally larger tax burden \ninterferes with [ ] religious activities ... knows no limita-\ntion\").\n\n     In actual fact, even this burden is overstated.  Because of \nthe unique treatment churches receive under the Internal \nRevenue Code, the impact of the revocation is likely to be \nmore symbolic than substantial.  As the IRS confirmed at \noral argument, if the Church does not intervene in future \npolitical campaigns, it may hold itself out as a 501(c)(3) \norganization and receive all the benefits of that status.  All \nthat will have been lost, in that event, is the advance assur-\nance of deductibility in the event a donor should be audited.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. s 508(c)(1)(A);  Rev. Proc. 82-39 s 2.03.  Con-\ntributions will remain tax deductible as long as donors are \nable to establish that the Church meets the requirements of \nsection 501(c)(3).\n\n     Nor does the revocation necessarily make the Church liable \nfor the payment of taxes.  As the IRS explicitly represented \nin its brief and reiterated at oral argument, the revocation of \nthe exemption does not convert bona fide donations into \nincome taxable to the Church.  See 26 U.S.C. s 102 (\"Gross \nincome does not include the value of property acquired by \ngift....\").  Furthermore, we know of no authority, and coun-\nsel provided none, to prevent the Church from reapplying for \na prospective determination of its tax-exempt status and \nregaining the advance assurance of deductibility--provided, \nof course, that it renounces future involvement in political \ncampaigns.\n\n\f     We also reject the Church's argument that it is substantial-\nly burdened because it has no alternate means by which to \ncommunicate its sentiments about candidates for public office.  \nIn Regan v. Taxation With Representation, 461 U.S. 540, \n552-53 (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring), three members of \nthe Supreme Court stated that the availability of such an \nalternate means of communication is essential to the constitu-\ntionality of section 501(c)(3)'s restrictions on lobbying.  The \nCourt subsequently confirmed that this was an accurate \ndescription of its holding.  See FCC v. League of Women \nVoters, 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984).  In Regan, the concurring \njustices noted that \"TWR may use its present s 501(c)(3) \norganization for its nonlobbying activities and may create a \ns 501(c)(4) affiliate to pursue its charitable goals through \nlobbying.\"  461 U.S. at 552.\n\n     The Church has such an avenue available to it.  As was the \ncase with TWR, the Church may form a related organization \nunder section 501(c)(4) of the Code.  See 26 U.S.C. s 501(c)(4) \n(tax exemption for \"[c]ivic leagues or organizations not orga-\nnized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of \nsocial welfare\").  Such organizations are exempt from taxa-\ntion;  but unlike their section 501(c)(3) counterparts, contribu-\ntions to them are not deductible.  See 26 U.S.C. s 170(c);  see \nalso Regan, 461 U.S. at 543, 552-53.  Although a section \n501(c)(4) organization is also subject to the ban on intervening \nin political campaigns, see 26 C.F.R. s 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(ii) \n(1999), it may form a political action committee (\"PAC\") that \nwould be free to participate in political campaigns.  Id. \ns 1.527-6(f), (g) (\"[A]n organization described in section \n501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) may, \n[if it is not a section 501(c)(3) organization], establish and \nmaintain such a separate segregated fund to receive contribu-\ntions and make expenditures in a political campaign.\").\n\n     At oral argument, counsel for the Church doggedly main-\ntained that there can be no \"Church at Pierce Creek PAC.\"  \nTrue, it may not itself create a PAC;  but as we have pointed \nout, the Church can initiate a series of steps that will provide \nan alternate means of political communication that will satisfy \nthe standards set by the concurring justices in Regan.  \n\n\fShould the Church proceed to do so, however, it must under-\nstand that the related 501(c)(4) organization must be sepa-\nrately incorporated;  and it must maintain records that will \ndemonstrate that tax-deductible contributions to the Church \nhave not been used to support the political activities conduct-\ned by the 501(c)(4) organization's political action arm.  See 26 \nU.S.C. s 527(f)(3);  26 C.F.R. s 1.527-6(e), (f).\n\n     That the Church cannot use its tax-free dollars to fund such \na PAC unquestionably passes constitutional muster.  The \nSupreme Court has consistently held that, absent invidious \ndiscrimination, \"Congress has not violated [an organization's] \nFirst Amendment rights by declining to subsidize its First \nAmendment activities.\"  Regan, 461 U.S. at 548;  see also \nCammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513 (1959) (\"Peti-\ntioners are not being denied a tax deduction because they \nengage in constitutionally protected activities, but are simply \nbeing required to pay for those activities entirely out of their \nown pockets, as everyone else engaging in similar activities is \nrequired to do under the provisions of the Internal Revenue \nCode.\").\n\n     Because the Church has failed to demonstrate that its free \nexercise rights have been substantially burdened, we do not \nreach its arguments that section 501(c)(3) does not serve a \ncompelling government interest or, if it is indeed compelling, \nthat revocation of its tax exemption was not the least restric-\ntive means of furthering that interest.\n\n     Nor does the Church succeed in its claim that the IRS has \nviolated its First Amendment free speech rights by engaging \nin viewpoint discrimination.  The restrictions imposed by \nsection 501(c)(3) are viewpoint neutral;  they prohibit inter-\nvention in favor of all candidates for public office by all tax-\nexempt organizations, regardless of candidate, party, or view-\npoint.  Cf. Regan, 461 U.S. at 550-51 (upholding denial of tax \ndeduction for lobbying activities, in spite of allowance of such \ndeduction for veteran's groups).\n\nC.   Selective Prosecution (Fifth Amendment)\n\n     The Church alleges that the IRS violated the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the Fifth Amendment by engaging in selective \n\n\fprosecution.  In support of its claim, the Church has submit-\nted several hundred pages of newspaper excerpts reporting \npolitical campaign activities in, or by the pastors of, other \nchurches that have retained their tax-exempt status.  These \ninclude reports of explicit endorsements of Democratic candi-\ndates by clergymen as well as many instances in which \nfavored candidates have been invited to address congrega-\ntions from the pulpit.  The Church complains that despite \nthis widespread and widely reported involvement by other \nchurches in political campaigns, it is the only one to have ever \nhad its tax-exempt status revoked for engaging in political \nactivity.  It attributes this alleged discrimination to the Ser-\nvice's political bias.\n\n     To establish selective prosecution, the Church must \"prove \nthat (1) [it] was singled out for prosecution from among \nothers similarly situated and (2) that [the] prosecution was \nimproperly motivated, i.e., based on race, religion or another \narbitrary classification.\"  United States v. Washington, 705 \nF.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  This burden is a demanding \none because \"in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, \ncourts presume that [government prosecutors] have properly \ndischarged their official duties.\"  United States v. Armstrong, \n517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (internal quotation marks and cita-\ntion omitted).\n\n     At oral argument, counsel for the IRS conceded that if \nsome of the church-sponsored political activities cited by the \nChurch were accurately reported, they were in violation of \nsection 501(c)(3) and could have resulted in the revocation of \nthose churches' tax-exempt status.  But even if the Service \ncould have revoked their tax exemptions, the Church has \nfailed to establish selective prosecution because it has failed \nto demonstrate that it was similarly situated to any of those \nother churches.  None of the reported activities involved the \nplacement of advertisements in newspapers with nationwide \ncirculations opposing a candidate and soliciting tax deductible \ncontributions to defray their cost.  As we have stated,\n\n     [i]f ... there was no one to whom defendant could be \n     compared in order to resolve the question of [prosecuto-\n     \n\f     rial] selection, then it follows that defendant has failed to \n     make out one of the elements of its case.  Discrimination \n     cannot exist in a vacuum;  it can be found only in the \n     unequal treatment of people in similar circumstances.\n     \nAttorney Gen. v. Irish People, Inc., 684 F.2d 928, 946 (D.C. \nCir. 1982);  see also United States v. Hastings, 126 F.3d 310, \n315 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"[D]efendants are similarly situated when \ntheir circumstances present no distinguishable legitimate \nprosecutorial factors that might justify making different pros-\necutorial decisions with respect to them.\") (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n     Because the Church has failed to establish that it was \nsingled out for prosecution from among others who were \nsimilarly situated, we need not examine whether the IRS was \nimproperly motivated in undertaking this prosecution.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we find that the revocation of \nthe Church's tax-exempt status neither violated the Constitu-\ntion nor exceeded the IRS's statutory authority.

The Internal Revenue Service concluded that the placement  of the advertisements violated the statutory restrictions on  organizations exempt from taxation and, for the first time in  its history, it revoked a bona fide church's tax-exempt status  because of its involvement in politics.  Branch Ministries and  its pastor, Dan Little, challenge the revocation on the  grounds that (1) the Service acted beyond its statutory authority, (2) the revocation violated its right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment and the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and (3) it was the victim  of selective prosecution in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Because these objections are without merit, we affirm the  district court's grant of summary judgment to the Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Taxation of Churches</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\") exempts certain organizations from taxation, including those organized and operated for religious purposes, provided that they do not engage in  certain activities, including involvement in \"any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for  public office.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(a), (c)(3) (1994).  Contributions to such organizations are also deductible from the  donating taxpayer's taxable income.  Id. &#167; 170(a).  Although  most organizations seeking tax-exempt status are required to  apply to the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\" or \"Service\")  for an advance determination that they meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3), id. &#167; 508(a), a church may simply  hold itself out as tax exempt and receive the benefits of that  status without applying for advance recognition from the IRS. Id. &#167; 508(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS maintains a periodically updated \"Publication No.  78,\" in which it lists all organizations that have received a  ruling or determination letter confirming the deductibility of  contributions made to them.  See Rev. Proc. 82-39, 1982-1  C.B. 759, &#167;&#167; 2.01, 2.03.  Thus, a listing in that publication will  provide donors with advance assurance that their contributions will be deductible under section 170(a).  If a listed  organization has subsequently had its tax-exempt status revoked, contributions that are made to it by a donor who is  unaware of the change in status will generally be treated as  deductible if made on or before the date that the revocation is  publicly announced.  Id. &#167; 3.01.  Donors to a church that has  not received an advance determination of its tax-exempt  status may also deduct their contributions;  but in the event  of an audit, the taxpayer will bear the burden of establishing  that the church meets the requirements of section 501(c)(3).See generally id. &#167; 3.04;  Rev. Proc. 80-24, 1980-1 C.B. 658,  &#167; 6 (discussing taxpayers' obligations in seeking a ruling or  determination letter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unique treatment churches receive in the Internal  Revenue Code is further reflected in special restrictions on  the IRS's ability to investigate the tax status of a church. The Church Audit Procedures Act (\"CAPA\") sets out the  circumstances under which the IRS may initiate an investigation of a church and the procedures it is required to follow in  such aninvestigation.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7611.  Upon a \"reasonable belief\" by a high-level Treasury official that a church  may not be exempt from taxation under section 501, the IRS may begin a \"church tax inquiry.\"  Id. &#167; 7611(a).  A church  tax inquiry is defined, rather circularly, as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any inquiry to a church (other than an examination) to serve as a basis for determining whether a church</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) is exempt from tax under section 501(a) by reasonof its status as a church, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) is ... engaged in activities which may be subjectto taxation....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 7611(h)(2).  If the IRS is not able to resolve its concerns through a church tax inquiry, it may proceed to the  second level of investigation:  a \"church tax examination.\"  In  such an examination, the IRS may obtain and review the  church's records or examine its activities \"to determine  whether [the] organization claiming to be a church is a church  for any period.\"  Id. &#167; 7611(b)(1)(A), (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Factual and Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Branch Ministries, Inc. operates the Church at Pierce  Creek (\"Church\"), a Christian church located in Binghamton,  New York.  In 1983, the Church requested and received a  letter from the IRS recognizing its tax-exempt status.  On  October 30, 1992, four days before the presidential election,  the Church placed full-page advertisements in USA Today  and the Washington Times.  Each bore the headline \"Christians Beware\" and asserted that then-Governor Clinton's  positions concerning abortion, homosexuality, and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in schools violated Biblical  precepts.  The following appeared at the bottom of each  advertisement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This advertisement was co-sponsored by the Church atPierce Creek, Daniel J. Little, Senior Pastor, and bychurches and concerned Christians nationwide.  Tax-deductible donations for this advertisement gladly ac-cepted.  Make donations to:  The Church at PierceCreek.

E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advertisements did not go unnoticed.  They produced  hundreds of contributions to the Church from across the country and were mentioned in a New York Times article and  an Anthony Lewis column which stated that the sponsors of  the advertisement had almost certainly violated the Internal  Revenue Code.  Peter Applebome, Religious Right Intensifies Campaign for Bush, N.Y. Times, Oct. 31, 1992, at A1;Anthony Lewis, Tax Exempt Politics?, N.Y. Times, Dec. 1,  1992, at A15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advertisements also came to the attention of the  Regional Commissioner of the IRS, who notified the Church  on November 20, 1992 that he had authorized a church tax  inquiry based on \"a reasonable belief ... that you may not be  tax-exempt or that you may be liable for tax\" due to political  activities and expenditures.  Letter from Cornelius J. Coleman, IRS Regional Commissioner, to The Church at Pierce  Creek (Nov. 20, 1992), reprinted in App. at Tab 5, Ex. F.The Church denied that it had engaged in any prohibited  political activity and declined to provide the IRS with certain  information the Service had requested.  On February 11,  1993, the IRS informed the Church that it was beginning a  church tax examination.  Following two unproductive meetings between the parties, the IRS revoked the Church's  section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status on January 19, 1995, citing  the newspaper advertisements as prohibited intervention in a  political campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church and Pastor Little (collectively, \"Church\") commenced this lawsuit soon thereafter.  This had the effect of  suspending the revocation of the Church's tax exemption until  the district court entered its judgment in this case.  See 26  U.S.C. &#167; 7428(c).  The Church challenged the revocation of its tax-exempt status, alleging that the IRS had no authority  to revoke its tax exemption, that the revocationviolated its  right to free speech and to freely exercise its religion under  the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb (1994) (\"RFRA\"), and that  the IRS engaged in selective prosecution in violation of the  Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  After  allowing discovery on the Church's selective prosecution  claim, Branch Ministries, Inc. v. Richardson, 970 F. Supp. 11  (D.D.C. 1997), the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the IRS.  Branch Ministries, Inc. v. Rossotti, 40  F. Supp. 2d 15 (D.D.C. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church filed a timely appeal, and we have jurisdiction  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.  We review summary judgment decisions de novo, see Everett v. United States, 158 F.3d  1364, 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1132 (1999),  and will affirm only if there is no genuine issue as to any  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as  a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church advances a number of arguments in support of  its challenges to the revocation.  We examine only those that  warrant analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Statutory Authority of the IRS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church argues that, under the Internal Revenue Code,  the IRS does not have the statutory authority to revoke the  tax-exempt status of a bona fide church.  It reasons as  follows:  section 501(c)(3) refers to tax-exempt status for  religious organizations, not churches;  section 508, on the  other hand, specifically exempts \"churches\" from the requirement of applying for advance recognition of tax-exempt status, id. &#167; 508(c)(1)(A);  therefore, according to the Church, its  tax-exempt status is derived not from section 501(c)(3), but  from the lack of any provision in the Code for the taxation of  churches.  The Church concludes from this that it is not  subject to taxation and that the IRS is therefore powerless to  place conditions upon or to remove its tax-exempt status as a  church.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this argument more creative than persuasive.  The  simple answer, of course, is that whereas not every religious  organization is a church, every church is a religious organization.  More to the point, irrespective of whether it was  required to do so, the Church applied to the IRS for an  advance determination of its tax-exempt status.  The IRS  granted that recognition and now seeks to withdraw it. CAPA gives the IRS this power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statute, which pertains exclusively to churches, provides authority for revocation of the tax-exempt status of a  church through its references to other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  The section of CAPA entitled \"Limitations on revocation of tax-exempt status, etc.\" provides that  the Secretary [of the Treasury] may \"determine that an organization is not a church which [ ] (i) is exempt from taxation  by reason of section 501(a), or (ii) is described in section  170(c).\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7611(d)(1)(A)(i), (ii).  Both of these  sections condition tax-exempt status on non-intervention in  political campaigns.  Section 501(a) states that \"[a]n organization described in subsection (c) ... shall be exempt from taxation....\"  Id. &#167; 501(a).  Those described in subsection (c) include</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">corporations ... organized and operated exclusively for religious ... purposes ... which do[ ] not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 501(c)(3).  Similarly, section 170(c) allows taxpayers to  deduct from their taxable income donations made to a corporation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">organized and operated exclusively for religious ... purposes ... which is not disqualified for tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) by reason of attempting to ...intervene in (including the publishingor distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 170(c)(2)(B), (D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Code, in short, specifically states that organizations  that fail to comply with the restrictions set forth in section  501(c) are not qualified to receive the tax exemption that it  provides.  Having satisfied ourselves that the IRS had the  statutory authority to revoke the Church's tax-exempt status,  we now turn to the free exercise challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. First Amendment Claims and the RFRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church claims that the revocation of its exemption  violated its right to freely exercise its religion under both the  First Amendment and the RFRA.  To sustain its claim under  either the Constitution or the statute, the Church must first  establish that its free exercise right has been substantially  burdened.  See Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of  Equalization, 493 U.S. 378, 384-85 (1990) (\"Our cases have  established that the free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation  of a central religious belief or practice and, if so, whether a  compelling governmental interest justifies the burden.\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted);  42 U.S.C. &#167;  2000bb-1(a), (b) (\"Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion\" in the absence of a  compelling government interest that is furthered by the least  restrictive means.).  We conclude that the Church has failed  to meet this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church asserts, first, that a revocation would threaten  its existence.  See Affidavit of Dan Little dated July 31, 1995  at p 22, reprinted in App. at Tab 8 (\"The Church at Pierce  Creek will have to close due to the revocation of its tax  exempt status, and the inability of congregants to deduct  their contributions from their taxes.\").  The Church maintains that a loss of its tax-exempt status will not only make its  members reluctant to contribute the funds essential to its  survival, but may obligate the Church itself to pay taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church appears to assume that the withdrawal of a  conditional privilege for failure to meet the condition is in  itself an unconstitutional burden on its free exercise right. This is true, however, only if the receipt of the privilege (in  this case the tax exemption) is conditioned</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or ...denie[d] ... because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adher-ent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 391-92 (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted).  Although its advertisements reflected its religious convictions on certain questions of morality, the Church does not maintain that a withdrawal from electoral politics would violate its beliefs.  The  sole effect of the loss of the tax exemption will be to decrease  the amount of money available to the Church for its religious  practices.  The Supreme Court has declared, however, that  such a burden \"is not constitutionally significant.\"  Id. at 391;see also Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 700 (1989)  (the \"contention that an incrementally larger tax burden  interferes with [ ] religious activities ... knows no limitation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In actual fact, even this burden is overstated.  Because of  the unique treatment churches receive under the Internal  Revenue Code, the impact of the revocation is likely to be  more symbolic than substantial.  As the IRS confirmed at  oral argument, if the Church does not intervene in future  political campaigns, it may hold itself out as a 501(c)(3)  organization and receive all the benefits of that status.  All  that will have been lost, in that event, is the advance assurance of deductibility inthe event a donor should be audited.See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 508(c)(1)(A);  Rev. Proc. 82-39 &#167; 2.03.  Contributions will remain tax deductible as long as donors are  able to establish that the Church meets the requirements of  section 501(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the revocation necessarily make the Church liable  for the payment of taxes.  As the IRS explicitly represented  in its brief and reiterated at oral argument, the revocation of  the exemption does not convert bona fide donations into  income taxable to the Church.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 102 (\"Gross  income does not include the value of property acquired by  gift....\").  Furthermore, we know of no authority, and counsel provided none, to prevent the Church from reapplying for  a prospective determination of its tax-exempt status and  regaining the advance assurance of deductibility--provided,  of course, that it renounces future involvement in political  campaigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject the Church's argument that it is substantially burdened because it has no alternate means by which to  communicate its sentiments about candidates for public office.In Regan v. Taxation With Representation, 461 U.S. 540,  552-53 (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring), three members of  the Supreme Court stated that the availability of such an  alternate means of communication is essential to the constitutionality of section 501(c)(3)'s restrictions on lobbying.  The  Court subsequently confirmed that this was an accurate  description of its holding.  See FCC v. League of Women  Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984).  In Regan, the concurring  justices noted that \"TWR may use its present &#167; 501(c)(3)  organization for its nonlobbying activities and may create a  &#167; 501(c)(4) affiliate to pursue its charitable goals through  lobbying.\"  461 U.S. at 552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church has such an avenue available to it.  As was the  case with TWR, the Church may form a related organization  under section 501(c)(4) of the Code.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(4)  (tax exemption for \"[c]ivic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of  social welfare\").  Such organizations are exempt from taxation;  but unlike their section 501(c)(3) counterparts, contributions to them are not deductible.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 170(c);  see  also Regan, 461 U.S. at 543, 552-53.  Although a section  501(c)(4) organization is also subject to the ban on intervening  in political campaigns, see 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(ii)  (1999), it may form a political action committee (\"PAC\") that  would be free to participate in political campaigns.  Id.  &#167; 1.527-6(f), (g) (\"[A]n organization described in section  501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) may,  [if it is not a section 501(c)(3) organization], establish and  maintain such a separate segregated fund to receive contributions and make expenditures in a political campaign.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for the Church doggedly maintained that there can be no \"Church at Pierce Creek PAC.\"True, it may not itself create a PAC;  but as we have pointed  out, the Church can initiate a series of steps that will provide  an alternate means of political communication that will satisfy  the standards set by the concurring justices in Regan.  Should the Church proceed to do so, however, it must understand that the related 501(c)(4) organization must be separately incorporated;  and it must maintain records that will  demonstrate that tax-deductible contributions to the Church  have not been used to support the political activities conducted by the 501(c)(4) organization's political action arm.

The  Supreme Court has consistently held that, absent invidious  discrimination, \"Congress has not violated [an organization's]  First Amendment rights by declining to subsidizeits First  Amendment activities.\"  Regan, 461 U.S. at 548;  see also  Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513 (1959) (\"Petitioners are not being denied a tax deduction because they  engage in constitutionally protected activities, but are simply  being required to pay for those activities entirely out of their  own pockets, as everyone else engaging in similar activities is  required to do under the provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Church has failed to demonstrate that its free  exercise rights have been substantially burdened, we do not  reach its arguments that section 501(c)(3) does not serve a  compelling government interest or, if it is indeed compelling,  that revocation of its tax exemption was not the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Church succeed in its claim that the IRS has  violated its First Amendment free speech rights by engaging  in viewpoint discrimination.  The restrictions imposed by  section 501(c)(3) are viewpoint neutral;  they prohibit intervention in favor of all candidates for public office by all taxexempt organizations, regardless of candidate, party, or viewpoint.  Cf. Regan, 461 U.S. at 550-51 (upholding denial of tax  deduction for lobbying activities, in spite of allowance of such  deduction for veteran's groups).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Selective Prosecution (Fifth Amendment)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church alleges that the IRS violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment by engaging in selective prosecution.  In support of its claim, the Church has submitted several hundred pages of newspaper excerpts reporting  political campaign activities in, or by the pastors of, other  churches that have retained their tax-exempt status.  These  include reports of explicit endorsements of Democratic candidates by clergymen as well as many instances in which  favored candidates have been invited to address congregations from the pulpit.  The Church complains that despite  this widespread and widely reported involvement by other  churches in political campaigns, it is the only one to have ever  had its tax-exempt status revoked for engaging in political  activity.  It attributes this alleged discrimination to the Service's political bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish selective prosecution, the Church must \"prove  that (1) [it] was singled out for prosecution from among  others similarly situated and (2) that [the] prosecution was  improperly motivated, i.e., based on race, religion or another  arbitrary classification.\"  United States v. Washington, 705  F.2d 489, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  This burden is a demanding  one because \"in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,  courts presume that [government prosecutors] have properly  discharged their official duties.\"  United States v.

But even if the Service  could have revoked their tax exemptions, the Church has  failed to establish selective prosecution because it has failed  to demonstrate that it was similarly situated to any of those  other churches.  None of the reported activities involved the  placement of advertisements in newspapers with nationwide  circulations opposing a candidate and soliciting tax deductible  contributions to defray their cost.

The Internal Revenue Service concluded that the placement  of the advertisements violated the statutory restrictions on  organizations exempt from taxation and, for the first time in  its history, it revoked a bona fide church's tax-exempt status  because of its involvement in politics.  Branch Ministries and  its pastor, Dan Little, challenge the revocation on the  grounds that (1) the Service acted beyond its statutory authority, (2) the revocation violated its right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment and the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and (3) it was the victim  of selective prosecution in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Because these objections are without merit, we affirm the  district court's grant of summary judgment to the Service.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Taxation of Churches</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\") exempts certain organizations from taxation, including those organized and operated for religious purposes, provided that they do not engage in  certain activities, including involvement in \"any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for  public office.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(a), (c)(3) (1994).  Contributions to such organizations are also deductible from the  donating taxpayer's taxable income.  Id. &#167; 170(a).  Although  most organizations seeking tax-exempt status are required to  apply to the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\" or \"Service\")  for an advance determination that they meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3), id. &#167; 508(a), a church may simply  hold itself out as tax exempt and receive the benefits of that  status without applying for advance recognition from the IRS. Id. &#167; 508(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS maintains a periodically updated \"Publication No.  78,\" in which it lists all organizations that have received a  ruling or determination letter confirming the deductibility of  contributions made to them.  See Rev. Proc. 82-39, 1982-1  C.B. 759, &#167;&#167; 2.01, 2.03.  Thus, a listing in that publication will  provide donors with advance assurance that their contributions will be deductible under section 170(a).  If a listed  organization has subsequently had its tax-exempt status revoked, contributions that are made to it by a donor who is  unaware of the change in status will generally be treated as  deductible if made on or before the date that the revocation is  publicly announced.  Id. &#167; 3.01.  Donors to a church that has  not received an advance determination of its tax-exempt  status may also deduct their contributions;  but in the event  of an audit, the taxpayer will bear the burden of establishing  that the church meets the requirements of section 501(c)(3).See generally id. &#167; 3.04;  Rev. Proc. 80-24, 1980-1 C.B. 658,  &#167; 6 (discussing taxpayers' obligations in seeking a ruling or  determination letter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unique treatment churches receive in the Internal  Revenue Code is further reflected in special restrictions on  the IRS's ability to investigate the tax status of a church. The Church Audit Procedures Act (\"CAPA\") sets out the  circumstances under which the IRS may initiate an investigation of a church and the procedures it is required to follow in  such aninvestigation.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7611.  Upon a \"reasonable belief\" by a high-level Treasury official that a church  may not be exempt from taxation under section 501, the IRS may begin a \"church tax inquiry.\"  Id. &#167; 7611(a).  A church  tax inquiry is defined, rather circularly, as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any inquiry to a church (other than an examination) to serve as a basis for determining whether a church</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) is exempt from tax under section 501(a) by reasonof its status as a church, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) is ... engaged in activities which may be subjectto taxation....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 7611(h)(2).  If the IRS is not able to resolve its concerns through a church tax inquiry, it may proceed to the  second level of investigation:  a \"church tax examination.\"  In  such an examination, the IRS may obtain and review the  church's records or examine its activities \"to determine  whether [the] organization claiming to be a church is a church  for any period.\"  Id. &#167; 7611(b)(1)(A), (B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.  Factual and Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Branch Ministries, Inc. operates the Church at Pierce  Creek (\"Church\"), a Christian church located in Binghamton,  New York.  In 1983, the Church requested and received a  letter from the IRS recognizing its tax-exempt status.  On  October 30, 1992, four days before the presidential election,  the Church placed full-page advertisements in USA Today  and the Washington Times.  Each bore the headline \"Christians Beware\" and asserted that then-Governor Clinton's  positions concerning abortion, homosexuality, and the distribution of condoms to teenagers in schools violated Biblical  precepts.  The following appeared at the bottom of each  advertisement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This advertisement was co-sponsored by the Church atPierce Creek, Daniel J.

They produced  hundreds of contributions to the Church from across the country and were mentioned in a New York Times article and  an Anthony Lewis column which stated that the sponsors of  the advertisement had almost certainly violated the Internal  Revenue Code.  Peter Applebome, Religious Right Intensifies Campaign for Bush, N.Y. Times, Oct. 31, 1992, at A1;Anthony Lewis, Tax Exempt Politics?, N.Y. Times, Dec. 1,  1992, at A15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The advertisements also came to the attention of the  Regional Commissioner of the IRS, who notified the Church  on November 20, 1992 that he had authorized a church tax  inquiry based on \"a reasonable belief ... that you may not be  tax-exempt or that you may be liable for tax\" due to political  activities and expenditures.  Letter from Cornelius J. Coleman, IRS Regional Commissioner, to The Church at Pierce  Creek (Nov. 20, 1992), reprinted in App. at Tab 5, Ex. F.The Church denied that it had engaged in any prohibited  political activity and declined to provide the IRS with certain  information the Service had requested.  On February 11,  1993, the IRS informed the Church that it was beginning a  church tax examination.  Following two unproductive meetings between the parties, the IRS revoked the Church's  section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status on January 19, 1995, citing  the newspaper advertisements as prohibited intervention in a  political campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church and Pastor Little (collectively, \"Church\") commenced this lawsuit soon thereafter.  This had the effect of  suspending the revocation of the Church's tax exemption until  the district court entered its judgment in this case.  See 26  U.S.C. &#167; 7428(c).  The Church challenged the revocation of its tax-exempt status, alleging that the IRS had no authority  to revoke its tax exemption, that the revocationviolated its  right to free speech and to freely exercise its religion under  the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration  Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000bb (1994) (\"RFRA\"), and that  the IRS engaged in selective prosecution in violation of the  Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church advances a number of arguments in support of  its challenges to the revocation.  We examine only those that  warrant analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Statutory Authority of the IRS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church argues that, under the Internal Revenue Code,  the IRS does not have the statutory authority to revoke the  tax-exempt status of a bona fide church.  It reasons as  follows:  section 501(c)(3) refers to tax-exempt status for  religious organizations, not churches;  section 508, on the  other hand, specifically exempts \"churches\" from the requirement of applying for advance recognition of tax-exempt status, id. &#167; 508(c)(1)(A);  therefore, according to the Church, its  tax-exempt status is derived not from section 501(c)(3), but  from the lack of any provision in the Code for the taxation of  churches.  The Church concludes from this that it is not  subject to taxation and that the IRS is therefore powerless to  place conditions upon or to remove its tax-exempt status as a  church.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this argument more creative than persuasive.  The  simple answer, of course, is that whereas not every religious  organization is a church, every church is a religious organization.  More to the point, irrespective of whether it was  required to do so, the Church applied to the IRS for an  advance determination of its tax-exempt status.  The IRS  granted that recognition and now seeks to withdraw it. CAPA gives the IRS this power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statute, which pertains exclusively to churches, provides authority for revocation of the tax-exempt status of a  church through its references to other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.  The section of CAPA entitled \"Limitations on revocation of tax-exempt status, etc.\" provides that  the Secretary [of the Treasury] may \"determine that an organization is not a church which [ ] (i) is exempt from taxation  by reason of section 501(a), or (ii) is described in section  170(c).\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7611(d)(1)(A)(i), (ii).  Both of these  sections condition tax-exempt status on non-intervention in  political campaigns.  Section 501(a) states that \"[a]n organization described in subsection (c) ... shall be exempt from taxation....\"  Id. &#167; 501(a).  Those described in subsection (c) include</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">corporations ... organized and operated exclusively for religious ... purposes ... which do[ ] not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 501(c)(3).  Similarly, section 170(c) allows taxpayers to  deduct from their taxable income donations made to a corporation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">organized and operated exclusively for religious ... purposes ... which is not disqualified for tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) by reason of attempting to ...intervene in (including the publishingor distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 170(c)(2)(B), (D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Code, in short, specifically states that organizations  that fail to comply with the restrictions set forth in section  501(c) are not qualified to receive the tax exemption that it  provides.  Having satisfied ourselves that the IRS had the  statutory authority to revoke the Church's tax-exempt status,  we now turn to the free exercise challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. First Amendment Claims and the RFRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church claims that the revocation of its exemption  violated its right to freely exercise its religion under both the  First Amendment and the RFRA.  To sustain its claim under  either the Constitution or the statute, the Church must first  establish that its free exercise right has been substantially  burdened.  See Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of  Equalization, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112354\"><a href=\"/opinion/112354/jimmy-swaggart-ministries-v-board-of-equalization-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 384-85 (1990) (\"Our cases have  established that the free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation  of a central religious belief or practice and, if so, whether a  compelling governmental interest justifies the burden.\") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted);  42 U.S.C. &#167;  2000bb-1(a), (b) (\"Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion\" in the absence of a  compelling government interest that is furthered by the least  restrictive means.).  We conclude that the Church has failed  to meet this test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church asserts, first, that a revocation would threaten  its existence.  See Affidavit of Dan Little dated July 31, 1995  at p 22, reprinted in App. at Tab 8 (\"The Church at Pierce  Creek will have to close due to the revocation of its tax  exempt status, and the inability of congregants to deduct  their contributions from their taxes.\").  The Church maintains that a loss of its tax-exempt status will not only make its  members reluctant to contribute the funds essential to its  survival, but may obligate the Church itself to pay taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church appears to assume that the withdrawal of a  conditional privilege for failure to meet the condition is in  itself an unconstitutional burden on its free exercise right. This is true, however, only if the receipt of the privilege (in  this case the tax exemption) is conditioned</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or ...denie[d] ... because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adher-ent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 391-92 (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted).  Although its advertisements reflected its religious convictions on certain questions of morality, the Church does not maintain that a withdrawal from electoral politics would violate its beliefs.  The  sole effect of the loss of the tax exemption will be to decrease  the amount of money available to the Church for its religious  practices.  The Supreme Court has declared, however, that  such a burden \"is not constitutionally significant.\"  Id. at 391;see also Hernandez v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112271\"><a href=\"/opinion/112271/hernandez-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span>, 700 (1989)  (the \"contention that an incrementally larger tax burden  interferes with [ ] religious activities ... knows no limitation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In actual fact, even this burden is overstated.  Because of  the unique treatment churches receive under the Internal  Revenue Code, the impact of the revocation is likely to be  more symbolic than substantial.  As the IRS confirmed at  oral argument, if the Church does not intervene in future  political campaigns, it may hold itself out as a 501(c)(3)  organization and receive all the benefits of that status.  All  that will have been lost, in that event, is the advance assurance of deductibility inthe event a donor should be audited.See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 508(c)(1)(A);  Rev. Proc. 82-39 &#167; 2.03.  Contributions will remain tax deductible as long as donors are  able to establish that the Church meets the requirements of  section 501(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the revocation necessarily make the Church liable  for the payment of taxes.  As the IRS explicitly represented  in its brief and reiterated at oral argument, the revocation of  the exemption does not convert bona fide donations into  income taxable to the Church.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 102 (\"Gross  income does not include the value of property acquired by  gift....\").  Furthermore, we know of no authority, and counsel provided none, to prevent the Church from reapplying for  a prospective determination of its tax-exempt status and  regaining the advance assurance of deductibility--provided,  of course, that it renounces future involvement in political  campaigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject the Church's argument that it is substantially burdened because it has no alternate means by which to  communicate its sentiments about candidates for public office.In Regan v. Taxation With Representation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110935\"><a href=\"/opinion/110935/regan-v-taxation-with-representation-of-wash/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>,  552-53 (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring), three members of  the Supreme Court stated that the availability of such an  alternate means of communication is essential to the constitutionality of section 501(c)(3)'s restrictions on lobbying.  The  Court subsequently confirmed that this was an accurate  description of its holding.  See FCC v. League of Women  Voters, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111248\"><a href=\"/opinion/111248/fcc-v-league-of-women-voters-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 400 (1984).  In Regan, the concurring  justices noted that \"TWR may use its present &#167; 501(c)(3)  organization for its nonlobbying activities and may create a  &#167; 501(c)(4) affiliate to pursue its charitable goals through  lobbying.\"  461 U.S. at 552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church has such an avenue available to it.  As was the  case with TWR, the Church may form a related organization  under section 501(c)(4) of the Code.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)(4)  (tax exemption for \"[c]ivic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of  social welfare\").  Such organizations are exempt from taxation;  but unlike their section 501(c)(3) counterparts, contributions to them are not deductible.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 170(c);  see  also Regan, 461 U.S. at 543, 552-53.  Although a section  501(c)(4) organization is also subject to the ban on intervening  in political campaigns, see 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.501(c)(4)-1(a)(2)(ii)  (1999), it may form a political action committee (\"PAC\") that  would be free to participate in political campaigns.  Id.  &#167; 1.527-6(f), (g) (\"[A]n organization described in section  501(c) that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) may,  [if it is not a section 501(c)(3) organization], establish and  maintain such a separate segregated fund to receive contributions and make expenditures in a political campaign.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for the Church doggedly maintained that there can be no \"Church at Pierce Creek PAC.\"True, it may not itself create a PAC;  but as we have pointed  out, the Church can initiate a series of steps that will provide  an alternate means of political communication that will satisfy  the standards set by the concurring justices in Regan.  Should the Church proceed to do so, however, it must understand that the related 501(c)(4) organization must be separately incorporated;  and it must maintain records that will  demonstrate that tax-deductible contributions to the Church  have not been used to support the political activities conducted by the 501(c)(4) organization's political action arm.  See 26  U.S.C. &#167; 527(f)(3);  26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.527-6(e), (f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Church cannot use its tax-free dollars to fund such  a PAC unquestionably passes constitutional muster.  The  Supreme Court has consistently held that, absent invidious  discrimination, \"Congress has not violated [an organization's]  First Amendment rights by declining to subsidizeits First  Amendment activities.\"  Regan, 461 U.S. at 548;  see also  Cammarano v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105830\"><a href=\"/opinion/105830/cammarano-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 513 (1959) (\"Petitioners are not being denied a tax deduction because they  engage in constitutionally protected activities, but are simply  being required to pay for those activities entirely out of their  own pockets, as everyone else engaging in similar activities is  required to do under the provisions of the Internal Revenue  Code.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the Church has failed to demonstrate that its free  exercise rights have been substantially burdened, we do not  reach its arguments that section 501(c)(3) does not serve a  compelling government interest or, if it is indeed compelling,  that revocation of its tax exemption was not the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the Church succeed in its claim that the IRS has  violated its First Amendment free speech rights by engaging  in viewpoint discrimination.  The restrictions imposed by  section 501(c)(3) are viewpoint neutral;  they prohibit intervention in favor of all candidates for public office by all taxexempt organizations, regardless of candidate, party, or viewpoint.  Cf. Regan, 461 U.S. at 550-51 (upholding denial of tax  deduction for lobbying activities, in spite of allowance of such  deduction for veteran's groups).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.  Selective Prosecution (Fifth Amendment)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Church alleges that the IRS violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment by engaging in selective prosecution.  In support of its claim, the Church has submitted several hundred pages of newspaper excerpts reporting  political campaign activities in, or by the pastors of, other  churches that have retained their tax-exempt status.  These  include reports of explicit endorsements of Democratic candidates by clergymen as well as many instances in which  favored candidates have been invited to address congregations from the pulpit.  The Church complains that despite  this widespread and widely reported involvement by other  churches in political campaigns, it is the only one to have ever  had its tax-exempt status revoked for engaging in political  activity.  It attributes this alleged discrimination to the Service's political bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish selective prosecution, the Church must \"prove  that (1) [it] was singled out for prosecution from among  others similarly situated and (2) that [the] prosecution was  improperly motivated, i.e., based on race, religion or another  arbitrary classification.\"  United States v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"417694\"><a href=\"/opinion/417694/united-states-v-myrtle-d-washington-two-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  This burden is a demanding  one because \"in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,  courts presume that [government prosecutors] have properly  discharged their official duties.\"  United States v. Armstrong,  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118022\"><a href=\"/opinion/118022/united-states-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 464 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for the IRS conceded that if  some of the church-sponsored political activities cited by the  Church were accurately reported, they were in violation of  section 501(c)(3) and could have resulted in the revocation of  those churches' tax-exempt status.  But even if the Service  could have revoked their tax exemptions, the Church has  failed to establish selective prosecution because it has failed  to demonstrate that it was similarly situated to any of those  other churches.  None of the reported activities involved the  placement of advertisements in newspapers with nationwide  circulations opposing a candidate and soliciting tax deductible  contributions to defray their cost.  As we have stated,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[i]f ... there was no one to whom defendant could be compared in order to resolve the question of [prosecuto-rial] selection, then it follows that defendant has failed to make out one of the elementsof its case.

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the revocation of  the Church's tax-exempt status neither violated the Constitution nor exceeded the IRS's statutory authority.
