The task force was instructed to\n\ndevelop their recommendations within the context of the Public’s Right to Know\n\nand the Right of Individual Privacy, guaranteed, respectively, by Article II,\n\nSections 9 and 10 of the Montana Constitution. The task force was co-chaired by\n\nJudy Meadows, State Law Librarian, and Karen Nelson, Director of Information\n\nTechnology for this Court, and included representatives from the District Courts\n\nand Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, and the Clerks of Courts thereof; from the\n\nClerk of the Supreme Court; from the media; from the State Bar of Montana; and\n\nfrom the Montana Advocacy Program.\n\n       Following a series of public meetings between December 2005 and March\n\n2006, the task force drafted comprehensive rules modeled on national guidelines\n\npublished in October 2002 by the National Center for State Courts and the Justice\n\nManagement Institute. The rules which the task force drafted and recommended,\n\nhowever, were in some cases modified to comply with Article II, Sections 9\n\n\n                                         1\n\fand 10 of the Montana Constitution as well as with Montana statutory law and\n\njurisprudence. The task force also drafted a detailed commentary to each rule\n\nreflecting the rationale underlying the rule.\n\n       At its May 15, 2006 meeting, the Commission on Technology unanimously\n\nvoted to recommend to this Court the proposed rules hereinafter referred to.\n\n       The Court expresses its appreciation and gratitude to the co-chairpersons\n\nand to the members of the task force for their exhaustive and diligent work on this\n\nmatter and for their service to the courts and to the State of Montana.\n\n       Having now reviewed these rules and commentary, we determine that\n\nbefore taking further action, the rules and commentary should be submitted to the\n\npublic for comment.\n\n       Therefore,\n\n       IT IS ORDERED that the rules referred to hereafter by hyperlink be\n\nsubmitted to the public for comment.

Purpose of these Rules\n\n(a)    The purpose of these rules is to provide a comprehensive framework for a policy on\n       public access to court records. These rules provide for access in a manner that:\n\n       (1) Maximizes accessibility to court records,\n       (2) Supports the role of the judiciary,\n       (3) Promotes governmental accountability,\n       (4) Contributes to public safety,\n       (5) Minimizes risk of injury to individuals,\n       (6) Protects individual privacy rights and interests,\n       (7) Protects proprietary business information,\n       (8) Minimizes reluctance to use the court to resolve disputes,\n       (9) Makes most effective use of court and clerk of court staff,\n       (10) Provides excellent customer service, and\n       (11) Does not unduly burden the ongoing business of the judiciary.\n\nThe rules are intended for 1) litigants, 2) those seeking access to court records, and 3) judges and\ncourt and clerk of court personnel responding to requests for access.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for Public\nAccess to Court Records\n\nThe objective of these rules is to provide maximum public accessibility to court records,\nconsistent with constitutional or other provisions of law and taking into account public policy\ninterests that are not always fully compatible with unrestricted access. Eleven significant public\npolicy interests are identified. Unrestricted access to certain information in court records could\nresult in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or unduly increase the risk of injury to\nindividuals and businesses. Denial of access would compromise the judiciary’s role in society,\ninhibit accountability, and might endanger public safety.\n\nThese rules start from the presumption of open public access to court records. In some\ncircumstances, however, the right to privacy may require that access to some records is\nrestricted. The rules reflect the view that any restriction to access must be implemented in a\nmanner narrowly tailored to serve the interests in open access. The premise underlying these\nrules is that court records are open and accessible to the public. Open access serves many public\npurposes. Open access supports the judiciary in fulfilling its role in our democratic form of\ngovernment and in our society. Open access also promotes the accountability of the judiciary by\nreadily allowing the public to monitor the performance of the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n             Page 3 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nOther specific benefits of open court records are further elaborated in the remaining subsections.\n\nSubsection (a)(2) Supports the Role of the Judiciary. The role of the judiciary is to resolve\ndisputes, between private parties or between an individual or entity and the government,\naccording to a set of rules. Although the dispute is between two people or entities, or with the\ngovernment, having the process and result open to the public serves a societal interest in having a\nset of stable, predictable rules governing behavior and conduct. The open nature of court\nproceedings furthers the goal of providing public education about the results in cases and the\nevidence supporting them. Another aspect of the court’s dispute resolution function is\nestablishing rights as between parties in a dispute. The decision of the court stating what the\nrights and obligations of the parties are is as important to the public as to the litigants. The\nsignificance of this role is reflected in statutes and rules creating such things as judgment rolls\nand party indices with specific public accessibility.\n\nSubsection (a)(3) Promotes Government Accountability. Open court records provide for\naccountability in at least three major areas: 1) the operations of the judiciary, 2) the operations of\nother governmental agencies, and 3) the enforcement of laws. Open court records allow the\npublic to monitor the performance of the judiciary and, thereby, hold it accountable. Public\naccess to court records allows anyone to review the proceedings and the decisions of the court,\nindividually, across cases, and across courts, to determine whether the court is meeting its role of\nprotecting the rule of law, and does so in a cost effective manner. Such access also promotes\ngreater public trust and confidence in the judiciary. Openness also provides accountability for\ngovernmental agencies that are parties in court actions, or whose activities are being challenged\nin a court action. Finally, open court proceedings and open court records also demonstrate that\nlaws are being enforced. This includes civil regulatory laws as well as criminal laws.\n\nSubsection (a)(4) Contributes to Public Safety. Open public access contributes to public safety\nand compliance with the law. Availability of information about court proceedings and outcomes\nallows people to become aware of individuals, circumstances or business propositions that may\npose a threat to their persons or their property. Open public access to information thus allows\npeople to protect themselves. Examples of this are criminal conviction information, protective\norder information, and judgments in non-criminal cases. At the same time however, an effort\nshould be made to alert the public of the potentially serious problems that could be brought about\nby the reliance upon incomplete information from yet unresolved cases, where allegations have\nnot been proven.\n\nPublic safety, physical and economic, is also enhanced to the extent open public access to court\nrecords contributes to the accountability of corporations, businesses and individuals. Court cases\nare one source of information about unsafe products, improper business practices or dangerous\nconditions. Knowing this information is readily available to the public from court records is one\nincentive for businesses and individuals to act\n\n\n\n\n               Page 4 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nappropriately. Open access to this information also allows individuals and businesses to better\nprotect themselves from injury.\n\nSubsection (a)(5) Minimizes Risk of Injury to Individuals. Other circumstances suggest\nunrestricted access is not always in the public interest. The interest in personal safety can be\nserved by restricting access to information that someone could use to injure someone else,\nphysically, psychologically or economically. Examples of actual injury to individuals based on\ninformation obtained from court records include: intimidation of, or physical violence towards,\nvictims, witnesses, or jurors, repeated domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, identity theft,\nand housing or employment discrimination. While this does not require total restriction of access\nto court records, it supports restriction of access to certain information that would allow someone\nto identify and find a person to whom they intend harm. This is an especially serious problem in\ndomestic violence cases where the abused person is seeking protection through the court.\n\nSubsection (a)(6) Protects Individual Privacy Rights and Interests. The countervailing public\ninterest to open public access is the protection of personal privacy. The interest in privacy is\nprotected by limiting public access to certain kinds of information. The presumption of public\naccess is not absolute. Considerations identified regarding privacy interests include: a specific,\nlegally protected privacy interest, the reasonableness (personally and objectively) of the\nexpectation of privacy, the seriousness of the invasion of privacy, and the legitimate public\ninterest in disclosure. Appropriate respect for individual privacy also enhances public trust and\nconfidence in the judiciary. It is also important to remember that, generally, at least some of the\nparties in a court case are not in court voluntarily, but rather have been brought into court by\nplaintiffs or by the government. They have not consented to personal information related to the\ndispute being in the public domain. For those who have violated the law or an agreement, civilly\nor criminally, an argument can be made that they have impliedly consented to participation and\ndisclosure by their actions. However, both civil suits and criminal cases are filed based on\nallegations, so it cannot be presumed that individuals who find themselves in court as a\ndefendant in a case have acted improperly or wrongly as alleged by plaintiffs or by the\ngovernment.\n\nFor those who have not been charged with violation of the law, civilly or criminally, but are\nsubject to protective actions initiated by the government, such as those subject to involuntary\ncommitments, guardianship or conservatorship proceedings, implied consent to participation and\ndisclosure could not be similarly argued.\n\nFinally, at times a person who is not a party to the action may be mentioned in the court record.\nCare should be taken that the privacy rights and interests of such a ‘third’ person, such as a\nminor involved in child protective proceedings, is not unduly compromised by public access to\nthe court record containing information about the person.\n\nSubsection (a)(7) Protects Proprietary Business Information. Another type of information to\nwhich access may be restricted is that related to the operations of a business. There may be a\ncompelling reason to protect trade secrets or other proprietary business information in a\nparticular case. Allowing public access to such information could both\n\n\n               Page 5 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\nthwart a legitimate business advantage and give a competitor an unfair business\nadvantage. It also reduces the willingness of a business to use the courts to resolve disputes.\n\nSubsection (a)(8) Minimizes Reluctance To Use The Court To Resolve Disputes. The public\navailability of information in the court record can also affect the decision as to whether to use the\ncourt to resolve disputes. A policy that permits unfettered public access might result in some\nindividuals avoiding the resolution of a dispute through the court because they are unwilling to\nhave information become accessible to the public simply by virtue of it being in the court record.\nThis would diminish access to the courts and undermine public confidence in the judiciary.\nThere may also be an unintended effect of encouraging use of alternative dispute resolution\nmechanisms, which tend to be essentially private proceedings. If someone believes the courts are\nnot available to help resolve their dispute, there is a risk they will resort to self-help, a response\nthe existence of the courts is intended to minimize because of the societal interest in the peaceful\nresolution of disputes.\n\nSubsection (a)(9) Makes Most Effective Use of Court and Clerk of Court Staff. This\nconsideration relates to how access is provided rather than whether there is access. Staff time is\nrequired to maintain and provide public access to court records. If records are in electronic form,\nless staff time may be needed to provide public access. However, there can be significant costs to\nconvert records to electronic form in the first place and to maintain them. There may also be\nadded costs for court personnel needed to provide appropriate security for court databases and to\nprevent hackers from improperly accessing and altering court databases. These additional staff\ncosts may at least partially offset any savings from improvements in workflow or from less use\nof staff time to respond to records requests. In providing public access the court and clerk should\nbe mindful of doing it in a way that makes most effective use of court and clerk of court staff.\nUse of staff may also be a relevant consideration in identifying the method for limiting access\nunder section 4.60(a). Note that the rule does not require a court to convert records to electronic\nform, nor to make electronic records available remotely.\n\nThe design of electronic databases used by the court is also relevant here. Court records\nmanagement systems should be designed to improve public access to the court record as well as\nto improve the productivity of the court’s employees and judges and the clerk’s office. What is\nthe added cost of providing both? The answer to this involves allocation of scarce resources as\nwell as system design issues. If the public can help themselves to access, especially\nelectronically, less staff time is needed to respond to requests for access. The best options would\nbe to design a system to accommodate access restrictions to certain kinds of information without\ncourt staff involvement (see discussion in Commentary to Section 3.20).\n\n\n\n\n               Page 6 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nSubsection (a)(10) Provides Excellent Customer Service. An access rule should also support\nexcellent customer service while conserving court resources, particular court staff. Having\ninformation in electronic form offers more opportunities for easier, less costly access to anyone\ninterested in the information. This consideration relates to how access is provided rather than\nwhether there is access.\n\nSubsection (a)(11) Does Not Unduly Burden The Ongoing Business Of The Judiciary. Finally,\nan access rule and its implementation should not unduly burden the court in delivering its\nfundamental service – resolution of disputes. This consideration relates to how access is provided\nrather than whether there is access. Depending on the manner of public access, unrestricted\npublic access could impinge on the day-to-day operations of the court. This subsection relates\nmore to requests for bulk access (see section 4.30) or for compiled information (see section 4.40)\nthan to the day-to-day, one at a time requests (see section 1.00, subdivision (a)(9)). Limited\npublic resources and high case volume also suggest that courts should not add to their current\ninformation burden by collecting information not needed for immediate judicial decisions, even\nif the collection of this information facilitates subsequent use of the collected information.\nMaking information available in electronic form, and making it remotely accessible, requires\nboth staff and equipment resources. Courts receive a large volume of documents and other\nmaterials daily, and converting them to electronic form may be expensive. As is the case with all\npublic institutions courts have limited resources to perform their work. The interest stated in this\nsubsection attempts to recognize that access is not free, that there may be more than one\napproach to providing, or restricting access, and some approaches are less burdensome than\nothers.\n\n\n\nWho Has Access\nSection 2.00 – Who Has Access under these Rules\n\nEvery member of the public will have the same access to court records as provided in these rules,\nsubject to the provisions of section 4.30(b) and 4.40(c).\n\nIn the official performance of their duties, the following people or entities, because of their\nemployment or relationship to the court, shall not have their access restricted under Sections 4.0\nthrough 4.6:\n\n(a)     court or clerk of court employees;\n(b)     people or entities, private or governmental, who assist the court in providing\n        court services;\n(c)    agencies whose access to court records is defined by another statute, rule, order\n       or policy, and\n(d)    the parties to a case or their lawyers regarding access to the court record in their\n       case.\n\n\n\n               Page 7 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 2.00 (Commentary)\n\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe point of this section is to explicitly state that access is the same for the general public, the\nmedia, and the information industry. Access does not depend on who is seeking access, the\nreason they want the information or what they are doing with it. The section also indicates what\ngroups of people are not subject to access restrictions under these rules.\n\n\n\n\n              Page 8 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\n\nAccess to What\nSection 3.00 – Definitions\nSection 3.10 – Definition of Court Record\n\nFor purposes of these rules:\n\n(a) “Court record” includes:\n\n       (1)     Any document, information, or other thing that is collected, received, or\n               maintained by a court or clerk of court in connection with a judicial\n               proceeding;\n\n       (2)     Any index, calendar, docket, register of actions, official record of the\n               proceedings, order, decree, judgment, minute, and any information in a\n               case management system created by or prepared by the court or clerk of\n               court that is related to a judicial proceeding; and\n\n       (3)     Information maintained by the court or clerk of court pertaining to the\n               administration of the court or clerk of court office and not associated with\n               any particular case.\n\n(b) “Court record” does not include:\n\n       (1)     Other non-court records maintained by the public official who also serves\n               as clerk of court.\n\n       (2)     Information gathered, maintained or stored by a governmental agency or\n               other entity to which the court has access but which is not part of the court\n               record as defined in section 3.10(a)(1).\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section defines the court record broadly. Three categories of information are\nidentified. First are the documents, etc., that constitute what is classically called the case\nfile. The second category is information that is created by the court, some of which\nbecomes part of the court file, but some resides only in documents or databases that are\nnot in a case file. The third category is information that relates to the operation of the\ncourt, but not to a specific case or cases. The definition addresses the content of a court\nrecord, not whether the information is accessible to the public. Limitations and exclusions\nto access are provided for in sections 4.50 and 4.60.\n\nThe rules are intended to apply to every court record, regardless of the manner in which it\n      Page 9 of 44             Privacy and Access Task Force                November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nwas created, the form(s) in which it is stored, or other form(s) in which the information\nmay exist (see section 4.00).\n\nSubsection (a)(1): This definition is meant to be all inclusive of information that is\nprovided to, or made available to, the court that relates to a judicial proceeding. The term\n“judicial proceeding” is used because there may not be a court case in every situation.\nThe definition is not limited to information “filed” with the court or “made part of the\ncourt record” because some types of information the court needs to make a fully informed\ndecision may not be “filed” or technically part of the court record. The language is,\ntherefore, written to include information delivered to, or “lodged” with, the court, even if\nit is not “filed.” An example is a complaint accompanying a motion to waive the filing\nfee based on indigency. The definition is also intended to include exhibits offered in\nhearings or trials, even if not admitted into evidence. The definition includes all\ninformation used by a court to make its decision, even if an appellate court subsequently\nrules that the information should not have been considered or was not relevant to the\njudicial decision made. In order for a court to be held accountable for its decisions all of\nthe information that a court considered and which formed the basis of the court’s decision\nmust be accessible to the public. The language is intended to include within its scope\nmaterials that are submitted to the court, but upon which a court did not act because the\nmatter was withdrawn or the case was resolved or, settled, by the parties. Once relevant\nmaterial has been submitted to the court, it does not become inaccessible because the\ncourt did not, in the end, act on the information in the materials because the parties\nresolved the issue without a court decision.\n\nSubsection (a)(2): The definition is written to cover any information that relates to a\njudicial proceeding generated by the court itself, whether through the court\nadministrator’s personnel or the clerk’s office personnel. This definition applies to\nproceedings conducted by temporary judges or referees hearing cases in an official\ncapacity. This includes two categories of information. One category includes documents,\nsuch as notices, minutes, orders and judgments, which become part of the court record.\nThe second category includes information that is gathered, generated, or kept for the\npurpose of managing the court’s cases. This information may never be in a document; it\nmay only exist as information in a field of a database such as a case management system,\nan automated register of actions, or an index of cases or parties.\n\nSubsection (a)(3): The definition of court record includes some information and records\nmaintained by the court and clerk of court that is related to the management and\nadministration of the court or the clerk’s office, as opposed to a specific case. Examples\nof this category of information include: internal court policies, memoranda and\ncorrespondence, court budget and fiscal records, and other routinely produced\nadministrative records, memos and reports, and meeting minutes. The Commentary to\nsubsection 4.60(b) discusses restriction of access to drafts and work products related to\ncourt administration or clerk’s office administration.\n\n\n\n      Page 10 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force           November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nSubsection (b)(1): This subsection makes it clear that the rules apply only to information\nrelated to court judicial proceedings. The types of information described are not court\nrecords, nor is the court responsible for their collection, maintenance, or accessibility. If\nthe official who also serves as clerk of court has responsibilities for other information and\nrecords, for example records maintained as clerk and recorder, which do not relate to\nspecific judicial proceedings, these rules do not apply to these records. The laws and\naccess policies of the agency responsible for gathering and maintaining the information\ngovern access to such information.\n\nSubsection (b)(2): The definition excludes information gathered, maintained or stored by\nother agencies or entities that is not necessary to, or is not part of the basis of, a court’s\ndecision or the judicial process. Access to this information should be governed by the\nlaws and access policy of the agency collecting and maintaining such information. The\nability of a computer in a court or clerk’s office to access the information because the\ncomputer uses shared software and databases should not, by itself, make the court records\naccess rules applicable to the information. An example of this is information stored in an\nintegrated criminal justice information system where all data is shared by law\nenforcement, the prosecutor, the court, defense counsel, and probation and corrections\ndepartments. The use of a shared system can blur the distinctions between agency records\nand court records. Under this section, if the information is provided to the court as part of\na case or judicial proceeding, the court’s access rules then apply, regardless of where the\ninformation came from or the access rules of that agency. Conversely, if the information\nis not made part of the court record, the access policy applicable to the agency collecting\nthe data still applies even if the information is stored in a shared database.\n\n\nSection 3.20 – Definition of Public Access\n\n“Public access” means that the public may inspect and obtain a copy of the information in\na court record as provided by Montana law.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section defines “public access” very broadly. The unrestricted language implies that\naccess is not conditioned on the reason access is requested or on prior permission being\ngranted by the court. Access is defined to include the ability to obtain a copy of the\ninformation, not just inspect it. The section does not address the form of the copy as\nthere are numerous forms the copy could take, and more will probably become possible\nas technology continues to evolve.\n\nAt a minimum inspection of the court record can be done at the courthouse where the\nrecord is maintained. It can also be done in any other manner determined by the court\nthat makes the most effective use of court staff, provides quality customer service and is\n      Page 11 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.20 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nleast disruptive to the operations of the court – that is, consistent with the principles and\ninterests specified in section 1.00. The inspection can be of the physical record or an\nelectronic version of the court record. Access may be over the counter, by fax, by\nregular mail, by e-mail or by courier. The section does not preclude the court from\nmaking inspection possible via electronic means or other sites, or remotely. It also\npermits a court to satisfy the request to inspect by providing a printed report, computer\ndisk, tape or other storage medium containing the information requested from the court\nrecord. The issue of the cost, if any, must be paid before obtaining a copy is addressed in\nsection 6.0.\n\nThe section implies an equality of the ability to “inspect and obtain a copy” across the\npublic. Implementing this equality will require the court to address several sources of\ninequality of access. Some people have physical impairments that prevent them from\nusing the form of access available to most of the public. The Americans with Disabilities\nAct may require the court or clerk to provide information in a form that is usable to\nsomeone with a disability. Another problem has to do with the existence of a ‘digital\ndivide’ regarding access to information in electronic form. The court should provide\nequivalent access to those who do not have the necessary electronic equipment to obtain\naccess. Finally, there is the issue of the format of electronic information and whether it is\nequally accessible to all computer platforms and operating systems. The court should\nmake electronic information equally available, regardless of the computer used to access\nthe information (in other words, in a manner that is hardware and software independent).\n\nAnother aspect of access is the need to redact restricted information in documents before\nallowing access to the balance of the document (see section 4.60 (a) and associated\ncommentary). In some circumstances this may be quite costly. Lack of, or insufficient,\nresources may present the court with an awkward choice of deciding between funding\nnormal operations and funding activities related to access to court records. As\ntechnology improves it is becoming easier to develop software that allows redaction of\npieces of information in documents in electronic form based on “tags” (such as XML\ntags) accompanying the information. When software to include such tags in documents\nbecomes available and court systems acquire the capability to use the tags, redaction will\nbecome more feasible, allowing the balance of a document to be accessible with little\neffort on the part of the court.\n\n\nSection 3.30 – Definition of Remote Access\n\n“Remote access” means the ability to electronically search, inspect, or copy information\nin a court record without the need to physically visit the court facility where the court\nrecord is maintained.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 12 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\nSection 3.30 (Commentary )\n\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe objective of defining the term “remote access” in Section 3.30 is to describe a means\nof access that is technology neutral. The term is used in section 4.20 regarding\ninformation that should be remotely accessible. The key elements are that: 1) the access\nis electronic, 2) the electronic form of the access allows searching of records, as well as\nviewing and making an electronic copy of the information, 3) a person is not required to\nvisit the courthouse to access the record, and 4) no assistance of court or clerk of court\nstaff is needed to gain access (other than staff maintaining the information technology\nsystems). This definition provides a term that is independent of any particular technology\nor means of access, for example, the Internet or a dial-up system such as the federal\ncourt’s PACER1 system. Remote access may be accomplished electronically by any one\nor more of a number of existing technologies, including dedicated terminal, kiosk, dial-in\nservice, or Internet site. Attaching electronic copies of information to e-mails, and\nmailing or faxing copies of documents in response to a letter or phone request for\ninformation would not constitute remote access under this definition.\n\nSection 3.40 – Definition of “In Electronic Form”\n\nInformation in a court record that is defined in Section 3.10 includes: (a) electronic\nrepresentations of text or graphic documents; (b) an electronic image, including a video\nimage, of a document, exhibit or other thing; (c) data in the fields or files of an electronic\ndatabase; or (d) an audio or video recording, analog or digital, of an event or notes in an\nelectronic file from which a transcript of an event can be prepared.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe breadth of the definition of “in electronic form” makes clear that the rule applies to\ninformation that is available in any type of electronic form. The point of this section is to\ndefine what “in electronic form” means, not to define whether electronic information can\nbe accessed or how it is accessed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) is the automated case management\ninformation system used by the federal courts to provide information about court cases\nthat can be accessed remotely by a subscriber.\n\n\n      Page 13 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.40 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\nSubsection (a): This subsection refers to electronic versions of textual documents (for\nexample documents produced on a word processor, or stored in some other text format\nsuch as PDF format), and pictures, charts, or other graphical representations of\ninformation (for example, graphics files, spreadsheet files, etc.).\n\nSubsection (b): A document might be electronically available as an image of a paper\ndocument produced by scanning, or another imaging technique (but not filming or\nmicrofilming). This document can be viewed on a screen and it appears as a readable\ndocument, but it is not searchable without the aid of OCR (optical character recognition)\napplications that translate the image into a searchable text format. An electronic image\nmay also be one produced of a document or other object through the use of a digital\ncamera, for example in a courtroom as part of an evidence presentation system.\n\nSubsection (c): Montana courts are increasingly using case management systems, data\nwarehouses or similar tools to maintain data about cases and court activities. The rule\napplies equally to this information even though it is not produced or available in paper\nformat unless a report containing the information is generated. This section, as well as\nsubsection (a), would also cover files created for, and transmitted through, an electronic\nfiling system for court documents.\n\nSubsection (d): Evidence can be in the form of audio or videotapes of testimony or\nevents. In addition audio and video recording, electronic recording and computer-aided\ntranscription systems (CAT) using court reporters are increasingly being used to capture\nthe verbatim record of court hearings and trials.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 14 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force           November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\n\nSection 4.00 – Applicability of the Rules\n\nThese rules apply to all court records, regardless of the physical form of the court record,\nthe method of recording the information in the court record or the method of storage of\nthe information in the court record.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe objective of this section is to make it clear that the rules apply to information in the\ncourt record regardless of the form in which the information was created or submitted to\nthe court, the means of gathering, storing or presenting the information, or the form in\nwhich it is maintained. Section 3.10 defines what is considered to be part of the court\nrecord. However, the materials that are contained in the court record come from a variety\nof sources. The materials are offered and kept in a variety of forms. Information in\nelectronic form exists in a variety of formats and databases and can be accessed by a\nvariety of software programs. To support the general principle of open access, the\napplication of the policy must be independent of technology, format and software and,\ninstead, focus on the information itself.\n\nOverview of Section 4.00 Provisions\n\nThree categories of information accessibility are created in the following sections of the\nrules. The first reflects the general principle that information in court records is generally\npresumed to be accessible (section 4.10). Second, there is a section that indicates what\ninformation should be accessible remotely (section 4.20). Following these provisions are\nsections on bulk release of electronic information (section 4.30) and release of compiled\ninformation (section 4.40). A fifth category identifies information prohibited from public\naccess because of overriding privacy or other interests (section 4.50). Finally, having\ndefined what information is accessible and not accessible, there is a section that indicates\nhow to request the prohibition of access to information generally accessible, and how to\ngain access to information to which public access is prohibited (section 4.60).\n\n\n\nSection 4.10 – General Access Rule\n\n(a)    Information in the court record is accessible to the public except as prohibited by\n       section 4.50 or section 4.60(a).\n\n(b)    There shall be a publicly accessible indication of the existence of information in a\n       court record to which access has been prohibited, which indication shall not\n       disclose the content of the information protected.\n\n\n\n      Page 15 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                       Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                    Access to What\n\nSection 4.10 (Cont.)\n\n\n\n  (c)    A local court may not adopt a more restrictive access policy or otherwise\n         restrict access beyond that provided for in these rules, nor provide greater access\n         than that provided for in these rules.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nSubsection (a) states the general premise that information in the court record will be\npublicly accessible unless access is specifically prohibited. There are two exceptions\nnoted. One exception is information in the court record that is specifically excluded from\npublic access by section 4.50. The second exception provides for those individual\nsituations where the court orders a part of the record to be restricted from access pursuant\nto the procedure set forth in section 4.60(a).\n\nThe provision does not require any particular level of access, nor does it require a court to\nprovide access in any particular form, for example, publishing court records in electronic\nform on a web site or dial-in database. (See section 4.20 on information that a court\nshould make available remotely.)\n\nThe provision, by omission, reiterates the concept noted in the commentary to section\n2.00 that access is not conditioned on proper use, nor is the burden on requestors to show\nthey are entitled to access. Subsection (b) provides a way for the public to know that\ninformation exists even though public access to the information itself is prohibited. This\nallows a member of the public to request access to the restricted record under section\n4.60(b), which they would not know to do if the existence of the restricted information\nwas not known. Making the existence of restricted information known enhances the\naccountability of the court. Hiding the existence of information not only reduces\naccountability, it also erodes public trust and confidence in the judiciary when the\nexistence of the information becomes known.\n\nIn addition to disclosing the existence of information that is not available, there is also a\nvalue in indicating how much information is being withheld. For many redactions this\ncould be as simple as using “placeholders,” such as gray boxes, when characters or\nnumbers are redacted, or indicating how many pages have been excluded if part or all of\na document is not accessible. Providing this level of detail about the information\ncontributes to the transparency and credibility of the restriction process and rules.\n\nThere are two situations where this policy presents a dilemma. One is where access is\nrestricted to an entire document and the other concerns a case where the entire file is\nordered sealed. This section requires the existence of the sealed document or file to be\npublic. The problem arises where the disclosing of the existence of a document or case\ninvolving a particular person, as opposed to some of the information in the court record,\nreveals the very information the restriction order seeks to protect. One example would be\n\n        Page 16 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nthe title of a document in a register of actions which describes the type or nature of the\ninformation to which access restrictions is being sought. These problems can be avoided,\nto some extent, by using a more generic description in the caption of a document, using a\npseudonym, or some other unique identifier instead of the party's full or real name. This\nsection requires disclosure of the existence of sealed information in the interest of a more\nopen judicial record.\n\nSection 4.30 (c) is provided for in the rules to promote consistency and predictability\nacross courts; it also furthers equal access to courts and court records.\n\n\nSection 4.20 – Court Records In Electronic Form Presumptively Subject to\nRemote Access by the Public\n\nThe following information in court records should receive the highest priority for remote\naccess by the public if available in electronic form, unless public access is restricted\npursuant to sections 4.50 or 4.60(a):\n\n    a. Litigant/party indexes to cases filed with the court;\n    b. Listings of new case filings, including the names of the parties;\n    c. Register of actions showing what documents have been filed in a case;\n    d. Calendars or dockets of court proceedings, including the case number and\n       caption, date and time of hearing, and location of hearing;\n    e. Judgments, orders, or decrees in a case and liens affecting title to real property.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nSeveral types of information in court records have traditionally been given wider public\ndistribution than merely making them publicly accessible at the courthouse. Task force\nmembers agreed that the types of information listed in Section 4.20 should receive the\nhighest priority for automation and remote access.\n\nThe summary or general nature of the information is such that there is little risk of harm\nto an individual or unwarranted invasion of privacy or proprietary business interests.\n\nWhile not every court, or every automated system, is capable of providing this type of\naccess, courts are encouraged to develop the capability to do so. The listing of\ninformation that should be made remotely available in no way is intended to imply that\nother information should not be made remotely available. Some court’s automated\nsystems may also make more information available remotely to litigants and their lawyers\nthan is available to the public, but this is outside the scope of these rules.\n\nMaking certain types of information remotely accessible allows the court to make cost\n         Page 17 of 44             Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.20 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\neffective use of public resources provided for its operation. If the information is not\navailable, someone requesting the information will have to call the court or come down to\nthe courthouse and request the information. Public resources will be consumed with court\nstaff locating case files containing the record or information, providing it to the requestor,\nand returning the case file to the shelf. If the requestor can obtain the information\nremotely, without involvement of court staff, there will be less use of court resources.\n\nIn implementing this section a court should be mindful about what specific pieces of\ninformation are appropriately remotely accessible. Care should be taken that the release\nof information is consistent with all provisions of the access rules, especially regarding\npersonal identification information. For example, the information remotely accessible\nshould not include information presumptively excluded from public access pursuant to\nsection 4.50, prohibited from public access by court order pursuant to 4.60(a).\n\nSubsection (e): One role of the judiciary, in resolving disputes, is to state the respective\nrights, obligations and interests of the parties to the dispute. This declaration of rights,\nobligations and interests usually is in the form of a judgment or other type of final order.\nJudgments or final orders have often had greater public accessibility by a statutory\nrequirement that they be recorded in a “judgment roll” or some similar practice. One\nreason this is done is to simplify public access by placing all such information in one\nplace, rather than making someone step through numerous individual case files to find\nthem. Recognizing such practices, the policy specifically encourages this information to\nbe remotely accessible if in electronic form.\n\nThere are circumstances where information about charges and convictions in criminal\ncases can change over time, which could mean copies of such listings derived from court\nrecords can become inaccurate unless updated. These circumstances suggest that there be\na disclaimer associated with such information, and that education about these possibilities\nbe provided to litigants and the public.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 18 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\n\nSection 4.30 – Requests for Bulk Distribution of Court Records\n\nBulk distribution is defined as the distribution of all, or a significant subset, of the\ninformation in court records, as is and without modification or compilation.\n\n(a)     Bulk distribution of information in the court record is permitted for court records\n        that are publicly accessible under section 4.10 and not prohibited by state law.\n\n(b)     A request for bulk distribution of information not publicly accessible can be made\n        to the court where the identification of specific individuals is ancillary to the\n        purpose of the inquiry. Prior to the release of information pursuant to this\n        subsection the requestor must comply with the provisions of section 4.40(c).\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section addresses requests for large volumes of information in court records, as\nopposed to requesting information from a particular case or reformulated information\nfrom several cases (see section 4.40). The section authorizes bulk distribution for\ninformation that is publicly accessible. It also sets out a method of requesting bulk\ndistribution of information to which public access is restricted.\n\nThere are advantages to allowing bulk access to court records. Allowing the public to\nobtain information from court records from a third party may reduce the number of\nrequests to the court for the records. Fewer requests mean less court staff resources\ndevoted to answering inquiries and requests. However, there are costs associated with\nmaking the records available. There may also be technology, as well as cost, issues in\nproviding bulk distribution of information. For example, a court’s systems may not be\nable to identify and separate publicly accessible information from restricted information\nin creating a copy of information for bulk distribution. Permitting bulk distribution of\ninformation in this circumstance assumes providing the data will not interfere with the\nnormal operations of the court. There is also the ‘cost’ of reduced public confidence in\nthe judiciary from the existence of inaccurate, stale or incorrectly linked information\navailable through third parties but derived from court records.\n\nIn allowing bulk data to be disseminated a court should be mindful not to gather\ninformation that it does not need to fulfill its judicial role, even if those requesting bulk\ninformation are interested in obtaining this information.\n\n\nSubsection (a). Bulk transfer is allowed for information that is publicly accessible under\nthese rules, however, task force members noted that § 2-6-109, MCA prohibits public\nagencies from distributing or selling for use as a mailing list any list of persons without\nfirst securing the permission of those on the list; and that a list of persons prepared by the\nagency may not be used as a mailing list except by the agency or another agency without\nfirst securing the permission of those on the list. There is no constitutional or other basis\n\n      Page 19 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.30 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nfor providing greater access to bulk requestors than to the public generally, and this\nsection implies there should be no less access. Consistent with section 3.20, public\naccess, including bulk access, is not dependent upon the reason the access is sought or the\nproposed use of the data. Court information provided through bulk distribution can be\ncombined with information from other sources. Information from court records may be\nlinked with other information and may be used for purposes that are unrelated to why the\ninformation was provided to the court in the first place. It is significant to note that\ntransferring information in the court record into databases that are then beyond the\ncourt’s control creates the very real likelihood that the information will, over time,\nbecome incomplete, inaccurate, stale or contain information that has been removed from\nthe court’s records. Keeping information distributed in bulk current may require the court\nto provide “refreshed” information on a frequent, regular and periodic basis. This may\nraise issues of availability of court resources to do this. Although creating liability or\npenalties on the third party information provider might reduce the risk of stale or\nincorrect information being distributed, meeting this standard still requires the court to\nprovide updated and new information on a frequent basis.\n\nA particular problem with bulk distribution of criminal conviction information has to do\nwith expungement policies. If the intent of an expungement policy is to “erase” a\nconviction, the public policy may be impossible to implement if the information is\nalready in another database as a result of a bulk transfer of the information. An approach\nneeds to be devised that accommodates expungement and bulk distribution. Potential\nmass access to electronic court information further highlights the question of the accuracy\nof the court’s records. This is particularly important for databases created by court or\nclerk of court employees. The potential for bulk distribution of the information in a court\ndatabase will require courts and clerks to be even more vigilant about both the accuracy\nof their databases and the timeliness of entering information into them.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 20 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force          November 2006\n\f                Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                             Access to What\n\n\nSection 4.40 – Access to Compiled Information from Court Records\n\n(a)    Compiled information is defined as information that is derived from the selection,\n       aggregation or reformulation by the court of some of the information from more\n       than one individual court record.\n\n(b)    Any member of the public may request compiled information that consists solely\n       of information that is publicly accessible and that is not already available pursuant\n       to section 4.20 or in an existing report. The court shall compile and provide the\n       information if it determines that the resources are available to compile the\n       information. The court may delegate to its staff or the clerk of court the authority\n       to make the initial determination as to whether to provide compiled information.\n\n(c)    Compiled information that includes information to which public access has been\n       restricted may be requested by any member of the public pursuant to Section 4.6.\n\n       The request shall:\n\n         1) identify what information is sought,\n         2) explain provisions for the secure protection of any information requested to\n            which public access is restricted or prohibited.\n         3) if the request is granted, the court may require the requestor to sign a\n            declaration that:\n\n               i. The data will not be sold or otherwise distributed, directly or\n                  indirectly, to third parties, except for journalistic purposes,\n\n              ii. The information will not be used directly or indirectly to sell a product\n                  or service to an individual or the general public, except for journalistic\n                  purposes, and/ or\n\n             iii. The court may make such additional orders as may be needed to\n                  protect information to which access has been restricted or prohibited.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 21 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\nSection 4.40\n\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section authorizes access to compiled information. The section describes how the\ncompiled information is requested, the requirements for obtaining compiled information,\nand possible limitations on using the information.\n\nThe primary interests served by release of compiled information are supporting the role\nof the judiciary, promoting the accountability of the judiciary, and providing public\neducation regarding the judiciary. Compiled data allows analysis and comparison of court\ndecisions across cases, across judges and across courts. This information can also educate\nthe public about the judicial process. It can provide guidance to individuals in the conduct\nof their everyday life and business. Although some judges may have legitimate concerns\nabout misuse of compiled data, for example in comparing the decisions of judges, such an\nanalysis is one approach to monitoring the performance of the judiciary.\n\nCompiled data also allows the study of the effectiveness of the judiciary and the laws\nenforced in courts. For example, the studies of delay reduction leading to improved case\nmanagement and faster case processing times were based on analysis of compiled data\nfrom thousands of cases in over a hundred courts across the country. In allowing\ncompiled data to be disseminated a court should be mindful not to gather information that\nit does not need to fulfill its judicial role, even if those requesting compiled information\nare interested in obtaining this information.\n\nSubsection (a) provides a definition of compiled information. Compiled information is\ndifferent from case-by-case access because it involves information from more than one\ncase. Compiled information is different from bulk access in that it involves only some of\nthe information from some cases and the information has been reformulated or\naggregated; it is not just a copy of all the information in the court’s records. Essentially\ncompiled information involves the creation of a new court record. In order to provide\ncompiled information a court generally must write a computer program to select the\nspecific cases or information sought in the request, or otherwise use court resources to\nidentify, gather, and copy the information.\n\nGenerating compiled data may require court resources and generating the compiled\ninformation may compete with the normal operations of the court for resources, which\nmay be a reason for the court not to compile the information. It may be less costly for the\ncourt and less of an impact on the court to, instead, provide bulk distribution of the\nrequested information pursuant to section 4.30, and let the requestor, rather than the\n      Page 22 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.40 (Commentary, cont.)\n\ncourt, compile the information.\n\nSubsection (b) addresses requests for information that is publicly available. Since public\nresources are used in responding to the request, the question for the court is whether\nresponding meets criteria established by the court for providing such information, and\nwhether the court will choose to expend available resources on the request.\n\nThe reference in section 4.40(b) to section 4.20 and existing reports is intended to limit\nthe section’s application to requests for compiled data that are not already routinely\nprepared and made public. Party name indices, or a screen that reports the results of a\nname search of either civil or criminal cases, are examples of compiled information that\nalready exist.\n\nSection 4.40(c) addresses requests for information that is not publicly accessible. Since\nthe information is not publicly accessible, the section provides for protections of the\nrestricted information.\n\nThe exception for “journalistic purposes” in subdivisions 4.40(c) is included as a\nrecognition that what journalism sells is information, and prohibiting a journalist from\nselling the information may defeat the purpose of providing the information to the\njournalist in the first place.\n\nSubdivision 4.40(c) further identifies possible provisions for preventing improper\ndisclosure of restricted or prohibited information. A state or individual court’s policy\nmight also consider a requirement of a nondisclosure agreement that includes injunctive\nrelief and indemnities for improper disclosure. In order to get a court order releasing the\ninformation the appropriate nondisclosure agreement must be signed by the requestor.\n\nThe enforcement of restrictions on the use or dissemination of information provided\npresents additional issues that the courts must address. One option is for courts to refuse\nto continue supplying compiled data to a certain organization, or on a certain subject, if\nabuses occur. Another option is to create, or strengthen, penalties for the release of\ninformation to which access is restricted under these rules.\n\nThe distribution of both publicly accessible and protected data also presents ancillary\nissues. Analysis of the data without a full understanding of the meaning of the data\nelements or codes used, or without a full understanding the limitations of the data, can\nresult in conclusions not substantiated by the data. To some extent this can be addressed\nby explanatory information provided with the transmittal of the compiled information.\n\n\n      Page 23 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force           November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.40 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nAnother concern arises with release of compiled data in electronic form. This is the\nresult of the nature of electronic records, which are an atypical subset of data from all\ncourt records. As electronic versions of information become more available, skewing\narises between what is available in electronic form, versus paper form. Compiled data\nfrom the electronic record may, therefore, not be representative of all cases. The fact that\nvery little information prior to a certain date is available in electronic form could also\ncause significant skewing. If historical records are not scanned or otherwise converted\ninto electronic form, the electronic records will only be recent cases or newer information\nin older cases. There are no obvious ways to avoid this problem, assuming the cost of\nproducing electronic versions of all existing records is prohibitive.\n\nFinally, an extracted set of information is a snapshot of the information, whereas the\ndatabase from which the information is extracted is dynamic, constantly changing and\ngrowing.\n\n\nSection 4.50 – Court Records Excluded from Public Access\n\nThe following information in a court record is not accessible to the public:\n\n(a)     Information that is not to be accessible to the public pursuant to state law; and\n\n(b)     Information that is not to be accessible to the public pursuant to federal law.\n\n(c)     The following information is not available without leave of the court:\n\n        (1)      Complete social security numbers;\n        (2)      Complete financial account numbers;\n        (3)      Full names of minor children, unless state law requires a child’s name to\n                 be accessible to the public;\n        (4)      Full birth dates of any person.\n\n(d)     It is the responsibility of the filing party to comply with these rules to protect\nprivate information.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 24 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\nSection 4.50 (Commentary)\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe objective of this section is to identify those categories of information to which public\naccess will be prohibited. The concept of the section is that for certain types of\ninformation an existing statute, rule or case law expresses a policy determination, made\nby the Legislature or the judiciary, that the presumption of public access has been\novercome by an individual’s right to privacy, and that the prohibition of public access\napplies on a categorical, as opposed to a case-by-case, basis.\n\nThe section suggests two possible sources of restrictions on access to information. The\nfirst is state law. The following commentary provides several lists of categories that are\ncurrently found in state statute, rule or case law. The second source is federal law,\nalthough there are few, if any, such limitations. The inclusion of the various federal\nlaws in the Commentary that do restrict the distribution of some information, but have\nnot been found to apply to the distribution of court records, is intended to provide\ncourt administrators with a convenient resource to ensure that administrators have an\naccurate understanding of those federal laws so misapprehension of these provisions will\nnot be an obstacle to the efficient and appropriate release of court records.\n\n\nSubsection (a) - State law: Information that is not accessible to the public pursuant to\nstate law generally falls into two categories. First are case types where the records of the\nentire court proceedings are presumptively sealed. These are:\n\n1.      Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings and Proceedings Brought to Terminate\nParental Rights Based Upon Abuse or Neglect of the Child. All court records pertaining\nto actions taken under Title 41, Chapter 3 are not open for public inspection unless the\ncourt “finds disclosure to be necessary for the fair resolution of the issue before it.” § 41-\n3-205 (2), MCA;\n\n2.      Involuntary Commitment Proceedings pursuant to Title 53, part 21, Mental\nIllness. Court records in these matters must be sealed five days prior to release of\nrespondent and only opened for “good cause shown.” § 53-21-103, MCA.\n\n3.     Minor’s names. State law requires the disclosure of a minor’s identity in some\ncircumstances. Disclosure may be required pursuant to a specific statutory mandate or\npursuant to a statutory provision applicable to both adults and minors where disclosure is\nrequired and no exception for the disclosure of a minor’s identity has been established.\nSection 4.50 (Commentary)\n\n      Page 25 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\nExamples of such provisions are the traffic regulation laws. See generally Title 61,\nChapter 8, MCA. In those situations where state law does not require the disclosure of\nminor’s names, the task force supports the use of fictitious names to refer to minors\nwhose names would otherwise be included in court records accessible to the public, such\nas victims or witnesses. We agree that the use of initials to accomplish this purpose,\ngiven Montana’s modest population, does not accord the privacy warranted in these\nsituations.\n\n4.      Formal Youth Court Records. These records are physically sealed on the youth’s\n18th birthday, or, in cases where “jurisdiction of the court or any agency is extended\nbeyond the youth’s 18th birthday, the records” are sealed when the extended jurisdiction\nhas ended. § 41-5-216 (1), MCA. Prior to this time, these records are\nopen to public inspection, except for the “social, medical and psychological records,\nyouth assessment materials, predispositional studies and supervision records of\nprobationer” which may be accessed only by those designated in § 41-5-215 (2), MCA\n\n        However, medical records, fingerprints, DNA records, photographs, youth traffic\nrecords, or “records in any case in which the youth did not fulfill all requirements of the\ncourt’s judgment or disposition” as well as records identified in § 42-3-203, MCA, and\n § 45-5-624 (7), MCA are exempt from these sealing provisions. § 41-5-216 (4), MCA;\n\n5.     Informal Youth Court Records. Informal youth court records must also be\nphysically sealed on the youth’s 18th birthday, or, if jurisdiction has been extended, they\nmust be sealed when the jurisdiction has ended. § 41-5-216 (7), MCA.\nHowever, these youth records may only be inspected by youth court personnel prior to\nthe youth’s 18th birthday, and only when there is a new offense;\n\n6.      Conciliation Court Proceedings. All district court hearings or conferences under\nthis chapter shall be closed unless opened to inspection by parties or counsel upon\njudicial order. § 40-3-116, MCA.\n\n7.      Parentage Proceedings. All hearings or trials held under Title 40, part 6 must be\nheld in closed court without admittance of any person other than those necessary to the\naction. All records other than the final judgment are only subject to inspection by\nconsent of court and all interested persons or in exceptional cases, only upon an order\n“for good cause shown.” § 40-6-120, MCA;\n\n\n\n4.50 (Commentary, cont)\n\n\n\n      Page 26 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\n8.      Adoption Proceedings. All papers and records concerning adoption “must be kept\nas a permanent record of the court and must be withheld from inspection,” and may only\nbe distributed pursuant to a court order when good cause is shown, pursuant to the state\nstatutory provisions regarding the collection of vital statistics or for purposes of child\nsupport enforcement and other narrow circumstances provided within Title 42, Chapter 6,\npart 1. § 42-6-101, MCA;\n\n9.     Proceedings Regarding the Abuse or Neglect of Elderly Persons and Persons with\nDevelopmental Disabilities. All actions presumed confidential and not released to public\nunless by court order or action of law. § 52-3-813, MCA;\n\n10.     Proceedings Under Parental Notice of Abortion Act. This statute has been\nenjoined from enforcement by the First Judicial District Court of Montana. A minor\npetitioning to judicially bypass parental notification must be provided the option of using\na pseudonym or initials and all documents related to the petition are confidential and are\nnot available to the public. § 50-20-212(3), MCA;\n\n11.     Guardianship and Conservatorship Proceedings. Such proceedings must be\nclosed if requested by the person alleged to be incapacitated or his or her counsel. § 72-\n5-315 (4), MCA;\n\n12.     Grand Jury Proceedings. Courts “shall order a hearing on matters affecting a\ngrand jury proceeding to be closed.” § 46-11-307, MCA. Disclosure of these\nproceedings is limited and generally may not be made to the public unless authorized by\nthe district court. § 46-11-317, MCA;\n\n13.    Investigative Subpoena Proceedings. These proceedings are subject to the same\nsecrecy and disclosure provisions as grand jury proceedings. § 46-4-304 (2), MCA;\n\n14.     Dissolution of Marriage, Criminal Conversation or Seduction. Courts are\nauthorized to exclude everyone from the courtroom except the officers of the court, the\nparties, their witnesses, and counsel for the trial of any issue of fact in these proceedings.\n§ 3-1-313 (2), MCA;\n\n15.     Supervision Proceedings by Insurance Commissioner. All records of the\nproceedings of actions taken under § 33-2-1321 and § 33-2-1322 are to be confidential,\nunless the district court orders otherwise. § 33-2-1323, MCA.\n\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\nThe Second category is information contained in court records that are not sealed, which\n      Page 27 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nstate law recognizes as sufficiently private to prohibit public access:\n\n1.       The address, telephone number, or place of employment of a victim of a criminal\noffense or a member of the victim’s family if the victim requests confidentiality, unless\nthis information “is of the location of the crime scene” or disclosure of this information\n“is required by law, is necessary for law enforcement purposes, or is authorized by a\ndistrict count upon a showing of good cause.” § 44-5-311 (1), MCA;\n\n2.       All information identifying the victim of certain sexual crimes, unless that\ninformation “is of the location of the crime scene” or the disclosure of this information\n“is required by law, is necessary for law enforcement purposes, or is authorized by a\ndistrict count upon a showing of good cause.” § 44-5-311 (3), MCA. These crimes are\nsexual assault, § 45-5-502, , sexual intercourse without consent, § 45-5-503, MCA,\nindecent exposure, § 45-5-504, MCA, and incest, § 45-5-507, MCA;\n\n3.     A defendant’s DNA information disclosed during a criminal proceeding. §§ 44-6-\n106, 108, MCA;\n\n4.      Videotapes that are part of the record in cases involving sexual offenses.\nVideotapes “which are part of the court record are subject to a protective order of the\ncourt for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the victim.” § 46-15-403, MCA;\n\n5.      Pre-sentence investigation reports, pursuant to § 46-18-113, MCA;\n\n6.     Notice by prosecutor of other crimes, wrongs or acts. Notice must be filed and\nsealed until the time of trial or until a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is entered by the\ndefendant. § 46-13-109 (3), MCA;\n\n7.      Confidential criminal justice information. Dissemination of confidential criminal\njustice information is restricted to criminal justice agencies, to those authorized by law to\nreceive it, and to those authorized by court order upon a written finding that the demands\nof individual privacy do not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure. § 44-5-303,\nMCA;\n\n8.     Will filed with court. A will filed with the court must be sealed and kept\nconfidential during the testator’s lifetime. § 72-2-535, MCA;\n\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\n9.     Writs of attachment. The fact of the filing of the complaint or the issuing of such\nattachment cannot be disclosed to the public until after the filing of return of service of\n      Page 28 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nattachment. § 27-18-111, MCA;\n\n10.     Medical information provided for marriage license. All medical certificates,\nlaboratory statements and reports and information provided pursuant to 40-1-203 through\n40-1-209 are confidential and may not be disclosed to anyone other than state or local\nhealth officials. § 40-1-208, MCA;\n\n11.    Confidential information in certificate of marriage or dissolution of marriage.\nDisclosure of confidential information in certificate of marriage or dissolution of\nmarriage for statistical purposes is prohibited unless disclosure is specifically authorized\nby law for statistical or research purposes or unless ordered by a court. § 50-15-121 (6),\nMCA;\n\n12.     Confidential information in birth records. Disclosure of “confidential\ninformation” in birth records for medical or health use is prohibited unless disclosure is\nspecifically authorized by law for statistical or research purposes or unless ordered by a\ncourt. § 50-15-121 (6), MCA.\n\nSubsection (b) Federal Law: There are several types of information that are commonly,\nif incorrectly, considered to be protected from public disclosure by federal law.\n\nAlthough the laws or regulations may prohibit a federal agency, federal employees, or\ncertain other specifically designated parties from disclosing certain information, the\nprohibitions generally do not extend to disclosure by state courts where the\ninformation has become a part of the court record. Parties should take note that these\nfederal laws or regulations may apply to them when they introduce restricted information\nonto the court records, which may require the individuals to request the court to restrict\naccess under sections 4.50 or 4.60(a). Each category is discussed below.\n\nSocial Security Numbers. Although there may be restrictions on federal agencies\ndisclosing Social Security Numbers (SSNs), they do not apply to state or local agencies\nsuch as courts. One provision of the Social Security Acts does bar disclosure by state\nand local governments of SSNs collected pursuant to any law enacted on or after October\n1, 1990. 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C)(vii)(I). Assuming the section is applicable to state\ncourts (there is some question about this), it would only apply to laws authorizing courts\nto collect SSNs that were adopted after this date. One possible example of this may be the\nlaw passed in the mid 1990s to facilitate child support collection that requires inclusion of\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nSSNs in orders granting dissolution of marriage, establishing child support or\ndetermining paternity. 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C)(ii). There does not appear to be any\nconsensus as to whether the non-disclosure provision applies to, or is superseded by, the\n      Page 29 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nnewer collection requirement.\n\nFederal income or business tax returns. Federal law prohibits disclosure of tax returns by\nfederal agencies or employees, but the prohibition does not extend to disclosure by\nothers.\n\nEducational information protected by federal law. FERPA protects information about\nstudents receiving federal aid from disclosure by a university or public school system, but\nit does not address disclosure of such information in a court record. 20 U.S.C. § 1232 g.\n\nHealth and medical information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996 (HIPAA) and regulations adopted pursuant to it limit disclosure of certain health\nrelated information about people by certain healthcare entities. 42 U.S.C. § 1320d; 45\nC.F.R. Part 160 and 164. Whether the limitation extends to state court records is not\nclear, however, state courts are not included within the definition of health care entities\nthat are covered by HIPAA. There are also federal restrictions regarding information in\nalcohol and drug abuse patient records and requiring confidentiality of information\nacquired by drug court programs. 42 U.S.C. § 290 dd - 2.\n\nCriminal History Information. There are federal regulations generally restricting the use\nof criminal history information contained in criminal records repositories maintained by\nexecutive branch agencies, particularly non-conviction information, to criminal justice\npurposes. The provisions do not extend to information once it becomes part of a court\nrecord in a case; nor do they extend to court records containing criminal conviction\ninformation.\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Federal regulations implementing the Americans with\nDisabilities Act provides that employers must segregate and keep confidential all\ninformation regarding medical examinations of employees required by the employer that\nare job-related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. § 12112, 29 C.F.R. §\n1630.14 (c)(1). Thus, to the extent that personnel records of court employees are\nidentified as court records under these rules, federal law would prohibit the distribution of\nthose records to the public.\n\nResearch Involving Human Subjects. There are federal regulations establishing practices\nand, in certain circumstances, prohibiting disclosure of certain personal identifier\ninformation gathered in the course of federally funded research on human subjects. 28\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nC.F.R. Part 46 and 45 C.F.R. section 46. This does not apply to information gathered by\na state court in the normal course of judicial business, but it might apply to individuals\n\n      Page 30 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\nrequesting information from court records for research purposes under section 4.30 (bulk\naccess) or section 4.40 (compiled access). 28 C.F.R. § 46.101 (b)(4).\n\nSubsection (c) Finally, the task force determined that there are few if any circumstances\nwhere merits of public disclosure of social security numbers, financial account numbers,\nminor children and birth dates would outweigh the privacy interests implicated. Thus, in\nlight of the absence of specific state or federal protection of such information when\ncontained in court records that are otherwise accessible to the public, the task force feels\nit is necessary to include this protection in these court rules.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to comply with this rule. The task force believes that the\nfollowing are the most effective ways to accomplish this purpose:\n\n1.      Social security numbers. The task force recommends the disclosure of no more\nthan the last four digits of the social security number. However, as the task force does\nnot have the specific expertise to determine the implications of the publication of just\npartial social security numbers upon the individual’s privacy interests, this\nrecommendation is provisional. The task force would recommend to the Court that\nduring the public comment period, a special invitation be made to members of the public\nwho have this specific expertise so the implications of even partial disclosure of social\nsecurity numbers can be thoroughly explored.\n\n2.      Financial account numbers. The task force supports the disclosure of only the\nlast four digits of any such account. As with the prior recommendation, however, this\nrecommendation is provisional, as the task force does not have the specific expertise to\ndetermine the implications of the publication of partial financial account numbers upon\nthe individual’s the privacy interests. The task force would recommend to the Court that\nduring the public comment period, a special invitation be made to members of the public\nwho have this specific expertise so the implications of even partial disclosure of financial\naccount numbers can be thoroughly explored.\n\n3.      Minor’s names. In those situations where state law does not otherwise require\nthe disclosure of minor’s names, the task force supports the use of fictitious names to\nrefer to children victims or witnesses in court records accessible to the public. We agree\nthat the use of initials to accomplish this purpose does not, given Montana’s modest\npopulation, accord the privacy warranted in these situations.\n\n4.      Full birth dates of any person. The task force supports the disclosure of only\nthe birth year, and not the month or date of birth.\n\n\n\n\n     Page 31 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f          Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                       Access to What\n\n\n\n\nPage 32 of 44     Privacy and Access Task Force      November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\nSection 4.60 - Requests to Prohibit Public Access to Information in Court\nRecords Or to Obtain Access to Restricted Information\n\n(a)    A motion or request to prohibit public access to information in a court record may\n       be made by any party to a case, the individual about whom information is present\n       in the court record, the clerk of court, or on the court's own motion. The court\n       must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to prohibit access by\n       determining whether the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits\n       of public disclosure.\n\n       The court should require that a party file a motion to protect the information, with\n       the information to be protected in a sealed envelope lodged, but not filed, with the\n       court. If the court grants the motion or request, the information will be filed\n       under seal. If the court denies the request, the party will have the option to file\n       the information with knowledge that it will be accessible to the public.\n\n(b)    In restricting access the court will use the least restrictive means that will achieve\n       the purposes of the access rules and the needs of the requestor.\n\n       A request to obtain access to information in a court record to which access is\n       prohibited under section 4.50 or 4.60(a) of these rules may be made by any\n       member of the public or on the court's own motion upon notice as provided in\n       subsection 4.60(c). The court must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to\n       prohibit access by determining whether the demand of individual privacy clearly\n       exceeds the merits of public disclosure. When the request is made for bulk or\n       compiled information to which public access has been prohibited under Section\n       4.50 and 4.60 (a) of these rules, the court should consider the actions provided in\n       section 4.40 (c) when making such a determination.\n\n(c)    The following is the process for making requests described in 4.50(a) and 4.50 (b)\n       where that process is not provided in statute or case law. The request shall be\n       made by a written motion to the court. The requestor will give notice to all\n       parties in the case except as prohibited by law. The court may require notice to be\n       given by the requestor or another party to any individuals or entities identified in\n       the information that is the subject of the request. When the request is for access\n       to information to which access was previously prohibited under section 4.60(a),\n       the court will provide notice to the individual or entity that requested that access\n       be prohibited either itself or by directing a party to give the notice.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 33 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                    Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                 Access to What\n\n4.60 (Commentary)\n\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section lays out the basic considerations and processes for prohibiting access to\notherwise publicly available information (often referred to as sealing), or opening access\nto restricted information (whether restricted under section 4.50 or section 4.60(a)). The\nlanguage incorporates the presumption of openness, and the need for sufficient grounds\nto overcome the presumption. The section also specifies the mechanism for making the\nrequest and directs the court to use the least restrictive approach possible when restricting\npublic access. The section reflects that the consideration must be made by the court on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nSubsection (a) allows anyone who is identified in the court record to request prohibition\nof public access. This specification is quite broad, including a witness in a case or\nsomeone about whom personally identifiable information is present in the court record,\nbut who is not a party to the action. While the reach of the rule is quite broad, this is\nrequired to meet the intent of subsection 1.00 (a)(6) regarding protection of individual\nprivacy rights and interests, not just the privacy rights and interests of parties to a case.\nProtection is available for someone who is referred to in the case, but does not have the\noptions or protections a party to the case would have.\n\nSubsection (a) provides only for prohibiting access to information, not prohibiting access\nto the existence of the information. Section 4.10(b) specifically provides that the\nexistence of information to which access is prohibited will be publicly accessible.\nSubsection (a) does not have any restrictions regarding when the request can be made,\nimplying it can be done at any time.\n\nThis subsection provides that it is the court that will decide whether access will be\nprohibited. Even if all parties agree that public access to information should be\nprohibited, this is not binding on the court, which must still make the decision based on\nthe applicable law.\n\nSubsection (a) also addresses what access is permitted between the time a request to\nprohibit access is made and the court rules on the request. This is particularly critical if\nthe request is made simultaneously with the filing of the information. It is also more\ncritical where the parties represent themselves and are unaware of appropriate\nprocedures. A court should require that a party file a motion to prohibit access with the\ninformation to be protected in a sealed envelope being lodged, but not filed, with the\ncourt. If the court grants the request, the information can be filed with prohibition to\n      Page 34 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\n4.60 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\naccess. If the request is denied, the party has the option of filing the information without\nprohibition of access, or not filing it. In order to avoid the misuse of such a provision to\nachieve at least temporary restriction, a court should establish procedures that provide for\nprompt consideration of a request to prohibit access.\n\nThe last paragraph to subsection (a) requires the court to seek an approach that minimizes\nthe amount of information that cannot be accessed, as opposed to an \"all or nothing\"\napproach. This is directed at the question of what to do about a document or other\nmaterial in the court record that contains some information to which access should be\nprohibited along with other information that remains publicly accessible. The issue\nbecomes one of whether it is technically possible to redact some information from a\ndocument and to allow the balance of the document to be publicly available. Less\nrestrictive methods include redaction of pieces of information in the record, sealing of\nonly certain pages of a document, as opposed to the entire document, or sealing of a\ndocument, but not the entire file. As noted previously (see commentary under section\n3.20) newer technologies permit tagging of information in an electronic records in a way\nthat readily allows electronic redaction of pieces of information in an electronic\ndocument, and courts are encouraged to obtain this capability when acquiring new\nsystems. As discussed in the commentary to section 4.10, other approaches to restricting\naccess to names would preferably include using pseudonyms or other unique identifier\nrather than a full or real name.\n\nIn addition to whether it is technically possible, there may be an issue of whether it is\nfeasible to redact information in a record, and whether the court or clerk has the resources\nto do so. The work needed to exhaustively review a large file or document to find\ninformation to be redacted may be prohibitive, such that access to the whole file or\ndocument would be restricted, rather than attempting redaction.\n\nThere is information that may be contained in court records which has not been protected\nin state statute, but may raise significant privacy interests that individuals may seek to\nprotect pursuant to this section.\n\n1.      Medical records; State v. Nelson, (1997) 283 Mont. 231, 242, 941 P.2d 441, 448.\nThese records may include descriptions or analysis of a person’s DNA or genetic\nmaterial, biometric identifiers, psychological evaluations, examination, diagnosis,\nevaluation or treatment records and photographs. In addition to court files in connection\nwith a specific case, such information may also be found jury questionnaires (see\ndiscussion below);\n\n\n      Page 35 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\n4.60 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\n2.

Other\nindividuals who may similarly be in actual jeopardy could include victims in stalking or\ndomestic violence cases, informants or potential or sworn jurors in a criminal case.

Information gathered or created during the investigatory phase related to alleged\nmisconduct by entities or individuals regulated by the judiciary.\nSubsection (b) specifically allows a court to consider providing access to information to\nwhich access is categorically prohibited under section 4.50, as well as specific\ninformation in a court record to which access has previously been prohibited by a court\npursuant to section 4.60(a). This subsection addresses those situations where the reasons\nfor prohibiting access no longer apply or have changed so that the merits of public\ndisclosure of the information now outweigh the interest in privacy. .\n\nSubsection (b) provides a standard and procedure for reviewing a previous decision to\nprohibit public access to information.\n\nSubsection (b) provides that \"any member of the public\" can make the request for access\nto prohibited information. This term is defined broadly in section 2.00, and includes the\nmedia and business entities as well as individuals.\n\nSubsection (c) contemplates a written motion seeking to prohibit, or gain, access.\nAlthough a motion is specified, the section is silent as to the need for oral argument or\ntestimony, leaving this up to the court. Notice is required to be given to all parties by the\nrequestor, except where prohibited by law.\" The subsection gives the court discretion to\nrequire notice to be given to others identified in the information that is the subject of the\nrequest. If public access to the information was restricted by a prior request, the\nsubsection requires the court to arrange for notice to be given to the person who made the\nprior request. The process for seeking review by an appellate court is not specified in the\npolicy, as the normal appeal process for a judicial decision is assumed to apply.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 37 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\n\n\n\nWhen Accessible\nSection 5.00 – When Court Records May Be Accessed\n\n(a)    Court records will be available for public access in the courthouse during hours\n       established by the court. Court records in electronic form to which the court\n       allows remote access under these rules will be available for access at least during\n       the hours established by the court for courthouse access, subject to unexpected\n       technical failures or normal system maintenance announced in advance.\n\n(b)    Upon receiving a request for access to information the court will respond within a\n       reasonable time regarding the availability of the information and provide the\n       information within a reasonable time.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section requires a court to specify when court records are accessible. The rules\ndirect, as a minimum, that remote access be available at the same times as records are\naccessible at the courthouse. This section does not preclude or require “after hours”\naccess to court records in electronic form. Courts are encouraged to provide access to\nrecords in electronic form beyond the hours access is available at the courthouse, with a\ngoal of 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, it is not the intent of the rules to\nrequire courts to expend money or other resources to make remote access possible\noutside of normal business hours. The section acknowledges that access to electronic\nrecords may occasionally not be available during normal business hours because of\nunexpected interruptions to information technology systems, crashes, and during planned\ninterruptions such as for back-up of databases, software upgrades or maintenance, or\nhardware upgrades or maintenance.\n\nSubsection (b) addresses the question of how quickly the information will be made\navailable. There are a number of factors that can affect how quickly the court responds to\na request and provides the information, assuming it is publicly accessible. The response\nwill be slower if the request is non-specific, is for a large amount of information, is for\ninformation that is in off-site storage, or requires significant amounts of court resources\nto respond to the request. The objective is to have a prompt and timely response to a\n      Page 38 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\n\n5.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nrequest for information.\n\n\n\nFees\nSection 6.00 – Fees for Access\n\n(a)     Disclosure or distribution of documents is subject to the payment of applicable\nfees as set by statute.\n\n(b)     The court may charge a fee for bulk distribution or compiled information in\naccordance with state law. To the extent that public access to information is provided\nexclusively through a vendor, the court will ensure that any fee imposed by the vendor\nfor the cost of bulk and compiled information is reasonable and covers the vendor's actual\ncosts.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section recognizes that providing access to information in court records does\nconsume court resources. Access is not without cost. Statutory fees of the clerk of\ndistrict court are enumerated in § 25-1-201, MCA. The preparation and access to the\ntranscript of proceedings is within the authority of the court reporter, not the court. In\nsuch instances the existing state laws and rules governing the cost of the transcript, in\npaper or electronic form, apply. See § 3-5-604, MCA.\n\nFees for bulk access pursuant to section 4.30 or compiled access pursuant to section 4.40,\nwhich require special programming or actions because the information is not regularly\navailable in the form requested, shall be calculated in accordance with § 2-6-110, MCA.\n\nThis section also provides that if access is provided exclusively through a vendor, any fee\nimposed must be reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 39 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n      Obligation of Vendors Providing Information Technology Support\n\n\nSection 7.00 -- Obligation of Vendors Providing Information Technology\nSupport to a Court to Maintain Court Records\n\n(a)     If a court contracts with a vendor to provide information technology support to\n        gather, store, or make accessible court records, the contract will require the\n        vendor to comply with the intent and provisions of these access rules. For\n        purposes of this section, “vendor” includes a state, county or local governmental\n        agency that provides information technology services to a court as well as private\n        contractors.\n\n(b)     By contract the vendor will be required to comply with the requirement of\n        sections 8.10, 8.20, 8.30, 8.40 and 8.50 to educate litigants, the public, and its\n        employees and subcontractors about the provisions of the access policy.\n\n(c)     By contract the vendor will be required to notify the court of any requests for\n        compiled information or bulk distribution of information, including the vendor’s\n        requests for such information for its own use. Accordingly, rules 4.30 and 4.40\n        apply.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section addresses situations where information technology services are provided to a\ncourt by another agency, usually in the executive branch, or by outsourcing of court\ninformation technology services to non-governmental entities. The intent is to have the\nrules apply regardless of who is providing the services involving court records. Implicit\nin these rules is that court records are under the control of the judiciary, and that the\njudiciary has the responsibility to ensure public access to court records and to restrict\naccess where appropriate.\n\nThe section provides a standard applicable to vendors as well as the courts. Regulating\nvendors is also relevant to the issue of liability of the court for release of information that\ncauses harm, particularly if there is no judicial immunity regarding adoption or\nimplementation of a local policy.\n\nSubsection (a): “Information technology support” is meant to include a wide range of\nactivities, including records management services or equipment, making and keeping the\nverbatim record, computer hardware or software, database management, web sites, and\ncommunications services used by the court to maintain court records and provide public\n\n       Page 40 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f             Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n   Obligation of Vendors Providing Information Technology Support\n\n\n7.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\naccess to them. It would also apply to vendors who are only providing access to a copy of\nelectronic court records maintained by the court itself or by an executive branch agency.\n\nVendor compliance is particularly important where the vendor’s system is the only means\nof accessing the information. The court must ensure that the vendor is not using the\nexclusive control of access to limit access, whether through fees, technology\nrequirements, or a requirement to sign a “user agreement,” particularly if it imposes\nrestrictions on the use of the information that the court could not impose. Subsection (b):\nThe requirements of the rules regarding a vendor educating its employees or\nsubcontractors, litigants, and the public are in addition to any incentive to do so provided\nby the liability or indemnity provisions of applicable law or the contract or agreement\nwith the court.\n\nSubsection (c): This subsection requires vendors to notify the court of requests for bulk\ninformation (pursuant to section 4.30) or compiled information (pursuant to section 4.40).\nThe court must receive this notice in order to properly control the release of information\nin its records.\n\n\nObligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\nSection 8.00 – Information and Education Regarding Access Rules\n\nSection 8.10 – Dissemination of Information to Litigants about Access to\nInformation in Court Records\n\nThe court will make information available to litigants and the public that information in\nthe court record about them is accessible to the public, including remotely and how to\nrequest to restrict the manner of access or to prohibit public access.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section recognizes that litigants may not be aware that information provided to the\ncourt, by them or other parties in the case, generally is accessible to the public, including,\n\n      Page 41 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                 Obligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\n8.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\npossibly, bulk downloads. Litigants may also be unaware that some of the information\nmay be available in electronic form, possibly even remotely. This section requires the\ncourts to inform litigants about public access to court records so they can make efforts to\nprotect their privacy throughout the proceedings. Such a requirement ensures that the\npublic is provided the information necessary to protect their interests.\n\nThis section also specifically requires the court to inform litigants of the process for\nrequesting restrictions to the manner of access under section 4.50, and to inform litigants\nabout how to request prohibition of public access to information in their case pursuant to\nsection 4.60. This would be especially important in cases involving domestic violence,\nsexual assault, stalking, or requests for protective orders, and witnesses where there is a\ngreater risk of harm to individuals.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 42 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                Obligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\n\nSection 8.20 – Dissemination of Information to the Public about Accessing\nCourt Records\n\nThe Court will develop and make information available to the public about how to obtain\naccess to court records pursuant to these rules.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nPublic access to court records is meaningless if the public does not know how to access\nthe records. This section establishes an obligation on the court to provide information to\nthe public, which should include jurors, victims, witnesses and other participants in\njudicial proceedings, about how to access court records.\n\n\nSection 8.30 – Education of Judges and Court Personnel about the Access\nRules\n\nAll Courts and clerks of court shall ensure that their personnel comply with these access\nrules and respond to requests for access in a manner consistent with the rules.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section mandates that the court and clerk of court educate and train their employees\nto be able to properly implement an access policy. Properly trained employees will\nprovide better customer service, facilitating access when appropriate, and preventing\naccess when access is restricted or prohibited. When properly trained, there is also less\nrisk of inappropriate disclosure, thereby protecting privacy and lowering risk to\nindividuals from disclosure of sensitive information. Training should also be provided to\nemployees of other agencies, or their contractors, who have access to information in court\nrecords, for example as part of shared integrated criminal justice information systems.\n\n\n\n\n     Page 43 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                Obligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\n\nSection 8.40 – Education about Process to Change Inaccurate Information in\na Court Record\n\nAll Courts will inform the public of the rules by which the court will correct, expunge or\nupdate inaccurate information.\n\nSection 8.50 - Procedure to Correct, Expunge or Update Inaccurate\nInformation\n\nAn individual who believes that a case record contains clerical errors may submit a\nwritten request for correction to the court, clerk of court, or other custodian who\nmaintains the record, with a copy served on all parties to the case. Such request shall be\nno longer than two pages in length. The custodian shall promptly do one of the\nfollowing:\n\n(a) correct a clerical error for which no court order is required: (b) forward the request to\nthe court to be considered informally; or (c) forward the request to the party or participant\nwho submitted the record containing the alleged clerical error who in turn may seek\nappropriate relief from the court. Upon forwarding under clause (b), the court may either\ncorrect the error on its own initiative or direct that the request will only be considered\npursuant to a motion requesting correction. The court’s direction may also establish\nappropriate requirements for a motion. The request for correction authorized in the rule\nneed not be exhausted before other relief is requested.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nCourt records are as susceptible to errors or incomplete information as any other public\nrecord. Section 8.40 and 8.50 establishes the method for reviewing information in court\nrecords and making any changes or additions to make the record more accurate or\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\n     Page 44 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f",

The task force was instructed to\n\ndevelop their recommendations within the context of the Public’s Right to Know\n\nand the Right of Individual Privacy, guaranteed, respectively, by Article II,\n\nSections 9 and 10 of the Montana Constitution. The task force was co-chaired by\n\nJudy Meadows, State Law Librarian, and Karen Nelson, Director of Information\n\nTechnology for this Court, and included representatives from the District Courts\n\nand Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, and the Clerks of Courts thereof; from the\n\nClerk of the Supreme Court; from the media; from the State Bar of Montana; and\n\nfrom the Montana Advocacy Program.\n\n       Following a series of public meetings between December 2005 and March\n\n2006, the task force drafted comprehensive rules modeled on national guidelines\n\npublished in October 2002 by the National Center for State Courts and the Justice\n\nManagement Institute. The rules which the task force drafted and recommended,\n\nhowever, were in some cases modified to comply with Article II, Sections 9\n\n\n                                         1\n\fand 10 of the Montana Constitution as well as with Montana statutory law and\n\njurisprudence. The task force also drafted a detailed commentary to each rule\n\nreflecting the rationale underlying the rule.\n\n       At its May 15, 2006 meeting, the Commission on Technology unanimously\n\nvoted to recommend to this Court the proposed rules hereinafter referred to.\n\n       The Court expresses its appreciation and gratitude to the co-chairpersons\n\nand to the members of the task force for their exhaustive and diligent work on this\n\nmatter and for their service to the courts and to the State of Montana.\n\n       Having now reviewed these rules and commentary, we determine that\n\nbefore taking further action, the rules and commentary should be submitted to the\n\npublic for comment.\n\n       Therefore,\n\n       IT IS ORDERED that the rules referred to hereafter by hyperlink be\n\nsubmitted to the public for comment.

Purpose of these Rules\n\n(a)    The purpose of these rules is to provide a comprehensive framework for a policy on\n       public access to court records. These rules provide for access in a manner that:\n\n       (1) Maximizes accessibility to court records,\n       (2) Supports the role of the judiciary,\n       (3) Promotes governmental accountability,\n       (4) Contributes to public safety,\n       (5) Minimizes risk of injury to individuals,\n       (6) Protects individual privacy rights and interests,\n       (7) Protects proprietary business information,\n       (8) Minimizes reluctance to use the court to resolve disputes,\n       (9) Makes most effective use of court and clerk of court staff,\n       (10) Provides excellent customer service, and\n       (11) Does not unduly burden the ongoing business of the judiciary.\n\nThe rules are intended for 1) litigants, 2) those seeking access to court records, and 3) judges and\ncourt and clerk of court personnel responding to requests for access.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for Public\nAccess to Court Records\n\nThe objective of these rules is to provide maximum public accessibility to court records,\nconsistent with constitutional or other provisions of law and taking into account public policy\ninterests that are not always fully compatible with unrestricted access. Eleven significant public\npolicy interests are identified. Unrestricted access to certain information in court records could\nresult in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or unduly increase the risk of injury to\nindividuals and businesses. Denial of access would compromise the judiciary’s role in society,\ninhibit accountability, and might endanger public safety.\n\nThese rules start from the presumption of open public access to court records. In some\ncircumstances, however, the right to privacy may require that access to some records is\nrestricted. The rules reflect the view that any restriction to access must be implemented in a\nmanner narrowly tailored to serve the interests in open access. The premise underlying these\nrules is that court records are open and accessible to the public. Open access serves many public\npurposes. Open access supports the judiciary in fulfilling its role in our democratic form of\ngovernment and in our society. Open access also promotes the accountability of the judiciary by\nreadily allowing the public to monitor the performance of the judiciary.\n\n\n\n\n             Page 3 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nOther specific benefits of open court records are further elaborated in the remaining subsections.\n\nSubsection (a)(2) Supports the Role of the Judiciary. The role of the judiciary is to resolve\ndisputes, between private parties or between an individual or entity and the government,\naccording to a set of rules. Although the dispute is between two people or entities, or with the\ngovernment, having the process and result open to the public serves a societal interest in having a\nset of stable, predictable rules governing behavior and conduct. The open nature of court\nproceedings furthers the goal of providing public education about the results in cases and the\nevidence supporting them. Another aspect of the court’s dispute resolution function is\nestablishing rights as between parties in a dispute. The decision of the court stating what the\nrights and obligations of the parties are is as important to the public as to the litigants. The\nsignificance of this role is reflected in statutes and rules creating such things as judgment rolls\nand party indices with specific public accessibility.\n\nSubsection (a)(3) Promotes Government Accountability. Open court records provide for\naccountability in at least three major areas: 1) the operations of the judiciary, 2) the operations of\nother governmental agencies, and 3) the enforcement of laws. Open court records allow the\npublic to monitor the performance of the judiciary and, thereby, hold it accountable. Public\naccess to court records allows anyone to review the proceedings and the decisions of the court,\nindividually, across cases, and across courts, to determine whether the court is meeting its role of\nprotecting the rule of law, and does so in a cost effective manner. Such access also promotes\ngreater public trust and confidence in the judiciary. Openness also provides accountability for\ngovernmental agencies that are parties in court actions, or whose activities are being challenged\nin a court action. Finally, open court proceedings and open court records also demonstrate that\nlaws are being enforced. This includes civil regulatory laws as well as criminal laws.\n\nSubsection (a)(4) Contributes to Public Safety. Open public access contributes to public safety\nand compliance with the law. Availability of information about court proceedings and outcomes\nallows people to become aware of individuals, circumstances or business propositions that may\npose a threat to their persons or their property. Open public access to information thus allows\npeople to protect themselves. Examples of this are criminal conviction information, protective\norder information, and judgments in non-criminal cases. At the same time however, an effort\nshould be made to alert the public of the potentially serious problems that could be brought about\nby the reliance upon incomplete information from yet unresolved cases, where allegations have\nnot been proven.\n\nPublic safety, physical and economic, is also enhanced to the extent open public access to court\nrecords contributes to the accountability of corporations, businesses and individuals. Court cases\nare one source of information about unsafe products, improper business practices or dangerous\nconditions. Knowing this information is readily available to the public from court records is one\nincentive for businesses and individuals to act\n\n\n\n\n               Page 4 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nappropriately. Open access to this information also allows individuals and businesses to better\nprotect themselves from injury.\n\nSubsection (a)(5) Minimizes Risk of Injury to Individuals. Other circumstances suggest\nunrestricted access is not always in the public interest. The interest in personal safety can be\nserved by restricting access to information that someone could use to injure someone else,\nphysically, psychologically or economically. Examples of actual injury to individuals based on\ninformation obtained from court records include: intimidation of, or physical violence towards,\nvictims, witnesses, or jurors, repeated domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, identity theft,\nand housing or employment discrimination. While this does not require total restriction of access\nto court records, it supports restriction of access to certain information that would allow someone\nto identify and find a person to whom they intend harm. This is an especially serious problem in\ndomestic violence cases where the abused person is seeking protection through the court.\n\nSubsection (a)(6) Protects Individual Privacy Rights and Interests. The countervailing public\ninterest to open public access is the protection of personal privacy. The interest in privacy is\nprotected by limiting public access to certain kinds of information. The presumption of public\naccess is not absolute. Considerations identified regarding privacy interests include: a specific,\nlegally protected privacy interest, the reasonableness (personally and objectively) of the\nexpectation of privacy, the seriousness of the invasion of privacy, and the legitimate public\ninterest in disclosure. Appropriate respect for individual privacy also enhances public trust and\nconfidence in the judiciary. It is also important to remember that, generally, at least some of the\nparties in a court case are not in court voluntarily, but rather have been brought into court by\nplaintiffs or by the government. They have not consented to personal information related to the\ndispute being in the public domain. For those who have violated the law or an agreement, civilly\nor criminally, an argument can be made that they have impliedly consented to participation and\ndisclosure by their actions. However, both civil suits and criminal cases are filed based on\nallegations, so it cannot be presumed that individuals who find themselves in court as a\ndefendant in a case have acted improperly or wrongly as alleged by plaintiffs or by the\ngovernment.\n\nFor those who have not been charged with violation of the law, civilly or criminally, but are\nsubject to protective actions initiated by the government, such as those subject to involuntary\ncommitments, guardianship or conservatorship proceedings, implied consent to participation and\ndisclosure could not be similarly argued.\n\nFinally, at times a person who is not a party to the action may be mentioned in the court record.\nCare should be taken that the privacy rights and interests of such a ‘third’ person, such as a\nminor involved in child protective proceedings, is not unduly compromised by public access to\nthe court record containing information about the person.\n\nSubsection (a)(7) Protects Proprietary Business Information. Another type of information to\nwhich access may be restricted is that related to the operations of a business. There may be a\ncompelling reason to protect trade secrets or other proprietary business information in a\nparticular case. Allowing public access to such information could both\n\n\n               Page 5 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\nthwart a legitimate business advantage and give a competitor an unfair business\nadvantage. It also reduces the willingness of a business to use the courts to resolve disputes.\n\nSubsection (a)(8) Minimizes Reluctance To Use The Court To Resolve Disputes. The public\navailability of information in the court record can also affect the decision as to whether to use the\ncourt to resolve disputes. A policy that permits unfettered public access might result in some\nindividuals avoiding the resolution of a dispute through the court because they are unwilling to\nhave information become accessible to the public simply by virtue of it being in the court record.\nThis would diminish access to the courts and undermine public confidence in the judiciary.\nThere may also be an unintended effect of encouraging use of alternative dispute resolution\nmechanisms, which tend to be essentially private proceedings. If someone believes the courts are\nnot available to help resolve their dispute, there is a risk they will resort to self-help, a response\nthe existence of the courts is intended to minimize because of the societal interest in the peaceful\nresolution of disputes.\n\nSubsection (a)(9) Makes Most Effective Use of Court and Clerk of Court Staff. This\nconsideration relates to how access is provided rather than whether there is access. Staff time is\nrequired to maintain and provide public access to court records. If records are in electronic form,\nless staff time may be needed to provide public access. However, there can be significant costs to\nconvert records to electronic form in the first place and to maintain them. There may also be\nadded costs for court personnel needed to provide appropriate security for court databases and to\nprevent hackers from improperly accessing and altering court databases. These additional staff\ncosts may at least partially offset any savings from improvements in workflow or from less use\nof staff time to respond to records requests. In providing public access the court and clerk should\nbe mindful of doing it in a way that makes most effective use of court and clerk of court staff.\nUse of staff may also be a relevant consideration in identifying the method for limiting access\nunder section 4.60(a). Note that the rule does not require a court to convert records to electronic\nform, nor to make electronic records available remotely.\n\nThe design of electronic databases used by the court is also relevant here. Court records\nmanagement systems should be designed to improve public access to the court record as well as\nto improve the productivity of the court’s employees and judges and the clerk’s office. What is\nthe added cost of providing both? The answer to this involves allocation of scarce resources as\nwell as system design issues. If the public can help themselves to access, especially\nelectronically, less staff time is needed to respond to requests for access. The best options would\nbe to design a system to accommodate access restrictions to certain kinds of information without\ncourt staff involvement (see discussion in Commentary to Section 3.20).\n\n\n\n\n               Page 6 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 1.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nSubsection (a)(10) Provides Excellent Customer Service. An access rule should also support\nexcellent customer service while conserving court resources, particular court staff. Having\ninformation in electronic form offers more opportunities for easier, less costly access to anyone\ninterested in the information. This consideration relates to how access is provided rather than\nwhether there is access.\n\nSubsection (a)(11) Does Not Unduly Burden The Ongoing Business Of The Judiciary. Finally,\nan access rule and its implementation should not unduly burden the court in delivering its\nfundamental service – resolution of disputes. This consideration relates to how access is provided\nrather than whether there is access. Depending on the manner of public access, unrestricted\npublic access could impinge on the day-to-day operations of the court. This subsection relates\nmore to requests for bulk access (see section 4.30) or for compiled information (see section 4.40)\nthan to the day-to-day, one at a time requests (see section 1.00, subdivision (a)(9)). Limited\npublic resources and high case volume also suggest that courts should not add to their current\ninformation burden by collecting information not needed for immediate judicial decisions, even\nif the collection of this information facilitates subsequent use of the collected information.\nMaking information available in electronic form, and making it remotely accessible, requires\nboth staff and equipment resources. Courts receive a large volume of documents and other\nmaterials daily, and converting them to electronic form may be expensive. As is the case with all\npublic institutions courts have limited resources to perform their work. The interest stated in this\nsubsection attempts to recognize that access is not free, that there may be more than one\napproach to providing, or restricting access, and some approaches are less burdensome than\nothers.\n\n\n\nWho Has Access\nSection 2.00 – Who Has Access under these Rules\n\nEvery member of the public will have the same access to court records as provided in these rules,\nsubject to the provisions of section 4.30(b) and 4.40(c).\n\nIn the official performance of their duties, the following people or entities, because of their\nemployment or relationship to the court, shall not have their access restricted under Sections 4.0\nthrough 4.6:\n\n(a)     court or clerk of court employees;\n(b)     people or entities, private or governmental, who assist the court in providing\n        court services;\n(c)    agencies whose access to court records is defined by another statute, rule, order\n       or policy, and\n(d)    the parties to a case or their lawyers regarding access to the court record in their\n       case.\n\n\n\n               Page 7 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                            Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\nSection 2.00 (Commentary)\n\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe point of this section is to explicitly state that access is the same for the general public, the\nmedia, and the information industry. Access does not depend on who is seeking access, the\nreason they want the information or what they are doing with it. The section also indicates what\ngroups of people are not subject to access restrictions under these rules.\n\n\n\n\n              Page 8 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\n\nAccess to What\nSection 3.00 – Definitions\nSection 3.10 – Definition of Court Record\n\nFor purposes of these rules:\n\n(a) “Court record” includes:\n\n       (1)     Any document, information, or other thing that is collected, received, or\n               maintained by a court or clerk of court in connection with a judicial\n               proceeding;\n\n       (2)     Any index, calendar, docket, register of actions, official record of the\n               proceedings, order, decree, judgment, minute, and any information in a\n               case management system created by or prepared by the court or clerk of\n               court that is related to a judicial proceeding; and\n\n       (3)     Information maintained by the court or clerk of court pertaining to the\n               administration of the court or clerk of court office and not associated with\n               any particular case.\n\n(b) “Court record” does not include:\n\n       (1)     Other non-court records maintained by the public official who also serves\n               as clerk of court.\n\n       (2)     Information gathered, maintained or stored by a governmental agency or\n               other entity to which the court has access but which is not part of the court\n               record as defined in section 3.10(a)(1).\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section defines the court record broadly. Three categories of information are\nidentified. First are the documents, etc., that constitute what is classically called the case\nfile. The second category is information that is created by the court, some of which\nbecomes part of the court file, but some resides only in documents or databases that are\nnot in a case file. The third category is information that relates to the operation of the\ncourt, but not to a specific case or cases. The definition addresses the content of a court\nrecord, not whether the information is accessible to the public. Limitations and exclusions\nto access are provided for in sections 4.50 and 4.60.\n\nThe rules are intended to apply to every court record, regardless of the manner in which it\n      Page 9 of 44             Privacy and Access Task Force                November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nwas created, the form(s) in which it is stored, or other form(s) in which the information\nmay exist (see section 4.00).\n\nSubsection (a)(1): This definition is meant to be all inclusive of information that is\nprovided to, or made available to, the court that relates to a judicial proceeding. The term\n“judicial proceeding” is used because there may not be a court case in every situation.\nThe definition is not limited to information “filed” with the court or “made part of the\ncourt record” because some types of information the court needs to make a fully informed\ndecision may not be “filed” or technically part of the court record. The language is,\ntherefore, written to include information delivered to, or “lodged” with, the court, even if\nit is not “filed.” An example is a complaint accompanying a motion to waive the filing\nfee based on indigency. The definition is also intended to include exhibits offered in\nhearings or trials, even if not admitted into evidence. The definition includes all\ninformation used by a court to make its decision, even if an appellate court subsequently\nrules that the information should not have been considered or was not relevant to the\njudicial decision made. In order for a court to be held accountable for its decisions all of\nthe information that a court considered and which formed the basis of the court’s decision\nmust be accessible to the public. The language is intended to include within its scope\nmaterials that are submitted to the court, but upon which a court did not act because the\nmatter was withdrawn or the case was resolved or, settled, by the parties. Once relevant\nmaterial has been submitted to the court, it does not become inaccessible because the\ncourt did not, in the end, act on the information in the materials because the parties\nresolved the issue without a court decision.\n\nSubsection (a)(2): The definition is written to cover any information that relates to a\njudicial proceeding generated by the court itself, whether through the court\nadministrator’s personnel or the clerk’s office personnel. This definition applies to\nproceedings conducted by temporary judges or referees hearing cases in an official\ncapacity. This includes two categories of information. One category includes documents,\nsuch as notices, minutes, orders and judgments, which become part of the court record.\nThe second category includes information that is gathered, generated, or kept for the\npurpose of managing the court’s cases. This information may never be in a document; it\nmay only exist as information in a field of a database such as a case management system,\nan automated register of actions, or an index of cases or parties.\n\nSubsection (a)(3): The definition of court record includes some information and records\nmaintained by the court and clerk of court that is related to the management and\nadministration of the court or the clerk’s office, as opposed to a specific case. Examples\nof this category of information include: internal court policies, memoranda and\ncorrespondence, court budget and fiscal records, and other routinely produced\nadministrative records, memos and reports, and meeting minutes. The Commentary to\nsubsection 4.60(b) discusses restriction of access to drafts and work products related to\ncourt administration or clerk’s office administration.\n\n\n\n      Page 10 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force           November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nSubsection (b)(1): This subsection makes it clear that the rules apply only to information\nrelated to court judicial proceedings. The types of information described are not court\nrecords, nor is the court responsible for their collection, maintenance, or accessibility. If\nthe official who also serves as clerk of court has responsibilities for other information and\nrecords, for example records maintained as clerk and recorder, which do not relate to\nspecific judicial proceedings, these rules do not apply to these records. The laws and\naccess policies of the agency responsible for gathering and maintaining the information\ngovern access to such information.\n\nSubsection (b)(2): The definition excludes information gathered, maintained or stored by\nother agencies or entities that is not necessary to, or is not part of the basis of, a court’s\ndecision or the judicial process. Access to this information should be governed by the\nlaws and access policy of the agency collecting and maintaining such information. The\nability of a computer in a court or clerk’s office to access the information because the\ncomputer uses shared software and databases should not, by itself, make the court records\naccess rules applicable to the information. An example of this is information stored in an\nintegrated criminal justice information system where all data is shared by law\nenforcement, the prosecutor, the court, defense counsel, and probation and corrections\ndepartments. The use of a shared system can blur the distinctions between agency records\nand court records. Under this section, if the information is provided to the court as part of\na case or judicial proceeding, the court’s access rules then apply, regardless of where the\ninformation came from or the access rules of that agency. Conversely, if the information\nis not made part of the court record, the access policy applicable to the agency collecting\nthe data still applies even if the information is stored in a shared database.\n\n\nSection 3.20 – Definition of Public Access\n\n“Public access” means that the public may inspect and obtain a copy of the information in\na court record as provided by Montana law.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section defines “public access” very broadly. The unrestricted language implies that\naccess is not conditioned on the reason access is requested or on prior permission being\ngranted by the court. Access is defined to include the ability to obtain a copy of the\ninformation, not just inspect it. The section does not address the form of the copy as\nthere are numerous forms the copy could take, and more will probably become possible\nas technology continues to evolve.\n\nAt a minimum inspection of the court record can be done at the courthouse where the\nrecord is maintained. It can also be done in any other manner determined by the court\nthat makes the most effective use of court staff, provides quality customer service and is\n      Page 11 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.20 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nleast disruptive to the operations of the court – that is, consistent with the principles and\ninterests specified in section 1.00. The inspection can be of the physical record or an\nelectronic version of the court record. Access may be over the counter, by fax, by\nregular mail, by e-mail or by courier. The section does not preclude the court from\nmaking inspection possible via electronic means or other sites, or remotely. It also\npermits a court to satisfy the request to inspect by providing a printed report, computer\ndisk, tape or other storage medium containing the information requested from the court\nrecord. The issue of the cost, if any, must be paid before obtaining a copy is addressed in\nsection 6.0.\n\nThe section implies an equality of the ability to “inspect and obtain a copy” across the\npublic. Implementing this equality will require the court to address several sources of\ninequality of access. Some people have physical impairments that prevent them from\nusing the form of access available to most of the public. The Americans with Disabilities\nAct may require the court or clerk to provide information in a form that is usable to\nsomeone with a disability. Another problem has to do with the existence of a ‘digital\ndivide’ regarding access to information in electronic form. The court should provide\nequivalent access to those who do not have the necessary electronic equipment to obtain\naccess. Finally, there is the issue of the format of electronic information and whether it is\nequally accessible to all computer platforms and operating systems. The court should\nmake electronic information equally available, regardless of the computer used to access\nthe information (in other words, in a manner that is hardware and software independent).\n\nAnother aspect of access is the need to redact restricted information in documents before\nallowing access to the balance of the document (see section 4.60 (a) and associated\ncommentary). In some circumstances this may be quite costly. Lack of, or insufficient,\nresources may present the court with an awkward choice of deciding between funding\nnormal operations and funding activities related to access to court records. As\ntechnology improves it is becoming easier to develop software that allows redaction of\npieces of information in documents in electronic form based on “tags” (such as XML\ntags) accompanying the information. When software to include such tags in documents\nbecomes available and court systems acquire the capability to use the tags, redaction will\nbecome more feasible, allowing the balance of a document to be accessible with little\neffort on the part of the court.\n\n\nSection 3.30 – Definition of Remote Access\n\n“Remote access” means the ability to electronically search, inspect, or copy information\nin a court record without the need to physically visit the court facility where the court\nrecord is maintained.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 12 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\nSection 3.30 (Commentary )\n\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe objective of defining the term “remote access” in Section 3.30 is to describe a means\nof access that is technology neutral. The term is used in section 4.20 regarding\ninformation that should be remotely accessible. The key elements are that: 1) the access\nis electronic, 2) the electronic form of the access allows searching of records, as well as\nviewing and making an electronic copy of the information, 3) a person is not required to\nvisit the courthouse to access the record, and 4) no assistance of court or clerk of court\nstaff is needed to gain access (other than staff maintaining the information technology\nsystems). This definition provides a term that is independent of any particular technology\nor means of access, for example, the Internet or a dial-up system such as the federal\ncourt’s PACER1 system. Remote access may be accomplished electronically by any one\nor more of a number of existing technologies, including dedicated terminal, kiosk, dial-in\nservice, or Internet site. Attaching electronic copies of information to e-mails, and\nmailing or faxing copies of documents in response to a letter or phone request for\ninformation would not constitute remote access under this definition.\n\nSection 3.40 – Definition of “In Electronic Form”\n\nInformation in a court record that is defined in Section 3.10 includes: (a) electronic\nrepresentations of text or graphic documents; (b) an electronic image, including a video\nimage, of a document, exhibit or other thing; (c) data in the fields or files of an electronic\ndatabase; or (d) an audio or video recording, analog or digital, of an event or notes in an\nelectronic file from which a transcript of an event can be prepared.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe breadth of the definition of “in electronic form” makes clear that the rule applies to\ninformation that is available in any type of electronic form. The point of this section is to\ndefine what “in electronic form” means, not to define whether electronic information can\nbe accessed or how it is accessed.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) is the automated case management\ninformation system used by the federal courts to provide information about court cases\nthat can be accessed remotely by a subscriber.\n\n\n      Page 13 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 3.40 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\nSubsection (a): This subsection refers to electronic versions of textual documents (for\nexample documents produced on a word processor, or stored in some other text format\nsuch as PDF format), and pictures, charts, or other graphical representations of\ninformation (for example, graphics files, spreadsheet files, etc.).\n\nSubsection (b): A document might be electronically available as an image of a paper\ndocument produced by scanning, or another imaging technique (but not filming or\nmicrofilming). This document can be viewed on a screen and it appears as a readable\ndocument, but it is not searchable without the aid of OCR (optical character recognition)\napplications that translate the image into a searchable text format. An electronic image\nmay also be one produced of a document or other object through the use of a digital\ncamera, for example in a courtroom as part of an evidence presentation system.\n\nSubsection (c): Montana courts are increasingly using case management systems, data\nwarehouses or similar tools to maintain data about cases and court activities. The rule\napplies equally to this information even though it is not produced or available in paper\nformat unless a report containing the information is generated. This section, as well as\nsubsection (a), would also cover files created for, and transmitted through, an electronic\nfiling system for court documents.\n\nSubsection (d): Evidence can be in the form of audio or videotapes of testimony or\nevents. In addition audio and video recording, electronic recording and computer-aided\ntranscription systems (CAT) using court reporters are increasingly being used to capture\nthe verbatim record of court hearings and trials.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 14 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force           November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\n\nSection 4.00 – Applicability of the Rules\n\nThese rules apply to all court records, regardless of the physical form of the court record,\nthe method of recording the information in the court record or the method of storage of\nthe information in the court record.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe objective of this section is to make it clear that the rules apply to information in the\ncourt record regardless of the form in which the information was created or submitted to\nthe court, the means of gathering, storing or presenting the information, or the form in\nwhich it is maintained. Section 3.10 defines what is considered to be part of the court\nrecord. However, the materials that are contained in the court record come from a variety\nof sources. The materials are offered and kept in a variety of forms. Information in\nelectronic form exists in a variety of formats and databases and can be accessed by a\nvariety of software programs. To support the general principle of open access, the\napplication of the policy must be independent of technology, format and software and,\ninstead, focus on the information itself.\n\nOverview of Section 4.00 Provisions\n\nThree categories of information accessibility are created in the following sections of the\nrules. The first reflects the general principle that information in court records is generally\npresumed to be accessible (section 4.10). Second, there is a section that indicates what\ninformation should be accessible remotely (section 4.20). Following these provisions are\nsections on bulk release of electronic information (section 4.30) and release of compiled\ninformation (section 4.40). A fifth category identifies information prohibited from public\naccess because of overriding privacy or other interests (section 4.50). Finally, having\ndefined what information is accessible and not accessible, there is a section that indicates\nhow to request the prohibition of access to information generally accessible, and how to\ngain access to information to which public access is prohibited (section 4.60).\n\n\n\nSection 4.10 – General Access Rule\n\n(a)    Information in the court record is accessible to the public except as prohibited by\n       section 4.50 or section 4.60(a).\n\n(b)    There shall be a publicly accessible indication of the existence of information in a\n       court record to which access has been prohibited, which indication shall not\n       disclose the content of the information protected.\n\n\n\n      Page 15 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                       Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                    Access to What\n\nSection 4.10 (Cont.)\n\n\n\n  (c)    A local court may not adopt a more restrictive access policy or otherwise\n         restrict access beyond that provided for in these rules, nor provide greater access\n         than that provided for in these rules.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nSubsection (a) states the general premise that information in the court record will be\npublicly accessible unless access is specifically prohibited. There are two exceptions\nnoted. One exception is information in the court record that is specifically excluded from\npublic access by section 4.50. The second exception provides for those individual\nsituations where the court orders a part of the record to be restricted from access pursuant\nto the procedure set forth in section 4.60(a).\n\nThe provision does not require any particular level of access, nor does it require a court to\nprovide access in any particular form, for example, publishing court records in electronic\nform on a web site or dial-in database. (See section 4.20 on information that a court\nshould make available remotely.)\n\nThe provision, by omission, reiterates the concept noted in the commentary to section\n2.00 that access is not conditioned on proper use, nor is the burden on requestors to show\nthey are entitled to access. Subsection (b) provides a way for the public to know that\ninformation exists even though public access to the information itself is prohibited. This\nallows a member of the public to request access to the restricted record under section\n4.60(b), which they would not know to do if the existence of the restricted information\nwas not known. Making the existence of restricted information known enhances the\naccountability of the court. Hiding the existence of information not only reduces\naccountability, it also erodes public trust and confidence in the judiciary when the\nexistence of the information becomes known.\n\nIn addition to disclosing the existence of information that is not available, there is also a\nvalue in indicating how much information is being withheld. For many redactions this\ncould be as simple as using “placeholders,” such as gray boxes, when characters or\nnumbers are redacted, or indicating how many pages have been excluded if part or all of\na document is not accessible. Providing this level of detail about the information\ncontributes to the transparency and credibility of the restriction process and rules.\n\nThere are two situations where this policy presents a dilemma. One is where access is\nrestricted to an entire document and the other concerns a case where the entire file is\nordered sealed. This section requires the existence of the sealed document or file to be\npublic. The problem arises where the disclosing of the existence of a document or case\ninvolving a particular person, as opposed to some of the information in the court record,\nreveals the very information the restriction order seeks to protect. One example would be\n\n        Page 16 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nthe title of a document in a register of actions which describes the type or nature of the\ninformation to which access restrictions is being sought. These problems can be avoided,\nto some extent, by using a more generic description in the caption of a document, using a\npseudonym, or some other unique identifier instead of the party's full or real name. This\nsection requires disclosure of the existence of sealed information in the interest of a more\nopen judicial record.\n\nSection 4.30 (c) is provided for in the rules to promote consistency and predictability\nacross courts; it also furthers equal access to courts and court records.\n\n\nSection 4.20 – Court Records In Electronic Form Presumptively Subject to\nRemote Access by the Public\n\nThe following information in court records should receive the highest priority for remote\naccess by the public if available in electronic form, unless public access is restricted\npursuant to sections 4.50 or 4.60(a):\n\n    a. Litigant/party indexes to cases filed with the court;\n    b. Listings of new case filings, including the names of the parties;\n    c. Register of actions showing what documents have been filed in a case;\n    d. Calendars or dockets of court proceedings, including the case number and\n       caption, date and time of hearing, and location of hearing;\n    e. Judgments, orders, or decrees in a case and liens affecting title to real property.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nSeveral types of information in court records have traditionally been given wider public\ndistribution than merely making them publicly accessible at the courthouse. Task force\nmembers agreed that the types of information listed in Section 4.20 should receive the\nhighest priority for automation and remote access.\n\nThe summary or general nature of the information is such that there is little risk of harm\nto an individual or unwarranted invasion of privacy or proprietary business interests.\n\nWhile not every court, or every automated system, is capable of providing this type of\naccess, courts are encouraged to develop the capability to do so. The listing of\ninformation that should be made remotely available in no way is intended to imply that\nother information should not be made remotely available. Some court’s automated\nsystems may also make more information available remotely to litigants and their lawyers\nthan is available to the public, but this is outside the scope of these rules.\n\nMaking certain types of information remotely accessible allows the court to make cost\n         Page 17 of 44             Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.20 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\neffective use of public resources provided for its operation. If the information is not\navailable, someone requesting the information will have to call the court or come down to\nthe courthouse and request the information. Public resources will be consumed with court\nstaff locating case files containing the record or information, providing it to the requestor,\nand returning the case file to the shelf. If the requestor can obtain the information\nremotely, without involvement of court staff, there will be less use of court resources.\n\nIn implementing this section a court should be mindful about what specific pieces of\ninformation are appropriately remotely accessible. Care should be taken that the release\nof information is consistent with all provisions of the access rules, especially regarding\npersonal identification information. For example, the information remotely accessible\nshould not include information presumptively excluded from public access pursuant to\nsection 4.50, prohibited from public access by court order pursuant to 4.60(a).\n\nSubsection (e): One role of the judiciary, in resolving disputes, is to state the respective\nrights, obligations and interests of the parties to the dispute. This declaration of rights,\nobligations and interests usually is in the form of a judgment or other type of final order.\nJudgments or final orders have often had greater public accessibility by a statutory\nrequirement that they be recorded in a “judgment roll” or some similar practice. One\nreason this is done is to simplify public access by placing all such information in one\nplace, rather than making someone step through numerous individual case files to find\nthem. Recognizing such practices, the policy specifically encourages this information to\nbe remotely accessible if in electronic form.\n\nThere are circumstances where information about charges and convictions in criminal\ncases can change over time, which could mean copies of such listings derived from court\nrecords can become inaccurate unless updated. These circumstances suggest that there be\na disclaimer associated with such information, and that education about these possibilities\nbe provided to litigants and the public.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 18 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\n\nSection 4.30 – Requests for Bulk Distribution of Court Records\n\nBulk distribution is defined as the distribution of all, or a significant subset, of the\ninformation in court records, as is and without modification or compilation.\n\n(a)     Bulk distribution of information in the court record is permitted for court records\n        that are publicly accessible under section 4.10 and not prohibited by state law.\n\n(b)     A request for bulk distribution of information not publicly accessible can be made\n        to the court where the identification of specific individuals is ancillary to the\n        purpose of the inquiry. Prior to the release of information pursuant to this\n        subsection the requestor must comply with the provisions of section 4.40(c).\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section addresses requests for large volumes of information in court records, as\nopposed to requesting information from a particular case or reformulated information\nfrom several cases (see section 4.40). The section authorizes bulk distribution for\ninformation that is publicly accessible. It also sets out a method of requesting bulk\ndistribution of information to which public access is restricted.\n\nThere are advantages to allowing bulk access to court records. Allowing the public to\nobtain information from court records from a third party may reduce the number of\nrequests to the court for the records. Fewer requests mean less court staff resources\ndevoted to answering inquiries and requests. However, there are costs associated with\nmaking the records available. There may also be technology, as well as cost, issues in\nproviding bulk distribution of information. For example, a court’s systems may not be\nable to identify and separate publicly accessible information from restricted information\nin creating a copy of information for bulk distribution. Permitting bulk distribution of\ninformation in this circumstance assumes providing the data will not interfere with the\nnormal operations of the court. There is also the ‘cost’ of reduced public confidence in\nthe judiciary from the existence of inaccurate, stale or incorrectly linked information\navailable through third parties but derived from court records.\n\nIn allowing bulk data to be disseminated a court should be mindful not to gather\ninformation that it does not need to fulfill its judicial role, even if those requesting bulk\ninformation are interested in obtaining this information.\n\n\nSubsection (a). Bulk transfer is allowed for information that is publicly accessible under\nthese rules, however, task force members noted that § 2-6-109, MCA prohibits public\nagencies from distributing or selling for use as a mailing list any list of persons without\nfirst securing the permission of those on the list; and that a list of persons prepared by the\nagency may not be used as a mailing list except by the agency or another agency without\nfirst securing the permission of those on the list. There is no constitutional or other basis\n\n      Page 19 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.30 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nfor providing greater access to bulk requestors than to the public generally, and this\nsection implies there should be no less access. Consistent with section 3.20, public\naccess, including bulk access, is not dependent upon the reason the access is sought or the\nproposed use of the data. Court information provided through bulk distribution can be\ncombined with information from other sources. Information from court records may be\nlinked with other information and may be used for purposes that are unrelated to why the\ninformation was provided to the court in the first place. It is significant to note that\ntransferring information in the court record into databases that are then beyond the\ncourt’s control creates the very real likelihood that the information will, over time,\nbecome incomplete, inaccurate, stale or contain information that has been removed from\nthe court’s records. Keeping information distributed in bulk current may require the court\nto provide “refreshed” information on a frequent, regular and periodic basis. This may\nraise issues of availability of court resources to do this. Although creating liability or\npenalties on the third party information provider might reduce the risk of stale or\nincorrect information being distributed, meeting this standard still requires the court to\nprovide updated and new information on a frequent basis.\n\nA particular problem with bulk distribution of criminal conviction information has to do\nwith expungement policies. If the intent of an expungement policy is to “erase” a\nconviction, the public policy may be impossible to implement if the information is\nalready in another database as a result of a bulk transfer of the information. An approach\nneeds to be devised that accommodates expungement and bulk distribution. Potential\nmass access to electronic court information further highlights the question of the accuracy\nof the court’s records. This is particularly important for databases created by court or\nclerk of court employees. The potential for bulk distribution of the information in a court\ndatabase will require courts and clerks to be even more vigilant about both the accuracy\nof their databases and the timeliness of entering information into them.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 20 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force          November 2006\n\f                Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                             Access to What\n\n\nSection 4.40 – Access to Compiled Information from Court Records\n\n(a)    Compiled information is defined as information that is derived from the selection,\n       aggregation or reformulation by the court of some of the information from more\n       than one individual court record.\n\n(b)    Any member of the public may request compiled information that consists solely\n       of information that is publicly accessible and that is not already available pursuant\n       to section 4.20 or in an existing report. The court shall compile and provide the\n       information if it determines that the resources are available to compile the\n       information. The court may delegate to its staff or the clerk of court the authority\n       to make the initial determination as to whether to provide compiled information.\n\n(c)    Compiled information that includes information to which public access has been\n       restricted may be requested by any member of the public pursuant to Section 4.6.\n\n       The request shall:\n\n         1) identify what information is sought,\n         2) explain provisions for the secure protection of any information requested to\n            which public access is restricted or prohibited.\n         3) if the request is granted, the court may require the requestor to sign a\n            declaration that:\n\n               i. The data will not be sold or otherwise distributed, directly or\n                  indirectly, to third parties, except for journalistic purposes,\n\n              ii. The information will not be used directly or indirectly to sell a product\n                  or service to an individual or the general public, except for journalistic\n                  purposes, and/ or\n\n             iii. The court may make such additional orders as may be needed to\n                  protect information to which access has been restricted or prohibited.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 21 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\nSection 4.40\n\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section authorizes access to compiled information. The section describes how the\ncompiled information is requested, the requirements for obtaining compiled information,\nand possible limitations on using the information.\n\nThe primary interests served by release of compiled information are supporting the role\nof the judiciary, promoting the accountability of the judiciary, and providing public\neducation regarding the judiciary. Compiled data allows analysis and comparison of court\ndecisions across cases, across judges and across courts. This information can also educate\nthe public about the judicial process. It can provide guidance to individuals in the conduct\nof their everyday life and business. Although some judges may have legitimate concerns\nabout misuse of compiled data, for example in comparing the decisions of judges, such an\nanalysis is one approach to monitoring the performance of the judiciary.\n\nCompiled data also allows the study of the effectiveness of the judiciary and the laws\nenforced in courts. For example, the studies of delay reduction leading to improved case\nmanagement and faster case processing times were based on analysis of compiled data\nfrom thousands of cases in over a hundred courts across the country. In allowing\ncompiled data to be disseminated a court should be mindful not to gather information that\nit does not need to fulfill its judicial role, even if those requesting compiled information\nare interested in obtaining this information.\n\nSubsection (a) provides a definition of compiled information. Compiled information is\ndifferent from case-by-case access because it involves information from more than one\ncase. Compiled information is different from bulk access in that it involves only some of\nthe information from some cases and the information has been reformulated or\naggregated; it is not just a copy of all the information in the court’s records. Essentially\ncompiled information involves the creation of a new court record. In order to provide\ncompiled information a court generally must write a computer program to select the\nspecific cases or information sought in the request, or otherwise use court resources to\nidentify, gather, and copy the information.\n\nGenerating compiled data may require court resources and generating the compiled\ninformation may compete with the normal operations of the court for resources, which\nmay be a reason for the court not to compile the information. It may be less costly for the\ncourt and less of an impact on the court to, instead, provide bulk distribution of the\nrequested information pursuant to section 4.30, and let the requestor, rather than the\n      Page 22 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.40 (Commentary, cont.)\n\ncourt, compile the information.\n\nSubsection (b) addresses requests for information that is publicly available. Since public\nresources are used in responding to the request, the question for the court is whether\nresponding meets criteria established by the court for providing such information, and\nwhether the court will choose to expend available resources on the request.\n\nThe reference in section 4.40(b) to section 4.20 and existing reports is intended to limit\nthe section’s application to requests for compiled data that are not already routinely\nprepared and made public. Party name indices, or a screen that reports the results of a\nname search of either civil or criminal cases, are examples of compiled information that\nalready exist.\n\nSection 4.40(c) addresses requests for information that is not publicly accessible. Since\nthe information is not publicly accessible, the section provides for protections of the\nrestricted information.\n\nThe exception for “journalistic purposes” in subdivisions 4.40(c) is included as a\nrecognition that what journalism sells is information, and prohibiting a journalist from\nselling the information may defeat the purpose of providing the information to the\njournalist in the first place.\n\nSubdivision 4.40(c) further identifies possible provisions for preventing improper\ndisclosure of restricted or prohibited information. A state or individual court’s policy\nmight also consider a requirement of a nondisclosure agreement that includes injunctive\nrelief and indemnities for improper disclosure. In order to get a court order releasing the\ninformation the appropriate nondisclosure agreement must be signed by the requestor.\n\nThe enforcement of restrictions on the use or dissemination of information provided\npresents additional issues that the courts must address. One option is for courts to refuse\nto continue supplying compiled data to a certain organization, or on a certain subject, if\nabuses occur. Another option is to create, or strengthen, penalties for the release of\ninformation to which access is restricted under these rules.\n\nThe distribution of both publicly accessible and protected data also presents ancillary\nissues. Analysis of the data without a full understanding of the meaning of the data\nelements or codes used, or without a full understanding the limitations of the data, can\nresult in conclusions not substantiated by the data. To some extent this can be addressed\nby explanatory information provided with the transmittal of the compiled information.\n\n\n      Page 23 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force           November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nSection 4.40 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nAnother concern arises with release of compiled data in electronic form. This is the\nresult of the nature of electronic records, which are an atypical subset of data from all\ncourt records. As electronic versions of information become more available, skewing\narises between what is available in electronic form, versus paper form. Compiled data\nfrom the electronic record may, therefore, not be representative of all cases. The fact that\nvery little information prior to a certain date is available in electronic form could also\ncause significant skewing. If historical records are not scanned or otherwise converted\ninto electronic form, the electronic records will only be recent cases or newer information\nin older cases. There are no obvious ways to avoid this problem, assuming the cost of\nproducing electronic versions of all existing records is prohibitive.\n\nFinally, an extracted set of information is a snapshot of the information, whereas the\ndatabase from which the information is extracted is dynamic, constantly changing and\ngrowing.\n\n\nSection 4.50 – Court Records Excluded from Public Access\n\nThe following information in a court record is not accessible to the public:\n\n(a)     Information that is not to be accessible to the public pursuant to state law; and\n\n(b)     Information that is not to be accessible to the public pursuant to federal law.\n\n(c)     The following information is not available without leave of the court:\n\n        (1)      Complete social security numbers;\n        (2)      Complete financial account numbers;\n        (3)      Full names of minor children, unless state law requires a child’s name to\n                 be accessible to the public;\n        (4)      Full birth dates of any person.\n\n(d)     It is the responsibility of the filing party to comply with these rules to protect\nprivate information.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 24 of 44                Privacy and Access Task Force            November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\nSection 4.50 (Commentary)\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThe objective of this section is to identify those categories of information to which public\naccess will be prohibited. The concept of the section is that for certain types of\ninformation an existing statute, rule or case law expresses a policy determination, made\nby the Legislature or the judiciary, that the presumption of public access has been\novercome by an individual’s right to privacy, and that the prohibition of public access\napplies on a categorical, as opposed to a case-by-case, basis.\n\nThe section suggests two possible sources of restrictions on access to information. The\nfirst is state law. The following commentary provides several lists of categories that are\ncurrently found in state statute, rule or case law. The second source is federal law,\nalthough there are few, if any, such limitations. The inclusion of the various federal\nlaws in the Commentary that do restrict the distribution of some information, but have\nnot been found to apply to the distribution of court records, is intended to provide\ncourt administrators with a convenient resource to ensure that administrators have an\naccurate understanding of those federal laws so misapprehension of these provisions will\nnot be an obstacle to the efficient and appropriate release of court records.\n\n\nSubsection (a) - State law: Information that is not accessible to the public pursuant to\nstate law generally falls into two categories. First are case types where the records of the\nentire court proceedings are presumptively sealed. These are:\n\n1.      Child Abuse and Neglect Proceedings and Proceedings Brought to Terminate\nParental Rights Based Upon Abuse or Neglect of the Child. All court records pertaining\nto actions taken under Title 41, Chapter 3 are not open for public inspection unless the\ncourt “finds disclosure to be necessary for the fair resolution of the issue before it.” § 41-\n3-205 (2), MCA;\n\n2.      Involuntary Commitment Proceedings pursuant to Title 53, part 21, Mental\nIllness. Court records in these matters must be sealed five days prior to release of\nrespondent and only opened for “good cause shown.” § 53-21-103, MCA.\n\n3.     Minor’s names. State law requires the disclosure of a minor’s identity in some\ncircumstances. Disclosure may be required pursuant to a specific statutory mandate or\npursuant to a statutory provision applicable to both adults and minors where disclosure is\nrequired and no exception for the disclosure of a minor’s identity has been established.\nSection 4.50 (Commentary)\n\n      Page 25 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                               Access to What\n\nExamples of such provisions are the traffic regulation laws. See generally Title 61,\nChapter 8, MCA. In those situations where state law does not require the disclosure of\nminor’s names, the task force supports the use of fictitious names to refer to minors\nwhose names would otherwise be included in court records accessible to the public, such\nas victims or witnesses. We agree that the use of initials to accomplish this purpose,\ngiven Montana’s modest population, does not accord the privacy warranted in these\nsituations.\n\n4.      Formal Youth Court Records. These records are physically sealed on the youth’s\n18th birthday, or, in cases where “jurisdiction of the court or any agency is extended\nbeyond the youth’s 18th birthday, the records” are sealed when the extended jurisdiction\nhas ended. § 41-5-216 (1), MCA. Prior to this time, these records are\nopen to public inspection, except for the “social, medical and psychological records,\nyouth assessment materials, predispositional studies and supervision records of\nprobationer” which may be accessed only by those designated in § 41-5-215 (2), MCA\n\n        However, medical records, fingerprints, DNA records, photographs, youth traffic\nrecords, or “records in any case in which the youth did not fulfill all requirements of the\ncourt’s judgment or disposition” as well as records identified in § 42-3-203, MCA, and\n § 45-5-624 (7), MCA are exempt from these sealing provisions. § 41-5-216 (4), MCA;\n\n5.     Informal Youth Court Records. Informal youth court records must also be\nphysically sealed on the youth’s 18th birthday, or, if jurisdiction has been extended, they\nmust be sealed when the jurisdiction has ended. § 41-5-216 (7), MCA.\nHowever, these youth records may only be inspected by youth court personnel prior to\nthe youth’s 18th birthday, and only when there is a new offense;\n\n6.      Conciliation Court Proceedings. All district court hearings or conferences under\nthis chapter shall be closed unless opened to inspection by parties or counsel upon\njudicial order. § 40-3-116, MCA.\n\n7.      Parentage Proceedings. All hearings or trials held under Title 40, part 6 must be\nheld in closed court without admittance of any person other than those necessary to the\naction. All records other than the final judgment are only subject to inspection by\nconsent of court and all interested persons or in exceptional cases, only upon an order\n“for good cause shown.” § 40-6-120, MCA;\n\n\n\n4.50 (Commentary, cont)\n\n\n\n      Page 26 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\n8.      Adoption Proceedings. All papers and records concerning adoption “must be kept\nas a permanent record of the court and must be withheld from inspection,” and may only\nbe distributed pursuant to a court order when good cause is shown, pursuant to the state\nstatutory provisions regarding the collection of vital statistics or for purposes of child\nsupport enforcement and other narrow circumstances provided within Title 42, Chapter 6,\npart 1. § 42-6-101, MCA;\n\n9.     Proceedings Regarding the Abuse or Neglect of Elderly Persons and Persons with\nDevelopmental Disabilities. All actions presumed confidential and not released to public\nunless by court order or action of law. § 52-3-813, MCA;\n\n10.     Proceedings Under Parental Notice of Abortion Act. This statute has been\nenjoined from enforcement by the First Judicial District Court of Montana. A minor\npetitioning to judicially bypass parental notification must be provided the option of using\na pseudonym or initials and all documents related to the petition are confidential and are\nnot available to the public. § 50-20-212(3), MCA;\n\n11.     Guardianship and Conservatorship Proceedings. Such proceedings must be\nclosed if requested by the person alleged to be incapacitated or his or her counsel. § 72-\n5-315 (4), MCA;\n\n12.     Grand Jury Proceedings. Courts “shall order a hearing on matters affecting a\ngrand jury proceeding to be closed.” § 46-11-307, MCA. Disclosure of these\nproceedings is limited and generally may not be made to the public unless authorized by\nthe district court. § 46-11-317, MCA;\n\n13.    Investigative Subpoena Proceedings. These proceedings are subject to the same\nsecrecy and disclosure provisions as grand jury proceedings. § 46-4-304 (2), MCA;\n\n14.     Dissolution of Marriage, Criminal Conversation or Seduction. Courts are\nauthorized to exclude everyone from the courtroom except the officers of the court, the\nparties, their witnesses, and counsel for the trial of any issue of fact in these proceedings.\n§ 3-1-313 (2), MCA;\n\n15.     Supervision Proceedings by Insurance Commissioner. All records of the\nproceedings of actions taken under § 33-2-1321 and § 33-2-1322 are to be confidential,\nunless the district court orders otherwise. § 33-2-1323, MCA.\n\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\nThe Second category is information contained in court records that are not sealed, which\n      Page 27 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nstate law recognizes as sufficiently private to prohibit public access:\n\n1.       The address, telephone number, or place of employment of a victim of a criminal\noffense or a member of the victim’s family if the victim requests confidentiality, unless\nthis information “is of the location of the crime scene” or disclosure of this information\n“is required by law, is necessary for law enforcement purposes, or is authorized by a\ndistrict count upon a showing of good cause.” § 44-5-311 (1), MCA;\n\n2.       All information identifying the victim of certain sexual crimes, unless that\ninformation “is of the location of the crime scene” or the disclosure of this information\n“is required by law, is necessary for law enforcement purposes, or is authorized by a\ndistrict count upon a showing of good cause.” § 44-5-311 (3), MCA. These crimes are\nsexual assault, § 45-5-502, , sexual intercourse without consent, § 45-5-503, MCA,\nindecent exposure, § 45-5-504, MCA, and incest, § 45-5-507, MCA;\n\n3.     A defendant’s DNA information disclosed during a criminal proceeding. §§ 44-6-\n106, 108, MCA;\n\n4.      Videotapes that are part of the record in cases involving sexual offenses.\nVideotapes “which are part of the court record are subject to a protective order of the\ncourt for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the victim.” § 46-15-403, MCA;\n\n5.      Pre-sentence investigation reports, pursuant to § 46-18-113, MCA;\n\n6.     Notice by prosecutor of other crimes, wrongs or acts. Notice must be filed and\nsealed until the time of trial or until a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is entered by the\ndefendant. § 46-13-109 (3), MCA;\n\n7.      Confidential criminal justice information. Dissemination of confidential criminal\njustice information is restricted to criminal justice agencies, to those authorized by law to\nreceive it, and to those authorized by court order upon a written finding that the demands\nof individual privacy do not clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure. § 44-5-303,\nMCA;\n\n8.     Will filed with court. A will filed with the court must be sealed and kept\nconfidential during the testator’s lifetime. § 72-2-535, MCA;\n\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\n9.     Writs of attachment. The fact of the filing of the complaint or the issuing of such\nattachment cannot be disclosed to the public until after the filing of return of service of\n      Page 28 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nattachment. § 27-18-111, MCA;\n\n10.

All medical certificates,\nlaboratory statements and reports and information provided pursuant to 40-1-203 through\n40-1-209 are confidential and may not be disclosed to anyone other than state or local\nhealth officials. § 40-1-208, MCA;\n\n11.    Confidential information in certificate of marriage or dissolution of marriage.\nDisclosure of confidential information in certificate of marriage or dissolution of\nmarriage for statistical purposes is prohibited unless disclosure is specifically authorized\nby law for statistical or research purposes or unless ordered by a court. § 50-15-121 (6),\nMCA;\n\n12.     Confidential information in birth records. Disclosure of “confidential\ninformation” in birth records for medical or health use is prohibited unless disclosure is\nspecifically authorized by law for statistical or research purposes or unless ordered by a\ncourt. § 50-15-121 (6), MCA.\n\nSubsection (b) Federal Law: There are several types of information that are commonly,\nif incorrectly, considered to be protected from public disclosure by federal law.\n\nAlthough the laws or regulations may prohibit a federal agency, federal employees, or\ncertain other specifically designated parties from disclosing certain information, the\nprohibitions generally do not extend to disclosure by state courts where the\ninformation has become a part of the court record. Parties should take note that these\nfederal laws or regulations may apply to them when they introduce restricted information\nonto the court records, which may require the individuals to request the court to restrict\naccess under sections 4.50 or 4.60(a). Each category is discussed below.\n\nSocial Security Numbers. Although there may be restrictions on federal agencies\ndisclosing Social Security Numbers (SSNs), they do not apply to state or local agencies\nsuch as courts. One provision of the Social Security Acts does bar disclosure by state\nand local governments of SSNs collected pursuant to any law enacted on or after October\n1, 1990. 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C)(vii)(I). Assuming the section is applicable to state\ncourts (there is some question about this), it would only apply to laws authorizing courts\nto collect SSNs that were adopted after this date. One possible example of this may be the\nlaw passed in the mid 1990s to facilitate child support collection that requires inclusion of\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nSSNs in orders granting dissolution of marriage, establishing child support or\ndetermining paternity. 42 U.S.C. § 405(c)(2)(C)(ii). There does not appear to be any\nconsensus as to whether the non-disclosure provision applies to, or is superseded by, the\n      Page 29 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\nnewer collection requirement.\n\nFederal income or business tax returns. Federal law prohibits disclosure of tax returns by\nfederal agencies or employees, but the prohibition does not extend to disclosure by\nothers.\n\nEducational information protected by federal law. FERPA protects information about\nstudents receiving federal aid from disclosure by a university or public school system, but\nit does not address disclosure of such information in a court record. 20 U.S.C. § 1232 g.\n\nHealth and medical information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nof 1996 (HIPAA) and regulations adopted pursuant to it limit disclosure of certain health\nrelated information about people by certain healthcare entities. 42 U.S.C. § 1320d; 45\nC.F.R. Part 160 and 164. Whether the limitation extends to state court records is not\nclear, however, state courts are not included within the definition of health care entities\nthat are covered by HIPAA. There are also federal restrictions regarding information in\nalcohol and drug abuse patient records and requiring confidentiality of information\nacquired by drug court programs. 42 U.S.C. § 290 dd - 2.\n\nCriminal History Information. There are federal regulations generally restricting the use\nof criminal history information contained in criminal records repositories maintained by\nexecutive branch agencies, particularly non-conviction information, to criminal justice\npurposes. The provisions do not extend to information once it becomes part of a court\nrecord in a case; nor do they extend to court records containing criminal conviction\ninformation.\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Federal regulations implementing the Americans with\nDisabilities Act provides that employers must segregate and keep confidential all\ninformation regarding medical examinations of employees required by the employer that\nare job-related and consistent with business necessity. 42 U.S.C. § 12112, 29 C.F.R. §\n1630.14 (c)(1). Thus, to the extent that personnel records of court employees are\nidentified as court records under these rules, federal law would prohibit the distribution of\nthose records to the public.\n\nResearch Involving Human Subjects. There are federal regulations establishing practices\nand, in certain circumstances, prohibiting disclosure of certain personal identifier\ninformation gathered in the course of federally funded research on human subjects. 28\n4.50 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\nC.F.R. Part 46 and 45 C.F.R. section 46. This does not apply to information gathered by\na state court in the normal course of judicial business, but it might apply to individuals\n\n      Page 30 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\nrequesting information from court records for research purposes under section 4.30 (bulk\naccess) or section 4.40 (compiled access). 28 C.F.R. § 46.101 (b)(4).\n\nSubsection (c) Finally, the task force determined that there are few if any circumstances\nwhere merits of public disclosure of social security numbers, financial account numbers,\nminor children and birth dates would outweigh the privacy interests implicated. Thus, in\nlight of the absence of specific state or federal protection of such information when\ncontained in court records that are otherwise accessible to the public, the task force feels\nit is necessary to include this protection in these court rules.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to comply with this rule. The task force believes that the\nfollowing are the most effective ways to accomplish this purpose:\n\n1.      Social security numbers. The task force recommends the disclosure of no more\nthan the last four digits of the social security number. However, as the task force does\nnot have the specific expertise to determine the implications of the publication of just\npartial social security numbers upon the individual’s privacy interests, this\nrecommendation is provisional. The task force would recommend to the Court that\nduring the public comment period, a special invitation be made to members of the public\nwho have this specific expertise so the implications of even partial disclosure of social\nsecurity numbers can be thoroughly explored.\n\n2.      Financial account numbers. The task force supports the disclosure of only the\nlast four digits of any such account. As with the prior recommendation, however, this\nrecommendation is provisional, as the task force does not have the specific expertise to\ndetermine the implications of the publication of partial financial account numbers upon\nthe individual’s the privacy interests. The task force would recommend to the Court that\nduring the public comment period, a special invitation be made to members of the public\nwho have this specific expertise so the implications of even partial disclosure of financial\naccount numbers can be thoroughly explored.\n\n3.      Minor’s names. In those situations where state law does not otherwise require\nthe disclosure of minor’s names, the task force supports the use of fictitious names to\nrefer to children victims or witnesses in court records accessible to the public. We agree\nthat the use of initials to accomplish this purpose does not, given Montana’s modest\npopulation, accord the privacy warranted in these situations.\n\n4.      Full birth dates of any person. The task force supports the disclosure of only\nthe birth year, and not the month or date of birth.\n\n\n\n\n     Page 31 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f          Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                       Access to What\n\n\n\n\nPage 32 of 44     Privacy and Access Task Force      November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                              Access to What\n\nSection 4.60 - Requests to Prohibit Public Access to Information in Court\nRecords Or to Obtain Access to Restricted Information\n\n(a)    A motion or request to prohibit public access to information in a court record may\n       be made by any party to a case, the individual about whom information is present\n       in the court record, the clerk of court, or on the court's own motion. The court\n       must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to prohibit access by\n       determining whether the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits\n       of public disclosure.\n\n       The court should require that a party file a motion to protect the information, with\n       the information to be protected in a sealed envelope lodged, but not filed, with the\n       court. If the court grants the motion or request, the information will be filed\n       under seal. If the court denies the request, the party will have the option to file\n       the information with knowledge that it will be accessible to the public.\n\n(b)    In restricting access the court will use the least restrictive means that will achieve\n       the purposes of the access rules and the needs of the requestor.\n\n       A request to obtain access to information in a court record to which access is\n       prohibited under section 4.50 or 4.60(a) of these rules may be made by any\n       member of the public or on the court's own motion upon notice as provided in\n       subsection 4.60(c). The court must decide whether there are sufficient grounds to\n       prohibit access by determining whether the demand of individual privacy clearly\n       exceeds the merits of public disclosure. When the request is made for bulk or\n       compiled information to which public access has been prohibited under Section\n       4.50 and 4.60 (a) of these rules, the court should consider the actions provided in\n       section 4.40 (c) when making such a determination.\n\n(c)    The following is the process for making requests described in 4.50(a) and 4.50 (b)\n       where that process is not provided in statute or case law. The request shall be\n       made by a written motion to the court. The requestor will give notice to all\n       parties in the case except as prohibited by law. The court may require notice to be\n       given by the requestor or another party to any individuals or entities identified in\n       the information that is the subject of the request. When the request is for access\n       to information to which access was previously prohibited under section 4.60(a),\n       the court will provide notice to the individual or entity that requested that access\n       be prohibited either itself or by directing a party to give the notice.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 33 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                    Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                 Access to What\n\n4.60 (Commentary)\n\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section lays out the basic considerations and processes for prohibiting access to\notherwise publicly available information (often referred to as sealing), or opening access\nto restricted information (whether restricted under section 4.50 or section 4.60(a)). The\nlanguage incorporates the presumption of openness, and the need for sufficient grounds\nto overcome the presumption. The section also specifies the mechanism for making the\nrequest and directs the court to use the least restrictive approach possible when restricting\npublic access. The section reflects that the consideration must be made by the court on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nSubsection (a) allows anyone who is identified in the court record to request prohibition\nof public access. This specification is quite broad, including a witness in a case or\nsomeone about whom personally identifiable information is present in the court record,\nbut who is not a party to the action. While the reach of the rule is quite broad, this is\nrequired to meet the intent of subsection 1.00 (a)(6) regarding protection of individual\nprivacy rights and interests, not just the privacy rights and interests of parties to a case.\nProtection is available for someone who is referred to in the case, but does not have the\noptions or protections a party to the case would have.\n\nSubsection (a) provides only for prohibiting access to information, not prohibiting access\nto the existence of the information. Section 4.10(b) specifically provides that the\nexistence of information to which access is prohibited will be publicly accessible.\nSubsection (a) does not have any restrictions regarding when the request can be made,\nimplying it can be done at any time.\n\nThis subsection provides that it is the court that will decide whether access will be\nprohibited. Even if all parties agree that public access to information should be\nprohibited, this is not binding on the court, which must still make the decision based on\nthe applicable law.\n\nSubsection (a) also addresses what access is permitted between the time a request to\nprohibit access is made and the court rules on the request. This is particularly critical if\nthe request is made simultaneously with the filing of the information. It is also more\ncritical where the parties represent themselves and are unaware of appropriate\nprocedures. A court should require that a party file a motion to prohibit access with the\ninformation to be protected in a sealed envelope being lodged, but not filed, with the\ncourt. If the court grants the request, the information can be filed with prohibition to\n      Page 34 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                                Access to What\n\n4.60 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\naccess. If the request is denied, the party has the option of filing the information without\nprohibition of access, or not filing it. In order to avoid the misuse of such a provision to\nachieve at least temporary restriction, a court should establish procedures that provide for\nprompt consideration of a request to prohibit access.\n\nThe last paragraph to subsection (a) requires the court to seek an approach that minimizes\nthe amount of information that cannot be accessed, as opposed to an \"all or nothing\"\napproach. This is directed at the question of what to do about a document or other\nmaterial in the court record that contains some information to which access should be\nprohibited along with other information that remains publicly accessible. The issue\nbecomes one of whether it is technically possible to redact some information from a\ndocument and to allow the balance of the document to be publicly available. Less\nrestrictive methods include redaction of pieces of information in the record, sealing of\nonly certain pages of a document, as opposed to the entire document, or sealing of a\ndocument, but not the entire file. As noted previously (see commentary under section\n3.20) newer technologies permit tagging of information in an electronic records in a way\nthat readily allows electronic redaction of pieces of information in an electronic\ndocument, and courts are encouraged to obtain this capability when acquiring new\nsystems. As discussed in the commentary to section 4.10, other approaches to restricting\naccess to names would preferably include using pseudonyms or other unique identifier\nrather than a full or real name.\n\nIn addition to whether it is technically possible, there may be an issue of whether it is\nfeasible to redact information in a record, and whether the court or clerk has the resources\nto do so. The work needed to exhaustively review a large file or document to find\ninformation to be redacted may be prohibitive, such that access to the whole file or\ndocument would be restricted, rather than attempting redaction.\n\nThere is information that may be contained in court records which has not been protected\nin state statute, but may raise significant privacy interests that individuals may seek to\nprotect pursuant to this section.\n\n1.

This subsection addresses those situations where the reasons\nfor prohibiting access no longer apply or have changed so that the merits of public\ndisclosure of the information now outweigh the interest in privacy. .\n\nSubsection (b) provides a standard and procedure for reviewing a previous decision to\nprohibit public access to information.\n\nSubsection (b) provides that \"any member of the public\" can make the request for access\nto prohibited information.

Court records in electronic form to which the court\n       allows remote access under these rules will be available for access at least during\n       the hours established by the court for courthouse access, subject to unexpected\n       technical failures or normal system maintenance announced in advance.\n\n(b)    Upon receiving a request for access to information the court will respond within a\n       reasonable time regarding the availability of the information and provide the\n       information within a reasonable time.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section requires a court to specify when court records are accessible. The rules\ndirect, as a minimum, that remote access be available at the same times as records are\naccessible at the courthouse. This section does not preclude or require “after hours”\naccess to court records in electronic form. Courts are encouraged to provide access to\nrecords in electronic form beyond the hours access is available at the courthouse, with a\ngoal of 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, it is not the intent of the rules to\nrequire courts to expend money or other resources to make remote access possible\noutside of normal business hours. The section acknowledges that access to electronic\nrecords may occasionally not be available during normal business hours because of\nunexpected interruptions to information technology systems, crashes, and during planned\ninterruptions such as for back-up of databases, software upgrades or maintenance, or\nhardware upgrades or maintenance.\n\nSubsection (b) addresses the question of how quickly the information will be made\navailable. There are a number of factors that can affect how quickly the court responds to\na request and provides the information, assuming it is publicly accessible. The response\nwill be slower if the request is non-specific, is for a large amount of information, is for\ninformation that is in off-site storage, or requires significant amounts of court resources\nto respond to the request. The objective is to have a prompt and timely response to a\n      Page 38 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                   Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n\n\n5.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\nrequest for information.\n\n\n\nFees\nSection 6.00 – Fees for Access\n\n(a)     Disclosure or distribution of documents is subject to the payment of applicable\nfees as set by statute.\n\n(b)     The court may charge a fee for bulk distribution or compiled information in\naccordance with state law. To the extent that public access to information is provided\nexclusively through a vendor, the court will ensure that any fee imposed by the vendor\nfor the cost of bulk and compiled information is reasonable and covers the vendor's actual\ncosts.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section recognizes that providing access to information in court records does\nconsume court resources. Access is not without cost. Statutory fees of the clerk of\ndistrict court are enumerated in § 25-1-201, MCA. The preparation and access to the\ntranscript of proceedings is within the authority of the court reporter, not the court. In\nsuch instances the existing state laws and rules governing the cost of the transcript, in\npaper or electronic form, apply. See § 3-5-604, MCA.\n\nFees for bulk access pursuant to section 4.30 or compiled access pursuant to section 4.40,\nwhich require special programming or actions because the information is not regularly\navailable in the form requested, shall be calculated in accordance with § 2-6-110, MCA.\n\nThis section also provides that if access is provided exclusively through a vendor, any fee\nimposed must be reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 39 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                   November 2006\n\f                Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n      Obligation of Vendors Providing Information Technology Support\n\n\nSection 7.00 -- Obligation of Vendors Providing Information Technology\nSupport to a Court to Maintain Court Records\n\n(a)     If a court contracts with a vendor to provide information technology support to\n        gather, store, or make accessible court records, the contract will require the\n        vendor to comply with the intent and provisions of these access rules. For\n        purposes of this section, “vendor” includes a state, county or local governmental\n        agency that provides information technology services to a court as well as private\n        contractors.\n\n(b)     By contract the vendor will be required to comply with the requirement of\n        sections 8.10, 8.20, 8.30, 8.40 and 8.50 to educate litigants, the public, and its\n        employees and subcontractors about the provisions of the access policy.\n\n(c)     By contract the vendor will be required to notify the court of any requests for\n        compiled information or bulk distribution of information, including the vendor’s\n        requests for such information for its own use. Accordingly, rules 4.30 and 4.40\n        apply.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section addresses situations where information technology services are provided to a\ncourt by another agency, usually in the executive branch, or by outsourcing of court\ninformation technology services to non-governmental entities. The intent is to have the\nrules apply regardless of who is providing the services involving court records. Implicit\nin these rules is that court records are under the control of the judiciary, and that the\njudiciary has the responsibility to ensure public access to court records and to restrict\naccess where appropriate.\n\nThe section provides a standard applicable to vendors as well as the courts. Regulating\nvendors is also relevant to the issue of liability of the court for release of information that\ncauses harm, particularly if there is no judicial immunity regarding adoption or\nimplementation of a local policy.\n\nSubsection (a): “Information technology support” is meant to include a wide range of\nactivities, including records management services or equipment, making and keeping the\nverbatim record, computer hardware or software, database management, web sites, and\ncommunications services used by the court to maintain court records and provide public\n\n       Page 40 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f             Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n   Obligation of Vendors Providing Information Technology Support\n\n\n7.00 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\naccess to them. It would also apply to vendors who are only providing access to a copy of\nelectronic court records maintained by the court itself or by an executive branch agency.\n\nVendor compliance is particularly important where the vendor’s system is the only means\nof accessing the information. The court must ensure that the vendor is not using the\nexclusive control of access to limit access, whether through fees, technology\nrequirements, or a requirement to sign a “user agreement,” particularly if it imposes\nrestrictions on the use of the information that the court could not impose. Subsection (b):\nThe requirements of the rules regarding a vendor educating its employees or\nsubcontractors, litigants, and the public are in addition to any incentive to do so provided\nby the liability or indemnity provisions of applicable law or the contract or agreement\nwith the court.\n\nSubsection (c): This subsection requires vendors to notify the court of requests for bulk\ninformation (pursuant to section 4.30) or compiled information (pursuant to section 4.40).\nThe court must receive this notice in order to properly control the release of information\nin its records.\n\n\nObligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\nSection 8.00 – Information and Education Regarding Access Rules\n\nSection 8.10 – Dissemination of Information to Litigants about Access to\nInformation in Court Records\n\nThe court will make information available to litigants and the public that information in\nthe court record about them is accessible to the public, including remotely and how to\nrequest to restrict the manner of access or to prohibit public access.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section recognizes that litigants may not be aware that information provided to the\ncourt, by them or other parties in the case, generally is accessible to the public, including,\n\n      Page 41 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                  Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                 Obligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\n8.10 (Commentary, cont.)\n\n\n\npossibly, bulk downloads. Litigants may also be unaware that some of the information\nmay be available in electronic form, possibly even remotely. This section requires the\ncourts to inform litigants about public access to court records so they can make efforts to\nprotect their privacy throughout the proceedings. Such a requirement ensures that the\npublic is provided the information necessary to protect their interests.\n\nThis section also specifically requires the court to inform litigants of the process for\nrequesting restrictions to the manner of access under section 4.50, and to inform litigants\nabout how to request prohibition of public access to information in their case pursuant to\nsection 4.60. This would be especially important in cases involving domestic violence,\nsexual assault, stalking, or requests for protective orders, and witnesses where there is a\ngreater risk of harm to individuals.\n\n\n\n\n      Page 42 of 44         Privacy and Access Task Force                  November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                Obligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\n\nSection 8.20 – Dissemination of Information to the Public about Accessing\nCourt Records\n\nThe Court will develop and make information available to the public about how to obtain\naccess to court records pursuant to these rules.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nPublic access to court records is meaningless if the public does not know how to access\nthe records. This section establishes an obligation on the court to provide information to\nthe public, which should include jurors, victims, witnesses and other participants in\njudicial proceedings, about how to access court records.\n\n\nSection 8.30 – Education of Judges and Court Personnel about the Access\nRules\n\nAll Courts and clerks of court shall ensure that their personnel comply with these access\nrules and respond to requests for access in a manner consistent with the rules.\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nThis section mandates that the court and clerk of court educate and train their employees\nto be able to properly implement an access policy. Properly trained employees will\nprovide better customer service, facilitating access when appropriate, and preventing\naccess when access is restricted or prohibited. When properly trained, there is also less\nrisk of inappropriate disclosure, thereby protecting privacy and lowering risk to\nindividuals from disclosure of sensitive information. Training should also be provided to\nemployees of other agencies, or their contractors, who have access to information in court\nrecords, for example as part of shared integrated criminal justice information systems.\n\n\n\n\n     Page 43 of 44          Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f                 Draft-Model Access Rules with Commentary\n                Obligation of the Court to Inform and Educate\n\n\nSection 8.40 – Education about Process to Change Inaccurate Information in\na Court Record\n\nAll Courts will inform the public of the rules by which the court will correct, expunge or\nupdate inaccurate information.\n\nSection 8.50 - Procedure to Correct, Expunge or Update Inaccurate\nInformation\n\nAn individual who believes that a case record contains clerical errors may submit a\nwritten request for correction to the court, clerk of court, or other custodian who\nmaintains the record, with a copy served on all parties to the case. Such request shall be\nno longer than two pages in length. The custodian shall promptly do one of the\nfollowing:\n\n(a) correct a clerical error for which no court order is required: (b) forward the request to\nthe court to be considered informally; or (c) forward the request to the party or participant\nwho submitted the record containing the alleged clerical error who in turn may seek\nappropriate relief from the court. Upon forwarding under clause (b), the court may either\ncorrect the error on its own initiative or direct that the request will only be considered\npursuant to a motion requesting correction. The court’s direction may also establish\nappropriate requirements for a motion. The request for correction authorized in the rule\nneed not be exhausted before other relief is requested.\n\n\nTask Force Commentary and Selected Text from CCJ/COSCA Guidelines for\nPublic Access to Court Records\n\nCourt records are as susceptible to errors or incomplete information as any other public\nrecord. Section 8.40 and 8.50 establishes the method for reviewing information in court\nrecords and making any changes or additions to make the record more accurate or\ncomplete.\n\n\n\n\n     Page 44 of 44           Privacy and Access Task Force                 November 2006\n\f</pre>",
