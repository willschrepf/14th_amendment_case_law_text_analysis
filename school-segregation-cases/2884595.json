As explained below, because\n\fthe appeal does not present a substantial issue, we will summarily affirm the judgment of\n\nthe District Court.\n\n       In his petition, Jackson challenges the result of a prison disciplinary hearing at\n\nwhich he was found guilty of using marijuana. According to Jackson, he was arrested on\n\nFebruary 9, 2004. Later that day he arrived at FDC-Honolulu, where officials began\n\ntaking urine samples from him three days later based on information received from a\n\nconfidential informant. All the tests performed within 36 days of his arrival were positive\n\nfor THC, a metabolite of marijuana. As a result of the test on March 17, 2004, Jackson\n\nreceived an incident report. He was charged with use of narcotics, found guilty, and\n\nreceived as sanctions loss of visitation for six months, window visits only for six months,\n\nand 60 days’ segregation, to be served consecutively. Jackson also states that he was\n\nplaced in a higher security prison, and cannot be transferred to a facility closer to his\n\nfamily.\n\n       In his petition Jackson does not contest that THC was found in his urine but\n\ncomplains that the verdict was not properly supported and should be expunged from his\n\nprison file. According to Jackson, he had been regularly using marijuana for 15 years and\n\nwas smoking it on the day of his arrest. Moreover, the marijuana he used was highly\n\npotent and thus, especially in light of his weight (more than 300 pounds), more likely to\n\nremain longer in his system. Jackson complains that the prison refused to hear testimony\n\nfrom a toxicologist who would have “dispute[d] the DHO finding of thirty days as the\n\ntime frame of THC in a persons [sic] system,” and points out that all his urine tests after\n\n                                              2\n\fMarch 17, 2004, were negative. He also complains that the prison refused to hear\n\ntestimony from the arresting FBI agent, who would have explained that Jackson was\n\nsmoking marijuana right up to his arrest, and that the testing policies at FCD-Honolulu\n\nare “out dated and could not be used to support the finding of narcotic use within the first\n\nthirty six days of incarceration.”\n\n       The District Court declined to decide whether Jackson’s petition was properly\n\ntreated as a § 2241 petition or a § 1983 complaint but found his claims meritless anyway\n\nand denied the petition. This appeal followed.1\n\n       Jackson should have brought his action under § 1983 rather than § 2241. He does\n\nnot allege that he will stay in prison longer as a result of the disciplinary proceedings, nor\n\ndo his claims otherwise implicate the fact or duration of his term of incarceration. See\n\nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475 (1973); Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997);\n\nTorres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n       Jackson’s claims fail under § 1983 because he does not allege that he has suffered\n\na violation of a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. As the District Court\n\nexplained, the penalties he suffered are not atypical and significant in relation to the\n\nordinary incidents of prison life. As a result, the BOP had no obligation to provide due\n\nprocess. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995); Torres, supra. Nor were Jackson’s\n\ndue process rights implicated by such collateral consequences as participation in\n\n\n       1\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and review the District Court’s\ndecision de novo. Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n                                              3\n\fprograms and the location of the prison in which he is housed. See Olim v. Wakinekona,\n\n461 U.S. 238 (1983) (prisoner has no constitutionally protected interest in the place of his\n\nconfinement); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976) (liberty interest of prisoner not\n\nimplicated by transfer from medium to maximum security); Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S.\n\n78, 88 n.9 (1976) (due process clause not implicated by prison officials’ decisions\n\nconcerning inmate classifications).\n\n       Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f",
