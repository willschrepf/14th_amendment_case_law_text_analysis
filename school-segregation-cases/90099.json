The district\n\fcourt   dismissed    with   prejudice       all   of   Aguilar’s    complaints,\n\nreasoning that the claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nWe AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n                                       I.\n\n\n\n       First, Aguilar contends that the magistrate judge erred by\n\ndenying him leave to amend his complaint.              Prior to any defendant\n\nfiling an answer to the original complaint, Aguilar filed a motion\n\nto amend his complaint.       The magistrate judge denied the motion.\n\nThe magistrate noted that Aguilar’s co-plaintiffs, who were not\n\nmentioned in the proposed amended complaint, had not signed the\n\nproposed amended complaint and that the new complaint included only\n\nclaims relating to Aguilar.         The magistrate judge also pointed out\n\nthat    the   proposed    amended    complaint     sought   to     add    six   new\n\ndefendants    who   had   little    connection     with   the    events    in   the\n\noriginal complaint and to add new claims concerning incidents that\n\noccurred after the original complaint was filed.                 The magistrate\n\nconcluded that adding new defendants and claims that had nothing to\n\ndo with the original complaint would be inefficient and possibly\n\nconfusing.    He also determined that it would be unfair to the other\n\nplaintiffs to allow Aguilar to effectively drop their claims by\n\namending the complaint to allow only his claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f     Aguilar maintains that he did not attempt to have the other\n\nplaintiffs join the amendment because he was under the impression\n\nthat the district court had entered an order stating that it would\n\nnot accept any filings from the other plaintiffs.                  In fact, the\n\ndistrict court had entered such an order: the court would not\n\naccept any of the co-plaintiffs’ filings, other than a motion for\n\nextension of time, until they complied with the court’s requirement\n\nthat they provide the appropriate in forma pauperis material.\n\n     A court’s denial of leave to amend a complaint is usually\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.                See Ashe v. Corley, 992 F.2d\n\n540, 542 (5th Cir. 1993).              However, “[a] party may amend the\n\nparty’s pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a\n\nresponsive pleading is served . . . .”             FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a).     This\n\nrule implies that the court has no discretion to deny such an\n\namendment.    See Vernell for and on Behalf of Vernell v. United\n\nStates Postal Serv., 819 F.2d 108, 110 (5th Cir. 1987), overruled\n\non other grounds, McGuire v. Turnbo, 137 F.3d 321 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n     No cases in this circuit have addressed directly whether a\n\ncourt has any discretion to deny a party’s right to amend the\n\ncomplaint before the filing of a responsive pleading because\n\nsignatures of co-plaintiffs were not present.               While under normal\n\ncircumstances a plaintiff would have an absolute right to amend his\n\ncomplaint    before    the    filing    of   a    responsive   pleading,    these\n\ncircumstances    are    not    normal.       In    this   case,   Aguilar’s   co-\n\n\n                                         3\n\fplaintiffs did not join in the motion to amend.       The original\n\ncomplaint belonged to these plaintiffs as well as to Aguilar;\n\nallowing Aguilar to amend the complaint without any indication that\n\nthe other plaintiffs agreed to the motion could have prejudiced\n\ntheir action. Thus, the magistrate did not abuse his discretion by\n\nrefusing Aguilar’s motion to amend.\n\n\n\n                                II.\n\n\n\n     The district court did not err in finding that the Eleventh\n\nAmendment bars Aguilar’s claims.       The Eleventh Amendment bars\n\nclaims against a state brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   See\n\nFarias v. Bexar County Bd. of Trustees for Mental Health Mental\n\nRetardation Servs., 925 F.2d 866, 875 n.9 (5th Cir. 1991). Section\n\n1983 does not waive the states’ sovereign immunity, see Quern v.\n\nJordan, 440 U.S. 332, 338 n.7 (1979), and Texas has not consented\n\nto this suit.   See Emory v. Texas State Bd. of Med. Exam’rs, 748\n\nF.2d 1023, 1025 (5th Cir. 1984).\n\n     The Eleventh Amendment also bars a suit against a state\n\nofficial when “the state is a real, substantial party in interest.”\n\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101-02\n\n(1984)(citations omitted).   Thus,\n\n     [t]he general rule is that relief sought nominally\n     against an officer is in fact against the sovereign if\n     the decree would operate against the latter. And, as\n     when the State itself is named as the defendant, a suit\n\n                                   4\n\f     against state officials that is in fact a suit against a\n     State is barred regardless of whether it seeks damages or\n     injunctive relief.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n     In Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), the Supreme Court\n\ncarved out an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity.              The Court\n\nheld that enforcement of an unconstitutional law is not an official\n\nact because a state can not confer authority on its officers to\n\nviolate the Constitution or federal law.          See American Bank & Trust\n\nCo. of Opelousas v. Dent, 982 F.2d 917, 920-21 (5th Cir. 1993).             To\n\nmeet the Ex Parte Young exception, a plaintiff’s suit alleging a\n\nviolation of federal law must be brought against individual persons\n\nin their official capacities as agents of the state, and the relief\n\nsought must be declaratory or injunctive in nature and prospective\n\nin effect.     See Saltz v. Tennessee Dep’t of Employment Sec., 976\n\nF.2d 966, 968 (5th Cir. 1992).\n\n     Aguilar    argues   on   appeal       that   Texas   is   not   the   real\n\nsubstantial party in interest in his suit; rather, his claims for\n\ninjunctive relief are against the state officials who implemented\n\nthe alleged unconstitutional Texas Department of Criminal Justice -\n\nInstitutional Division (“TDCJ-ID”) policies.              Aguilar’s original\n\npetition demonstrates, however, that he sued TDCJ-ID itself for\n\ninjunctive relief, not any state official in his or her individual\n\ncapacity as an agent of the state.          And, as an instrumentality of\n\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fthe state, TDCJ-ID is immune from Aguilar’s suit on Eleventh\n\nAmendment grounds.   See Farias, 925 F.2d at 875 n.9.\n\n\n\n                               III.\n\n\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of dismissal.\n\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\f",
