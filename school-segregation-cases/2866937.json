SCHLUETER, ESQUIRE (Argued)\nAssistant United States Attorney\nOffice of United States Attorney\n633 United States Post Office & Courthouse\nPittsburgh, PA 15219\nAttorneys for Appellee\n\fOPINION OF THE COURT\n\fNYGAARD, Circuit Judge\n\n          Roderick Edwards appeals the district court's order\n\ndenying his petition for habeas corpus relief.   Edwards contends\n\nthat the Bureau of Prisons improperly denied him sentence credit\n\nfor the time he spent in home confinement on bond pending appeal.\n\nThe district court denied his petition.   The sole issue on appeal\n\nis whether his home confinement rises to the penal valence of\n\n\"official detention\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b),\n\nthus entitling him to credit against his sentence.   We conclude\n\nthat it does not and will affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n           Edwards pleaded guilty to distribution and possession\n\nwith intent to distribute cocaine base.   The court then placed\n\nEdwards on pre-trial home detention pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3142(c) to ensure his appearance at trial and to protect the\n\npublic.   For a period of nine to ten months, Edwards was confined\n\nto his uncle's home under electronic monitoring and could not\n\nleave without permission of Pretrial Services.   He was granted a\n\nnumber of \"black out periods\" to leave his uncle's apartment and\n\nattend church, church choir practice, attorney and court\n\nappointments.\n\n           Edwards was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment,\n\nfollowed by five years supervised release.   At sentencing,\n\nEdwards requested sentence credit for the nine to ten months he\n\nspent in home confinement, which the district court denied.\n\n           The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed\n\nand held that sentencing courts have the authority to determine\n\fwhether a form of confinement amounts to \"official detention\" and\n\nwhether sentence credit should be granted under § 3585(b).\n\nUnited States v. Edwards, 960 F.2d 278 (2d Cir. 1992).     Shortly\n\nthereafter, the Supreme Court, in United States v. Wilson, 112\n\nS.Ct 1351 (1992), held that § 3585(b) does not authorize a\n\ndistrict court to award credit at sentencing and that the\n\nAttorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, is to make the\n\nsentence credit determination for a defendant.     Id. at 1354-1355.\n\n          In light of Wilson, Edwards filed a petition with the\n\nBureau of Prisons, again raising the issue.     The Bureau denied\n\nEdwards' petition for \"prior custody credit.\"     Having exhausted\n\nhis administrative remedies, Edwards, now incarcerated at a\n\nfederal corrections facility in Loretto, Pennsylvania, filed a\n\npetition for habeas corpus relief, raising the same denial of\n\nsentence credit issue.\n\n             The district court referred the case to a magistrate\n\njudge, who recommended that the district court find the\n\nrestrictions on Edwards' freedom were not equal to official\n\ndetention.     The district court rejected Edwards' objections, and\n\nadopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, except\n\na portion of the report recommending that \"residential\n\nconfinement ... never [be considered] legally onerous enough to\n\nconstitute official detention.\"     Specifically, the district\n\ncourt's order stated that Edwards had \"not been restrained to so\n\nsignificant a degree that it would constitute 'official\n\ndetention' under the statute.\"\n\f             Edwards again argues that the time he spent in home\n\nconfinement constitutes \"official detention\" as that term is used\n\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b), which provides in pertinent part:\n                  Credit for prior custody - A\n\n                  defendant shall be given credit\n                  toward the service of a term of\n                  imprisonment for any time he has\n                  spent in official detention prior\n                  to the date the sentence commences\n                  (1) as a result of the offense for\n                  which the sentence was imposed. . .\n\n\nThe government does not dispute Edwards concerning the conditions\n\nof his home detention, but argues that the decision of the Bureau\n\nof Prisons, which found that Edwards' court-ordered, pre-trial\n\nresidential segregation did not amount to \"official detention,\"\n\nwas reasonable under the statute and entitled to substantial\n\ndeference.\n\n             Ordinarily, agency decisions are subject to limited\n\nreview and can be overturned only if they are arbitrary,\n\ncapricious or an abuse of discretion, especially when Congress\n\nhas given the agency the authority to carry out a statute's\n\npurpose.   National Small Shipments Traffic Conference, Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 887 F.2d 443, 446 (3d Cir. 1989), cert. denied,\n\n495 U.S. 918 (1990).     Moreover, an agency's interpretation of a\n\nstatute that it is responsible for administering is entitled to\n\nsubstantial deference.     Chevron U.S.A. v. National Resources\n\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984).\n\nHere, as the Supreme Court noted in United States v. Wilson,       112\n\nS.Ct. 1351 (1992), the Attorney General, through the Bureau of\n\fPrisons, has long been trusted with the authority to calculate\n\nsentence credit for time previously served.   Id. at 1355.\n\nNevertheless, because the Bureau of Prisons' assessment of\n\nEdwards' home confinement was based on its \"Program Statements1\",\n\nmere internal guidelines rather than its published regulations,\n\nits interpretation is entitled to a minimal degree of deference.\n\nSee Koray v. Sizer, 21 F.3d 558, 562 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing FLRA\n\nv. United States Dep't of Navy, 966 F.2d 747, 762 & n. 14 (3d\n\nCir. 1992)(in banc)).\n\n          In Koray v. Sizer, 21 F.3d 558 (3d Cir. 1994), we held\n\nthat the time a detainee spends in a halfway house pursuant to\n\ncourt order may be \"official detention\" if the restrictions on a\n\ndetainee's liberty were equivalent to \"jail-type\" confinement.\n\nEdwards asserts that his home confinement was so restrictive that\n\nit approached jail-type confinement, and that the Bureau of\n\nPrisons abused its discretion in finding that his confinement was\n\nnot \"official detention\" under § 3585(b).\n\n          Edwards simply cannot carry his burden: the terms of\n\nhis home confinement were just not sufficiently onerous to\n1\n . Before the Supreme Court decided Wilson, the Bureau of\nPrisons issued a policy statement on February 21, 1992 that made\nreference to sentence credit. The Bureau of Prisons Sentence\nComputation Manual CCCA Program Statement 5880.28 (February 21,\n1992) provides that, \"[a] condition of bail or bond which is\n'highly restrictive', and that includes 'house arrest',\n'electronic monitoring' or 'home confinement' . . . is not\nconsidered as time in official detention.\"\n          However, \"[t]he Bureau's interpretation is recorded in\nits 'Program Statements', which are merely internal agency\nguidelines and may be altered by the Bureau at will.\" Koray, 21\nF.3d at 562 (citing Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement\n1121.02.1.2.1. (April 12, 1993)).\n\fapproach jail-type incarceration, and, therefore, did not\n\nconstitute official detention within the meaning of § 3585.\n\nEdwards minimizes the frequent \"blackout\" periods he was given\n\nwhere he was allowed to leave his uncle's apartment to attend\n\nchurch and social events.   Although he was on electronically\n\nmonitored release and could not leave his uncle's apartment\n\nwithout permission from Pretrial Services, Edwards was frequently\n\nallowed to leave the apartment.   There is no evidence that there\n\nwere any restrictions placed on the number of guests he could\n\nhave at his uncle's home.   There is no evidence that limitations\n\nwere put on the frequency of his guests' visits.    Finally,\n\nEdwards argues that he was not allowed to work while he was in\n\nhome confinement, but no evidence was presented that Edwards had\n\na job or had to refuse employment because of the confinement.\n\n          During the first five months of home confinement,\n\nEdwards was given permission to attend twenty-two social\n\nfunctions, and one personal outing.   Further, from November 22,\n\n1990 to April 11, 1991, Edwards was given permanent blackout\n\nperiods every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5:00 p.m. to\n\n10:00 p.m. for choir rehearsal, every Saturday from 11:00 a.m. to\n\n4:00 p.m. for choir meetings, and every Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to\n\n7:00 p.m. for church service and evening service.    Moreover,\n\nduring the last four months of his release, Edwards was permitted\n\napproximately thirty hours per week outside of his home\n\nconfinement for church activities.    Finally, his weekend blackout\n\nperiods were extended on three occasions.\n\f          Edwards may argue and indeed prove that his home\n\nconfinement deterred him and taught him a lesson, contained him\n\nand protected society, and even totally rehabilitated him.       That,\n\nhowever, is beside the point.    By Congress' scheme, it simply\n\ndoes not matter that the condition of Edwards' home confinement\n\nmay have accomplished all this.    The penologically uncertain, but\n\nnonetheless patent objective of offense-based sentencing under\n\nthe Sentencing Reform Act is retributive and punitive.\n\nCongress has determined that the sinner must suffer.     Edwards was\n\nplaced on court-ordered, pretrial detention to ensure his\n\nappearance at trial, and the fairly modest nature of the\n\nrestrictions placed on him reflects that purpose.     His home\n\nconfinement was not sufficiently jail-like to punish and he gets\n\nno credit.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Edwards next argues that the Bureau of Prisons should\n\nhave given him sentence credit because similarly situated\n\nsentenced persons confined under the same conditions receive\n\nsentence credit.    This is not true.   Edwards, convicted of\n\ndistributing cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a),\n\ncould not even be sentenced to home detention.     Section 5C1.1(f)\n\nexplicitly states that if a defendant's \"guideline range is more\n\nthan ten months, the guidelines require that the minimum term be\n\nsatisfied by a sentence of imprisonment.\"     U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(f)\n\n(1990).\n\n          Edwards' guideline range for violating § 841(a) is well\n\nabove ten months.    He pleaded guilty to distributing fifty grams\n\for more of cocaine base, which carries a base level offense of\n\nsixteen under the Sentencing Guidelines.   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\n\n(1990).   At a minimum, this would result in a twenty-one month\n\nsentence, and here when his criminal history and other charges\n\nwere taken into account, Edwards received a 120-month sentence.\n\nEdwards bears no similarity to others sentenced to home\n\nconfinement, because he simply could not have been given such a\n\nsentence.\n\n                                III.\n\n            In sum, we will affirm the district court's denial of\n\nEdwards' petition for habeas relief.   The district court gave\n\nappropriate deference to the Bureau's conclusion, made the\n\nunassailable factual determination that Edwards' home confinement\n\nwith electronic monitoring was not sufficiently restrictive to\n\nmeet the Koray test, and properly concluded that his home\n\nconfinement was not \"official detention\" under § 3585(b).     We\n\nwill affirm.\n\f",

The district court rejected Edwards' objections, and\n\nadopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, except\n\na portion of the report recommending that \"residential\n\nconfinement ... never [be considered] legally onerous enough to\n\nconstitute official detention.\"     Specifically, the district\n\ncourt's order stated that Edwards had \"not been restrained to so\n\nsignificant a degree that it would constitute 'official\n\ndetention' under the statute.\"\n\f             Edwards again argues that the time he spent in home\n\nconfinement constitutes \"official detention\" as that term is used\n\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b), which provides in pertinent part:\n                  Credit for prior custody - A\n\n                  defendant shall be given credit\n                  toward the service of a term of\n                  imprisonment for any time he has\n                  spent in official detention prior\n                  to the date the sentence commences\n                  (1) as a result of the offense for\n                  which the sentence was imposed. . .\n\n\nThe government does not dispute Edwards concerning the conditions\n\nof his home detention, but argues that the decision of the Bureau\n\nof Prisons, which found that Edwards' court-ordered, pre-trial\n\nresidential segregation did not amount to \"official detention,\"\n\nwas reasonable under the statute and entitled to substantial\n\ndeference.\n\n             Ordinarily, agency decisions are subject to limited\n\nreview and can be overturned only if they are arbitrary,\n\ncapricious or an abuse of discretion, especially when Congress\n\nhas given the agency the authority to carry out a statute's\n\npurpose.

Before the Supreme Court decided Wilson, the Bureau of\nPrisons issued a policy statement on February 21, 1992 that made\nreference to sentence credit. The Bureau of Prisons Sentence\nComputation Manual CCCA Program Statement 5880.28 (February 21,\n1992) provides that, \"[a] condition of bail or bond which is\n'highly restrictive', and that includes 'house arrest',\n'electronic monitoring' or 'home confinement' . . . is not\nconsidered as time in official detention.\"\n          However, \"[t]he Bureau's interpretation is recorded in\nits 'Program Statements', which are merely internal agency\nguidelines and may be altered by the Bureau at will.\" Koray, 21\nF.3d at 562 (citing Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement\n1121.02.1.2.1. (April 12, 1993)).\n\fapproach jail-type incarceration, and, therefore, did not\n\nconstitute official detention within the meaning of § 3585.\n\nEdwards minimizes the frequent \"blackout\" periods he was given\n\nwhere he was allowed to leave his uncle's apartment to attend\n\nchurch and social events.   Although he was on electronically\n\nmonitored release and could not leave his uncle's apartment\n\nwithout permission from Pretrial Services, Edwards was frequently\n\nallowed to leave the apartment.   There is no evidence that there\n\nwere any restrictions placed on the number of guests he could\n\nhave at his uncle's home.   There is no evidence that limitations\n\nwere put on the frequency of his guests' visits.    Finally,\n\nEdwards argues that he was not allowed to work while he was in\n\nhome confinement, but no evidence was presented that Edwards had\n\na job or had to refuse employment because of the confinement.\n\n          During the first five months of home confinement,\n\nEdwards was given permission to attend twenty-two social\n\nfunctions, and one personal outing.   Further, from November 22,\n\n1990 to April 11, 1991, Edwards was given permanent blackout\n\nperiods every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5:00 p.m. to\n\n10:00 p.m. for choir rehearsal, every Saturday from 11:00 a.m. to\n\n4:00 p.m. for choir meetings, and every Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to\n\n7:00 p.m. for church service and evening service.    Moreover,\n\nduring the last four months of his release, Edwards was permitted\n\napproximately thirty hours per week outside of his home\n\nconfinement for church activities.    Finally, his weekend blackout\n\nperiods were extended on three occasions.\n\f          Edwards may argue and indeed prove that his home\n\nconfinement deterred him and taught him a lesson, contained him\n\nand protected society, and even totally rehabilitated him.       That,\n\nhowever, is beside the point.    By Congress' scheme, it simply\n\ndoes not matter that the condition of Edwards' home confinement\n\nmay have accomplished all this.    The penologically uncertain, but\n\nnonetheless patent objective of offense-based sentencing under\n\nthe Sentencing Reform Act is retributive and punitive.\n\nCongress has determined that the sinner must suffer.     Edwards was\n\nplaced on court-ordered, pretrial detention to ensure his\n\nappearance at trial, and the fairly modest nature of the\n\nrestrictions placed on him reflects that purpose.     His home\n\nconfinement was not sufficiently jail-like to punish and he gets\n\nno credit.\n\n                                II.\n\n          Edwards next argues that the Bureau of Prisons should\n\nhave given him sentence credit because similarly situated\n\nsentenced persons confined under the same conditions receive\n\nsentence credit.    This is not true.   Edwards, convicted of\n\ndistributing cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a),\n\ncould not even be sentenced to home detention.     Section 5C1.1(f)\n\nexplicitly states that if a defendant's \"guideline range is more\n\nthan ten months, the guidelines require that the minimum term be\n\nsatisfied by a sentence of imprisonment.\"     U.S.S.G. § 5C1.1(f)\n\n(1990).\n\n          Edwards' guideline range for violating § 841(a) is well\n\nabove ten months.    He pleaded guilty to distributing fifty grams\n\for more of cocaine base, which carries a base level offense of\n\nsixteen under the Sentencing Guidelines.   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\n\n(1990).   At a minimum, this would result in a twenty-one month\n\nsentence, and here when his criminal history and other charges\n\nwere taken into account, Edwards received a 120-month sentence.\n\nEdwards bears no similarity to others sentenced to home\n\nconfinement, because he simply could not have been given such a\n\nsentence.\n\n                                III.\n\n            In sum, we will affirm the district court's denial of\n\nEdwards' petition for habeas relief.   The district court gave\n\nappropriate deference to the Bureau's conclusion, made the\n\nunassailable factual determination that Edwards' home confinement\n\nwith electronic monitoring was not sufficiently restrictive to\n\nmeet the Koray test, and properly concluded that his home\n\nconfinement was not \"official detention\" under § 3585(b).     We\n\nwill affirm.\n\f</pre>",
