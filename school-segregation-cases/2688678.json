Ct. No. RG13687980)\n        Defendants and Respondents.\n\n\n        Plaintiffs brought a Code of Civil Procedure section 526a (section 526a) taxpayer\naction against defendants based on allegations that defendants commit animal cruelty\nevery summer by transporting pregnant pigs and housing them in farrowing crates at the\nstate fair. One defendant, joined by the other, demurred, contending plaintiffs’ complaint\nfailed to state a cause of action for three distinct reasons, including that California’s\nanimal cruelty laws are not enforceable through a taxpayer action. The trial court agreed\non all accounts, and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. Plaintiffs appeal.\nWe affirm.\n                               SUMMARY OF RELEVANT LAW\n        California’s Animal Cruelty Law\n        Under California’s animal cruelty laws, it is a crime to cause harm to an animal\nthrough an affirmative act or an act of neglect or to confine an animal in an enclosed\nspace without an adequate exercise area. (Pen. Code, §§ 597, 597t.)1 Specifically,\nsection 597 provides, as pertinent here, that “every person who . . . deprives of necessary\n\n        1\n        Undesignated statutory references, other than references to section 526a, are to\nthe Penal Code.\n\n                                               1\n\fsustenance, drink, or shelter . . . and . . . subjects any animal to needless suffering, or\ninflicts unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, or in any manner abuses any animal . . . is,\nfor each offense, guilty of a crime . . . .” (§ 597, subd. (b).) Section 597t provides in\npertinent part: “Every person who keeps an animal confined in an enclosed area shall\nprovide it with an adequate exercise area.”\n       Proposition 2\n       In 2008, California voters passed the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act,\nHealth and Safety Code sections 25990 et seq. Commonly known as Proposition 2, it\nprovides: “In addition to other applicable provisions of law, a person shall not tether or\nconfine any covered animal, on a farm, for all or the majority of any day, in a manner that\nprevents such animal from: [¶] (a) Lying down, standing up, and fully extending his or\nher limbs; and (b) Turning around freely.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25990.) “Covered\nanimal” is defined as “any pig during pregnancy, calf raised for veal, or egg-laying hen\nwho is kept on a farm.” (Id., § 25991, subd. (b).) In effect, Proposition 2 bans three\nforms of confinement used in the farmed animal industry: gestation crates for pregnant\npigs, veal crates for calves, and battery cages for egg-laying hens. Although enacted in\n2008, Proposition 2 became operative January 1, 2015, after the proceedings that are the\nsubject of this appeal.\n       Proposition 2 contains three express exceptions that are relevant to plaintiffs’\nclaims. First, it does not apply “During transportation.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25992,\nsubd. (c).) Second, it does not apply to animals “During . . . state or county fair\nexhibitions . . . .” (Id., subd. (d).) And third, it does not apply “To a pig during the\nseven-day period prior to the pig’s expected date of giving birth.” (Id., subd. (f).)\n       Finally, Proposition 2 contains a savings clause: “The provisions of this chapter\nare in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other laws protecting animal welfare, including\nthe California Penal Code. This chapter shall not be construed to limit any state law or\nregulations protecting the welfare of animals . . . .” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25994; see\nalso § 25990 [prohibition against confining a covered animal is “[i]n addition to other\napplicable provisions of law”].)\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        Code of Civil Procedure Section 526a\n        Section 526a creates a taxpayer private right of action to restrain the illegal or\nwasteful expenditure of public funds. It provides in pertinent part: “An action to obtain a\njudgment, restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to, the\nestate, funds, or other property of a county, town, city or city and county of the state, may\nbe maintained against any officer thereof, or any agent, or other person, acting in its\nbehalf, either by a citizen resident therein, or by a corporation, who is assessed for and is\nliable to pay, or, within one year before the commencement of the action, has paid, a tax\ntherein.” Although the statutory language authorizes a taxpayer action only as to local\ngovernmental units and their officers, courts have extended section 526a’s reach to state\nagencies. (Chiatello v. City and County of San Francisco (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 472,\n482.)\n                                      BACKGROUND\n        Plaintiffs’ Complaint\n        On July 18, 2013, plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting a section 526a action\nagainst defendants, premised on the theory that defendants waste taxpayer money and\nstaff time by obtaining, transporting, and exhibiting pregnant pigs in violation of sections\n597 and 597t. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged as follows:\n        Plaintiff Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) is a nonprofit charitable\norganization whose mission is “to advance the interest of animals through the legal\nsystem.” Plaintiffs Jan Gates and Bonnie Mencher are members of ALDF. All plaintiffs\nreside and pay taxes in California.\n        Defendant California Exposition and State Fairs (Cal Expo) is a state agency\ncreated and regulated by California Food and Agriculture Code sections 3301 et seq. It is\nresponsible for organizing the California State Fair (State Fair), which takes place for\nthree weeks every July.\n        The University of California at Davis School of Veterinary Medicine (School) is a\nsubdivision of defendant The Regents of the University of California (Regents).\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f          Every year, Cal Expo enters into a cooperative arrangement with the School to set\nup and manage the livestock nursery exhibit at the State Fair where pregnant pigs and\nother animals are put on display for three weeks to give birth and nurse. Cal Expo\nprovides the land, tent, support infrastructure, and financial compensation, while the\nSchool provides the animals, equipment, and staff.\n          Shortly before the State Fair begins, the School obtains and transports pregnant\npigs to be displayed in the livestock nursery exhibit. The pigs have approximately two\nweeks remaining in their pregnancy when they are transported. Transporting pigs during\nthe last two weeks of their pregnancy causes suffering due to stress and physical\ndiscomfort, potentially resulting in an aborted pregnancy.\n          Once at the fair, the School places the pregnant pigs in farrowing crates. As\nplaintiffs describe them: “[F]arrowing crates are small metal stalls approximately five\nfeet long and three feet wide. These are also the approximate dimensions of the pigs\nthemselves. On both sides immediately adjacent to the mother’s area are two enclosed\nareas for the piglets to live once they are born. Metal bars separate the mother’s section\nfrom the piglets’ but provide an opening so the piglets can nurse. [¶]. . .The farrowing\ncrates are so small that the mother pigs cannot turn around or walk. The pigs remain\nconfined to the farrowing crates for the three-week duration of the State Fair . . . .” The\nrestriction of movement once at the State Fair deprives the pigs of the opportunity to\nengage in any exercise, which causes suffering due to physical discomfort, boredom, and\nstress.\n          The farrowing crates have metal-grate flooring and lack bedding material, which\ncauses additional suffering. The lack of bedding material causes physical and thermal\ndiscomfort for the pigs and frustrates their maternal instinct to build a nest, causing stress\nand emotional depression that manifests outwardly as restlessness and bar-chewing.\n          The crated pigs are displayed as close as four feet to attendees of the State Fair.\nThe pigs have a strong instinct to isolate themselves days before and while giving birth,\nas well as for several days at the beginning of the nursing period. By farrowing in close\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fproximity to the State Fair crowds with nowhere to retreat, the pigs suffer stress and\ndiscomfort.\n           Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from transporting pregnant pigs to the State\nFair for non-medical purposes during the final 15 days of their pregnancy, confining them\nto farrowing crates and other similar areas with metal floors and insufficient bedding\nmaterial, and keeping them in close proximity to State Fair attendees during the days\nleading up to and following birth. Plaintiffs also sought a declaration that such conduct is\nillegal.\n           The Regents’ Demurrer\n           On September 30, 2013, the Regents demurred to the complaint, with Cal Expo\nsubsequently filing a joinder. The Regents asserted three independent reasons the\ncomplaint failed to state a cause of action. First, the conduct of which plaintiffs\ncomplained was not illegal because Proposition 2 would not proscribe defendants’\nconduct once in effect. Second, there is no private right of action to enforce the animal\ncruelty provisions of the Penal Code, as held in Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Mendes\n(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 136 (Mendes). Third, section 526a taxpayer actions do not lie\nwhere the challenged conduct involves an exercise of discretion by another branch of\ngovernment, such as a prosecutor’s decision to charge a particular act as a crime.\n           Plaintiffs filed opposition, responding to each of the Regents’ arguments. They\ncontended Proposition 2 was irrelevant to their claims, because not only was it not yet\noperative, but it also did not apply to the conduct of which they complained—conduct,\nplaintiffs argued, that constituted animal cruelty under sections 597(b) and 597t, which\nProposition 2’s savings clause expressly preserved. Plaintiffs also argued that Mendes\nwas inapplicable, as it held only that there is no private right of action under section 597t,\nwhereas they were asserting a taxpayer action under section 526a. Lastly, plaintiffs\ndisputed that they sought to interfere with the discretion of the executive branch, because\nstate agencies lack the discretion to commit animal cruelty and because their claims did\nnot interfere with the prosecutor’s discretion to bring future animal cruelty charges.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       After the Regents filed a reply, the trial court issued a tentative ruling rejecting all\nthree grounds asserted by the Regents and overruling the demurrer. The Regents\ncontested the tentative ruling, and the matter came on for hearing on November 18, 2013.\nAfter a lengthy hearing, the court took the matter under submission.\n       On December 9, 2013, the trial court entered an order reversing course from its\ntentative ruling: it agreed with the Regents on all three asserted grounds and sustained\nthe demurrer without leave to amend. The court first concluded that Proposition 2 did not\napply to the dispute, both because it was not yet operative and because it contained\nexemptions for covered animals in transportation and at state fairs and for farrowing pigs.\nNevertheless, the court could not “justify . . . present or future injunctive and/or\ndeclaratory relief with regard to treatment of animals specifically covered by the\noncoming regulatory scheme, particularly as it appears that defendants’ present practices\nwill be lawful in that framework.” Moreover, the court rejected plaintiffs’ position that\nthe conduct could be enjoined as unlawful under the more general prohibitions of\nCalifornia’s animal cruelty laws, reasoning that Proposition 2 “cannot be presumed to be\nother than a consistent and harmonious extension of the already existing and more\ngeneral animal cruelty provisions of [Penal] Code § 597.”\n       The court also agreed that plaintiffs lacked a private right of action to enforce the\nPenal Code provisions, describing as “illogical and without merit” their attempt to do “as\ntaxpayers . . . what they may not do as bystander citizens . . . .” It noted that section 526a\n“cannot . . . be read as a carte blanche for taxpayers who declare themselves to be\nconcerned about a potential violation of the Penal Code to do what concerned citizens\ncannot do under Mendes. . . . Penal Code § 597 contains its own unique enforcement\nmechanism for those asserting that animals are being criminally abused.”\n       Finally, the court found that the complaint was an “improper[] attempt” by\nplaintiffs “to pursue principally ‘political’ issues and issues involving the exercise of the\ndiscretion of either the legislative or executives branches of government.”\n       After the court entered judgment in favor of defendants, plaintiffs filed this timely\nappeal.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n       The Standard of Review\n       The standard of review governing an appeal from a demurrer sustained without\nleave to amend is well established. As we summarized in Chiatello v. City and County of\nSan Francisco, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 480: “ ‘Because this case comes to us on a\ndemurrer for failure to state a cause of action, we accept as true the well-pleaded\nallegations in plaintiffs’ first amended complaint. “ ‘We treat the demurrer as admitting\nall material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact\nor law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.’\n[Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a\nwhole and its parts in their context. [Citation.]” ’ [Citation.] We likewise accept facts\nthat are reasonably implied or may be inferred from the complaint’s express allegations.\n[Citations.] ‘ “ ‘A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint . . . .’ [Citations.]\nOn appeal from a dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer, we review the order de\nnovo, exercising our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of\naction as a matter of law. [Citations.] When the trial court sustains a demurrer without\nleave to amend, we must also consider whether the complaint might state a cause of\naction if a defect could reasonably be cured by amendment. If the defect can be cured,\nthen the judgment of dismissal must be reversed to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to\ndo so. The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating a reasonable possibility to cure\nany defect by amendment. [Citations.]” ’ [Citation.]”\n       Plaintiffs Cannot Assert a Section 526a Taxpayer Claim Predicated on a\n       Violation of Section 597 or 597t\n       On appeal, plaintiffs make the same arguments they made in opposition to the\nRegents’ demurrer. We address only one, plaintiffs’ claim that, contrary to the trial\ncourt’s conclusion, they can in fact assert a section 526a taxpayer action to enjoin waste\narising out of defendants’ alleged violation of the animal cruelty laws. Like the trial\ncourt, we reject plaintiffs’ contention, concluding that they cannot circumvent the\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fprohibition recognized in Mendes by couching their claim as a section 526a taxpayer\naction.\n          In Mendes, ALDF and two consumers brought an action against two individuals\nwho were in the business of raising calves placed with them by dairies. Plaintiffs alleged\nthat at any one time defendants housed approximately 12,000 calves confined to isolation\ncrates for up to 60 days at a time. According to plaintiffs’ allegations, the crates were\nbarely bigger than the calves themselves, preventing them from turning around or lying\ndown in a natural position. (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.)\n          Plaintiffs’ complaint asserted two causes of action. The first, asserted only by\nALDF, alleged that defendants’ confinement of calves violated section 597t—the same\nanimal cruelty provision on which ALDF’s claims here are, in part, premised. (Mendes,\nsupra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.) The second, asserted only by the consumers, alleged a\nviolation of California’s unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code\nsection 17200 et seq. (Id. at p. 141.) Both causes of action sought declaratory and\ninjunctive relief. (Id. at pp. 140–141.) Defendants demurred, the trial court sustained the\ndemurrer without leave to amend, and plaintiffs appealed. (Ibid.)\n          The Court of Appeal first addressed ALDF’s cause of action, considering whether,\nas ALDF contended, section 597t impliedly established a private right of action in entities\nsuch as ALDF “with a long-standing commitment to carrying out the laws protecting\nanimals and a history of ‘direct work in the area of animal cruelty law enforcement and\nprotection.’ ” (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 141.) Acknowledging that “a\ncriminal statute can expressly or impliedly give rise to a private right of action for its\nviolation,” (id. at p. 141) the court explained that whether it did so there was a question of\nlegislative intent. And it held that the Legislature did not intend there to be a private right\nof action for a violation of section 597t, reasoning that, “In light of the overall statutory\nscheme effectively ‘deputizing’ humane societies to aid local authorities in the\nenforcement of anticruelty laws, we think it clear that the Legislature did not intend to\ncreate a private right of action in other private entities, no matter how well intentioned the\ngoals of such entities.” (Id. at p. 142.)\n\n\n                                                8\n\f       The court went on to describe in detail the statutory scheme to which it was\nreferring, detail we quote at length as it is relevant to whether plaintiffs can assert their\ntaxpayer action here. Thus:\n       “Since 1905, California has authorized the formation of corporations for the\nprevention of cruelty to animals. (See Civ. Code, former § 607, repealed by Stats. 1947,\nch. 1038, § 100001, p. 2439; see also Stats. 1947, ch. 1038, § 10404, p. 2423, enacting\nCorp. Code, § 10400.) Such a corporation (hereafter section § [sic] 10400 corporations)\n‘may proffer a complaint against any person, before any court or magistrate having\njurisdiction, for the violation of any law relating to or affecting . . . animals, and may aid\nin the prosecution of any such offender before such court or magistrate.’ (Corp. Code,\n§ 10404.) [¶] . . . [¶]\n       “Only section 10400 corporations may apply for appointment of humane officers,\nwhose duty ‘shall be the enforcement of the laws for the prevention of cruelty to\nanimals.’ (Corp. Code, § 14502, subd. (a)(1)(A)(i).) Humane officers are required to\nhave initial qualifications and subsequent periodic training. (Id., subd. (i).) Powers to\nenforce anticruelty laws are conferred on humane officers by statute. (See id., subd.\n(i)(1)(A)–(C), (2)(A)–(C); see also Pen. Code, §§ 597f, 599aa [seizure of certain animals\nby humane officers].)\n       “Not only do the Corporations Code and the Penal Code provide for extensive\nregulation and empowerment of section 10400 corporations and humane officers, the\nPenal Code expressly provides a remedy for those not so regulated when they believe,\ninter alia, animal cruelty ‘is being, or is about to be’ committed in ‘any particular\nbuilding or place.’ (Pen. Code, § 599a.) ‘When complaint is made, on oath, to any\nmagistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal cases, that the complainant believes’\nanimal cruelty is taking place or will take place at a specific site, ‘the magistrate must\nissue and deliver immediately a warrant directed to any sheriff, police or peace officer or\nofficer of any [section 10400 corporation], authorizing him to enter and search that\nbuilding or place, and to arrest any person there present violating, or attempting to\nviolate’ any anticruelty law. (Ibid.)” (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at pp. 142–143.)\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       In light of this statutory scheme, the Mendes court concluded that recognition of a\nprivate right of action under section 597t would be inconsistent with the Legislature’s\nentrustment of enforcement of anticruelty laws to local authorities and humane societies:\n“[T]here is in place an explicit and comprehensive legislative scheme for enforcement of\nanticruelty laws, including an explicit avenue for enforcement upon the complaint of any\nperson. This broad and somewhat unusual scheme for enforcement in the criminal\nsystem of laws for the protection of animals, including direct participation of both\nconcerned residents and registered humane officers, demonstrates a legislative intent that\nthese laws not be enforceable through a private right of action in civil court.” (Mendes,\nsupra, 160 Cal.App.4th at pp. 143–144.)2\n       As can be seen, Mendes held that the Legislature did not intend to establish an\nimplied private right of action for a section 597t violation. It did not, as ALDF correctly\nnotes, address whether a taxpayer can assert a section 526a claim predicated on a\nviolation of section 597 or 597t. ALDF submits this distinction precludes the application\nof Mendes here. We conclude otherwise, that the rationale of Mendes applies equally to\nplaintiffs’ taxpayer action.\n       As our Supreme Court long ago recognized, “The primary purpose of [section\n526a], originally enacted in 1909, is to ‘enable a large body of the citizenry to challenge\ngovernmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the\nstanding requirement.’ [Citation.]” (Blair v. Pitchess (1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 267–268; see\nalso Chiatello v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 481.)\nHere, as laid out in Mendes, there exists a comprehensive statutory scheme that provides\nmultiple avenues for the enforcement of California’s animal cruelty laws. Humane\nsocieties are vested with “quasi-governmental powers” to aid local authorities in the\nenforcement of anticruelty laws, and any individual can make a complaint under oath to a\n\n\n       2\n        The court went on to address the consumers’ unfair competition law claim,\nconcluding they had not alleged an adequate injury to state a cause of action under\nBusiness and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 145, 147.)\n\n                                             10\n\fmagistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal cases if the complainant believes\nanimal cruelty is taking place or will take place. (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n142–143.) These methods of enforcement are in addition to the authority of law\nenforcement agencies to enforce the penal laws of California.\n       In light of these many means of enforcing the animal cruelty laws, the very\npurpose of a section 526a action is not furthered by plaintiffs’ lawsuit here, since it\ncannot be said that defendants’ conduct—if indeed violative of the animal cruelty laws—\nwould go unchallenged in the absence of a taxpayer action (notwithstanding plaintiffs’\nclaim that they “are the only persons who can challenge this unlawful government\nconduct because Cal Expo and the School’s victims are pigs who do not have standing to\nsue”). It is worth noting, “ ‘California has one of the nation’s toughest anticruelty laws,\nand enforcement of the law appears to be more rigorous than in many other states.’ ”\n(Humane Society of the United States v. State Bd. of Equalization (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th\n349, 359 (Humane Society), quoting Francione, Animals, Property, and the Law (Temple\nUniv. Press 1995) p. 119.)\n       ALDF attempts to distance itself from Mendes, arguing that because section 526a\nempowers taxpayers to sue governmental entities to stop unlawful activity that violates a\nlegal standard found elsewhere, it provides its own independent right of action, even\nwhere, as here, the predicate statute does not. In other words, ALDF seeks to enjoin\ndefendants from illegally using public resources, as opposed to seeking to enforce the\nanimal cruelty laws. But section 526a does not create an absolute right of action in\ntaxpayers to assert any claim for governmental waste. To the contrary, courts have\nrecognized numerous situations in which a section 526a claim will not lie. (See, e.g.,\nDaar v. Alvord (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 480, 487 [“[E]ven assuming the illegality of the\n[tax] collection process, Code of Civil Procedure section 526a was not intended to be\nutilized in challenging that illegality.”]; City of Ceres v. City of Modesto (1969) 274\nCal.App.2d 545, 555 [“courts should not take judicial cognizance of disputes which are\nprimarily political in nature, nor should they attempt to enjoin every expenditure which\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fdoes not meet with a taxpayer’s approval.”].) To this list, we add a claim for alleged\ngovernmental waste based on an alleged violation of section 597 or 597t.\n       Our conclusion finds support in the dearth of authority recognizing a section 526a\ntaxpayer action predicated on an alleged criminal violation. Plaintiffs cite only one case,\nMendoza v. County of Tulare (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 403 (Mendoza), in which, as they\nwould have it, the Penal Code “supplied [the] standard” for a taxpayer action. Mendoza\nis unavailing.\n       Plaintiffs in Mendoza were four inmates and one taxpayer who brought a\nprisoners’ class action challenging the conditions at Tulare County jail. Their complaint\nalleged “various violations of the federal and state Constitutions, the federal Civil Rights\nAct (42 U.S.C. § 1983), and the California Penal and Health and Safety Codes,” and\nsought, among other forms of relief, declaratory and injunctive relief restraining the\nCounty from maintaining the alleged unlawful procedures and jail conditions. (Mendoza,\nsupra, 128 Cal.App.3d at pp. 407–408.) The county and other defendants demurred, the\ntrial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend, and plaintiffs appealed. (Id.\nat p. 407.)\n       Among the numerous issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the taxpayer\nhad standing to assert a section 526a claim. (Mendoza, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d at p. 415.)\nIn its cursory analysis of the issue, the court held that the taxpayer did in fact have\nstanding to bring his taxpayer suit because “the existence of directly affected individuals\nwho might also have standing to sue does not preclude a taxpayer’s suit” and “directly\naggrieved parties and taxpayers have concurrent standing to bring suit to enjoin\ngovernment action.” (Id. at p. 415.) From this, we can surmise that the only basis on\nwhich defendants challenged the taxpayer’s standing was whether the taxpayer could\nmaintain his section 526a action when other plaintiffs who were directly impacted by the\njail conditions were asserting similar claims. The opinion does not suggest that the court\nconsidered whether the taxpayer could maintain a section 526a action based on an alleged\nfailure to comply with a Penal Code provision, as is the case here.\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f        Perhaps more significant is the nature of the Penal Code sections at issue in\nMendoza. Plaintiffs alleged a failure to maintain a licensed physician in the jail in\nviolation of section 4023, lack of segregation of pretrial detainees from sentenced\nprisoners in violation of sections 4001 and 4002, and implied the board of supervisors\nfailed to provide sufficient funds for prisoners as required by section 4015. (Mendoza,\nsupra, 128 Cal.App.3d at pp. 417, 421.) These Penal Code provisions set forth guidelines\ngoverning procedures and conditions applicable to the jail; none proscribed conduct that\nwould subject defendants to criminal prosecution, as is the case with sections 597 and\n597t.\n        Plaintiffs also cite our opinion in Humane Society, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th 349,\n360–364, for the proposition that “courts have presumed that Section 526a may be used\nto enjoin violations of the Animal Cruelty Law.” Nothing in Humane Society suggests,\nhowever, that we made any such a presumption.\n        In Humane Society, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th 349, the Humane Society of the\nUnited States and several individual taxpayers filed a section 526a action against the\nState Board of Equalization and the state controller to partially bar the implementation of\nan amendment to the Revenue and Taxation Code that provided an exemption from\nCalifornia sales and use taxes for the gross receipts for “farm equipment and\nmachinery . . . used primarily in producing and harvesting agricultural products.” (Rev.\n& Tax. Code, § 6356.5, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs sought to enjoin application of that\nexemption to poultry producers who purchased battery cages for egg-laying hens,\nalleging that permitting those producers to qualify for the exemption violated sections\n597, subdivision (b), and 597t because the battery cages caused the hens unnecessary\nsuffering. (Humane Society, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at pp. 352–354.) Defendants\ndemurred, challenging plaintiffs’ standing as taxpayers as well as the sufficiency of the\nallegations to state a cause of action under section 526a. (Id. at p. 354.) The court\nsustained the demurrer without leave to amend, and plaintiffs appealed. (Id. at pp. 354–\n355.)\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       We affirmed, agreeing with defendants that the complaint failed to allege a cause\nof action, for multiple reasons. (Humane Society, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.)\nFirst, we noted that the allegedly improper conduct—subjecting hens to needless\nsuffering—involved conduct not by public officials but rather by certain poultry and egg\nproducers, and a section 526a claim cannot be asserted where the challenged\ngovernmental conduct is legal. (Id. at pp. 361–362.) We rejected the Humane Society’s\nattempt “to transform the [State Board of Equalization] into some sort of a police agency\nwith regard to chicken coops.” (Id. at p. 362.) We also expressed concern that a decision\nin the Humane Society’s favor could open the door to an “inevitable endless stream of\npotential litigation” directed at purchasers of equipment used to house cattle, sheep, pigs,\nor “ ‘fur-bearing animals in captivity.’ ” (Id. at p. 363.) And we cited a “final reason for\naffirmance: [plaintiffs’] pleas for governmental action to relieve the alleged mistreatment\nof chickens should be directed to the Legislature, not the judiciary.” (Ibid.)\n       From this, plaintiffs infer a presumption “that Section 526a may be used to enjoin\nviolations of the Animal Cruelty Law,” a presumption apparently derived from the fact\nthat we did not hold otherwise. But nothing in Humane Society can be construed as\nsupporting this presumption. Nothing suggests that the parties raised this issue—or that it\nwas in any way before us.\n       Nathan H. Schur, Inc. v. City of Santa Monica (1956) 47 Cal.2d 11 (Schur) is\ninstructive, where our Supreme Court rejected an attempt to enjoin a crime via a taxpayer\naction. There, a corporate plaintiff brought a section 526a action against the city of Santa\nMonica and its police chief, alleging that city officials improperly licensed certain games\nthat violated gambling laws, that the issuance of licenses was itself a crime, and seeking\nto enjoin the city from issuing the licenses. (Id. at pp. 12–14, 17.) The trial court issued\nan injunction. The Supreme Court reversed, holding “that unless the conduct complained\nof constitutes a nuisance as declared by the Legislature, equity will not enjoin it even if it\nconstitutes a crime, as the appropriate tribunal for the enforcement of the criminal law is\nthe court in an appropriate criminal proceeding.” (Ibid.) The court explained that the\ninjunction was “basically one to enjoin the alleged commission of a crime” (id. at p. 18),\n\n\n                                              14\n\fand thus “has the collateral effect of depriving a defendant of the jury trial to which he\nwould be entitled in a criminal prosecution for violating exactly the same standards of\npublic policy. . . .” (Id. at p. 19.) The defendant is also deprived of the protection of the\nhigher burden of proof. (Ibid.) “For these reasons,” the court explained, “equity is loath\nto interfere where the standards of public policy can be enforced by resort to the criminal\nlaw, and in the absence of a legislative declaration to that effect, the courts should not\nbroaden the field in which injunctions against criminal activity will be granted.” (Ibid.)\n       In Schur, the Supreme Court also observed that “[t]he local officials are vested\nwith the power” of determining whether licenses should be issued for the games and that\n“[h]ere there was a public hearing on the precise issue, whether the games for which\nlicenses were sought violated the Penal Code, and due notice was given to all concerned\nwhich would include a taxpayer.” And so, a taxpayer action was not an available\nremedy. (Schur, supra, 47 Cal.App.2d at pp. 17–18.)\n       In sum, Schur stands for the proposition that where the Legislature has provided\nan administrative remedy, a taxpayer action cannot be used in lieu of that remedy. Here,\nthe remedy provided by the Legislature is not administrative, but it is a carefully crafted\nlegislative mechanism for enforcing the Penal Code section plaintiffs claim defendants\nviolated. Given this detailed legislative scheme, we believe the Legislature intended the\nenforcement mechanisms it established—and the entities in whom it entrusted such\nenforcement—to be the exclusive mechanisms for, and entities charged with, such\nenforcement. Put otherwise, the more general remedy of a taxpayer action was not\nintended to be used in their stead.\n       Because standing is a procedural requirement plaintiffs cannot satisfy, we need not\naddress their remaining claims.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgments are affirmed.

One defendant, joined by the other, demurred, contending plaintiffs’ complaint\nfailed to state a cause of action for three distinct reasons, including that California’s\nanimal cruelty laws are not enforceable through a taxpayer action. The trial court agreed\non all accounts, and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. Plaintiffs appeal.\nWe affirm.\n                               SUMMARY OF RELEVANT LAW\n        California’s Animal Cruelty Law\n        Under California’s animal cruelty laws, it is a crime to cause harm to an animal\nthrough an affirmative act or an act of neglect or to confine an animal in an enclosed\nspace without an adequate exercise area. (Pen. Code, §§ 597, 597t.)1 Specifically,\nsection 597 provides, as pertinent here, that “every person who . . . deprives of necessary\n\n        1\n        Undesignated statutory references, other than references to section 526a, are to\nthe Penal Code.\n\n                                               1\n\fsustenance, drink, or shelter . . . and . . . subjects any animal to needless suffering, or\ninflicts unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, or in any manner abuses any animal . . . is,\nfor each offense, guilty of a crime . . . .” (§ 597, subd. (b).) Section 597t provides in\npertinent part: “Every person who keeps an animal confined in an enclosed area shall\nprovide it with an adequate exercise area.”\n       Proposition 2\n       In 2008, California voters passed the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act,\nHealth and Safety Code sections 25990 et seq. Commonly known as Proposition 2, it\nprovides: “In addition to other applicable provisions of law, a person shall not tether or\nconfine any covered animal, on a farm, for all or the majority of any day, in a manner that\nprevents such animal from: [¶] (a) Lying down, standing up, and fully extending his or\nher limbs; and (b) Turning around freely.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25990.) “Covered\nanimal” is defined as “any pig during pregnancy, calf raised for veal, or egg-laying hen\nwho is kept on a farm.” (Id., § 25991, subd. (b).) In effect, Proposition 2 bans three\nforms of confinement used in the farmed animal industry: gestation crates for pregnant\npigs, veal crates for calves, and battery cages for egg-laying hens. Although enacted in\n2008, Proposition 2 became operative January 1, 2015, after the proceedings that are the\nsubject of this appeal.\n       Proposition 2 contains three express exceptions that are relevant to plaintiffs’\nclaims. First, it does not apply “During transportation.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25992,\nsubd. (c).) Second, it does not apply to animals “During . . . state or county fair\nexhibitions . . . .” (Id., subd. (d).) And third, it does not apply “To a pig during the\nseven-day period prior to the pig’s expected date of giving birth.” (Id., subd. (f).)\n       Finally, Proposition 2 contains a savings clause: “The provisions of this chapter\nare in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other laws protecting animal welfare, including\nthe California Penal Code. This chapter shall not be construed to limit any state law or\nregulations protecting the welfare of animals . . . .” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25994; see\nalso § 25990 [prohibition against confining a covered animal is “[i]n addition to other\napplicable provisions of law”].)\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        Code of Civil Procedure Section 526a\n        Section 526a creates a taxpayer private right of action to restrain the illegal or\nwasteful expenditure of public funds. It provides in pertinent part: “An action to obtain a\njudgment, restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to, the\nestate, funds, or other property of a county, town, city or city and county of the state, may\nbe maintained against any officer thereof, or any agent, or other person, acting in its\nbehalf, either by a citizen resident therein, or by a corporation, who is assessed for and is\nliable to pay, or, within one year before the commencement of the action, has paid, a tax\ntherein.” Although the statutory language authorizes a taxpayer action only as to local\ngovernmental units and their officers, courts have extended section 526a’s reach to state\nagencies.

Specifically, plaintiffs alleged as follows:\n        Plaintiff Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) is a nonprofit charitable\norganization whose mission is “to advance the interest of animals through the legal\nsystem.” Plaintiffs Jan Gates and Bonnie Mencher are members of ALDF. All plaintiffs\nreside and pay taxes in California.\n        Defendant California Exposition and State Fairs (Cal Expo) is a state agency\ncreated and regulated by California Food and Agriculture Code sections 3301 et seq. It is\nresponsible for organizing the California State Fair (State Fair), which takes place for\nthree weeks every July.\n        The University of California at Davis School of Veterinary Medicine (School) is a\nsubdivision of defendant The Regents of the University of California (Regents).\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f          Every year, Cal Expo enters into a cooperative arrangement with the School to set\nup and manage the livestock nursery exhibit at the State Fair where pregnant pigs and\nother animals are put on display for three weeks to give birth and nurse. Cal Expo\nprovides the land, tent, support infrastructure, and financial compensation, while the\nSchool provides the animals, equipment, and staff.\n          Shortly before the State Fair begins, the School obtains and transports pregnant\npigs to be displayed in the livestock nursery exhibit. The pigs have approximately two\nweeks remaining in their pregnancy when they are transported. Transporting pigs during\nthe last two weeks of their pregnancy causes suffering due to stress and physical\ndiscomfort, potentially resulting in an aborted pregnancy.\n          Once at the fair, the School places the pregnant pigs in farrowing crates. As\nplaintiffs describe them: “[F]arrowing crates are small metal stalls approximately five\nfeet long and three feet wide. These are also the approximate dimensions of the pigs\nthemselves. On both sides immediately adjacent to the mother’s area are two enclosed\nareas for the piglets to live once they are born. Metal bars separate the mother’s section\nfrom the piglets’ but provide an opening so the piglets can nurse. [¶]. . .The farrowing\ncrates are so small that the mother pigs cannot turn around or walk. The pigs remain\nconfined to the farrowing crates for the three-week duration of the State Fair . . . .” The\nrestriction of movement once at the State Fair deprives the pigs of the opportunity to\nengage in any exercise, which causes suffering due to physical discomfort, boredom, and\nstress.\n          The farrowing crates have metal-grate flooring and lack bedding material, which\ncauses additional suffering. The lack of bedding material causes physical and thermal\ndiscomfort for the pigs and frustrates their maternal instinct to build a nest, causing stress\nand emotional depression that manifests outwardly as restlessness and bar-chewing.\n          The crated pigs are displayed as close as four feet to attendees of the State Fair.\nThe pigs have a strong instinct to isolate themselves days before and while giving birth,\nas well as for several days at the beginning of the nursing period. By farrowing in close\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fproximity to the State Fair crowds with nowhere to retreat, the pigs suffer stress and\ndiscomfort.\n           Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from transporting pregnant pigs to the State\nFair for non-medical purposes during the final 15 days of their pregnancy, confining them\nto farrowing crates and other similar areas with metal floors and insufficient bedding\nmaterial, and keeping them in close proximity to State Fair attendees during the days\nleading up to and following birth. Plaintiffs also sought a declaration that such conduct is\nillegal.\n           The Regents’ Demurrer\n           On September 30, 2013, the Regents demurred to the complaint, with Cal Expo\nsubsequently filing a joinder. The Regents asserted three independent reasons the\ncomplaint failed to state a cause of action. First, the conduct of which plaintiffs\ncomplained was not illegal because Proposition 2 would not proscribe defendants’\nconduct once in effect. Second, there is no private right of action to enforce the animal\ncruelty provisions of the Penal Code, as held in Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Mendes\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279605\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279605/animal-legal-defense-fund-v-mendes/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mendes). Third, section 526a taxpayer actions do not lie\nwhere the challenged conduct involves an exercise of discretion by another branch of\ngovernment, such as a prosecutor’s decision to charge a particular act as a crime.\n           Plaintiffs filed opposition, responding to each of the Regents’ arguments. They\ncontended Proposition 2 was irrelevant to their claims, because not only was it not yet\noperative, but it also did not apply to the conduct of which they complained—conduct,\nplaintiffs argued, that constituted animal cruelty under sections 597(b) and 597t, which\nProposition 2’s savings clause expressly preserved. Plaintiffs also argued that Mendes\nwas inapplicable, as it held only that there is no private right of action under section 597t,\nwhereas they were asserting a taxpayer action under section 526a. Lastly, plaintiffs\ndisputed that they sought to interfere with the discretion of the executive branch, because\nstate agencies lack the discretion to commit animal cruelty and because their claims did\nnot interfere with the prosecutor’s discretion to bring future animal cruelty charges.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       After the Regents filed a reply, the trial court issued a tentative ruling rejecting all\nthree grounds asserted by the Regents and overruling the demurrer. The Regents\ncontested the tentative ruling, and the matter came on for hearing on November 18, 2013.\nAfter a lengthy hearing, the court took the matter under submission.\n       On December 9, 2013, the trial court entered an order reversing course from its\ntentative ruling: it agreed with the Regents on all three asserted grounds and sustained\nthe demurrer without leave to amend. The court first concluded that Proposition 2 did not\napply to the dispute, both because it was not yet operative and because it contained\nexemptions for covered animals in transportation and at state fairs and for farrowing pigs.\nNevertheless, the court could not “justify . . . present or future injunctive and/or\ndeclaratory relief with regard to treatment of animals specifically covered by the\noncoming regulatory scheme, particularly as it appears that defendants’ present practices\nwill be lawful in that framework.” Moreover, the court rejected plaintiffs’ position that\nthe conduct could be enjoined as unlawful under the more general prohibitions of\nCalifornia’s animal cruelty laws, reasoning that Proposition 2 “cannot be presumed to be\nother than a consistent and harmonious extension of the already existing and more\ngeneral animal cruelty provisions of [Penal] Code § 597.”\n       The court also agreed that plaintiffs lacked a private right of action to enforce the\nPenal Code provisions, describing as “illogical and without merit” their attempt to do “as\ntaxpayers . . . what they may not do as bystander citizens . . . .” It noted that section 526a\n“cannot . . . be read as a carte blanche for taxpayers who declare themselves to be\nconcerned about a potential violation of the Penal Code to do what concerned citizens\ncannot do under Mendes. . . . Penal Code § 597 contains its own unique enforcement\nmechanism for those asserting that animals are being criminally abused.”\n       Finally, the court found that the complaint was an “improper[] attempt” by\nplaintiffs “to pursue principally ‘political’ issues and issues involving the exercise of the\ndiscretion of either the legislative or executives branches of government.”\n       After the court entered judgment in favor of defendants, plaintiffs filed this timely\nappeal.\n\n\n                                               6\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n       The Standard of Review\n       The standard of review governing an appeal from a demurrer sustained without\nleave to amend is well established. As we summarized in Chiatello v. City and County of\nSan Francisco, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 480: “ ‘Because this case comes to us on a\ndemurrer for failure to state a cause of action, we accept as true the well-pleaded\nallegations in plaintiffs’ first amended complaint. “ ‘We treat the demurrer as admitting\nall material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact\nor law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.’\n[Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a\nwhole and its parts in their context. [Citation.]” ’ [Citation.] We likewise accept facts\nthat are reasonably implied or may be inferred from the complaint’s express allegations.\n[Citations.] ‘ “ ‘A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint . . . .’ [Citations.]\nOn appeal from a dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer, we review the order de\nnovo, exercising our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of\naction as a matter of law. [Citations.] When the trial court sustains a demurrer without\nleave to amend, we must also consider whether the complaint might state a cause of\naction if a defect could reasonably be cured by amendment. If the defect can be cured,\nthen the judgment of dismissal must be reversed to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to\ndo so. The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating a reasonable possibility to cure\nany defect by amendment. [Citations.]” ’ [Citation.]”\n       Plaintiffs Cannot Assert a Section 526a Taxpayer Claim Predicated on a\n       Violation of Section 597 or 597t\n       On appeal, plaintiffs make the same arguments they made in opposition to the\nRegents’ demurrer. We address only one, plaintiffs’ claim that, contrary to the trial\ncourt’s conclusion, they can in fact assert a section 526a taxpayer action to enjoin waste\narising out of defendants’ alleged violation of the animal cruelty laws. Like the trial\ncourt, we reject plaintiffs’ contention, concluding that they cannot circumvent the\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fprohibition recognized in Mendes by couching their claim as a section 526a taxpayer\naction.\n          In Mendes, ALDF and two consumers brought an action against two individuals\nwho were in the business of raising calves placed with them by dairies. Plaintiffs alleged\nthat at any one time defendants housed approximately 12,000 calves confined to isolation\ncrates for up to 60 days at a time. According to plaintiffs’ allegations, the crates were\nbarely bigger than the calves themselves, preventing them from turning around or lying\ndown in a natural position. (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.)\n          Plaintiffs’ complaint asserted two causes of action. The first, asserted only by\nALDF, alleged that defendants’ confinement of calves violated section 597t—the same\nanimal cruelty provision on which ALDF’s claims here are, in part, premised. (Mendes,\nsupra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 140.) The second, asserted only by the consumers, alleged a\nviolation of California’s unfair competition law, Business and Professions Code\nsection 17200 et seq. (Id. at p. 141.) Both causes of action sought declaratory and\ninjunctive relief. (Id. at pp. 140–141.) Defendants demurred, the trial court sustained the\ndemurrer without leave to amend, and plaintiffs appealed. (Ibid.)\n          The Court of Appeal first addressed ALDF’s cause of action, considering whether,\nas ALDF contended, section 597t impliedly established a private right of action in entities\nsuch as ALDF “with a long-standing commitment to carrying out the laws protecting\nanimals and a history of ‘direct work in the area of animal cruelty law enforcement and\nprotection.’ ” (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 141.) Acknowledging that “a\ncriminal statute can expressly or impliedly give rise to a private right of action for its\nviolation,” (id. at p. 141) the court explained that whether it did so there was a question of\nlegislative intent. And it held that the Legislature did not intend there to be a private right\nof action for a violation of section 597t, reasoning that, “In light of the overall statutory\nscheme effectively ‘deputizing’ humane societies to aid local authorities in the\nenforcement of anticruelty laws, we think it clear that the Legislature did not intend to\ncreate a private right of action in other private entities, no matter how well intentioned the\ngoals of such entities.” (Id. at p. 142.)\n\n\n                                                8\n\f       The court went on to describe in detail the statutory scheme to which it was\nreferring, detail we quote at length as it is relevant to whether plaintiffs can assert their\ntaxpayer action here. Thus:\n       “Since 1905, California has authorized the formation of corporations for the\nprevention of cruelty to animals. (See Civ. Code, former § 607, repealed by Stats. 1947,\nch. 1038, § 100001, p. 2439; see also Stats. 1947, ch. 1038, § 10404, p. 2423, enacting\nCorp. Code, § 10400.) Such a corporation (hereafter section § [sic] 10400 corporations)\n‘may proffer a complaint against any person, before any court or magistrate having\njurisdiction, for the violation of any law relating to or affecting . . . animals, and may aid\nin the prosecution of any such offender before such court or magistrate.’ (Corp. Code,\n§ 10404.) [¶] . . . [¶]\n       “Only section 10400 corporations may apply for appointment of humane officers,\nwhose duty ‘shall be the enforcement of the laws for the prevention of cruelty to\nanimals.’ (Corp. Code, § 14502, subd. (a)(1)(A)(i).) Humane officers are required to\nhave initial qualifications and subsequent periodic training. (Id., subd. (i).) Powers to\nenforce anticruelty laws are conferred on humane officers by statute. (See id., subd.\n(i)(1)(A)–(C), (2)(A)–(C); see also Pen. Code, §§ 597f, 599aa [seizure of certain animals\nby humane officers].)\n       “Not only do the Corporations Code and the Penal Code provide for extensive\nregulation and empowerment of section 10400 corporations and humane officers, the\nPenal Code expressly provides a remedy for those not so regulated when they believe,\ninter alia, animal cruelty ‘is being, or is about to be’ committed in ‘any particular\nbuilding or place.’ (Pen. Code, § 599a.) ‘When complaint is made, on oath, to any\nmagistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal cases, that the complainant believes’\nanimal cruelty is taking place or will take place at a specific site, ‘the magistrate must\nissue and deliver immediately a warrant directed to any sheriff, police or peace officer or\nofficer of any [section 10400 corporation], authorizing him to enter and search that\nbuilding or place, and to arrest any person there present violating, or attempting to\nviolate’ any anticruelty law. (Ibid.)” (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at pp. 142–143.)\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       In light of this statutory scheme, the Mendes court concluded that recognition of a\nprivate right of action under section 597t would be inconsistent with the Legislature’s\nentrustment of enforcement of anticruelty laws to local authorities and humane societies:\n“[T]here is in place an explicit and comprehensive legislative scheme for enforcement of\nanticruelty laws, including an explicit avenue for enforcement upon the complaint of any\nperson. This broad and somewhat unusual scheme for enforcement in the criminal\nsystem of laws for the protection of animals, including direct participation of both\nconcerned residents and registered humane officers, demonstrates a legislative intent that\nthese laws not be enforceable through a private right of action in civil court.” (Mendes,\nsupra, 160 Cal.App.4th at pp. 143–144.)2\n       As can be seen, Mendes held that the Legislature did not intend to establish an\nimplied private right of action for a section 597t violation. It did not, as ALDF correctly\nnotes, address whether a taxpayer can assert a section 526a claim predicated on a\nviolation of section 597 or 597t. ALDF submits this distinction precludes the application\nof Mendes here. We conclude otherwise, that the rationale of Mendes applies equally to\nplaintiffs’ taxpayer action.\n       As our Supreme Court long ago recognized, “The primary purpose of [section\n526a], originally enacted in 1909, is to ‘enable a large body of the citizenry to challenge\ngovernmental action which would otherwise go unchallenged in the courts because of the\nstanding requirement.’ [Citation.]” (Blair v. Pitchess (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1383169\"><a href=\"/opinion/1383169/blair-v-pitchess/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267–268; see\nalso Chiatello v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, 189 Cal.App.4th at p. 481.)\nHere, as laid out in Mendes, there exists a comprehensive statutory scheme that provides\nmultiple avenues for the enforcement of California’s animal cruelty laws. Humane\nsocieties are vested with “quasi-governmental powers” to aid local authorities in the\nenforcement of anticruelty laws, and any individual can make a complaint under oath to a\n\n\n       2\n        The court went on to address the consumers’ unfair competition law claim,\nconcluding they had not alleged an adequate injury to state a cause of action under\nBusiness and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 145, 147.)\n\n                                             10\n\fmagistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal cases if the complainant believes\nanimal cruelty is taking place or will take place. (Mendes, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at pp.\n142–143.) These methods of enforcement are in addition to the authority of law\nenforcement agencies to enforce the penal laws of California.\n       In light of these many means of enforcing the animal cruelty laws, the very\npurpose of a section 526a action is not furthered by plaintiffs’ lawsuit here, since it\ncannot be said that defendants’ conduct—if indeed violative of the animal cruelty laws—\nwould go unchallenged in the absence of a taxpayer action (notwithstanding plaintiffs’\nclaim that they “are the only persons who can challenge this unlawful government\nconduct because Cal Expo and the School’s victims are pigs who do not have standing to\nsue”). It is worth noting, “ ‘California has one of the nation’s toughest anticruelty laws,\nand enforcement of the law appears to be more rigorous than in many other states.’ ”\n(Humane Society of the United States v. State Bd. of Equalization (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256335\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256335/humane-soc-v-state-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In other words, ALDF seeks to enjoin\ndefendants from illegally using public resources, as opposed to seeking to enforce the\nanimal cruelty laws. But section 526a does not create an absolute right of action in\ntaxpayers to assert any claim for governmental waste. To the contrary, courts have\nrecognized numerous situations in which a section 526a claim will not lie. (See, e.g.,\nDaar v.

To this list, we add a claim for alleged\ngovernmental waste based on an alleged violation of section 597 or 597t.\n       Our conclusion finds support in the dearth of authority recognizing a section 526a\ntaxpayer action predicated on an alleged criminal violation.

Mendoza\nis unavailing.\n       Plaintiffs in Mendoza were four inmates and one taxpayer who brought a\nprisoners’ class action challenging the conditions at Tulare County jail. Their complaint\nalleged “various violations of the federal and state Constitutions, the federal Civil Rights\nAct (42 U.S.C. § 1983), and the California Penal and Health and Safety Codes,” and\nsought, among other forms of relief, declaratory and injunctive relief restraining the\nCounty from maintaining the alleged unlawful procedures and jail conditions. (Mendoza,\nsupra, 128 Cal.App.3d at pp. 407–408.) The county and other defendants demurred, the\ntrial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend, and plaintiffs appealed. (Id.\nat p. 407.)\n       Among the numerous issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the taxpayer\nhad standing to assert a section 526a claim. (Mendoza, supra, 128 Cal.App.3d at p. 415.)\nIn its cursory analysis of the issue, the court held that the taxpayer did in fact have\nstanding to bring his taxpayer suit because “the existence of directly affected individuals\nwho might also have standing to sue does not preclude a taxpayer’s suit” and “directly\naggrieved parties and taxpayers have concurrent standing to bring suit to enjoin\ngovernment action.” (Id. at p. 415.) From this, we can surmise that the only basis on\nwhich defendants challenged the taxpayer’s standing was whether the taxpayer could\nmaintain his section 526a action when other plaintiffs who were directly impacted by the\njail conditions were asserting similar claims. The opinion does not suggest that the court\nconsidered whether the taxpayer could maintain a section 526a action based on an alleged\nfailure to comply with a Penal Code provision, as is the case here.\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f        Perhaps more significant is the nature of the Penal Code sections at issue in\nMendoza. Plaintiffs alleged a failure to maintain a licensed physician in the jail in\nviolation of section 4023, lack of segregation of pretrial detainees from sentenced\nprisoners in violation of sections 4001 and 4002, and implied the board of supervisors\nfailed to provide sufficient funds for prisoners as required by section 4015. (Mendoza,\nsupra, 128 Cal.App.3d at pp. 417, 421.) These Penal Code provisions set forth guidelines\ngoverning procedures and conditions applicable to the jail; none proscribed conduct that\nwould subject defendants to criminal prosecution, as is the case with sections 597 and\n597t.\n        Plaintiffs also cite our opinion in Humane Society, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256335\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256335/humane-soc-v-state-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Code, § 6356.5, subd. (a).) Plaintiffs sought to enjoin application of that\nexemption to poultry producers who purchased battery cages for egg-laying hens,\nalleging that permitting those producers to qualify for the exemption violated sections\n597, subdivision (b), and 597t because the battery cages caused the hens unnecessary\nsuffering. (Humane Society, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at pp. 352–354.) Defendants\ndemurred, challenging plaintiffs’ standing as taxpayers as well as the sufficiency of the\nallegations to state a cause of action under section 526a. (Id. at p. 354.) The court\nsustained the demurrer without leave to amend, and plaintiffs appealed. (Id. at pp. 354–\n355.)\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       We affirmed, agreeing with defendants that the complaint failed to allege a cause\nof action, for multiple reasons. (Humane Society, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.)\nFirst, we noted that the allegedly improper conduct—subjecting hens to needless\nsuffering—involved conduct not by public officials but rather by certain poultry and egg\nproducers, and a section 526a claim cannot be asserted where the challenged\ngovernmental conduct is legal. (Id. at pp. 361–362.) We rejected the Humane Society’s\nattempt “to transform the [State Board of Equalization] into some sort of a police agency\nwith regard to chicken coops.” (Id. at p. 362.) We also expressed concern that a decision\nin the Humane Society’s favor could open the door to an “inevitable endless stream of\npotential litigation” directed at purchasers of equipment used to house cattle, sheep, pigs,\nor “ ‘fur-bearing animals in captivity.’ ” (Id. at p. 363.) And we cited a “final reason for\naffirmance: [plaintiffs’] pleas for governmental action to relieve the alleged mistreatment\nof chickens should be directed to the Legislature, not the judiciary.” (Ibid.)\n       From this, plaintiffs infer a presumption “that Section 526a may be used to enjoin\nviolations of the Animal Cruelty Law,” a presumption apparently derived from the fact\nthat we did not hold otherwise. But nothing in Humane Society can be construed as\nsupporting this presumption. Nothing suggests that the parties raised this issue—or that it\nwas in any way before us.\n       Nathan H.

There, a corporate plaintiff brought a section 526a action against the city of Santa\nMonica and its police chief, alleging that city officials improperly licensed certain games\nthat violated gambling laws, that the issuance of licenses was itself a crime, and seeking\nto enjoin the city from issuing the licenses. (Id. at pp. 12–14, 17.) The trial court issued\nan injunction. The Supreme Court reversed, holding “that unless the conduct complained\nof constitutes a nuisance as declared by the Legislature, equity will not enjoin it even if it\nconstitutes a crime, as the appropriate tribunal for the enforcement of the criminal law is\nthe court in an appropriate criminal proceeding.” (Ibid.) The court explained that the\ninjunction was “basically one to enjoin the alleged commission of a crime” (id. at p. 18),\n\n\n                                              14\n\fand thus “has the collateral effect of depriving a defendant of the jury trial to which he\nwould be entitled in a criminal prosecution for violating exactly the same standards of\npublic policy. . . .” (Id. at p. 19.) The defendant is also deprived of the protection of the\nhigher burden of proof. (Ibid.) “For these reasons,” the court explained, “equity is loath\nto interfere where the standards of public policy can be enforced by resort to the criminal\nlaw, and in the absence of a legislative declaration to that effect, the courts should not\nbroaden the field in which injunctions against criminal activity will be granted.” (Ibid.)\n       In Schur, the Supreme Court also observed that “[t]he local officials are vested\nwith the power” of determining whether licenses should be issued for the games and that\n“[h]ere there was a public hearing on the precise issue, whether the games for which\nlicenses were sought violated the Penal Code, and due notice was given to all concerned\nwhich would include a taxpayer.” And so, a taxpayer action was not an available\nremedy. (Schur, supra, 47 Cal.App.2d at pp. 17–18.)\n       In sum, Schur stands for the proposition that where the Legislature has provided\nan administrative remedy, a taxpayer action cannot be used in lieu of that remedy. Here,\nthe remedy provided by the Legislature is not administrative, but it is a carefully crafted\nlegislative mechanism for enforcing the Penal Code section plaintiffs claim defendants\nviolated. Given this detailed legislative scheme, we believe the Legislature intended the\nenforcement mechanisms it established—and the entities in whom it entrusted such\nenforcement—to be the exclusive mechanisms for, and entities charged with, such\nenforcement. Put otherwise, the more general remedy of a taxpayer action was not\nintended to be used in their stead.\n       Because standing is a procedural requirement plaintiffs cannot satisfy, we need not\naddress their remaining claims.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgments are affirmed.
