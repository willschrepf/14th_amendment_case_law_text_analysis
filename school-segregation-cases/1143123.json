Topeka Board of Education.  The court then permitted evidence in support of this approach by the intervenors, and denied the appellants' motion for preliminary injunction solely on the basis of such evidence, which, briefly stated, tended to support the thesis that compliance with the Supreme Court's decision would be detrimental to both the Negro plaintiffs and to white students in the Savannah-Chatham County school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court for the Southern District of Georgia is bound by the decision of the United States Supreme Court, as are we.
