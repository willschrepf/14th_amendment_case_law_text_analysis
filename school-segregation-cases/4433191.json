This interlocutory appeal is brought pursuant to\n\nSection § 51.014(a)(4) of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\n        The instant case primarily involves a dispute over rights to an assignment of\n\na 40% working interest in an oil & gas prospect located in the state of Alabama\n\n(the “Alabama Prospect”). Plaintiffs sought and obtained a temporary injunction\n\nenjoining Defendants from engaging in various activities, including transferring\n\nany working interest to bona fide purchasers, as well as the merger of entities\n\notherwise required for contractual compliance and continued development of the\n\nAlabama Prospect.\n\n        Appellants are appealing subsections (a)-(f) of Paragraph 35 of the\n\nTemporary Injunction Order.\n\n        Course of Proceedings: The trial court conducted a temporary injunction\n\nhearing intermittently over the course of November 19-21, 2014.               At the\n\nconclusion of the temporary injunction hearing, the Hon. David Stith 319th\n\n\n\n\n1\n Record cites used in this brief are as follows: App.–Appendix; CR–Clerk’s Record; RR–\nReporter’s Report; PX–Plaintiffs’ hearing exhibits; DX–Defendants’ hearing exhibit.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                              ix\n\fJudicial District Court of Nueces County, entered a temporary injunction against\n\nAppellants on November 21, 2014. 2\n\n        Defendants thereafter requested and obtained a setting for a hearing to\n\nmodify and/or dissolve the temporary injunction. However, on the day of the\n\nsetting, the trial court informed the parties it would be unable to hear Defendants’\n\nmotion and request.3 In order to preserve Defendants’ rights, Defendants filed a\n\nnotice of appeal that same day as required under the Texas Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure.\n\n        Defendants thereafter were able to reset their prior request to modify and/or\n\ndissolve the temporary injunction for December 29, 2014.                     At the hearing,\n\nhowever, Plaintiffs objected to any request for the Court to modify the temporary\n\ninjunction, on the basis that the appellate court was the proper court to modify the\n\ntemporary injunction. The trial court agreed and otherwise denied Defendants’\n\nadditional request to dissolve the temporary injunction.4\n\n\n\n\n2\n  CR 569; App. A. The temporary injunction order was signed by Judge Missy Medary per\nJudge Stith’s request as Judge Stith was required to leave at the conclusion of the hearing in\norder to attend a previously scheduled event.\n3\n  The trial court referred the parties to a visiting judge. However, given the complexity of the\ncase, and the fact that the visiting judge would be unfamiliar with the case and issues,\nDefendants elected to reset the hearing before Judge Stith.\n4\n  Appellants are appealing the trial court’s original grant of the temporary injunction order and\nalso request that the appellate court review the trial court’s subsequent refusal to dissolve the\ntemporary injunction.

Oral argument is warranted and will\n\nassist the Court in resolving important questions to be decided.\n\n                                ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n        (1)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary\n               injunction because the temporary injunction order did not\n               comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 683, in that the order lacked\n               requisite specificity, was overly broad, restrained parties not\n               before the court, and sought relief that was not specifically\n               plead for;\n\n        (2)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary\n               injunction because the temporary injunction order does not\n               comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 681;\n\n        (3)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary\n               injunction relating to the Alabama Prospect that fails to\n               preserve the status quo;\n\n        (4)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering the temporary\n               injunction relating to the Alabama Prospect because Appellees\n               failed to prove probable, imminent, and irreparable injury;\n\n        (5)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering the temporary\n               injunction relating to the Alabama Prospect because a required\n               balancing of the equities weighs against an injunction due to the\n               catastrophic and irreparable injury that all parties will suffer as\n               a result of the temporary injunction; and\n\n        (6)    The trial court abused its discretion in granting a low bond in\n               the amount of $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                xi\n\f                            I.     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n        A.     Plaintiffs C-5 and Everest.\n        Plaintiff C-5 Oil & Gas, Ltd. (“C-5”) is an investment company that invests\n\nin oil and gas properties.5 C-5 is the primary funder of Plaintiff Everest Resource\n\nCompany (“Everest”). 6 Everest, in turn, is a small, independent oil and gas\n\nexploration and production company based in Corpus Christi, Texas. 7 Jimmy\n\nClark (“Clark”) is the President and CEO of Everest Resource Company. 8\n\nThrough Clark-Durham Operations LLC, Clark is also involved as a general\n\npartner of C-5. 9 Clark and Tom Crain (“Crain”), who operates as Everest’s Chief\n\nOperating Officer, make all the decisions and effectively run C-5 and Everest.10\n\n        B.     Everest’s Business is Limited to Oil and Gas Prospects Located\n               Along the Gulf Coast of Texas.\n        Everest publicly advertises itself as a company that generates, buys, drills,\n\nand operates oil and gas prospects primarily along the Gulf Coast of Texas. 11\n\n\n\n\n5\n   See RR Vol. 7, PX—23 (C-5 Oil & Gas Partnership Agreement).\n6\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 48.\n7\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 82-83; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff Everest’s Website).\n8\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 50-51.\n9\n   See id.\n10\n    See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 43.\n11\n    See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 82-83; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff Everest’s Website).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                    1\n\fEverest’s current prospects are all located in Texas. 12 Everest has not done any oil\n\nand gas operations outside the state of Texas for at least the last twenty years. 13\n\n        Everest as a business is incredibly risk averse, and centers on using other\n\npeople’s money for oil and gas prospects. 14 Everest’s philosophical business\n\nmodel involves exploiting investors for up-front money. 15 Indeed, Everest publicly\n\nadvertises that the typical Everest deal is “Reimburse Everest for G&G costs,\n\nturnkey well costs, Everest carry to Casing Point.” 16\n\n        C.     Defendants.\n        Defendants Keith Baker (“Baker”) and Flatmax Energy, L.P. (“Flatmax”) are\n\nlimited partners in C-5.         Flatmax Energy, L.P. is a company controlled by\n\nDefendant David Desenberg (“Desenberg”). 17 Other Defendants to this appeal\n\ninclude Defendant Flatmax L.L.C., which is a company operated by Desenberg;\n\nReagan Rich who is Desenberg’s stepson-in-law; and Defendant Big Reef Energy,\n\nL.L.C. (“Big Reef”) which is a company managed by Defendants. 18\n\n\n12\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pg. 83.\n13\n   See id.\n14\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 55-57; Vol. 4 at pgs. 83-84; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff\nEverest’s Website).\n15\n   Id.\n16\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 83-84; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff Everest’s Website).\n17\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pgs. 22, 25.\n18\n   Defendant Big Reef Energy entered into various participation agreements with third-party\ninvestors regarding the Alabama Prospect. See RR Vol. 7, DX 6-8 (Participation Agreements\nbetween Big Reef Energy, LLC and third-party investors who are not before the Court). Big\nReef Energy owns 100% stock of Petrodome Alabama II, LLC, the entity which holds rights to\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                   2\n\f        D.     Defendants Desenberg and Baker Join Everest and C-5; Plaintiffs\n               Were to Have Only Limited Use of Desenberg’s Data;\n               Desenberg’s Data Has Nothing to Do with the Alabama Prospect.\n        Defendants Baker and Desenberg have each been in the oil and gas business\n\nfor many years. 19 In 2012, Desenberg and Baker each explored potential business\n\ndealings with Everest and C-5. Desenberg joined C-5 and Everest because of the\n\nseismic data he had and because he was hoping to find a company that would\n\nparticipate with him in developing prospects from that data. 20           Desenberg’s\n\ndatabase of seismic data dealt with a few counties in South Texas. 21 Desenberg’s\n\ndatabase did not have anything to do with the Alabama Prospect. 22 On paper, it\n\nseemed like a good fit. Prior to Desenberg and Baker joining C-5 and Everest,\n\nEverest had had limited success in the drilling business. In fact, Crain stated many\n\ntimes that Everest had drilled 40 dry holes in a row. 23\n\n        While Desenberg was working with Everest and partnering with C-5, some\n\nof his seismic data was made available for exploration benefit. 24 However,\n\n\n\n\nthe assignment of the 40% working interest.

Desenberg’s and Baker’s Agreements with C-5 and Everest.\n        In September 2012, Desenberg started employment with Everest without any\n\nsort of agreement. 31 Therefore, on October 25, 2012, Desenberg and Baker signed\n\n\n25\n   See id.\n26\n   See id.\n27\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-2 (Email to Clark & Crain); RR Vol. 3 at pg. 38.\n28\n   See RR Vol. 6, PX-9 (Email to Mr. Perry of Geotrace, with Copies to Clark, Crain & Baker);\nRR Vol. 2 at pgs. 56-57.\n29\n   Id.\n30\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 38-40. In addition to allowing Everest to use his data, Mr. Desenberg\nalso put down $250,000 towards C-5. See id.. To date, Mr. Desenberg has received zero money\nback for use of his data and being a partner in C-5. See id. at pg. 41.\n31\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pg. 22.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                  4\n\fa C-5 Partnership Agreement and as well employment agreements. 32 The C-5\n\nPartnership Agreement and the Employment Agreements were drafted by an\n\nattorney for Everest.33 The understanding of the parties was that the Defendants\n\nwould be free to pursue other oil and gas interests.34 This intention of the parties\n\nwas memorialized in the C-5 Partnership Agreement (to which Flatmax and\n\nDefendant Baker were signatories). Specifically, Section 5.5 of that agreement\n\nstates, in relevant part, that “all partners may pursue other business and interests\n\nwithout regard to the partnership.”35\n\n        As a result of Desenberg bringing data to the venture, Desenberg’s\n\nemployment agreement with Everest contained a unique provision which was\n\nmeant to allow Everest to potentially pursue prospects using Desenberg’s data\n\nwithin three counties in South Texas. 36 This intention was memorialized in Section\n\n7 of Mr. Desenberg’s Agreement which provides in relevant part:\n\n\n\n32\n   See RR Vol. 6, PX-1 (Desenberg Employment Agreement); RR Vol. 6, PX-2 (Baker\nEmployment Agreement); RR Vol. 6, PX-23 (C-5 Partnership Agreement).\n33\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 60.\n34\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 41-42, 49.\n35\n   See RR Vol. 7, PX-23 (C-5 Partnership Agreement at § 5.5). See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 41-42, 49.\nPursuant to that express grant, Defendant Flatmax entered into a Letter of Intent Agreement to\npurchase the Petrodome Key Largo Prospect. See RR Vol. 6, PX-14 (Draft LOI addressed to\nFlatmax).\n36\n   See RR Vol 2 at pg. 50. There is no similar Section 7 provision in Baker’s employment\nagreement with Everest, nor is there any restriction on Baker’s work after leaving Everest. See\nRR Vol. 4 at pg. 43. Other Everest employees, including Clark, did not have the same agreement\nas Desenberg. See id. at pg. 81.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                  5\n\f        Set forth in the Attached Exhibit A is a schedule of seismic and associated\n        data rights currently owned or controlled by Flatmax and its affiliates (the\n        “Retained Seismic”). Attached as Exhibit B is a map showing the area\n        covered by the Retained Seismic (the “Covered Area”). Unless otherwise\n        subsequently agreed, and notwithstanding Employee’s confidentiality\n        obligations set forth above, Flatmax and its affiliates will retain all\n        ownership of the Retained Seismic and all opportunity rights to pursue\n        prospects within the Covered Area before and after termination of the Terms\n        of the Employment, subject to the following:\n\n        (2) Otherwise, during the Term of Employment, Desenberg, Flatmax and\n        their affiliates agree to pursue prospects within the Covered Area jointly\n        with the Company on a mutually agreed basis, and to pursue prospects\n        outside the Covered Area exclusively for the account of the Company and/or\n        C-5. (emphasis added)\n\n        Subsection 2 did not create a worldwide prohibition to compete as Plaintiffs\n\nclaim, but rather only restricted the ability of Defendant Flatmax and its affiliates\n\nto pursue opportunity rights within the Covered Areas (which consists of\n\nDesenberg’s data within three counties of Texas) and outside of the Covered Areas\n\n(which consists of the remaining area of the three counties in Texas). 37 This was\n\ndiscussed as part of the negotiations several times and was the understanding of the\n\nparties. 38    In other words, inside the three counties within the Covered Area,\n\nDesenberg earned a mutually agreed special interest amount, whereas outside the\n\nCovered Area, Desenberg did not earn any additional mutually agreed to interest.39\n\n\n37\n   See RR Vol 2 at pg. 50.\n38\n   See id.\n39\n   See See RR Vol. 6, PX-1 (Desenberg Employment Agreement) at pg. 6. Mutually agreed basis\nwas not defined in the Agreement but was agreed by all parties on many occasions to be\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                6\n\fAny ambiguity in the agreement was due the fact that Plaintiffs failed to attach the\n\nreferenced exhibits to the Agreement. 40\n\n         The Key Largo Prospect which is located in Alabama, however, has nothing\n\nto do with Mr. Desenberg’s data (which is limited to three counties in South Texas)\n\nand therefore was beyond the purview of the restriction set forth in Subsection\n\n(2).41\n\n         F.    Plaintiffs Treat Defendants Desenberg, Baker, and Investors\n               Poorly; Desenberg and Baker Each Independently Decide to\n               Leave Everest Before Hearing About the Alabama Prospect.\n         Desenberg and Baker each made an independent decision to leave Everest,\n\nand did not solicit each other to leave. 42 Moreover, both made the decision to\n\nleave months before they ever heard about the Alabama Prospect. 43\n\n         In June 2014, Baker had made the decision to leave Everest because Everest\n\nlacked the ability to evolve and meet the current challenges in the oil and gas\n\nindustry. 44\n\n\n\n\ncompensation to Desenberg of either a 1 % overriding royalty interest or a 2 % carried working\ninterest to sales on any prospect drilled on the Flatmax 3-D Data Sets. See CR at pg. 1139.\n40\n   No exhibits were attached to the original Desenberg Employment Agreement. See RR Vol. 2\nat pg. 34. Rather, Desenberg’s employment agreement with Everest lacks a list of the Flatmax 3-\nD Shoots and it lacked the map identifying the covered and non-covered areas.

Despite initially raising millions of dollars including Desenberg’s\n\n$250,000, C-5 partners inexplicably had requests for cash calls beginning in or\n\naround October 2013, only one year after the initial funding of C-5.48\n\n        G.     Defendants Desenberg and Baker Do Not Hear About the\n               Potential Alabama Prospect Until the Last Few Weeks of Their\n               Employment With Everest; and Do Not Use Any Everest\n               Resources in Exploring the Possibility of The Alabama Prospect.\n        Desenberg first learned about the potential for the Alabama Prospect on or\n\nabout August 6, 2014, less than a month before his resignation. 49 Desenberg was\n\ncontacted by a friend who invited him to look at some information concerning a\n\nprospect in Alabama. 50 It was not clear that Defendants could even purchase the\n\n\n45\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 48-49.

Defendant Rich was the primary individual\n\nnegotiating the deal, with Defendant Desenberg only participating peripherally. 52\n\nOn August 29, 2014, the last business day before Defendants Desenberg and\n\nBaker’s resignations, a letter of intent was signed between Flatmax and\n\nPetrodome. 53 At no time prior to August 29, 2014, did any Defendant have any\n\ncontractual right of any kind to the Alabama Prospect. 54\n\n        The Alabama Prospect was a highly risky investment, and required a tight\n\nclosing with a lot of money needing to be raised quickly. 55 A $500,000 non-\n\nrefundable deposit was requested and paid by Desenberg and Rich’s company on\n\nthe last Friday of August 2014. 56 Defendants barely had enough money to fund\n\ndeal.

In fact, Everest didn’t have the resources to acquire any prospect, let\n\nalone the $7.5 million dollar 40% working interest in the Alabama Prospect. Prior\n\nto the Alabama Prospect, Defendants Desenberg and Baker had presented two\n\npotential prospects to Everest, both of which Everest declined to fund. 75 Indeed,\n\nEverest didn’t even have money to keep operations going. By October 2013,\n\nEverest’s Crain began stressing the need for cash calls in order to sustain continued\n\noperations.76 By August 2014, the very month that the Petrodome letter of intent\n\nwas signed, Everest’s funding had all but dried up. Specifically, on August 27,\n\n2014—two days before the Alabama letter of intent was signed—Everest held a\n\npartner’s meeting in which Crain and Ron Polansky, C-5 Chief Financial Offer,\n\n\n\n73\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 53.\n74\n   See id.\n75\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 57-58.\n76\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 48.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                             12\n\fbegged Clark to use his sources and raise exploration capital for C-5. 77 Clark\n\nabsolutely refused to raise any exploration capital for C-5, at which point Everest\n\nwere effectively defunct.78\n\n        Nor was there any reason to believe that Everest could sell the Alabama\n\nProspect to Defendants’ investors. All of the investors in the Key Largo Prospect\n\nhad a relationship with at least one of the Defendants prior to Defendants working\n\nfor Everest, and simply were not interested in investing with Everest. 79 Nor was\n\nDesenberg who took out a personal loan interest in order to complete the\n\nPetrodome acquisition interested in further investments with Everest. 80\n\n        Apart from not having the financial wherewithal to complete the $7.5\n\nmillion acquisition, Everest also did not have an interest in investing in or\n\notherwise acquiring a 40% working interest in the Alabama Prospect. First, the\n\nAlabama Prospect was a non-operator deal, whereas Everest was typically the\n\noperator in a deal. 81 Being the operator is critical to using other people’s money\n\nwhich was Everest business philosophy. 82 Second, the Alabama Prospect required\n\n\n77\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 58.\n78\n   See id.

It was not until a month and a half later after\n\nfirst being informed of the offering, that Plaintiffs, without any warning or prior\n\nnotice, filed suit.87\n\n\n\n\n83\n   See id.\n84\n   See id.\n85\n   See id.\n86\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pg. 89.\n87\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pg. 92.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                            14\n\f        I.

The customer list that\n\nDesenberg downloaded on September 4, 2014 was simply Desenberg’s personal\n\ncontact list from his Outlook. 88 Desenberg had been compiling this list of contacts\n\nfor many years, well before he started working at Everest. 89 These contacts\n\nincluded, for example, Desenberg’s upholster, his mechanic, his acupuncturist,\n\nfamily, and good friends. 90 Indeed, Clark—Everest’s CEO—admitted under cross\n\nexamination that the list really wasn’t confidential. 91               Defendant Baker did\n\ndownload a Google Earth file, but only after obtaining permission to do so. 92\n\nDefendant Baker had been accumulating well coordinates and locations files from\n\nall the places he had worked over the years, including for example, Tunisia,\n\nLouisiana, and Texas, and had been storing such information on his Google Earth\n\nfile. 93 So as not to lose his information, Defendant Baker exported a copy of this\n\n\n\n88\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pg. 61.\n89\n   See id.\n90\n   See id.\n91\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 78-79.\n92\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 39-41.

Defendants Have Received a Drilling Proposal And Are Required\n               to Act in Order to Develop And Preserve the Alabama Prospect.\n        On Friday, November 14, 2014, just a few days before the temporary\n\ninjunction hearings, Defendants received a well proposal from Renpetco—the\n\noperator of the Alabama Prospect. 96 Renpetco requested that the election be\n\nreturned within 10 days along with a check for 51.6% of the costs of the first well,\n\nwhich represents the 40% working interest belonging to Defendants and their\n\ninvestors, as well as a carry for other working interests.97\n\n        Renpetco’s well proposal triggered deadlines requiring Defendants to act\n\nexpeditiously. According to the Participating Agreement, failure to participate in a\n\nproposed well and prospect within ten days of a well proposal will result in a\n                                                                98\nforfeiture of participation rights in that prospect.

There is presently a dispute over ownership of this\nseismic data. Defendants are amenable to depositing with the court a copy of the disputed data\nuntil a resolution of ownership of the data. Moreover, Geotrace has a copy of this disputed data.\n96\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pgs. 130-131; Vol. 3 at pg. 20; RR Vol. 7, DX-1 Renpetco Well Proposal).\n97\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-1 (Renpetco Well Proposal).\n98\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-5 (Renpetco Participation Agreement, Article 3 at pg. 8).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                   16\n\fin accordance with the terms of the agreement, will result in a loss of all rights and\n\nobligations under the Participation Agreement. 99\n\n        In order to avoid forfeiture, Defendants have since elected to participate in\n\nthe drilling of the first well. However, the costs associated with drilling the first\n\nwell and subsequent wells remain outstanding. Paragraph 3(a) of Exhibit “C” of\n\nthe JOA, and Paragraph I of Article XV of the JOA, as found of page 17 of the\n\nJOA, in turn, both require payment with 15 days after billing receipt. 100 That\n\ndeadline has now come and past.101 Defendants are arguably now in default of the\n\nParticipation Agreement and other agreements. 102\n\n        Unless Defendants are able to raise capital to fund the well proposal as well\n\nas future wells, all parties’ ability to participate in the Prospect may be lost. The\n\nprojected cost of the first completed well is over $2.45 million. 103 The only way\n\nthat Defendants can pay for the well proposal as well as subsequent proposals is\n\nthrough cash call to investors. However, investors must be assured of clear title\n\nprior to investing additional capital towards the Alabama Prospect.\n\n99\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-5 (Article 3 provides in relevant part that “[i]f Renpetco or its successor\ndoes not receive a written electron from any participant, within ten (10) business days of receipt\nby the non-responding Participant of the Prospect JOA, the non-responding Participant shall be\ndeemed to have not participated in the Prospect JOA.”); RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 9-16, 22-24.\n100\n    See RR Vol. 7, DX-5.\n101\n    Desenberg testified that even if the TRO were dissolved it would be different to come up with\nthe required $700,000 in a week.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n        Appellants are appealing subsections (a)-(f) of Paragraph 35 of the\n\nTemporary Injunction Order, as such sections were improperly granted pursuant to\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 681 and 683. Subsections (a) and (b) which deal with Defendants’\n\nuse of certain data should be declared void by the Court because such sections lack\n\nrequisite specificity, and are overly broad in restraining lawful conduct. Similarly,\n\nsubsection (c) which relates to restraining Defendants from communicating with\n\nthird-party Geotrace Technologies regarding Plaintiffs should be declared void by\n\nthe Court because it lacks requisite specificity, and is overly broad in restraining\n\nlawful conduct.\n\n        Subsection (d) which enjoining Defendants from undertaking various actions\n\nwith respect to the Alabama Prospect, including performing a necessary merger\n\nand transferring working interests to bona fide purchasers should be declared void\n\nby the Court because it improperly affects rights of parties not joined to the lawsuit\n\nor injunction hearing, grants relief beyond that which was requested by Appellees’\n\nin the petition, grants relief where there is no irreparable harm, and is overly broad\n\nin restraining lawful activity. Similarly, subsection (e) which enjoins Defendants\n\nfrom undertaking various actions with respect to unidentified prospects should be\n\ndeclared void by the Court because it lacks requisite specificity, is overly broad in\n\nrestraining lawful activity, and creates what is otherwise an impermissible non-\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                             18\n\fcompete provision.         Lastly, Subsection (f) which enjoins Defendants from\n\ntransferring funds from the Alabama Prospect as well as other unidentified\n\nProspects, should be declared void by the Court because it lacks requisite\n\nspecificity, is overly broad in restraining lawful activity, and similar to Subsection\n\n(e) creates an impermissible non-compete provision.\n\n        Appellants are also challenging subsection (d), which relates to the Alabama\n\nProspect, on the basis that Appellees failed to prove probable, imminent, and\n\nirreparable injury; on the basis that the Court failed to consider the equities in the\n\ncase; and on the basis that the temporary injunction fails to preserve the status quo.\n\n        Appellants are also challenging the temporary injunction order on the basis\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in granting a low bond of $10,000 under\n\nthe circumstances, whereas Defendants and bona fide purchasers stand to\n\npotentially lose millions of dollars in damage due to the temporary injunction.\n\n                    III.    ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n        A.     Tex. R. Civ. P 681 and 683.\n        A trial court abuses it discretion by violating the requirements of Rule 683.\n\nA temporary injunction that violates Rule 683 is subject to being declared void and\n\ndissolved.104 The purpose of Rule 683 is to adequately inform a party of what he is\n\n\n\n104\n   See Tex. R. Civ. P. 683; Qwest Commc’ns Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex.\n2000) (requirements of Rule 683 are mandatory and must be strictly followed).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                              19\n\fenjoined from doing and the reasons why he is enjoined. 105 Under Rule 683, a\n\nvalid order for a temporary injunction must: (1) state the reasons for the\n\ninjunction's issuance by defining the injury and describing why it is irreparable; (2)\n\ndefine the acts sought to be enjoined in clear, specific and unambiguous terms so\n\nthat such person will readily know exactly what duties or obligations are imposed\n\nupon him; and (3) set the cause for trial on the merits and fix the amount of the\n\nbond. 106\n\n        Furthermore, an injunction decree must be as definite, clear and precise as\n\npossible and, when practicable, it should inform the person enjoined of the acts he\n\nis restrained from doing, without calling for inferences or conclusions about which\n\npersons might well differ and without leaving anything for further hearing. 107 The\n\ndecree must describe in reasonable detail and not by reference to the complaint or\n\nother documents, the acts to the restrained. 108 The trial court must also state in its\n\norder a “nexus” between the laundry list of probable injuries and finding that such\n\n\n\n\n105\n    El Tacaso, Inc., 356 S.W.3d 740, 744 (Tex.

Tex. R. Civ. P. 681 succinctly provides that “no\n\ntemporary injunction shall issue without notice to an adverse party.” Notice to\n\nadverse party requires an opportunity to be heard as well the opportunity to present\n\n109\n    Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC. v. Cornerstone Healthcare Group Holding, Inc., 374 S.W.3d\n488, 497 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.).\n110\n    See, e.g., Holubec v. Brandenberger, 111 S.W.3d 32, 39-40 (Tex. 2003).\n111\n    See id.\n112\n    See Harbor Perfusion, Inc. v. Floyd, 45 S.W.3d 713, 718 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001,\nno pet.) (“[W]here the injunctive relief granted exceeds the relief requested by the application in\nthe petition, the trial court exceeds its jurisdiction.”). The request, both as to type of relief and\nextent, must be specific. See Fairfield v. Stonehenge Ass’n, 678 S.W.2d 608, 610-11 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ). The original petition which was the live pleading at\nthe start of the temporary injunction hearing did not contain or request the relief that Plaintiffs\nobtained from the court. While Plaintiffs did file a separate application for temporary injunction,\nthe requested relief was not stated or requested in the petition. Arguably, the court was without\nauthority to enter the relief requested by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs did not file an amended petition\ncontaining requested relief for the temporary injunction until November 21, 2014— during the\nmiddle of the temporary injunction hearing. Plaintiffs’ amended petition and joinder of C-5 as\nPlaintiff was not properly before the Court. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 63; In re Fluor Enterprises, Inc.,\n2011 WL 2463004, *4 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2011, orig. proceeding) (holding that\namended petitions filed on the day of hearing for change of venue were untimely pursuant to\nTex. R. Civ. P. 63 and therefore they “were not before the trial court for its consideration.”). In\nany event, the amended petition sought relief that was narrower than the relief granted by the\ntrial court.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                     21\n\fevidence above and beyond the mere opportunity to cross-examine the party’s\n\nwitnesses. 113\n\n                 1.    The Injunction Is Void As It Violates Tex. R. Civ.

Baker, Reagan Rich, and Big Reef Energy,\n\nLLC (collectively “Defendants”), including their officers, agents, servants,\n\nemployees, and attorneys, and all persons, corporations and entities in active\n\nconcert or participation with them, from in any manner whatsoever are restrained\n\nfrom:\n\n        (a)      modifying, deleting, transferring, altering, viewing, showing, loading,\n                 copying or otherwise using in any manner 3-D seismic data and 3-D\n                 projects and associated data, information and derivatives thereof\n                 (including, without limitation, raw data, processed data, culture used\n                 with the data, interpretations of data, maps, lines, and horizons) that\n                 was taken or deleted from Everest Resource Company offices,\n\n113\n   See, e.g., Elliot v. Lewis, 792 S.W.2d 853, 855 (Tex. App. Dallas 1990, no writ), PILF Invs. v.\nArlitt, 940 S.W.2d 255, 259-60 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1997, no writ). Not only were\nDefendants ambushed with the joinder of C-5 during the middle of the hearing, but the amount\nof time allotted to Plaintiffs as opposed to Defendants was grossly lopsided and lacking in\nfundamental fairness. See, e.g., RR Vol. 4 at pg. 57.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                   22\n\f               computers, files or file servers, or that was subject to Everest\n               Resource Company's right of ownership or control pursuant to the\n               Desenberg Employment Agreement, including any such data that\n               Desenberg or Flatmax Energy, L.P. obtained from Geotrace\n               Technologies or other vendors used by Everest Resource Company;\n               however, the Defendants are not barred from using the original, raw or\n               processed data, that Flatmax Energy contributed to Everest Resource\n               Company in such original form;\n        This subsection lacks the requisite specificity under Tex. R. Civ. P. 683 in\n\nthat it fails to define the acts sought to be enjoined in clear, specific, and\n\nunambiguous terms so that a person will readily know exactly what duties or\n\nobligations are imposed.            Furthermore, the subsection improperly requires\n\nreference to other documents.             Specifically, the subsection seeks to enjoin\n\nDefendants from “using in any manner” “3-D seismic data and 3-D products and\n\nassociated data, information and derivatives therefore (including, without\n\nlimitation, raw data, processed data, cultured used with the data, interpretations of\n\ndata, maps, lines, and horizons)…that was subject to the Everest Resource\n\nCompany’s right of ownership or control pursuant to the Desenberg Employment\n\nAgreement.”114\n\n\n\n\n114\n   See Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC. v.

Specifically, the subsection seeks to enjoin\n\nDefendants from “using in any manner” “Everest Resource Company confidential\n\nbusiness information and derivatives thereof (including, without limitation,\n115\n      See, e.g., Holubec v. Brandenberger, 111 S.W.3d 32, 39-40 (Tex. 2003)\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                    24\n\fcustomer lists, vendor lists, investor lists, business forms, well data, logs, maps,\n\ngeologic information and Google Earth files)….that was subject to Everest\n\nResource Company’s ownership or control pursuant to the Desenberg and Baker\n\nEmployment Agreements.”116\n\n        The subsection is also overly broad in that restrains lawful activity and is not\n\nnarrowly tailored. 117      For example, the subsection could be read to prevent\n\nDefendants from sharing this information with the attorneys or other consultants in\n\nthis litigation.\n\n                      (3)     Subsection (c) lacks requisite specificity, and is overly\n                              broad.\n\n        Under Subsection (c), Defendants and others are restrained from:\n\n        (c)    contacting Geotrace Technologies, whether by email, telephone or\n               otherwise, concerning Everest Resource Company's seismic data or\n               otherwise interfering in the contractual relationship between Everest\n               Resource Company and Geotrace Technologies;\n\n        This subsection also lacks the requisite specificity under Tex.

P. 683\n\nin that it fails to define the acts sought to be enjoined in clear, specific and\n\nunambiguous terms so that a person will readily know exactly what duties or\n\nobligations are imposed.

Brandenberger, 111 S.W.3d 32, 39-40 (Tex. 2003).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                    25\n\freference to other documents.             Specifically, the subsection seeks to enjoin\n\nDefendants from contacting “Geotrace….concerning Everest Resource Company’s\n\nseismic data” or “otherwise interfering in the contractual relationship between\n\nEverest Resource Company and Geotrace Technologies.” 118\n\n        The subsection also is overly broad in that restrains lawful activity and is not\n\nnarrowly tailored. 119      For example, the subsection could be read to prevent\n\nDefendants’ attorneys from serving third-party discovery on Geotrace.                         The\n\nsubsection could also be read to prevent Defendants from communicating with\n\nGeotrace in order to defend the allegations made against Defendants in this case or\n\nin order to protect for example, any data belonging to Defendants that has not been\n\nreprocessed yet. 120       This subsection is also objectionable as the temporary\n\ninjunction order and the evidence fail to show why Plaintiffs would suffer\n\nimminent, immediate, and irreparable harm unless Appellee’s were enjoined from\n\nthese actions. 121\n\n\n118\n    See Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC. v. Cornerstone Healthcare Group Holding, Inc., 374\nS.W.3d at 495 (“[R]ule of civil procedure 683 requires every order granting a temporary\ninjunction to state the reasons for its issuances, be specific in terms, and describe in reasonable\ndetail and not by reference to the complaint or other documents, the acts sought to be\nrestrained.”). “Everest Resource Company’s seismic data” is undefined, and the parties otherwise\ndispute ownership of various seismic data.\n119\n    See Holubec v. Brandenberger, 111 S.W.3d 32, 39-40 (Tex. 2003).\n120\n    The temporary injunction is clear for example that Defendants have a right to access and use\nof raw, original data, which is currently in the hands of GeoTrace. See CR 579.\n121\n    The evidence actually shows no probable, imminent, or irreparable harm. Plaintiffs’ request\nfor temporary injunction is based on a series of emails involving the parties and Geotrace in early\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                    26\n\f                     (4)     Subsection (d) lacks requisite specificity, is overly broad,\n                             and grants relief not specifically requested.\n\n        Under Subsection (d), Defendants and others are restrained from:\n\n        (d)    further marketing, selling, offering for sale, transferring, assigning,\n               encumbering, burdening, or contracting to assign or sell any interest in\n               the Key Largo Prospect, including without limitation, transferring\n               ownership of Key Largo Prospect out of Petrodome Alabama II, LLC,\n               merging Petrodome Alabama II, LLC into Big Reef Energy L.L.C., or\n               taking like measures that would have the effect of transferring\n               ownership of the property, or further assigning or promising to assign\n               any mineral leasehold interest in the Key Largo Prospect; however, to\n               the extent contractually required to change the name of Petrodome\n               Alabama II, LLC, the defendants shall be permitted to do, so long as\n               the name change does not have the effect of transferring title to the\n               Key Largo Prospect into any named defendant that has already\n               contracted to sell any interest in the Key Largo Prospect;\n\n        This subsection is overbroad and void pursuant to R. Civ. P. 681 and 683.\n\nFirst, this section improperly purports the affects the rights and interest of\n\nnumerous non-parties who were never given notice of the temporary injunction as\n\nwell as an opportunity to be heard. 122 These numerous non-parties include\n\nPetrodome Alabama II, LLC, third-party investors, Renpetco (the operator of the\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 2014—more than two before the temporary injunction hearing. Crain and Clark were\ncarbon copied on the e-mails shortly after Desenberg and Baker left in early September 2014, in\nwhich Desenberg asserted that Flatmax owned the data that was in Geotrace’s possession. See\nRR Vol. 6, PX-9. Neither Crain or Clark voiced any objection or otherwise challenged\nDesenberg’s statement as inaccurate in the email exchanges. Nor did Crain or Clark ever\nsubsequently challenge Flatmax’s ownership of the data until filing suit. See RR Vol. 3 at pgs.\n39-40. There is no reason to believe that Defendants must be enjoined to prevent probably,\nimminent, and irreparable harm.\n122\n    See RR Vol. 5 at pg. 18.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                  27\n\fProspect), and other working-party groups. 123 The contractual rights of obligations\n\nof these parties are directly and negatively affected by the Court’s injunction.124\n\nNone of these companies or individuals is a party to the action or temporary\n\ninjunction hearing and thus the temporary injunction is therefore overbroad and\n\nvoid. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 681 (“no temporary injunction shall be issued without\n\nnotice to the adverse party.); Down Time-South Texas, LLC, 2014 WL 1464320, *6\n\n(Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2014, no pet.)

Neither Appellees’ original petition or amended petition\n\nspecifically request this relief.126 A trial court abuses its discretion by entering an\n\n‘overly-broad’ injunction which grants ‘more relief’ than a plaintiff is entitled to by\n\nenjoining a defendant from conducting lawful activities or from exercising legal\n\nrights. 127\n\n        This subsection is void under Rule 683 because the order and evidence fails\n\nto explain why Appellees would be irreparably and imminently harmed if\n\nAppellants were not restrained for thereafter assigning out the remaining 35%\n\nworking interest to the investors who paid millions of dollar for that assignment.\n\nNor can Appellees. Plaintiffs have no claim to the investors’ respective 35%\n\nworking interest under either law or equity. Plaintiffs would never be entitled to\n\nrecovery of the 35% interest, as the remedy for breach of fiduciary is fee forfeiture\n126\n   See CR 560 (Plaintiffs’ Amended Petition at pg. 97).\n127\n   See Harbor Perfusion, Inc. v. Floyd, 45 S.W.3d 713, (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001, no\npet.) (“[W]here the injunctive relief granted exceeds the relief requested by the application in the\npetition, the trial court exceeds its jurisdiction.” The request, both as to type of relief and extent,\nmust be specific. See Fairfield v. Stonehenge Ass’n, 678 S.W.2d 608, 610-11 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1984, no writ).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                      29\n\fand/or profit disgorgement. 128 Instead, the maximum forfeiture or disgorgement in\n\nthis case is the 4% retained interest that Defendants retained during the process of\n\nselling the remaining working interest. Cf. Alliance Royalties, LLC v. Boothe, 313\n\nS.W.3d 493, 496 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.) (noting that there must be some\n\nconnection between the claims alleged and the acts sought to be enjoined and\n\nreversing a temporary injunction that granted relief to which party was not entitled\n\nto under the contract). 129\n\n        Moreover, even if Plaintiffs were entitled to this 35% working interest—\n\nwhich they are not—the rights of the third-party investors who are bona fide\n\npurchasers would trump any equitable rights that Plaintiffs might have to the 35%\n\nworking interest. Plaintiffs have not shown to the contrary. See, e.g., Ratcliff v.\n\nMahres, 122 S.W.2d 718, 723 (Tex. Civ. App.—El Paso 1938, writ ref’d) (a bona\n\nfide purchaser will prevail over the holder of a prior equitable title). See also\n\nAmason v.

Swinnea, 318 S.W.3d 867, 873 (Tex. 2010)\n(“courts may fashion equitable remedies such as profit disgorgement and fee forfeiture to remedy\na breach of fiduciary duty.”).\n129\n    Neither a party nor the court can “rewrite the parties’ contract [or] add to its language.” Am.\nMfrs.

Appellees have hardly established\n\nimmediate, imminent, and irreparable harm with respect to enjoining the transfer of\n\nthe 35% working interest which properly belongs to the bona fide purchasers. Nor\n\nhave Appellees established irreparable, imminent, and irreparable harm with\n\nrespect to the merger of Petrodome Alabama II, LLC into Big Reef. For all these\n\nreasons subsection (e) must be declared void and be dissolved to the extent it fails\n\nto comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 681 and 683.\n\n                      (5)    Subsection (e) lacks requisite specificity, is overly broad,\n                             and grants relief not specifically requested.\n\n        Under Subsection (e), Defendants and others are restrained from:\n\n        (e)    marketing, selling, offering for sale, transferring, assigning,\n               encumbering, burdening, or contracting to assign or sell any interest in\n               an oil, gas or mineral prospect (including without limitation, signing a\n               participation agreement, entering into a joint operating agreement, or\n               assigning or promising to assign any mineral leasehold interest\n               therein) that was discovered, purchased, encountered or worked on by\n               David Desenberg or Keith Baker during their employment at Everest\n               Resource Company;\n        This subsection lacks the requisite specificity under Tex.

For example, the subsection seeks to enjoin Defendants\n\nfrom numerous activities relating to “any…prospect” “that was discovered,\n\npurchased, encountered or worked on by David Desenberg or Keith Baker during\n\ntheir employment at Everest Resources Company.”131\n\n        The subsection is also overly broad, in that it restrains lawful activity and is\n\nnot narrowly tailored. Among other things, it prohibits Appellants from developing\n\nprospects that they were aware of prior to joining Everest, but nevertheless worked\n\non while at Everest. For example, Defendant Desenberg brought to Everest the\n\nAlbrecht prospect, which he leased before ever coming to Everest. He presented\n\nthe prospect to Everest, but Everest never acted on it. 132 Similarly, Defendant\n\nBaker identified a prospect in Colorado County based on data he had prior to\n\nEverest, which Defendant Everest failed to act upon.133\n\n        More generally, the subsection is overly broad in that it restrains lawful\n\ncompetition. Under Texas law, former employees can use general knowledge,\n\n\n\n\n131\n    See Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC. v.

In a case involving trade secrets or confidential information, Texas\n\ncourts require that injunctions be narrowly tailored to address the improper use of\n\nconfidential or proprietary information; temporary injunctions must not be framed\n\nso broadly as to prohibit the enjoyment of lawful rights. 135 As written, the trial\n\ncourt is improper creating and enforcing a non-compete when no such provision\n\nexists under Defendant Desenberg and Defendant Baker’s employment agreement.\n\nSee Reliant Hosp.

The court must consider injury that may result\n\n\n\n\n140\n    See RR Vol. 1 at pg. 135-137; Vol. 3 at pgs. 11-12.\n141\n    Similar to Subsection (e), this subsection in effect creates an impermissible non-compete\nrestriction on Defendants’ ability to do business, and therefore must be declared void.\n142\n    Walling v.

Rather, the evidence showed that Plaintiffs would\n\nnot suffer probable and irreparable harm, because Plaintiffs would not have been\n\nable to facilitate and acquire the working interest in the Alabama Prospect in the\n\nfirst place. As recounted in detail above, neither C-5 nor Everest had the financial\n\nresources to acquire the out-of-state Alabama Prospect; nor was Desenberg or\n\nDefendants’ investors interested in further investment with Everest. Moreover, the\n\nevidence, as recounted above, further shows that apart from not having the\n\nfinancial wherewithal to complete the acquisition, Everest also did not have an\n\ninterest in investing in or otherwise acquiring the Alabama Prospect.           Indeed, the\n\nevidence also shows that despite being aware of the Alabama Prospect, Everest\n\nhowever, never contacted Defendants to inquire further and otherwise showed no\n\ninterest in pursuing the Alabama Prospect, prior to filing suit.\n\n        Second, even if Plaintiffs were somehow able and interested in acquiring the\n\nAlabama Prospect, the only harm that Plaintiffs may ultimately have suffered is a\n\n144\n    See Storey v.

Rights to the\n\nworking interest do not completely vest until the completion of the first well which\n\nhas yet to be drilled. Under the Participation Agreement, no participant is entitled\n\nto an assignment of a real property interest in an obligatory well until it has paid all\n\ncosts and expenses associated with the well.146 In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to\n\nmake the required showing of probable, imminent, and irreparable harm in order\n\nfor a temporary injunction to be issued with respect to actions enjoined in\n\nsubsection (d).147\n\n               3.      A Balancing of the Equities Necessitates That the Injunction\n                       be Dissolved With Respect to the Alabama Prospect.\n        The equities in this case strongly weigh against the issuance of a temporary\n\ninjunction order with respect to the Alabama Prospect. Numerous innocent third-\n\nparties who have put up millions of dollars into the Prospect and are relying upon\n\nexpeditious development of the Prospect are being irreparably harmed by the\n145\n    Plaintiffs have improperly obtained injunctive relief restraining the transfer of legal title of\n35% of the working interest to third-party investors. As detailed above, Plaintiffs have no claim\nto the investors’ respective working interest.\n146\n    See RR Vol. 7, DX-5 (Renpetco Participation Agreement).\n147\n    In addition to transfer of working interests to bona fide purchasers, Plaintiffs have also failed\nto establish immediate, imminent, and irreparable harm with respect to the merger of Petrodome\nAlabama II, LLC into Big Reef Energy LLC.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                     38\n\fissuance of the temporary injunction.               These include Renpetco, the prospect\n\noperator—who receives a carry on the first well—as well as innocent third-party\n\ninvestors who have put up millions of dollars in anticipation of being assigned their\n\nproportionate working interest. The temporary injunction has effectively frustrated\n\ntheir working interest—despite the fact that Plaintiffs, even if they prevailed on\n\ntheir claims against Defendants, would not be entitled to recovery of the respective\n\nworking interest share of the investors.\n\n        In turn, the only two parties that are seeking a temporary injunction to block\n\nthe continued development of the Prospect are cash-strapped entities who were\n\nnever interested in the Prospect in the first place; who have yet to put a dime\n\ntowards the Prospect; and who knew about the Prospect the day after Defendants\n\nDesenberg and Baker resigned, but elected to do nothing until Defendants had\n\nalready sold a 35% working interest in the Alabama Prospect to innocent investors\n\nwho are also bona fide purchasers.148\n\n\n148\n   The weight given to Plaintiffs’ claims is further weakened by the fact that their claims rest\nlargely on a vague and ambiguous contract. To support specific performance, a contract must\nhave precise terms capable of enforcement. Living Christ Church, Inc. v. Jones, 734 S.W.2d 417,\n420-21 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1987, writ denied); Guzman v. Acuna, 653 S.W.2d 315, 319 (Tex.\nApp.—San Antonio 1983, writ dis’d (holding that agreement was not subject to specific\nperformance because its essential terms were uncertain and ambiguous).

Specifically, the only way that any party\n\nincluding Plaintiffs is able to recover is if the Prospect is properly and fully\n\ndeveloped. However, Plaintiffs’ temporary injunction order has effectively stalled\n\nthe development of the Prospect, and threatens to destroy the entire prospect as\n\nwell as the possibility of recovery by any party. A weighing of the equities requires\n\nthat the temporary injunction with respect to the Alabama Prospect be dissolved.\n\nSee Neuces County Drainage and Conversation Dist. v.

The Temporary Injunction Must Be Dissolved As It Fails to\n                      Preserve the Status Quo and Threatens the Entire Alabama\n                      Prospect as Well as Recovery for Any Party.\n        The purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo of the\n\nlitigation’s subject matter pending trial on the merits. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co.,\n\n84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex. 2002).              Status quo is defined as the “last, actual,\n\npeaceful, non-contested status that preceded the pending controversy.” 150 The\n\nstatus quo in this case is the continued preservation and development of the\n\nAlabama Prospect.\n\n        The Court’s temporary order not only fails to preserve the status quo, but it\n\nthreatens to destroy the very asset from which any and all claims are to be paid.\n\nUndoubtedly, it is everyone’s best interest for the Alabama Prospect to be\n\npreserved and fully developed.\n\n        By denying the merger of Petrodome Alabama II, LLC into Big Reef\n\nEnergy, LLC, the Court has effectually split future funding from liability and\n\nownership in violation of contractual requirements with the operator and other\n\nworking interest holders. The effect is that Petrodome is arguably now in default\n\nof the Participation Agreement, and the entire Prospect is at risk. Specifically,\n\n\n\n(Tex. Civ.

In “Good Standing” is\n“being a financially solvent condition and conducting its business consistent with its normal\npractices and maintaining the Projects and AMI without liens or breaches of this contract.”)\n(emphasis added). The “Good Standing” Requirement is found throughout the Participation\nAgreement. See, e.g., Articles 2, 5.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                    42\n\feffectively prevents Defendants from complying with the contractual requirements\n\nof the Participation Agreement and from proceeding to develop the Prospect. 157\n\n          In addition to creating a state of perpetual noncompliance and default, the\n\nCourt’s temporary injunction has also effectively killed future funding of wells and\n\nfurther development of the prospect. By mandating that the interests stay in\n\nPetrodome Alabama instead of being allowed to be consolidated within Big Reef,\n\nthe Court is giving license to the Defendants to potentially work mineral interests\n\nthat they do not have clear title to. Even worse, the Court would be actively\n\nallowing them to solicit new funds from investors that they know may have\n\nownership title problems. Issuing cash calls to investors and asking them to\n\ncontribute to this potentially would open Defendant to claims of fraud by their\n\ninvestors. Investors must be assured clear title in order to fund further cash calls.\n\nNo investor would and should be willing to contribute additional funds to a project\n\nwhen they cannot be assured of clear title.\n\n          Funding difficulties will arise when the investors see these cash calls and\n\nquestion how their interest will be secured. The only way for Big Reef to protect\n\nitself is to decline to participate until the lawsuits are all settled. This will lead to\n\none prospect after another not being drilled to the detriment of all investors, all\n\nDefendants, and all Plaintiffs if they are ultimately successful in this suit. If Big\n\n157\n      See id.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                               43\n\fReef chooses not to participate in the first well, then it loses that identified\n\nprospect. Without continued funding of the wells and the project, the 40% working\n\ninterest in the Alabama Project that innocents investors have paid millions for, will\n\nbe lost, along with any potential recovery for any party.\n\n        That lost is real and immediate. The Participation Agreements provide that\n\nfailure to participate in a proposed well and prospect within ten (10) days of a well\n\nproposal will result in a forfeiture of participation rights in that prospect. 158\n\nParagraph 3(a) of Exhibit “C” of the JOA, and Paragraph I of Article XV of the\n\nJOA, 159 both require payment with 15 days after billing receipt. 160 That deadline\n\nhas now come and past.\n\n        The consequences are potentially disastrous for all parties, including\n\nPlaintiffs. Under the Participation Agreement, consent to participate in a proposed\n\nobligatory well, followed by a failure to pay for the well in accordance with the\n\nterms of the agreement, will result in a loss of all rights and obligations under the\n\nParticipation Agreement.\n\n        In sum, without the merger of Petrodome Alabama II, LLC into Big Reef\n\noccurring, and the subsequent assignment of working interest to investors—who\n\n\n158\n    See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 11-13; RR Vol. 7, DX-1 (Renpetco Well Proposal); RR Vol. 7, DX-5\n(Renpetco Participation Agreement) at Art. 3.\n159\n    See RR Vol 7, DX-1 at pg. 17.\n160\n    See RR Vol. 7, DX-1.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                               44\n\fpaid millions of dollars for such interests—the development of the Alabama\n\nProspect is terminally stalled, and potentially at risk of complete collapse.\n\nCertainly, if Defendants forfeited the rights to assignment of the 40% working\n\ninterest, it would be a substantial economic detriment to Defendants, their partners,\n\nand other working interest holders. Under those circumstances, Plaintiffs would\n\ngain nothing and everyone else involved would lose everything invested in and\n\nanticipated from a successful project.               Even the Plaintiffs would lose any\n\nopportunity to collect the monetary damages they seek in their petition.\n\nAccordingly, the temporary injunction must be dissolved as it falls to preserve and\n\nin fact changes the status quo. 161\n\n        B.     The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion by Setting a Low Bond.\n        The trial court also abused its discretion in setting a bond of $10,000 given\n\nthe fact that Defendants, bona fide purchasers, and other third parties stand to lose\n\npotentially millions of dollars. The trial court is required to set a bond when it\n\ngrants a temporary injunction. Tex. R. Civ. P. 683, 684.

Without that purchase and those investors there is no\n\nAlabama Project. There is no participation in the first well or the money to fund\n\nthe first well.   Plaintiffs cannot and should not be able to claim a corporate\n\nopportunity without having to put up that amount.\n\n        Moreover, Plaintiffs’ temporary injunction has effectively halted the\n\ndevelopment of the Prospect, and now threatens to kills the Prospect altogether.\n\nDefendants and investors stand to lose not only the $7.5 million used to purchase\n\nthe Prospect, but potentially millions of dollars in revenue and profit that could\n\npotentially flow from the Prospect. Appellees are in essence enjoying a free ride,\n\nand are betting on other people’s money.\n\n        Should the Project prove unfruitful, Appellees will quickly disavow any\n\nclaimed corporate opportunity. Defendants and the investors will be unable to\n\nrecover from these financially defunct entities.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                               46\n\f        A bond of $10,000 is clearly insufficient and should be reversed, given that\n\nDefendants and innocent third-party stand to lose $7.5 million in actual damages,\n\nin addition to potentially millions more in lost profits and revenues due to delay or\n\nloss of the Project altogether. Where, as here, the evidence shows that the potential\n\ndamages to be suffered exceed the amount of the bond, the bond is insufficient.\n\nSee GTE Mobilnet of South Tex. Ltd. Part’p v.

This interlocutory appeal is brought pursuant to\n\nSection § 51.014(a)(4) of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code.\n\n        The instant case primarily involves a dispute over rights to an assignment of\n\na 40% working interest in an oil & gas prospect located in the state of Alabama\n\n(the “Alabama Prospect”). Plaintiffs sought and obtained a temporary injunction\n\nenjoining Defendants from engaging in various activities, including transferring\n\nany working interest to bona fide purchasers, as well as the merger of entities\n\notherwise required for contractual compliance and continued development of the\n\nAlabama Prospect.\n\n        Appellants are appealing subsections (a)-(f) of Paragraph 35 of the\n\nTemporary Injunction Order.\n\n        Course of Proceedings: The trial court conducted a temporary injunction\n\nhearing intermittently over the course of November 19-21, 2014.               At the\n\nconclusion of the temporary injunction hearing, the Hon. David Stith 319th\n\n\n\n\n1\n Record cites used in this brief are as follows: App.–Appendix; CR–Clerk’s Record; RR–\nReporter’s Report; PX–Plaintiffs’ hearing exhibits; DX–Defendants’ hearing exhibit.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                              ix\n\fJudicial District Court of Nueces County, entered a temporary injunction against\n\nAppellants on November 21, 2014. 2\n\n        Defendants thereafter requested and obtained a setting for a hearing to\n\nmodify and/or dissolve the temporary injunction. However, on the day of the\n\nsetting, the trial court informed the parties it would be unable to hear Defendants’\n\nmotion and request.3 In order to preserve Defendants’ rights, Defendants filed a\n\nnotice of appeal that same day as required under the Texas Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure.\n\n        Defendants thereafter were able to reset their prior request to modify and/or\n\ndissolve the temporary injunction for December 29, 2014.                     At the hearing,\n\nhowever, Plaintiffs objected to any request for the Court to modify the temporary\n\ninjunction, on the basis that the appellate court was the proper court to modify the\n\ntemporary injunction. The trial court agreed and otherwise denied Defendants’\n\nadditional request to dissolve the temporary injunction.4\n\n\n\n\n2\n  CR 569; App. A. The temporary injunction order was signed by Judge Missy Medary per\nJudge Stith’s request as Judge Stith was required to leave at the conclusion of the hearing in\norder to attend a previously scheduled event.\n3\n  The trial court referred the parties to a visiting judge. However, given the complexity of the\ncase, and the fact that the visiting judge would be unfamiliar with the case and issues,\nDefendants elected to reset the hearing before Judge Stith.\n4\n  Appellants are appealing the trial court’s original grant of the temporary injunction order and\nalso request that the appellate court review the trial court’s subsequent refusal to dissolve the\ntemporary injunction. See TRAP 29.6.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                   x\n\f                                 ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n        The issues presented in this appeal have significant implications for the\n\nrights and remedies available to the parties. Oral argument is warranted and will\n\nassist the Court in resolving important questions to be decided.\n\n                                ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n        (1)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary\n               injunction because the temporary injunction order did not\n               comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 683, in that the order lacked\n               requisite specificity, was overly broad, restrained parties not\n               before the court, and sought relief that was not specifically\n               plead for;\n\n        (2)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary\n               injunction because the temporary injunction order does not\n               comply with Tex. R. Civ. P. 681;\n\n        (3)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering a temporary\n               injunction relating to the Alabama Prospect that fails to\n               preserve the status quo;\n\n        (4)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering the temporary\n               injunction relating to the Alabama Prospect because Appellees\n               failed to prove probable, imminent, and irreparable injury;\n\n        (5)    The trial court abused its discretion in entering the temporary\n               injunction relating to the Alabama Prospect because a required\n               balancing of the equities weighs against an injunction due to the\n               catastrophic and irreparable injury that all parties will suffer as\n               a result of the temporary injunction; and\n\n        (6)    The trial court abused its discretion in granting a low bond in\n               the amount of $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                xi\n\f                            I.     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n        A.     Plaintiffs C-5 and Everest.\n        Plaintiff C-5 Oil & Gas, Ltd. (“C-5”) is an investment company that invests\n\nin oil and gas properties.5 C-5 is the primary funder of Plaintiff Everest Resource\n\nCompany (“Everest”). 6 Everest, in turn, is a small, independent oil and gas\n\nexploration and production company based in Corpus Christi, Texas. 7 Jimmy\n\nClark (“Clark”) is the President and CEO of Everest Resource Company. 8\n\nThrough Clark-Durham Operations LLC, Clark is also involved as a general\n\npartner of C-5. 9 Clark and Tom Crain (“Crain”), who operates as Everest’s Chief\n\nOperating Officer, make all the decisions and effectively run C-5 and Everest.10\n\n        B.     Everest’s Business is Limited to Oil and Gas Prospects Located\n               Along the Gulf Coast of Texas.\n        Everest publicly advertises itself as a company that generates, buys, drills,\n\nand operates oil and gas prospects primarily along the Gulf Coast of Texas. 11\n\n\n\n\n5\n   See RR Vol. 7, PX—23 (C-5 Oil & Gas Partnership Agreement).\n6\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 48.\n7\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 82-83; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff Everest’s Website).\n8\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 50-51.\n9\n   See id.\n10\n    See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 43.\n11\n    See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 82-83; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff Everest’s Website).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                    1\n\fEverest’s current prospects are all located in Texas. 12 Everest has not done any oil\n\nand gas operations outside the state of Texas for at least the last twenty years. 13\n\n        Everest as a business is incredibly risk averse, and centers on using other\n\npeople’s money for oil and gas prospects. 14 Everest’s philosophical business\n\nmodel involves exploiting investors for up-front money. 15 Indeed, Everest publicly\n\nadvertises that the typical Everest deal is “Reimburse Everest for G&G costs,\n\nturnkey well costs, Everest carry to Casing Point.” 16\n\n        C.     Defendants.\n        Defendants Keith Baker (“Baker”) and Flatmax Energy, L.P. (“Flatmax”) are\n\nlimited partners in C-5.         Flatmax Energy, L.P. is a company controlled by\n\nDefendant David Desenberg (“Desenberg”). 17 Other Defendants to this appeal\n\ninclude Defendant Flatmax L.L.C., which is a company operated by Desenberg;\n\nReagan Rich who is Desenberg’s stepson-in-law; and Defendant Big Reef Energy,\n\nL.L.C. (“Big Reef”) which is a company managed by Defendants. 18\n\n\n12\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pg. 83.\n13\n   See id.\n14\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 55-57; Vol. 4 at pgs. 83-84; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff\nEverest’s Website).\n15\n   Id.\n16\n   See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 83-84; RR Vol. 7, DX-14 (Print Out from Plaintiff Everest’s Website).\n17\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pgs. 22, 25.\n18\n   Defendant Big Reef Energy entered into various participation agreements with third-party\ninvestors regarding the Alabama Prospect. See RR Vol. 7, DX 6-8 (Participation Agreements\nbetween Big Reef Energy, LLC and third-party investors who are not before the Court).

Defendants Desenberg and Baker Join Everest and C-5; Plaintiffs\n               Were to Have Only Limited Use of Desenberg’s Data;\n               Desenberg’s Data Has Nothing to Do with the Alabama Prospect.\n        Defendants Baker and Desenberg have each been in the oil and gas business\n\nfor many years. 19 In 2012, Desenberg and Baker each explored potential business\n\ndealings with Everest and C-5. Desenberg joined C-5 and Everest because of the\n\nseismic data he had and because he was hoping to find a company that would\n\nparticipate with him in developing prospects from that data. 20           Desenberg’s\n\ndatabase of seismic data dealt with a few counties in South Texas. 21 Desenberg’s\n\ndatabase did not have anything to do with the Alabama Prospect. 22 On paper, it\n\nseemed like a good fit. Prior to Desenberg and Baker joining C-5 and Everest,\n\nEverest had had limited success in the drilling business. In fact, Crain stated many\n\ntimes that Everest had drilled 40 dry holes in a row. 23\n\n        While Desenberg was working with Everest and partnering with C-5, some\n\nof his seismic data was made available for exploration benefit. 24 However,\n\n\n\n\nthe assignment of the 40% working interest.

Specifically, Section 5.5 of that agreement\n\nstates, in relevant part, that “all partners may pursue other business and interests\n\nwithout regard to the partnership.”35\n\n        As a result of Desenberg bringing data to the venture, Desenberg’s\n\nemployment agreement with Everest contained a unique provision which was\n\nmeant to allow Everest to potentially pursue prospects using Desenberg’s data\n\nwithin three counties in South Texas. 36 This intention was memorialized in Section\n\n7 of Mr. Desenberg’s Agreement which provides in relevant part:\n\n\n\n32\n   See RR Vol. 6, PX-1 (Desenberg Employment Agreement); RR Vol. 6, PX-2 (Baker\nEmployment Agreement); RR Vol. 6, PX-23 (C-5 Partnership Agreement).\n33\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 60.\n34\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 41-42, 49.\n35\n   See RR Vol. 7, PX-23 (C-5 Partnership Agreement at § 5.5).

See RR Vol. 6, PX-14 (Draft LOI addressed to\nFlatmax).\n36\n   See RR Vol 2 at pg. 50. There is no similar Section 7 provision in Baker’s employment\nagreement with Everest, nor is there any restriction on Baker’s work after leaving Everest. See\nRR Vol. 4 at pg. 43. Other Everest employees, including Clark, did not have the same agreement\nas Desenberg.

Attached as Exhibit B is a map showing the area\n        covered by the Retained Seismic (the “Covered Area”). Unless otherwise\n        subsequently agreed, and notwithstanding Employee’s confidentiality\n        obligations set forth above, Flatmax and its affiliates will retain all\n        ownership of the Retained Seismic and all opportunity rights to pursue\n        prospects within the Covered Area before and after termination of the Terms\n        of the Employment, subject to the following:\n\n        (2) Otherwise, during the Term of Employment, Desenberg, Flatmax and\n        their affiliates agree to pursue prospects within the Covered Area jointly\n        with the Company on a mutually agreed basis, and to pursue prospects\n        outside the Covered Area exclusively for the account of the Company and/or\n        C-5. (emphasis added)\n\n        Subsection 2 did not create a worldwide prohibition to compete as Plaintiffs\n\nclaim, but rather only restricted the ability of Defendant Flatmax and its affiliates\n\nto pursue opportunity rights within the Covered Areas (which consists of\n\nDesenberg’s data within three counties of Texas) and outside of the Covered Areas\n\n(which consists of the remaining area of the three counties in Texas). 37 This was\n\ndiscussed as part of the negotiations several times and was the understanding of the\n\nparties. 38    In other words, inside the three counties within the Covered Area,\n\nDesenberg earned a mutually agreed special interest amount, whereas outside the\n\nCovered Area, Desenberg did not earn any additional mutually agreed to interest.39\n\n\n37\n   See RR Vol 2 at pg. 50.\n38\n   See id.\n39\n   See See RR Vol. 6, PX-1 (Desenberg Employment Agreement) at pg. 6.

Plaintiffs Treat Defendants Desenberg, Baker, and Investors\n               Poorly; Desenberg and Baker Each Independently Decide to\n               Leave Everest Before Hearing About the Alabama Prospect.\n         Desenberg and Baker each made an independent decision to leave Everest,\n\nand did not solicit each other to leave. 42 Moreover, both made the decision to\n\nleave months before they ever heard about the Alabama Prospect. 43\n\n         In June 2014, Baker had made the decision to leave Everest because Everest\n\nlacked the ability to evolve and meet the current challenges in the oil and gas\n\nindustry. 44\n\n\n\n\ncompensation to Desenberg of either a 1 % overriding royalty interest or a 2 % carried working\ninterest to sales on any prospect drilled on the Flatmax 3-D Data Sets. See CR at pg. 1139.\n40\n   No exhibits were attached to the original Desenberg Employment Agreement. See RR Vol. 2\nat pg. 34. Rather, Desenberg’s employment agreement with Everest lacks a list of the Flatmax 3-\nD Shoots and it lacked the map identifying the covered and non-covered areas.

Despite initially raising millions of dollars including Desenberg’s\n\n$250,000, C-5 partners inexplicably had requests for cash calls beginning in or\n\naround October 2013, only one year after the initial funding of C-5.48\n\n        G.     Defendants Desenberg and Baker Do Not Hear About the\n               Potential Alabama Prospect Until the Last Few Weeks of Their\n               Employment With Everest; and Do Not Use Any Everest\n               Resources in Exploring the Possibility of The Alabama Prospect.\n        Desenberg first learned about the potential for the Alabama Prospect on or\n\nabout August 6, 2014, less than a month before his resignation. 49 Desenberg was\n\ncontacted by a friend who invited him to look at some information concerning a\n\nprospect in Alabama. 50 It was not clear that Defendants could even purchase the\n\n\n45\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 48-49.

Defendant Rich was the primary individual\n\nnegotiating the deal, with Defendant Desenberg only participating peripherally. 52\n\nOn August 29, 2014, the last business day before Defendants Desenberg and\n\nBaker’s resignations, a letter of intent was signed between Flatmax and\n\nPetrodome. 53 At no time prior to August 29, 2014, did any Defendant have any\n\ncontractual right of any kind to the Alabama Prospect. 54\n\n        The Alabama Prospect was a highly risky investment, and required a tight\n\nclosing with a lot of money needing to be raised quickly. 55 A $500,000 non-\n\nrefundable deposit was requested and paid by Desenberg and Rich’s company on\n\nthe last Friday of August 2014. 56 Defendants barely had enough money to fund\n\ndeal. In fact, Desenberg had to borrow some of the $450,000 he personally funded\n\nfor the Petrodome stock purchase.57\n\n\n\n51\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 51.\n52\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pg. 78.\n53\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 52-53.\n54\n   See id.\n55\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pgs. 70, 103-104.\n56\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pgs. 79, 103-104; Vol. 3 at pg. 57.\n57\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pg. 100.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                     9\n\f        Desenberg and Baker resigned from Everest the following Tuesday, on\n\nSeptember 3, 2014. 58 The Key Largo acquisition closed on October 1, 2014,\n\napproximately one month later. 59 The total acquisition price for the 40% working\n\ninterest was $7.5 million, 60 which was funded entirely by Defendants’ friends,\n                                                               61\nfamily, and through a personal loan to Desenberg.

During that time, Desenberg and Baker\n\ncontinued to work full time for Everest and did not use any company resources in\n\nconnection with the Key Largo Prospect, except perhaps for an occasional email or\n\na call on a personal cel phone.69\n\n        At no time during their employment with Everest did Desenberg or Baker\n\nengaged in any activity that would have materially interfered with the performance\n\nof their obligations to the Everest. 70 They worked on the Petrodome Project\n\ntypically at nights and on the weekends. 71 Nor did Desenberg or Baker take any\n\nconfidential information or trade secrets of any kind from Everest. 72\n\n        Desenberg and Baker’s departure from Everest was otherwise cordial.\n\nIndeed, after Desenberg and Baker announced that they were leaving Everest,\n66\n   See id.\n67\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 98-99.\n68\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 51, 61; Vol. 4 at pg. 39.\n69\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 51, 60-61; Vol. 4 at pgs. 38-39.\n70\n   See id.\n71\n   See id.\n72\n   See id.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                     11\n\fCrain came into Desenberg’s office.73 Crain stated that he would love to continue\n\nworking with Desenberg and Baker, and offered to do land work on the side for\n\nthem. 74\n\n        H.

In fact, Everest didn’t have the resources to acquire any prospect, let\n\nalone the $7.5 million dollar 40% working interest in the Alabama Prospect. Prior\n\nto the Alabama Prospect, Defendants Desenberg and Baker had presented two\n\npotential prospects to Everest, both of which Everest declined to fund. 75 Indeed,\n\nEverest didn’t even have money to keep operations going. By October 2013,\n\nEverest’s Crain began stressing the need for cash calls in order to sustain continued\n\noperations.76 By August 2014, the very month that the Petrodome letter of intent\n\nwas signed, Everest’s funding had all but dried up. Specifically, on August 27,\n\n2014—two days before the Alabama letter of intent was signed—Everest held a\n\npartner’s meeting in which Crain and Ron Polansky, C-5 Chief Financial Offer,\n\n\n\n73\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 53.\n74\n   See id.\n75\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pgs. 57-58.\n76\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 48.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                             12\n\fbegged Clark to use his sources and raise exploration capital for C-5. 77 Clark\n\nabsolutely refused to raise any exploration capital for C-5, at which point Everest\n\nwere effectively defunct.78\n\n        Nor was there any reason to believe that Everest could sell the Alabama\n\nProspect to Defendants’ investors. All of the investors in the Key Largo Prospect\n\nhad a relationship with at least one of the Defendants prior to Defendants working\n\nfor Everest, and simply were not interested in investing with Everest. 79 Nor was\n\nDesenberg who took out a personal loan interest in order to complete the\n\nPetrodome acquisition interested in further investments with Everest. 80\n\n        Apart from not having the financial wherewithal to complete the $7.5\n\nmillion acquisition, Everest also did not have an interest in investing in or\n\notherwise acquiring a 40% working interest in the Alabama Prospect. First, the\n\nAlabama Prospect was a non-operator deal, whereas Everest was typically the\n\noperator in a deal. 81 Being the operator is critical to using other people’s money\n\nwhich was Everest business philosophy. 82 Second, the Alabama Prospect required\n\n\n77\n   See RR Vol. 3 at pg. 58.\n78\n   See id.

According to the Participating Agreement, failure to participate in a\n\nproposed well and prospect within ten days of a well proposal will result in a\n                                                                98\nforfeiture of participation rights in that prospect.

Mr. Baker did delete some seismic data off of Everest’s\ncomputer, but only did so based on his understanding that such data contractually belonged to\nFlatmax See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 44-45. There is presently a dispute over ownership of this\nseismic data. Defendants are amenable to depositing with the court a copy of the disputed data\nuntil a resolution of ownership of the data. Moreover, Geotrace has a copy of this disputed data.\n96\n   See RR Vol. 2 at pgs. 130-131; Vol. 3 at pg. 20; RR Vol. 7, DX-1 Renpetco Well Proposal).\n97\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-1 (Renpetco Well Proposal).\n98\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-5 (Renpetco Participation Agreement, Article 3 at pg. 8).\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                   16\n\fin accordance with the terms of the agreement, will result in a loss of all rights and\n\nobligations under the Participation Agreement. 99\n\n        In order to avoid forfeiture, Defendants have since elected to participate in\n\nthe drilling of the first well. However, the costs associated with drilling the first\n\nwell and subsequent wells remain outstanding. Paragraph 3(a) of Exhibit “C” of\n\nthe JOA, and Paragraph I of Article XV of the JOA, as found of page 17 of the\n\nJOA, in turn, both require payment with 15 days after billing receipt. 100 That\n\ndeadline has now come and past.101 Defendants are arguably now in default of the\n\nParticipation Agreement and other agreements. 102\n\n        Unless Defendants are able to raise capital to fund the well proposal as well\n\nas future wells, all parties’ ability to participate in the Prospect may be lost. The\n\nprojected cost of the first completed well is over $2.45 million. 103 The only way\n\nthat Defendants can pay for the well proposal as well as subsequent proposals is\n\nthrough cash call to investors. However, investors must be assured of clear title\n\nprior to investing additional capital towards the Alabama Prospect.\n\n99\n   See RR Vol. 7, DX-5 (Article 3 provides in relevant part that “[i]f Renpetco or its successor\ndoes not receive a written electron from any participant, within ten (10) business days of receipt\nby the non-responding Participant of the Prospect JOA, the non-responding Participant shall be\ndeemed to have not participated in the Prospect JOA.”); RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 9-16, 22-24.\n100\n    See RR Vol. 7, DX-5.\n101\n    Desenberg testified that even if the TRO were dissolved it would be different to come up with\nthe required $700,000 in a week.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n        Appellants are appealing subsections (a)-(f) of Paragraph 35 of the\n\nTemporary Injunction Order, as such sections were improperly granted pursuant to\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 681 and 683. Subsections (a) and (b) which deal with Defendants’\n\nuse of certain data should be declared void by the Court because such sections lack\n\nrequisite specificity, and are overly broad in restraining lawful conduct. Similarly,\n\nsubsection (c) which relates to restraining Defendants from communicating with\n\nthird-party Geotrace Technologies regarding Plaintiffs should be declared void by\n\nthe Court because it lacks requisite specificity, and is overly broad in restraining\n\nlawful conduct.\n\n        Subsection (d) which enjoining Defendants from undertaking various actions\n\nwith respect to the Alabama Prospect, including performing a necessary merger\n\nand transferring working interests to bona fide purchasers should be declared void\n\nby the Court because it improperly affects rights of parties not joined to the lawsuit\n\nor injunction hearing, grants relief beyond that which was requested by Appellees’\n\nin the petition, grants relief where there is no irreparable harm, and is overly broad\n\nin restraining lawful activity. Similarly, subsection (e) which enjoins Defendants\n\nfrom undertaking various actions with respect to unidentified prospects should be\n\ndeclared void by the Court because it lacks requisite specificity, is overly broad in\n\nrestraining lawful activity, and creates what is otherwise an impermissible non-\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                             18\n\fcompete provision.         Lastly, Subsection (f) which enjoins Defendants from\n\ntransferring funds from the Alabama Prospect as well as other unidentified\n\nProspects, should be declared void by the Court because it lacks requisite\n\nspecificity, is overly broad in restraining lawful activity, and similar to Subsection\n\n(e) creates an impermissible non-compete provision.\n\n        Appellants are also challenging subsection (d), which relates to the Alabama\n\nProspect, on the basis that Appellees failed to prove probable, imminent, and\n\nirreparable injury; on the basis that the Court failed to consider the equities in the\n\ncase; and on the basis that the temporary injunction fails to preserve the status quo.\n\n        Appellants are also challenging the temporary injunction order on the basis\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in granting a low bond of $10,000 under\n\nthe circumstances, whereas Defendants and bona fide purchasers stand to\n\npotentially lose millions of dollars in damage due to the temporary injunction.\n\n                    III.

R. Civ. P. 683 in\n\nthat it fails to define the acts sought to be enjoined in clear, specific and\n\nunambiguous terms so that a person will readily know exactly what duties or\n\nobligations are imposed. For example, the subsection seeks to enjoin Defendants\n\nfrom numerous activities relating to “any…prospect” “that was discovered,\n\npurchased, encountered or worked on by David Desenberg or Keith Baker during\n\ntheir employment at Everest Resources Company.”138\n\n        The subsection is also overly broad, in that it restrains lawful activity and is\n\nnot narrowly tailored. Former employees can use general knowledge, skills, and\n\nexperience acquired in the employment relationship, even when competing with\n\ntheir former employer. 139 Moreover, this section is overly broad, as this section\n\n\n138\n    See Reliant Hospital Partners, LLC. v.

Moreover, the\n\nevidence, as recounted above, further shows that apart from not having the\n\nfinancial wherewithal to complete the acquisition, Everest also did not have an\n\ninterest in investing in or otherwise acquiring the Alabama Prospect.           Indeed, the\n\nevidence also shows that despite being aware of the Alabama Prospect, Everest\n\nhowever, never contacted Defendants to inquire further and otherwise showed no\n\ninterest in pursuing the Alabama Prospect, prior to filing suit.\n\n        Second, even if Plaintiffs were somehow able and interested in acquiring the\n\nAlabama Prospect, the only harm that Plaintiffs may ultimately have suffered is a\n\n144\n    See Storey v.

Under the Participation Agreement, no participant is entitled\n\nto an assignment of a real property interest in an obligatory well until it has paid all\n\ncosts and expenses associated with the well.146 In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to\n\nmake the required showing of probable, imminent, and irreparable harm in order\n\nfor a temporary injunction to be issued with respect to actions enjoined in\n\nsubsection (d).147\n\n               3.      A Balancing of the Equities Necessitates That the Injunction\n                       be Dissolved With Respect to the Alabama Prospect.\n        The equities in this case strongly weigh against the issuance of a temporary\n\ninjunction order with respect to the Alabama Prospect. Numerous innocent third-\n\nparties who have put up millions of dollars into the Prospect and are relying upon\n\nexpeditious development of the Prospect are being irreparably harmed by the\n145\n    Plaintiffs have improperly obtained injunctive relief restraining the transfer of legal title of\n35% of the working interest to third-party investors. As detailed above, Plaintiffs have no claim\nto the investors’ respective working interest.\n146\n    See RR Vol. 7, DX-5 (Renpetco Participation Agreement).\n147\n    In addition to transfer of working interests to bona fide purchasers, Plaintiffs have also failed\nto establish immediate, imminent, and irreparable harm with respect to the merger of Petrodome\nAlabama II, LLC into Big Reef Energy LLC.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                                     38\n\fissuance of the temporary injunction.               These include Renpetco, the prospect\n\noperator—who receives a carry on the first well—as well as innocent third-party\n\ninvestors who have put up millions of dollars in anticipation of being assigned their\n\nproportionate working interest. The temporary injunction has effectively frustrated\n\ntheir working interest—despite the fact that Plaintiffs, even if they prevailed on\n\ntheir claims against Defendants, would not be entitled to recovery of the respective\n\nworking interest share of the investors.\n\n        In turn, the only two parties that are seeking a temporary injunction to block\n\nthe continued development of the Prospect are cash-strapped entities who were\n\nnever interested in the Prospect in the first place; who have yet to put a dime\n\ntowards the Prospect; and who knew about the Prospect the day after Defendants\n\nDesenberg and Baker resigned, but elected to do nothing until Defendants had\n\nalready sold a 35% working interest in the Alabama Prospect to innocent investors\n\nwho are also bona fide purchasers.148\n\n\n148\n   The weight given to Plaintiffs’ claims is further weakened by the fact that their claims rest\nlargely on a vague and ambiguous contract.

By mandating that the interests stay in\n\nPetrodome Alabama instead of being allowed to be consolidated within Big Reef,\n\nthe Court is giving license to the Defendants to potentially work mineral interests\n\nthat they do not have clear title to. Even worse, the Court would be actively\n\nallowing them to solicit new funds from investors that they know may have\n\nownership title problems. Issuing cash calls to investors and asking them to\n\ncontribute to this potentially would open Defendant to claims of fraud by their\n\ninvestors. Investors must be assured clear title in order to fund further cash calls.\n\nNo investor would and should be willing to contribute additional funds to a project\n\nwhen they cannot be assured of clear title.\n\n          Funding difficulties will arise when the investors see these cash calls and\n\nquestion how their interest will be secured. The only way for Big Reef to protect\n\nitself is to decline to participate until the lawsuits are all settled.

Without continued funding of the wells and the project, the 40% working\n\ninterest in the Alabama Project that innocents investors have paid millions for, will\n\nbe lost, along with any potential recovery for any party.\n\n        That lost is real and immediate. The Participation Agreements provide that\n\nfailure to participate in a proposed well and prospect within ten (10) days of a well\n\nproposal will result in a forfeiture of participation rights in that prospect. 158\n\nParagraph 3(a) of Exhibit “C” of the JOA, and Paragraph I of Article XV of the\n\nJOA, 159 both require payment with 15 days after billing receipt. 160 That deadline\n\nhas now come and past.\n\n        The consequences are potentially disastrous for all parties, including\n\nPlaintiffs. Under the Participation Agreement, consent to participate in a proposed\n\nobligatory well, followed by a failure to pay for the well in accordance with the\n\nterms of the agreement, will result in a loss of all rights and obligations under the\n\nParticipation Agreement.\n\n        In sum, without the merger of Petrodome Alabama II, LLC into Big Reef\n\noccurring, and the subsequent assignment of working interest to investors—who\n\n\n158\n    See RR Vol. 4 at pgs. 11-13; RR Vol. 7, DX-1 (Renpetco Well Proposal); RR Vol. 7, DX-5\n(Renpetco Participation Agreement) at Art. 3.\n159\n    See RR Vol 7, DX-1 at pg. 17.\n160\n    See RR Vol. 7, DX-1.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                               44\n\fpaid millions of dollars for such interests—the development of the Alabama\n\nProspect is terminally stalled, and potentially at risk of complete collapse.\n\nCertainly, if Defendants forfeited the rights to assignment of the 40% working\n\ninterest, it would be a substantial economic detriment to Defendants, their partners,\n\nand other working interest holders. Under those circumstances, Plaintiffs would\n\ngain nothing and everyone else involved would lose everything invested in and\n\nanticipated from a successful project.

App.—Dallas 1990, writ denied).\n\n        In order to protect the interests of Defendants and their investors, a bond of\n\nat least $9 million dollars should have been required—the purchase price of the\n\nright to an assignment of a 40% working interest in the Alabama Prospect and\n\nnecessary working capital. Without that purchase and those investors there is no\n\nAlabama Project. There is no participation in the first well or the money to fund\n\nthe first well.   Plaintiffs cannot and should not be able to claim a corporate\n\nopportunity without having to put up that amount.\n\n        Moreover, Plaintiffs’ temporary injunction has effectively halted the\n\ndevelopment of the Prospect, and now threatens to kills the Prospect altogether.\n\nDefendants and investors stand to lose not only the $7.5 million used to purchase\n\nthe Prospect, but potentially millions of dollars in revenue and profit that could\n\npotentially flow from the Prospect. Appellees are in essence enjoying a free ride,\n\nand are betting on other people’s money.\n\n        Should the Project prove unfruitful, Appellees will quickly disavow any\n\nclaimed corporate opportunity. Defendants and the investors will be unable to\n\nrecover from these financially defunct entities.\n\n\n\n206174111 v5                               46\n\f        A bond of $10,000 is clearly insufficient and should be reversed, given that\n\nDefendants and innocent third-party stand to lose $7.5 million in actual damages,\n\nin addition to potentially millions more in lost profits and revenues due to delay or\n\nloss of the Project altogether. Where, as here, the evidence shows that the potential\n\ndamages to be suffered exceed the amount of the bond, the bond is insufficient.\n\nSee GTE Mobilnet of South Tex. Ltd. Part’p v.
