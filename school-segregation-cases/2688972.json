(Super. Ct. No. 30-2012-00591239)\n\nCITY OF SAN CLEMENTE et al.,                         OPINION\n\n    Defendants and Appellants.\n\n\n\n                  Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County, Thierry\nPatrick Colaw, Judge. Affirmed.\n                  Rutan & Tucker, Jeffrey M. Oderman, Robert O. Owen and Ajit S. Thind\nfor Defendants and Appellants.\n                  Spach, Capaldi & Waggaman and Madison Spach, Jr.; Brad Malamud and\nPaul Rosenfield for Plaintiffs and Appellants.\n                                 *            *             *\n\f              The Mitigation Fee Act (Gov. Code, § 66000 et seq.; Act)1 authorizes a\nlocal agency to impose fees on specific development projects to defray the cost of new or\nadditional public facilities that are needed to serve those developments. The Act\nestablishes a variety of requirements to ensure local agencies timely use these fees to pay\nfor public facilities that serve those very developments rather than divert the fees for\ngeneral revenue purposes. For example, when establishing a development fee, a local\nagency must identify both how it will use the fee and the relationship between its use and\nthe developments on which the fee is imposed. Moreover, the local agency must make\nnew findings every five years to justify its continued retention of any fees it has collected\nbut failed to use. If the agency does not make these five-year findings, the Act requires\nthe agency to refund the unused fees to the current owners of the affected properties.\n              In 1989, defendant and appellant City of San Clemente (City)2 created the\n“Beach Parking Impact Fee” because the City anticipated that substantial residential\ndevelopment proposed for the City’s inland areas would significantly increase the\ndemand for public parking at the City’s beaches. The City therefore imposed the Beach\nParking Impact Fee on all new residential developments outside the City’s coastal zone to\ndefray the cost of acquiring and constructing new beach parking facilities. Between 1989\nand 2009, the City collected nearly $10 million in Beach Parking Impact Fees and\naccrued interest, but the City spent less than $350,000 to purchase a vacant parcel on\nwhich it has not constructed any parking facilities.\n              Plaintiffs and respondents Daniel Walker, as Trustee for the 1997 Walker\nFamily Trust, and W. Justin McCarthy (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action to compel\n\n\n          1   All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nstated.\n          2   The City Council of San Clemente also is a defendant and appellant, but we\nsimply refer to the City for ease of reference.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthe City to refund the unused portion of the Beach Parking Impact Fee. Plaintiffs alleged\nthe five-year findings the City made in 2009 failed to satisfy the Act’s requirements and\ndid not justify the City’s continued retention of the unexpended Beach Parking Impact\nFees because the increased parking demand had not materialized over the ensuing\n20 years. The trial court agreed and entered judgment ordering the City to refund\napproximately $10.5 million in unexpended impact fees to the current property owners on\nwhich the fees were imposed.\n              We affirm because the City failed to make the five-year findings the Act\nrequired and the statutorily-mandated remedy for that failure is the refund of all\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees. The City contends it satisfied the Act’s\nrequirement of five-year findings when it “receive[d] and file[d]” a 2009 staff report. We\ndisagree. The report’s findings were mere conclusions, not the specific findings required\nunder the Act. Consequently, the City failed to justify its continued retention of the\nunexpended impact fees.\n              Plaintiffs also appeal, challenging the trial court’s decision to deny\n(1) Plaintiffs’ claim the five-year findings the City made in 2004 were untimely;\n(2) Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling the City to sell the vacant lot it purchased\nand refund the sale proceeds with the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees;\n(3) Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling the City to reimburse the Beach Parking\nImpact Fee account for the administrative overhead costs the City charged; and\n(4) Plaintiffs’ request for a judicial determination the City improperly commingled the\nBeach Parking Impact Fees with other City revenues. As explained below, we affirm the\njudgment because these claims lack factual or legal merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                               I\n\n                     LEGAL BACKGROUND: THE MITIGATION FEE ACT\n              The Legislature passed the Act “‘in response to concerns among developers\nthat local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to\ndevelopment projects.’” (Ehrlich v. City of Culver City (1996) 12 Cal.4th 854, 864\n(Ehrlich).) The Act creates uniform procedures for local agencies to follow in\nestablishing, imposing, collecting, accounting for, and using development fees. (Centex\nReal Estate Corp. v. City of Vallejo (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1361-1362 (Centex).)\nIn passing the Act, the Legislature found and declared that “untimely or improper\nallocation of development fees hinders economic growth and is, therefore, a matter of\nstatewide interest and concern.” (§ 66006, subd. (e).)\n              The Act defines a development fee as “a monetary exaction other than a tax\nor special assessment . . . that is charged by a local agency to the applicant in connection\nwith approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the\ncost of public facilities related to the development project . . . .” (§ 66000, subd. (b).) “A\nfee shall not include the costs attributable to existing deficiencies in public facilities, but\nmay include the costs attributable to the increased demand for public facilities reasonably\nrelated to the development project in order to (1) refurbish existing facilities to maintain\nthe existing level of service or (2) achieve an adopted level of service that is consistent\nwith the general plan.” (§ 66001, subd. (g).) “‘Public facilities’ includes public\nimprovements, public services, and community amenities.” (§ 66000, subd. (d).)\n              To establish a development fee a local agency must identify “the purpose of\nthe fee” and “the use to which the fee is to be put.” (§ 66001, subd. (a).) The agency\nalso must determine that both “the fee’s use” and “the need for the public facility” are\nreasonably related to “the type of development project on which the fee is imposed.”\n(Ibid.; see Home Builders Assn. of Tulare/Kings Counties, Inc. v. City of Lemoore (2010)\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f185 Cal.App.4th 554, 561 (Home Builders).) “The Act thus codifies, as the statutory\nstandard applicable by definition to nonpossessory monetary exactions, the ‘reasonable\nrelationship’ standard employed in California and elsewhere to measure the validity of\nrequired dedications of land (or fees in lieu of such dedications) that are challenged under\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.” (Ehrlich, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 865.)\n              To impose an established development fee as a condition of approval for a\nspecific development project, a local agency must “determine how there is a reasonable\nrelationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the public facility or portion of\nthe public facility attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed.”\n(§ 66001, subd. (b).) The agency also must “identify the public improvement that the fee\nwill be used to finance.” (§ 66006, subd. (f).)\n              Each development fee a local agency collects must be deposited “in a\nseparate capital facilities account or fund in a manner to avoid any commingling of the\nfees with other revenues and funds of the local agency.” (§§ 66006, subd. (a); 66001,\nsubd. (c).) A local agency must expend all development fees its collects “solely and\nexclusively for the purpose or purposes” the agency identified when it imposed the fee on\na development project (§ 66008; see § 66006, subd. (a)), and the public facilities built or\nestablished with the fee must serve the developments on which the fee was imposed\n(Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 566). A development fee may not be\n“levied, collected, or imposed for general revenue purposes.” (§ 66008; see § 66006,\nsubd. (a).)\n              At the end of each fiscal year, a local agency must separately account for\neach development fee it collected by providing the public certain information, including a\nbrief description of the fee and its amount, the beginning and ending balance of the\naccount in which the fee was deposited, the amount of fees collected and interest earned,\nan identification of each public improvement on which the fee was expended, and an\napproximate date when construction will begin on any incomplete public improvement\n\n                                             5\n\fidentified when the fee was imposed if the agency determines it has collected sufficient\nfunds to finance the identified improvement. (§ 66006, subd. (b)(1).) If the agency does\nnot provide an approximate start date for construction within 180 days of determining it\nhas collected sufficient funds, the agency must refund the unexpended portion of the fee\nand all accrued interest to the current owners of the properties on which the fee was\nimposed. (§ 66001, subd. (e).)\n              For all unexpended development fees, the agency must make findings every\nfifth year that identify how the fee will be used, demonstrate a reasonable relationship\nbetween the fee and the purpose for which it is charged, identify all sources and amounts\nof funding anticipated to complete financing for incomplete improvements that were\nidentified when the fee was established, and designate the approximate dates for that\nfunding to be deposited into a dedicated account. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(1).) The public\nagency must make these findings “in connection with” the annual report the Act requires\nthe agency to provide. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(2).) If these findings are not made, “the local\nagency shall refund the moneys in the account or fund” to the then current owners of the\naffected properties on a prorated basis plus accrued interest. (§ 66001, subds. (d)(2) &\n(e); see Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 565-566.)\n              Any party may protest a local agency’s decision to establish or impose a\ndevelopment fee by tendering any required payment and serving the agency with notice\nof the protest within 90 days of the fee being established or imposed. (§ 66020,\nsubds. (a) & (d)(1).) Any party who timely serves a protest may file an action to “attack,\nreview, set aside, void, or annul” the fee within 180 days of serving that protest.\n(§ 66020, subd. (d)(2).) “Thereafter, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, all\npersons are barred from any action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or\nunreasonableness of the imposition.” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                             II\n\n                            FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n              In the mid-1980’s, several real estate developers proposed large residential\ndevelopments outside the City’s coastal zone that had the potential to nearly double the\nCity’s population. Concerned that those developments east of the Interstate 5 freeway\ncould significantly impact the availability of public beach parking, the City directed the\ndevelopers to prepare a study evaluating the potential problem. The study concluded that\npublic beach parking was at or above capacity on summer weekends and holidays,\n35 percent of beach users were City residents, and the proposed developments in the\nCity’s noncoastal zone would require approximately 360 new parking spaces to maintain\nthe City’s current level of beach parking.\n              Based on the parking study, the City in April 1989 adopted an ordinance\nestablishing the Beach Parking Impact Fee. Under the Act, the City identified the fee’s\npurpose as “mitigat[ing] the impact of the increased demand on beach parking caused by\nnew residential development in that portion of the City of San Clemente which lies\noutside the City’s coastal zone,” and the fee’s use as financing “the acquisition and/or\nconstruction of parking facilities at or near the beach.” The City set the fee at $1,500 per\ndwelling unit, subject to annual adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index, and\nidentified the construction of parking structures at “the Pier Bowl, North Beach, or State\nPark” as the intended new parking facilities.\n              The City collected over $300,000 in the Beach Parking Impact Fee’s first\nyear and continued to collect substantial sums each year as residential development in the\nCity’s noncoastal zone progressed. In 1994, the City used approximately $337,000 in\nBeach Parking Impact Fees, and approximately $138,000 in Local Drainage Fund\nmonies, to purchase a vacant lot on El Camino Real adjacent to the City’s North Beach\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fparking lot. The Local Drainage Fund monies were used because a drainage channel ran\nunder the lot.\n                 In the early 1990’s, the City continued to study the demand for public\nbeach parking and possible remedies. By 1995, these studies determined the parking\nstructures the City originally contemplated were no longer needed because there was a\nsurplus of parking in the City’s North Beach area, beach parking “was in equilibrium at\nthe Pier,” and parking needs in those areas could be satisfied with existing parking\nfacilities and “functional parking improvements.” In April 1996, the City therefore\nadopted an ordinance to reduce the Beach Parking Impact Fee to $750 per dwelling unit,\nsubject to annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. The City maintained\nthe fee’s purpose as “mitigat[ing] the impact of new development on beach parking,” but\nthe City broadened the fee’s use to financing improvements to beach parking. When it\nreduced the Beach Parking Impact Fee, the City already had collected approximately\n$2 million.\n                 The City continued to collect the reduced Beach Parking Impact Fee\nthroughout the 1990’s and the 2000’s, but it did not construct any new public beach\nparking facilities, not even on the vacant lot it purchased near the City’s North Beach\nparking lot. Instead, the City conducted additional studies about the adequacy of its\npublic beach parking. None of these studies identified or predicted the parking shortage\nthe City envisioned when it originally established and began collecting the Beach Parking\nImpact Fee. To the contrary, these studies recognized the City had adequate beach\nparking. The City continued to monitor and study its public beach parking, but it did not\nconstruct any new facilities or make any significant improvements.\n                 In 2004, the City “receive[d] and file[d]” the “Five-Year Required Report\nMitigation Fee Act City of San Clemente” (2004 Five-Year Report). The City’s staff\nprepared the report to comply with the Act’s requirement that the City make findings to\njustify its continued retention of the collected but unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees\n\n                                               8\n\fit had held for more than five years. In 2009, the City again “receive[d] and file[d]” a\n“Five-Year Required Report Mitigation Fee Act City of San Clemente” (2009 Five-Year\nReport) to comply with the Act’s five-year findings requirement. This second report was\nidentical to the first.\n               By the end of 2009, the City’s noncoastal zone was essentially built out and\nthe City had collected nearly $6 million in Beach Parking Impact Fees, plus more than\n$3 million in interest. Nonetheless, the City still had not constructed any new public\nbeach parking facilities, and it did not have a specific plan for using the impact fees.\n               In August 2012, Plaintiffs filed this action for declaratory and mandamus\nrelief to compel the City to refund the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees. Because\nthe statute of limitations expired on any challenge to the City’s decisions to establish and\nimpose the impact fee and impose it on specific development projects, Plaintiffs did not\nchallenge those actions by the City. Instead, Plaintiffs alleged the City must refund the\nBeach Parking Impact Fees because it did not timely use the fees for the designated\npurpose of constructing new beach parking facilities and the City failed to justify its\ncontinued retention of the fees. To the contrary, Plaintiffs alleged the City repeatedly had\ndetermined that there was no need for new beach parking facilities caused by the\ndevelopment of the City’s noncoastal zone and that zone was essentially built out.\nPlaintiffs also claimed the unexpended impact fees must be refunded because the City’s\n2004 Five-Year Report was two years late and its 2009 Five-Year Report failed to make\nthe requisite findings.\n               After a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment against the City and\nordered it to refund the unexpended impact fees to the current owners of the properties on\nwhich the fee had been imposed. The parties estimated the amount of unexpended fees\ntogether with accrued interest totaled approximately $10.5 million, and the judgment\nestablished a formula to determine the refund amount and each owner’s pro rata share.\nThe court found the City must refund the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees\n\n                                              9\n\fbecause (1) the 2009 Five-Year Report failed to make all required findings, and (2) the\nCity’s statements in the 2009 Five-Year Report constituted a determination that the City\nhad sufficient funds to complete the beach parking improvements, but it failed to identify\na start date for the construction of those improvements. The court rejected Plaintiffs’\nclaim the City belatedly adopted the 2004 Five-Year Report because that claim was\ntime-barred based on the four-year catchall statute of limitations in Code of Civil\nProcedure section 343. The court also denied Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling\nthe City to (1) sell the vacant lot it purchased with Beach Parking Impact Fees and\ninclude the sale proceeds in the refund; and (2) repay administrative overhead charges it\nmade against the account holding the Beach Parking Impact Fees. This appeal by the\nCity and Plaintiffs’ cross-appeal followed.\n\n                                              III\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n              A local agency’s establishment of a development fee under the Act is a\nquasi-legislative measure reviewed under the narrow standards applicable to ordinary\nmandamus (Code Civ. Proc., § 1085), as opposed to the broader standards applicable to\nadministrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5). (Home Builders, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at p. 561; Warmington Old Town Associates v. Tustin Unified School\nDist. (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 840, 849 (Warmington); Garrick Development Co. v.\nHayward Unified School Dist. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 320, 328 (Garrick).) Judicial review\nis limited to determining whether the local agency’s action “‘was arbitrary, capricious or\nentirely lacking in evidentiary support, or whether it failed to conform to procedures\nrequired by law.’” (Warmington, at p. 850; see Home Builders, at p. 561.) “The action\nwill be upheld if the [agency] adequately considered all relevant factors and demonstrated\na rational connection between those factors, the choice made, and the purposes of the\n\n                                              10\n\fenabling statute. [Citation.] This issue is a question of law.” (Home Builders, at p. 561.)\n“‘On appeal, we independently review the agency’s decision and apply the same standard\nof review that governs the superior court.’” (SN Sands Corp. v. City and County of San\nFrancisco (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 185, 191 (SN Sands); see Cresta Bella, LP v. Poway\nUnified School Dist. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 438, 451 (Cresta Bella).)\n              Neither the parties nor our own research has disclosed any authority\ndiscussing the standard of review on whether a local agency properly made the five-year\nfindings required under the Act to retain collected but unexpended development fees. We\nconclude the same arbitrary and capricious standard used to review the decisions of a\nlocal agency also applies to the required five-year findings because they constitute a\nquasi-legislative action equivalent to the initial establishment and imposition of the fee.\n              We review de novo any challenge based on an interpretation of the Act’s\nrequirements. (See Warmington, supra, 101 Cal.App.4th at p. 849.) We apply the\nsubstantial evidence standard to review any factual findings the trial court made. (Hensel\nPhelps Construction Co. v. San Diego Unified Port Dist. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1020,\n1029-1030.)\n\nB.     The Trial Court Properly Ordered the City to Refund the Unexpended Beach\n       Parking Impact Fees\n\n       1.     The City Failed to Make the Required Five-Year Findings\n              The City contends its 2009 Five-Year Report contained all the necessary\nfindings the Act required for the City to retain the nearly $10 million in unexpended\nBeach Parking Impact Fees it still held 20 years after it started collecting the fee. We\ndisagree because the City misconstrues both the five-year findings required under the Act\nand the City’s own 2009 Five-Year Report.\n              As explained above, when a local agency has not used all of a development\nfee within five years of the date it started to collect the fee, the agency must make\n\n\n                                             11\n\ffindings that (1) identify the agency’s purpose in holding the unexpended balance;\n(2) demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended balance and the\npurpose identified when the agency assessed the fee; (3) identify the sources and funding\nanticipated to complete any incomplete public improvement identified when the fee was\nestablished; and (4) designate the approximate date the agency expects that funding to be\ndeposited in the account holding the unexpended balance. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(1).) These\nfindings therefore require the local agency to affirmatively demonstrate that it still needs\nthe unexpended fee to achieve the purpose for which it was originally imposed, and that\nthe agency has a plan on how to use the unexpended balance to achieve that purpose.\nThese findings are due at the end of each five-year period if the agency continues to hold\nan unexpended portion of a development fee. (Ibid.) The Act requires the agency to\nrefund the unexpended fees to the current owners of the affected properties if it fails to\nmake the five-year findings. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(2).)\n              The five-year findings requirement establishes “a mechanism . . . to guard\nagainst unjustified fee retention” by a local agency (Home Builders, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at p. 565; see Garrick, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 332), and it ensures\nthe agency “refund[s] any portion of [a development] fee not expended within five years\nunless the local agency can demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the\nunexpended fee and its purpose” (Centex, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1361). The\nLegislative Counsel’s Digest when the Act was initially enacted confirms the requisite\nfive-year findings require a local agency to “reexamine the necessity for the unexpended\nbalance of the fee, as specified, every 5 years, and refund to then current owner or owners\nof the development project any unexpended portion of the fee for which need cannot be\ndemonstrated at the time of this review, together with any accrued interest.” (Legis.\nCounsel’s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1600 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1987, ch. 927,\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fp. 301.)3 This reexamination and refund requirement prevents a local agency from\ncollecting and holding a development fee for an extended period of time without a clear\nand demonstrable plan to use the fee for the purpose it was imposed.\n              Here, the City’s 2009 Five-Year Report failed to make the specific findings\nthe Act required.4 For example, the Act required the City to make a finding\ndemonstrating a reasonable relationship between the unexpended Beach Parking Impact\nFees and the purpose for which the fee was originally charged. (§ 66001,\nsubd. (d)(1)(B).) In an attempt to make that finding, the 2009 Five-Year Report states,\n“New parking facility improvements are determined by the City Engineering department\nand cost estimates established. The fee is calculated based on the number of new\nresidential dwelling units planned through build-out of the City.” This finding fails to\ndiscuss the relationship between the nearly $10 million balance in the Beach Parking\nImpact Fee account and the purpose for which the fee was established, let alone\ndemonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended fees and their purpose.\nThe 2009 Five-Year Report says nothing about any impact residential development in the\nCity’s noncoastal zone has had on the City’s public beach parking 20 years after the City\n\n\n       3       “‘“The Legislative Counsel’s Digest is printed as a preface to every bill\nconsidered by the Legislature.”’” (People v. Vega (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1382.)\nIt “‘constitutes the official summary of the legal effect of the bill and is relied upon by\nthe Legislature throughout the legislative process,’ and thus ‘is recognized as a primary\nindication of legislative intent.’” (In re M.G. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1277, fn. 7.)\n“‘Although the Legislative Counsel’s summary digests are not binding [citation], they are\nentitled to great weight.’” (Mt. Hawley Ins. Co. v. Lopez (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1385,\n1401.)\n       4      Plaintiffs concede the City made findings when it “receive[d] and file[d]”\nthe 2009 Five-Year Report, but argue the findings set forth in that report do not satisfy\nthe Act’s requirements. We accept Plaintiffs’ concession and examine whether the\nfindings in the 2009 Five-Year Report comply with the Act. We express no opinion on\nwhether the City actually made any findings by simply “receiv[ing] and fil[ing]” the\n2009 Five-Year Report the City’s staff prepared.\n\n\n                                            13\n\fstarted collecting the Beach Parking Impact Fee, the current condition of the City’s public\nbeach parking, the status of any of the improvements identified when the City established\nthe fee, or what the City has done in the last 20 years or future plans for public beach\nparking. As the trial court found, the report “dodges the question.”\n              The Act also required the City to make findings that (1) identified the\nsources and funds anticipated to complete financing for incomplete beach parking\nimprovements that were identified when the Beach Parking Impact Fee was established,\nand (2) designated the approximate dates when it anticipates receiving that funding.\n(§ 66001, subd. (d)(1)(C) & (D).) In an effort to make these findings, the 2009 Five-Year\nReport states, “This funding source is anticipated to be sufficient to complete the\nfinancing of identified improvements” and “Not applicable.”5 Neither of these findings\nsatisfies the Act’s requirements. The first finding is sufficient to the extent it limits the\nsources of funding for beach parking improvements to the Beach Parking Impact Fee, but\nthe finding fails to identify the amount of funding needed to complete the improvements\nand generally refers to “identified improvements” without specifying or describing those\nimprovements. The second of these findings also falls short because it fails to designate\nwhen the City anticipates receiving the additional Beach Parking Impact Fees needed to\ncomplete the financing for the incomplete beach parking improvements. The City’s\nfindings simply did not include the findings section 66001, subdivision (d)(1)(C) and (D)\nrequired.\n\n       5        The trial court concluded these two findings meant the City determined it\nhad collected sufficient funds to finance incomplete beach parking improvements\nidentified when the Beach Parking Impact Fee was imposed. Based on that conclusion,\nthe trial court ordered the City to refund the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees\nbecause the City failed to provide an approximate start date for construction of the\nimprovements within 180 days of the 2009 Five-Year Report. (§ 66001, subd. (e).) We\ndo not address this aspect of the trial court’s ruling because the City’s failure to make the\nfive-year findings is sufficient to support the judgment requiring the City to refund the\nunexpended impact fees. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(2).)\n\n\n                                              14\n\f               The City’s findings in the 2009 Five-Year Report, made 20 years after it\nestablished and began collecting the Beach Parking Impact Fee, fail to demonstrate the\nCity still needs the nearly $10 million in fees and interest it collected to address public\nbeach parking issues created by new development in the noncoastal zone. The report also\nfails to show how it will use those funds to address beach parking issues, what\nimprovements the City intends to construct with the funds, the cost of those\nimprovements, whether the City requires more money, and if so, when the City\nanticipates receiving that money. This is information the Act required, but the City failed\nto provide.6\n               The City contends its finding about the relationship between the\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees and the fee’s purpose is adequate because it\n“summarize[s] the methodology the City used in determining the ‘reasonable\nrelationship’ between the [Beach Parking Impact] Fee and the improvements to be\nconstructed with the fee.” According to the City, the Act did not require it to provide any\nfurther detail because the City “was still in the process of identifying specific beach\nparking improvement projects to be funded,” and therefore nothing of any significance\nhad changed since the City made its original findings to support establishing the fee in\n1989 and to support amending it in 1996. Not so.\n               As explained above, the five-year findings requirement imposed a duty on\nthe City to reexamine the need for the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees to finance\n\n\n       6        The City contends the trial court never found the City’s five-year findings\nwere deficient, asserting that the court solely based its judgment on the City’s purported\nfailure to identify a start date for construction within 180 days of the 2009 Five-Year\nReport because the City had collected sufficient funds to finance the projects. We\ndisagree. The trial court clearly found the City failed to make the five-year findings\nrequired by section 66001, subd. (d)(1). Moreover, we review the City’s action, not the\ntrial court’s, and we are not bound or limited by the trial court’s ruling. (SN Sands,\nsupra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 191; Cresta Bella, supra, 218 Cal.App.4th at p. 451.)\n\n\n                                              15\n\fbeach parking improvements that purportedly were required by the new development in\nthe City’s noncoastal zone. The City may not rely on findings it made 20 years earlier to\njustify the original establishment of the Beach Parking Impact Fee, or the findings it\nmade 13 years earlier to justify reducing the amount of the fee. Instead, the Act required\nthe City to make new findings demonstrating a continuing need for beach parking\nimprovements caused by the new development in the noncoastal zone. The City failed to\ndo so.\n              Similarly, the City’s claim it had not yet identified the specific\nimprovements it intended to finance with the Beach Parking Impact Fee does not make\nthe City’s finding adequate. When the City established the Beach Parking Impact Fee in\n1989 the Act required the City to identify how it would use the fee. (§ 66001,\nsubd. (a)(2).) Because that use was financing “the acquisition and/or construction of\nparking facilities at or near the beach,” the Act also required the City to identify the\nfacilities it would acquire or construct. The City could have generally identified by type\nor category the public facilities it intended to acquire or construct, but specific\nconstruction or improvement plans were not required. (Home Builders, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 564-565; Garrick, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 335.) Starting in\n1997, the Act also required the City to identify the public improvement that the fee would\nfinance each time the City imposed the Beach Parking Impact Fee as a condition of\napproval for a specific development project. (§ 66006, subd. (f); Stats. 1996, ch. 569\n(S.B. 1693), § 2, p. 3182.) Accordingly, in 2009, the City could not claim it did not know\nwhat projects it intended to finance with the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees and\ncontinue to retain those fees.7\n\n         7    We express no opinion on whether the City could have satisfied the Act’s\nfive-year findings requirement by claiming beach parking conditions had changed and\ntherefore the City was studying whether it could satisfy the purpose of the assessment by\nfinancing different projects. The City’s findings would have to explain that situation, but\nthe 2009 Five-Year Report provides no such explanation.\n\n\n                                              16\n\f              The City also contends the 2009 Five-Year Report’s findings about the\nsource and amount of additional funding and the approximate date on which it would\nreceive that funding complied with the Act’s requirements. According to the City, the\nAct did not require it to specify the amount of additional funding it anticipated needing or\nwhen it would receive that funding because the City “had not yet identified or prepared\ncost estimates for the specific parking improvement projects it was planning to\nconstruct.” We disagree. The Act clearly required a finding that “identif[ied] all sources\nand amounts of funding anticipated to complete financing in incomplete improvements.”\n(§ 66001, subd. (d)(1)(C).) The Act provides no exceptions or limitations on this\nrequired finding. Moreover, as explained above, the Act required the City to identify the\npublic facilities it intended to finance with the Beach Parking Impact Fee when it\noriginally established the fee in 1989. (§ 66001, subd. (a)(2).) Starting in 1997, the Act\nalso required the City to identify the public improvement it intended to finance with the\nBeach Parking Impact Fee each time it imposed the fee as a condition of approval for a\nspecific development project. (§ 66006, subd. (f); Stats. 1996, ch. 569 (S.B. 1693), § 2,\np. 3182.) Accordingly, the Act does not allow the City to identify no public improvement\nprojects it intends to finance with the Beach Parking Impact Fee 20 years after\nestablishing the fee and still retain the unexpended balance.\n\n       2.     A Refund Is the Statutorily-Mandated Remedy\n              The City contends the trial court should have remanded the matter to the\nCity to make new findings correcting the “technical deficienc[ies]” in the City’s five-year\nfindings rather than requiring the City to forfeit the unexpended impact fees that the City\nproperly had collected. The Act’s plain language prohibits this remedy.\n              Section 66001, subdivision (d)(2), unmistakably declares, “If the findings\nare not made as required by this subdivision, the local agency shall refund the moneys in\nthe account or fund.” (Italics added.) A statute’s clear and unambiguous language\n\n\n                                            17\n\fcontrols, and therefore we need not resort to extrinsic sources or rules of statutory\ninterpretation to determine the statute’s meaning. (Huntington Continental Townhouse\nAssociation, Inc. v. Miner (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 590, 598-599; People v. Pellecer\n(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 508, 512.) In any event, the Act’s legislative history repeatedly\nconfirms that in passing section 66001, subdivision (d), the Legislature intended that a\nlocal agency must refund unexpended development fees if the agency failed to make the\nrequired five-year findings. (See, e.g., Legis. Counsel’s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1600\n(1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1987, ch. 927, p. 301; Legis. Counsel’s Dig., Sen. Bill\nNo. 1693 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) 6 Stats. 1996, ch. 569, pp. 214-215.)\n              The City does not claim section 66001, subdivision (d), is ambiguous, nor\ndoes the City cite to any other provision of the Act or its legislative history that allows\nany remedy other than a refund when a local agency fails to make the required five-year\nfindings. Instead, the City claims a remand is ordinarily the remedy ordered when a local\nagency applies an incorrect legal standard (see SN Sands, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at\np. 194) or fails to make “required legislative findings” (see Manufactured Home\nCommunities, Inc. v. County of San Luis Obispo (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 705, 715\n(Manufactured Home); Respers v. University of Cal. Retirement System (1985)\n171 Cal.App.3d 864, 873 (Respers); Mountain Defense League v. Board of Supervisors\n(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 723, 731-732 (Mountain Defense); Hadley v. City of Ontario\n(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 121, 128-130 (Hadley)). What may or may not be the ordinary\nremedy, however, is irrelevant when the Legislature unambiguously establishes the\nstatutory remedy for a violation of its laws.\n              Moreover, the cases on which the City relies do not apply to the current\nfacts. SN Sands does not apply here because the City did not use an incorrect legal\nstandard in making its five-year findings. The City properly identified the findings the\nAct required it to make, but simply failed to make those specific findings.\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f              Manufactured Home, Respers, Mountain Defense, and Hadley do not apply\nbecause they involve administrative mandamus proceedings under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1094.5 (section 1094.5) rather than traditional mandamus proceedings\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (section 1085). (Manufactured Home,\nsupra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 710; Respers, supra, 171 Cal.App.3d at p. 870-871;\nMountain Defense, supra, 65 Cal.App.3d at pp. 731-732; Hadley, supra, 43 Cal.App.3d\nat pp. 127-130.) In administrative mandamus proceedings, a court reviews a public\nagency’s adjudicatory decision to determine whether the evidence supports the agency’s\nfindings and whether the agency’s findings support its ultimate decision. Section 1094.5\nrequires the agency to make findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence\nand the ultimate decision. When a public agency fails to make findings to support its\ndecision, remand is an appropriate remedy because a court cannot review the agency’s\ndecision without knowing how it analyzed the evidence to reach its decision. (See, e.g.,\nHadley, at pp. 127-128.)\n              As explained above, however, judicial review under section 1085 is much\nmore limited: a court does not review the agency’s analytical route, but rather defers to\nthe agency’s decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or totally lacking in evidentiary\nsupport. (Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 561.) Section 1085 does not\nrequire an agency to make findings to support its legislative and quasi-legislative\ndecisions unless another statute specifically requires findings. (Anaheim Redevelopment\nAgency v. Dusek (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 249, 261.) Here, section 66001, subdivision (d),\nrequired the City to make findings to support its quasi-legislative decision to retain the\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees, and that statute also specified the remedy for the\nCity’s failure to do so. Case law allowing a remand in a different legal context does not\npermit us to disregard that statute’s clear mandate. (See Garrick, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at\np. 328 [“‘precedents drawn from administrative mandamus proceedings should probably\nstill be applied with caution to the review of findings in a quasi-legislative context.\n\n                                              19\n\fProcedural or evidentiary requirements drawn from analogy to judicial proceedings\nwould appear peculiarly inappropriate . . .’”].)\n              The City also argues the trial court should have remanded the matter for the\nCity to correct its findings because the law abhors forfeitures and therefore requires\nstatutes imposing them to be strictly construed. (See Enfantino v. Superior Court (1984)\n162 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1113; Hernandez v. Temple (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 286, 290.)\nAlthough it is true forfeitures are disfavored, it does not logically follow that forfeitures\nare unenforceable. To the contrary, courts must enforce unambiguous statutory\nforfeitures and may not avoid them by rewriting the statute under the guise of statutory\nconstruction. (People v. Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th\n823, 829-830.) Assuming section 66001, subdivision (d)’s refund provision constitutes a\nforfeiture, the City offers no strict or other construction of the provision that would allow\nthe City to avoid refunding the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees based on its\nfailure to make the required five-year findings.\n              Finally, the City contends section 66001, subdivision (d)(2), does not apply\nbecause the City made findings and we simply have concluded those findings were\ninsufficient. According to the City, section 66001, subdivision (d)(2), requires a refund\nonly when a local agency fails to make any findings. Not so. Section 66001,\nsubdivision (d)(2), requires a refund when “the findings are not made as required by this\nsubdivision.” (Italics added.) For example, the subdivision required the City to\nspecifically demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended development\nfee and the purpose for which the fee was charged. As explained above, the City’s\nfindings do not identify any relationship between the unexpended Beach Parking Impact\nFees and the purpose for which the fee was charged, let alone a reasonable relationship.\nThe City therefore did not make findings “as required by this subdivision,” and the\nstatute requires the City to refund the unexpended impact fees. If we accepted the City’s\ncontention, a local agency could avoid refunding unexpended development fees by\n\n                                              20\n\fmaking any findings no matter how inadequate, and the only repercussion would be\nanother opportunity to repeat the process. That is not what the statute’s clear language\nrequires.\n\nC.     Plaintiffs’ Appeal From the Trial Court’s Judgment Lacks Merit\n              Although the trial court entered judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor and ordered\nthe City to refund the entire unexpended balance of the Beach Parking Impact Fee,\nPlaintiffs also appealed from the judgment. They argue the trial court erroneously denied\nadditional relief they sought. We find these claims unpersuasive.\n\n       1.     The Statute of Limitations Barred Plaintiffs’ Claims Regarding the\n              2004 Five-Year Report\n              Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the four-year limitations\nperiod in Code of Civil Procedure section 343 barred Plaintiffs’ challenges to the City’s\n2004 Five-Year Report. Plaintiffs, however, do not contend the trial court applied the\nwrong limitations period or miscalculated when that period expired. Instead, Plaintiffs\ncontend the trial court erred in failing to apply the equitable doctrines of estoppel and\nunjust enrichment to prevent the City from asserting the statute of limitations as a\ndefense. Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden of establishing error.\n              A party may be equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations when\nhis or her conduct induced another not to file a lawsuit within the applicable limitations\nperiod. (Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005)\n132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1089.) Plaintiffs, however, point to no conduct by the City during\nthe applicable limitations period that induced them not to bring an action challenging the\n2004 Five-Year Report. The only conduct by the City that Plaintiffs identify is a letter\nfrom the City’s attorney that stated the City filed the 2004 Five-Year Report in 2003, but\nthat letter was sent in 2012 — several years after the limitations period already had\nexpired.\n\n\n                                             21\n\f               Plaintiffs similarly fail to explain how applying the statute of limitations\nunjustly enriched the City. The trial court ordered the City to refund the unexpended\nBeach Parking Impact Fees based on other claims, and therefore the trial court’s\napplication of the statute of limitations does not unjustly enrich the City.\n\n       2.     The City’s Deficient Five-Year Findings Do Not Require the City to Sell\n              the Vacant Lot It Purchased With Beach Parking Impact Fees\n               Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in denying their request to compel the\nCity to sell the vacant lot it purchased adjacent to its North Beach parking lot and refund\nthe sale proceeds to the affected property owners. According to Plaintiffs, the Act\nrequired the City to use the Beach Parking Impact Fee for the designated purpose of\nacquiring and constructing public beach parking, but the City’s purchase of a vacant lot\nfailed to further the purpose of the fee because the City did nothing with the lot for\napproximately 20 years. Plaintiffs, however, fail to cite any authority that would have\nallowed the trial court to order the City to sell the lot.\n               When a local agency fails to make the required five-year findings,\nsection 66001, subdivision (d)(2), requires the agency to “refund the moneys in the\naccount or fund as provided in subdivision (e).” Section 66001, subdivision (e), provides\nthat the local agency shall refund “the unexpended portion of the fee, and any interest\naccrued thereon” to “the then current record owner or owners of the lots or units, as\nidentified on the last equalized assessment roll.” (Italics added.)\n               Here, the vacant lot the City purchased is not an “unexpended portion” of\nthe Beach Parking Impact Fee. To the contrary, the City expended a portion of the\nimpact fee to purchase the lot and Plaintiffs concede no one challenged that purchase.\nNothing in the Act or any other authority Plaintiffs have cited authorized the trial court to\norder the City to undo what was at the time a valid use of the impact fees. The City has\nnot yet constructed any public beach parking on the vacant lot, but it also has not used the\nlot for any purpose inconsistent with public beach parking.\n\n                                               22\n\f              The only limitation the Act places on the use of a development fee is the\nrequirement that the local agency use the fee “solely and exclusively for the purpose or\npurposes . . . for which the fee was collected.” (§ 66008; see § 66006, subd. (a).)\nPlaintiffs failed to show the City violated this command or that a compelled sale of the\nvacant lot is the appropriate remedy for the City’s failure to construct beach parking on\nthe lot over the past 20 years. If the City seeks to use the vacant lot in the future for a\npurpose inconsistent with the Beach Parking Impact Fee’s purpose, Plaintiffs then may\nchallenge the City’s action.\n\n       3.     The Act Did Not Prohibit the City From Charging the Administrative\n              Overhead Costs Associated With the Beach Parking Impact Fee\n              Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in refusing to order the City to return\nadministrative overhead costs it charged the account holding the impact fees. In\nPlaintiffs’ view, the City must return these administrative costs before it refunds the\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees because the Act required the City to use the\nimpact fees exclusively for acquiring and constructing public beach parking, and that\npurpose does not include paying administrative overhead costs. We do not find this\nargument persuasive.\n              The Act requires a local agency to expend development fees “solely and\nexclusively for the purpose or purposes . . . for which the fee was collected” and prohibits\nan agency from levying, collecting, or imposing a development fee “for general revenue\npurposes.” (§ 66008; see § 66006, subd. (a).) The parties cite nothing in the Act or its\nhistory that guides us in determining what it means to use a fee exclusively for a specific\npurpose, and we have uncovered no authority that sheds any light on the subject.\n              Nonetheless, we conclude using a portion of a development fee to facilitate\ncompliance with the Act’s requirements constitutes a use that furthers the purpose for\nwhich the fee was collected. For example, the Act requires that a local agency establish a\nseparate account for each development fee it collects and account for the fee to ensure it\n\n                                              23\n\fis not commingled with any of the agency’s other funds. The administrative costs to\ncomply with these requirements further the purpose for which the fee was collected\nbecause those costs ensure the fee is available for the designated purpose once sufficient\nfunds are collected. Indeed, without the administrative costs of accounting for the fee,\nthe local agency would not know how much it has collected.\n              Here, the City established a cost allocation plan and began charging many\nof the programs it runs for the administrative costs associated with the programs. For\nexample, the City established a formula for charging each program for the accounting\nservices required to maintain the program’s accounts and also for any other services the\nCity’s staff provided. The City worked with an independent consultant to create its cost\nallocation plan and it annually reviews the allocations for accuracy. The City’s financial\nservices officer testified the charges made against the Beach Parking Impact Fee account\nwere allocated to pay for staff time and other costs associated with maintaining the\naccount, accounting for the funds, and other administrative expenses directly related to\nthe Beach Parking Impact Fee.\n              Plaintiffs point to nothing in the administrative record that shows the City\nused any portion of the Beach Parking Impact Fee for general revenue purposes. Indeed,\nPlaintiffs do not challenge the reasonableness or the necessity for any of the\nadministrative costs the City charged. Plaintiffs simply argue no portion of a\ndevelopment fee may be used to pay administrative costs as a matter of law. We decline\nto impose such a broad prohibition without some clear basis in the Act, and Plaintiffs\nhave pointed to none.\n              Plaintiffs contend the only administrative costs expressly permitted under\nthe Act are the costs associated with conducting the public hearing required to establish\nthe fee. (See § 66018, subd. (b).) According to Plaintiffs, the Legislature authorizing a\nlocal agency to recover those specific administrative costs prevents an agency from using\na portion of a development fee to pay any other administrative costs. Not so.\n\n                                            24\n\f              Although Plaintiffs do not cite any legal authority or identify a principle of\nstatutory interpretation to support their construction of the Act, Plaintiffs implicitly rely\non the statutory interpretation maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, “which means\n‘“the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other\nthings not expressed.”’” (In re Sabrina H. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1411.) This\nmaxim is “a ‘mere guide’ to be utilized when a statute is ambiguous”; it “‘is no magical\nincantation, nor does it refer to an immutable rule.’” (Ibid.; see In re Christopher T.\n(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1290.) It “is generally applied to a specific statute [that]\ncontains a listing of items to which the statute applies” and prevents courts from implying\nadditional exceptions to a general rule when a statute specifies other exceptions.\n(Sabrina H., at p. 1411; see Christopher T., at p. 1290.) The maxim, however, “does not\napply when no reasonable inference exists that items not mentioned were excluded by\ndeliberate choice.” (Silverbrand v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 46 Cal.4th 106, 126;\nsee Barragan v. Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1484, fn. 3.)\n              Here, Plaintiffs point to nothing in the Act or its history that shows the\nLegislature intended to prohibit a local agency from using a portion of a development fee\nto pay administrative costs directly related to the fee and the agency’s compliance with\nthe Act. Section 66008’s mandate that a local agency use a development fee exclusively\nfor the purpose for which the fee was collected and Section 66018’s authorization to use\na portion of a fee to recover the cost of conducting the public hearing required to\nestablish the development fee are found in separate parts of the Act. Section 66008 is\npart of a chapter in the Government Code that solely addresses a local agency’s\nestablishment, imposition, and use of development fees (§§ 66000-66008), and\nsection 66018 is part of a separate chapter that addresses procedures for a local agency to\nadopt a variety of different types of fees and charges (§§ 66016-66019). Moreover, in\nconcluding the City may recover administrative overheard related directly to the Beach\nParking Impact Fee, we are not creating an exception to section 66008’s limitation on the\n\n                                              25\n\fuse of a development fee; rather, we merely are interpreting what the Legislature meant\nwhen it stated a fee shall be expended “solely and exclusively for the purpose or purposes\n. . . for which the fee was collected.” Accordingly, the maxim of expressio unius est\nexclusio alterius has no application here and the trial court did not err in refusing to\nrequire the City to reimburse the Beach Parking Impact Fee account for the\nadministrative overhead costs the City incurred.\n\n       4.     Plaintiffs Failed to Establish the City Improperly Commingled Beach\n              Parking Impact Fees With Other City Revenues\n              Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the City did not improperly\ncommingle the Beach Parking Impact Fee funds with other City funds. Although\nPlaintiffs concede this challenge “does not affect the refund,” they nonetheless contend\nthe trial court should have ordered the City to segregate the impact fees from other City\nfunds because the Act prohibits a local agency from commingling a development fee with\nother revenues. This contention lacks merit because substantial evidence supports the\ntrial court’s finding the City did not commingle the funds.\n              Section 66006, subdivision (a), provides, “the local agency receiving the\n[development] fee shall deposit it with the other fees for the improvement in a separate\ncapital facilities account or fund in a manner to avoid any commingling of the fees with\nother revenues and funds of the local agency.” To comply with this mandate, a local\nagency must deposit a development fee “into ‘a separate capital facilities account’ to\navoid commingling with the local agency’s other revenues and funds.” (Home Builders,\nsupra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 561.)\n              The City’s financial services officer testified the Beach Parking Impact Fee\nis collected from a developer as part of a lump sum payment to cover four separate\ndevelopment fees. Upon receipt, the City places the funds into a “Public Facilities\nConstruction Fee Fund” and separates the funds into four separate accounts for each of\nthe development fees. The funds in each account are tracked separately and not\n\n                                              26\n\fcommingled. According to the financial services officer, the “Public Facilities\nConstruction Fee Fund” consolidates the four accounts for financial reporting purposes\nonly, but the accounts are maintained separately. This testimony constitutes substantial\nevidence supporting the trial court’s ruling. (See, e.g., WorldMark, The Club v.\nWyndham Resort Development Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1029 [“‘Substantial\nevidence is evidence that is “reasonable, credible, and of solid value”; such that a\nreasonable trier of fact could make such findings. [Citation.] [¶] It is axiomatic that an\nappellate court defers to the trier of fact on such determinations, and has no power to\njudge the effect or value of, or to weigh the evidence; to consider the credibility of\nwitnesses; or to resolve conflicts in, or make inferences or deductions from the\nevidence’”].)\n\n                                              IV\n                                         DISPOSITION\n\n                The judgment is affirmed.

Code, § 66000 et seq.; Act)1 authorizes a\nlocal agency to impose fees on specific development projects to defray the cost of new or\nadditional public facilities that are needed to serve those developments. The Act\nestablishes a variety of requirements to ensure local agencies timely use these fees to pay\nfor public facilities that serve those very developments rather than divert the fees for\ngeneral revenue purposes. For example, when establishing a development fee, a local\nagency must identify both how it will use the fee and the relationship between its use and\nthe developments on which the fee is imposed. Moreover, the local agency must make\nnew findings every five years to justify its continued retention of any fees it has collected\nbut failed to use. If the agency does not make these five-year findings, the Act requires\nthe agency to refund the unused fees to the current owners of the affected properties.\n              In 1989, defendant and appellant City of San Clemente (City)2 created the\n“Beach Parking Impact Fee” because the City anticipated that substantial residential\ndevelopment proposed for the City’s inland areas would significantly increase the\ndemand for public parking at the City’s beaches. The City therefore imposed the Beach\nParking Impact Fee on all new residential developments outside the City’s coastal zone to\ndefray the cost of acquiring and constructing new beach parking facilities. Between 1989\nand 2009, the City collected nearly $10 million in Beach Parking Impact Fees and\naccrued interest, but the City spent less than $350,000 to purchase a vacant parcel on\nwhich it has not constructed any parking facilities.\n              Plaintiffs and respondents Daniel Walker, as Trustee for the 1997 Walker\nFamily Trust, and W. Justin McCarthy (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action to compel\n\n\n          1   All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nstated.\n          2   The City Council of San Clemente also is a defendant and appellant, but we\nsimply refer to the City for ease of reference.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fthe City to refund the unused portion of the Beach Parking Impact Fee. Plaintiffs alleged\nthe five-year findings the City made in 2009 failed to satisfy the Act’s requirements and\ndid not justify the City’s continued retention of the unexpended Beach Parking Impact\nFees because the increased parking demand had not materialized over the ensuing\n20 years. The trial court agreed and entered judgment ordering the City to refund\napproximately $10.5 million in unexpended impact fees to the current property owners on\nwhich the fees were imposed.\n              We affirm because the City failed to make the five-year findings the Act\nrequired and the statutorily-mandated remedy for that failure is the refund of all\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees. The City contends it satisfied the Act’s\nrequirement of five-year findings when it “receive[d] and file[d]” a 2009 staff report. We\ndisagree. The report’s findings were mere conclusions, not the specific findings required\nunder the Act. Consequently, the City failed to justify its continued retention of the\nunexpended impact fees.\n              Plaintiffs also appeal, challenging the trial court’s decision to deny\n(1) Plaintiffs’ claim the five-year findings the City made in 2004 were untimely;\n(2) Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling the City to sell the vacant lot it purchased\nand refund the sale proceeds with the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees;\n(3) Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling the City to reimburse the Beach Parking\nImpact Fee account for the administrative overhead costs the City charged; and\n(4) Plaintiffs’ request for a judicial determination the City improperly commingled the\nBeach Parking Impact Fees with other City revenues. As explained below, we affirm the\njudgment because these claims lack factual or legal merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                               I\n\n                     LEGAL BACKGROUND: THE MITIGATION FEE ACT\n              The Legislature passed the Act “‘in response to concerns among developers\nthat local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to\ndevelopment projects.’” (Ehrlich v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1361-1362 (Centex).)\nIn passing the Act, the Legislature found and declared that “untimely or improper\nallocation of development fees hinders economic growth and is, therefore, a matter of\nstatewide interest and concern.” (§ 66006, subd. (e).)\n              The Act defines a development fee as “a monetary exaction other than a tax\nor special assessment . . . that is charged by a local agency to the applicant in connection\nwith approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the\ncost of public facilities related to the development project . . . .” (§ 66000, subd. (b).) “A\nfee shall not include the costs attributable to existing deficiencies in public facilities, but\nmay include the costs attributable to the increased demand for public facilities reasonably\nrelated to the development project in order to (1) refurbish existing facilities to maintain\nthe existing level of service or (2) achieve an adopted level of service that is consistent\nwith the general plan.” (§ 66001, subd. (g).) “‘Public facilities’ includes public\nimprovements, public services, and community amenities.” (§ 66000, subd. (d).)\n              To establish a development fee a local agency must identify “the purpose of\nthe fee” and “the use to which the fee is to be put.” (§ 66001, subd. (a).) The agency\nalso must determine that both “the fee’s use” and “the need for the public facility” are\nreasonably related to “the type of development project on which the fee is imposed.”\n(Ibid.; see Home Builders Assn. of Tulare/Kings Counties, Inc. v. City of Lemoore (2010)\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2265155\"><a href=\"/opinion/2265155/home-builders-assn-of-tularekings-counties-inc-v-city-of-lemoore/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(b).) The agency also must “identify the public improvement that the fee\nwill be used to finance.” (§ 66006, subd. (f).)\n              Each development fee a local agency collects must be deposited “in a\nseparate capital facilities account or fund in a manner to avoid any commingling of the\nfees with other revenues and funds of the local agency.” (§§ 66006, subd. (a); 66001,\nsubd. (c).) A local agency must expend all development fees its collects “solely and\nexclusively for the purpose or purposes” the agency identified when it imposed the fee on\na development project (§ 66008; see § 66006, subd. (a)), and the public facilities built or\nestablished with the fee must serve the developments on which the fee was imposed\n(Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 566). A development fee may not be\n“levied, collected, or imposed for general revenue purposes.” (§ 66008; see § 66006,\nsubd. (a).)\n              At the end of each fiscal year, a local agency must separately account for\neach development fee it collected by providing the public certain information, including a\nbrief description of the fee and its amount, the beginning and ending balance of the\naccount in which the fee was deposited, the amount of fees collected and interest earned,\nan identification of each public improvement on which the fee was expended, and an\napproximate date when construction will begin on any incomplete public improvement\n\n                                             5\n\fidentified when the fee was imposed if the agency determines it has collected sufficient\nfunds to finance the identified improvement. (§ 66006, subd. (b)(1).) If the agency does\nnot provide an approximate start date for construction within 180 days of determining it\nhas collected sufficient funds, the agency must refund the unexpended portion of the fee\nand all accrued interest to the current owners of the properties on which the fee was\nimposed. (§ 66001, subd. (e).)\n              For all unexpended development fees, the agency must make findings every\nfifth year that identify how the fee will be used, demonstrate a reasonable relationship\nbetween the fee and the purpose for which it is charged, identify all sources and amounts\nof funding anticipated to complete financing for incomplete improvements that were\nidentified when the fee was established, and designate the approximate dates for that\nfunding to be deposited into a dedicated account. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(1).) The public\nagency must make these findings “in connection with” the annual report the Act requires\nthe agency to provide. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(2).) If these findings are not made, “the local\nagency shall refund the moneys in the account or fund” to the then current owners of the\naffected properties on a prorated basis plus accrued interest. (§ 66001, subds. (d)(2) &\n(e); see Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 565-566.)\n              Any party may protest a local agency’s decision to establish or impose a\ndevelopment fee by tendering any required payment and serving the agency with notice\nof the protest within 90 days of the fee being established or imposed. (§ 66020,\nsubds. (a) & (d)(1).) Any party who timely serves a protest may file an action to “attack,\nreview, set aside, void, or annul” the fee within 180 days of serving that protest.\n(§ 66020, subd. (d)(2).) “Thereafter, notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, all\npersons are barred from any action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or\nunreasonableness of the imposition.” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                             II\n\n                            FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n              In the mid-1980’s, several real estate developers proposed large residential\ndevelopments outside the City’s coastal zone that had the potential to nearly double the\nCity’s population. Concerned that those developments east of the Interstate 5 freeway\ncould significantly impact the availability of public beach parking, the City directed the\ndevelopers to prepare a study evaluating the potential problem. The study concluded that\npublic beach parking was at or above capacity on summer weekends and holidays,\n35 percent of beach users were City residents, and the proposed developments in the\nCity’s noncoastal zone would require approximately 360 new parking spaces to maintain\nthe City’s current level of beach parking.\n              Based on the parking study, the City in April 1989 adopted an ordinance\nestablishing the Beach Parking Impact Fee. Under the Act, the City identified the fee’s\npurpose as “mitigat[ing] the impact of the increased demand on beach parking caused by\nnew residential development in that portion of the City of San Clemente which lies\noutside the City’s coastal zone,” and the fee’s use as financing “the acquisition and/or\nconstruction of parking facilities at or near the beach.” The City set the fee at $1,500 per\ndwelling unit, subject to annual adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index, and\nidentified the construction of parking structures at “the Pier Bowl, North Beach, or State\nPark” as the intended new parking facilities.\n              The City collected over $300,000 in the Beach Parking Impact Fee’s first\nyear and continued to collect substantial sums each year as residential development in the\nCity’s noncoastal zone progressed. In 1994, the City used approximately $337,000 in\nBeach Parking Impact Fees, and approximately $138,000 in Local Drainage Fund\nmonies, to purchase a vacant lot on El Camino Real adjacent to the City’s North Beach\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fparking lot. The Local Drainage Fund monies were used because a drainage channel ran\nunder the lot.\n                 In the early 1990’s, the City continued to study the demand for public\nbeach parking and possible remedies. By 1995, these studies determined the parking\nstructures the City originally contemplated were no longer needed because there was a\nsurplus of parking in the City’s North Beach area, beach parking “was in equilibrium at\nthe Pier,” and parking needs in those areas could be satisfied with existing parking\nfacilities and “functional parking improvements.” In April 1996, the City therefore\nadopted an ordinance to reduce the Beach Parking Impact Fee to $750 per dwelling unit,\nsubject to annual adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. The City maintained\nthe fee’s purpose as “mitigat[ing] the impact of new development on beach parking,” but\nthe City broadened the fee’s use to financing improvements to beach parking. When it\nreduced the Beach Parking Impact Fee, the City already had collected approximately\n$2 million.\n                 The City continued to collect the reduced Beach Parking Impact Fee\nthroughout the 1990’s and the 2000’s, but it did not construct any new public beach\nparking facilities, not even on the vacant lot it purchased near the City’s North Beach\nparking lot. Instead, the City conducted additional studies about the adequacy of its\npublic beach parking. None of these studies identified or predicted the parking shortage\nthe City envisioned when it originally established and began collecting the Beach Parking\nImpact Fee. To the contrary, these studies recognized the City had adequate beach\nparking. The City continued to monitor and study its public beach parking, but it did not\nconstruct any new facilities or make any significant improvements.\n                 In 2004, the City “receive[d] and file[d]” the “Five-Year Required Report\nMitigation Fee Act City of San Clemente” (2004 Five-Year Report). The City’s staff\nprepared the report to comply with the Act’s requirement that the City make findings to\njustify its continued retention of the collected but unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees\n\n                                               8\n\fit had held for more than five years. In 2009, the City again “receive[d] and file[d]” a\n“Five-Year Required Report Mitigation Fee Act City of San Clemente” (2009 Five-Year\nReport) to comply with the Act’s five-year findings requirement. This second report was\nidentical to the first.\n               By the end of 2009, the City’s noncoastal zone was essentially built out and\nthe City had collected nearly $6 million in Beach Parking Impact Fees, plus more than\n$3 million in interest. Nonetheless, the City still had not constructed any new public\nbeach parking facilities, and it did not have a specific plan for using the impact fees.\n               In August 2012, Plaintiffs filed this action for declaratory and mandamus\nrelief to compel the City to refund the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees. Because\nthe statute of limitations expired on any challenge to the City’s decisions to establish and\nimpose the impact fee and impose it on specific development projects, Plaintiffs did not\nchallenge those actions by the City. Instead, Plaintiffs alleged the City must refund the\nBeach Parking Impact Fees because it did not timely use the fees for the designated\npurpose of constructing new beach parking facilities and the City failed to justify its\ncontinued retention of the fees. To the contrary, Plaintiffs alleged the City repeatedly had\ndetermined that there was no need for new beach parking facilities caused by the\ndevelopment of the City’s noncoastal zone and that zone was essentially built out.\nPlaintiffs also claimed the unexpended impact fees must be refunded because the City’s\n2004 Five-Year Report was two years late and its 2009 Five-Year Report failed to make\nthe requisite findings.\n               After a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment against the City and\nordered it to refund the unexpended impact fees to the current owners of the properties on\nwhich the fee had been imposed. The parties estimated the amount of unexpended fees\ntogether with accrued interest totaled approximately $10.5 million, and the judgment\nestablished a formula to determine the refund amount and each owner’s pro rata share.\nThe court found the City must refund the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees\n\n                                              9\n\fbecause (1) the 2009 Five-Year Report failed to make all required findings, and (2) the\nCity’s statements in the 2009 Five-Year Report constituted a determination that the City\nhad sufficient funds to complete the beach parking improvements, but it failed to identify\na start date for the construction of those improvements. The court rejected Plaintiffs’\nclaim the City belatedly adopted the 2004 Five-Year Report because that claim was\ntime-barred based on the four-year catchall statute of limitations in Code of Civil\nProcedure section 343. The court also denied Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling\nthe City to (1) sell the vacant lot it purchased with Beach Parking Impact Fees and\ninclude the sale proceeds in the refund; and (2) repay administrative overhead charges it\nmade against the account holding the Beach Parking Impact Fees. This appeal by the\nCity and Plaintiffs’ cross-appeal followed.\n\n                                              III\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nA.

The Trial Court Properly Ordered the City to Refund the Unexpended Beach\n       Parking Impact Fees\n\n       1.     The City Failed to Make the Required Five-Year Findings\n              The City contends its 2009 Five-Year Report contained all the necessary\nfindings the Act required for the City to retain the nearly $10 million in unexpended\nBeach Parking Impact Fees it still held 20 years after it started collecting the fee. We\ndisagree because the City misconstrues both the five-year findings required under the Act\nand the City’s own 2009 Five-Year Report.\n              As explained above, when a local agency has not used all of a development\nfee within five years of the date it started to collect the fee, the agency must make\n\n\n                                             11\n\ffindings that (1) identify the agency’s purpose in holding the unexpended balance;\n(2) demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended balance and the\npurpose identified when the agency assessed the fee; (3) identify the sources and funding\nanticipated to complete any incomplete public improvement identified when the fee was\nestablished; and (4) designate the approximate date the agency expects that funding to be\ndeposited in the account holding the unexpended balance. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(1).) These\nfindings therefore require the local agency to affirmatively demonstrate that it still needs\nthe unexpended fee to achieve the purpose for which it was originally imposed, and that\nthe agency has a plan on how to use the unexpended balance to achieve that purpose.\nThese findings are due at the end of each five-year period if the agency continues to hold\nan unexpended portion of a development fee. (Ibid.) The Act requires the agency to\nrefund the unexpended fees to the current owners of the affected properties if it fails to\nmake the five-year findings. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(2).)\n              The five-year findings requirement establishes “a mechanism . . . to guard\nagainst unjustified fee retention” by a local agency (Home Builders, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at p. 565; see Garrick, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 332), and it ensures\nthe agency “refund[s] any portion of [a development] fee not expended within five years\nunless the local agency can demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the\nunexpended fee and its purpose” (Centex, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1361). The\nLegislative Counsel’s Digest when the Act was initially enacted confirms the requisite\nfive-year findings require a local agency to “reexamine the necessity for the unexpended\nbalance of the fee, as specified, every 5 years, and refund to then current owner or owners\nof the development project any unexpended portion of the fee for which need cannot be\ndemonstrated at the time of this review, together with any accrued interest.” (Legis.\nCounsel’s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1600 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1987, ch. 927,\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fp. 301.)3 This reexamination and refund requirement prevents a local agency from\ncollecting and holding a development fee for an extended period of time without a clear\nand demonstrable plan to use the fee for the purpose it was imposed.\n              Here, the City’s 2009 Five-Year Report failed to make the specific findings\nthe Act required.4 For example, the Act required the City to make a finding\ndemonstrating a reasonable relationship between the unexpended Beach Parking Impact\nFees and the purpose for which the fee was originally charged. (§ 66001,\nsubd. (d)(1)(B).) In an attempt to make that finding, the 2009 Five-Year Report states,\n“New parking facility improvements are determined by the City Engineering department\nand cost estimates established. The fee is calculated based on the number of new\nresidential dwelling units planned through build-out of the City.” This finding fails to\ndiscuss the relationship between the nearly $10 million balance in the Beach Parking\nImpact Fee account and the purpose for which the fee was established, let alone\ndemonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended fees and their purpose.\nThe 2009 Five-Year Report says nothing about any impact residential development in the\nCity’s noncoastal zone has had on the City’s public beach parking 20 years after the City\n\n\n       3       “‘“The Legislative Counsel’s Digest is printed as a preface to every bill\nconsidered by the Legislature.”’” (People v. Vega (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1374</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1382.)\nIt “‘constitutes the official summary of the legal effect of the bill and is relied upon by\nthe Legislature throughout the legislative process,’ and thus ‘is recognized as a primary\nindication of legislative intent.’” (In re M.G. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Hawley Ins. Co. v. Lopez (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

We accept Plaintiffs’ concession and examine whether the\nfindings in the 2009 Five-Year Report comply with the Act. We express no opinion on\nwhether the City actually made any findings by simply “receiv[ing] and fil[ing]” the\n2009 Five-Year Report the City’s staff prepared.\n\n\n                                            13\n\fstarted collecting the Beach Parking Impact Fee, the current condition of the City’s public\nbeach parking, the status of any of the improvements identified when the City established\nthe fee, or what the City has done in the last 20 years or future plans for public beach\nparking. As the trial court found, the report “dodges the question.”\n              The Act also required the City to make findings that (1) identified the\nsources and funds anticipated to complete financing for incomplete beach parking\nimprovements that were identified when the Beach Parking Impact Fee was established,\nand (2) designated the approximate dates when it anticipates receiving that funding.\n(§ 66001, subd. (d)(1)(C) & (D).) In an effort to make these findings, the 2009 Five-Year\nReport states, “This funding source is anticipated to be sufficient to complete the\nfinancing of identified improvements” and “Not applicable.”5 Neither of these findings\nsatisfies the Act’s requirements. The first finding is sufficient to the extent it limits the\nsources of funding for beach parking improvements to the Beach Parking Impact Fee, but\nthe finding fails to identify the amount of funding needed to complete the improvements\nand generally refers to “identified improvements” without specifying or describing those\nimprovements. The second of these findings also falls short because it fails to designate\nwhen the City anticipates receiving the additional Beach Parking Impact Fees needed to\ncomplete the financing for the incomplete beach parking improvements. The City’s\nfindings simply did not include the findings section 66001, subdivision (d)(1)(C) and (D)\nrequired.\n\n       5        The trial court concluded these two findings meant the City determined it\nhad collected sufficient funds to finance incomplete beach parking improvements\nidentified when the Beach Parking Impact Fee was imposed. Based on that conclusion,\nthe trial court ordered the City to refund the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees\nbecause the City failed to provide an approximate start date for construction of the\nimprovements within 180 days of the 2009 Five-Year Report. (§ 66001, subd. (e).) We\ndo not address this aspect of the trial court’s ruling because the City’s failure to make the\nfive-year findings is sufficient to support the judgment requiring the City to refund the\nunexpended impact fees. (§ 66001, subd. (d)(2).)\n\n\n                                              14\n\f               The City’s findings in the 2009 Five-Year Report, made 20 years after it\nestablished and began collecting the Beach Parking Impact Fee, fail to demonstrate the\nCity still needs the nearly $10 million in fees and interest it collected to address public\nbeach parking issues created by new development in the noncoastal zone. The report also\nfails to show how it will use those funds to address beach parking issues, what\nimprovements the City intends to construct with the funds, the cost of those\nimprovements, whether the City requires more money, and if so, when the City\nanticipates receiving that money. This is information the Act required, but the City failed\nto provide.6\n               The City contends its finding about the relationship between the\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees and the fee’s purpose is adequate because it\n“summarize[s] the methodology the City used in determining the ‘reasonable\nrelationship’ between the [Beach Parking Impact] Fee and the improvements to be\nconstructed with the fee.” According to the City, the Act did not require it to provide any\nfurther detail because the City “was still in the process of identifying specific beach\nparking improvement projects to be funded,” and therefore nothing of any significance\nhad changed since the City made its original findings to support establishing the fee in\n1989 and to support amending it in 1996. Not so.\n               As explained above, the five-year findings requirement imposed a duty on\nthe City to reexamine the need for the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees to finance\n\n\n       6        The City contends the trial court never found the City’s five-year findings\nwere deficient, asserting that the court solely based its judgment on the City’s purported\nfailure to identify a start date for construction within 180 days of the 2009 Five-Year\nReport because the City had collected sufficient funds to finance the projects. We\ndisagree. The trial court clearly found the City failed to make the five-year findings\nrequired by section 66001, subd. (d)(1). Moreover, we review the City’s action, not the\ntrial court’s, and we are not bound or limited by the trial court’s ruling. (SN Sands,\nsupra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 191; Cresta Bella, supra, 218 Cal.App.4th at p. 451.)\n\n\n                                              15\n\fbeach parking improvements that purportedly were required by the new development in\nthe City’s noncoastal zone. The City may not rely on findings it made 20 years earlier to\njustify the original establishment of the Beach Parking Impact Fee, or the findings it\nmade 13 years earlier to justify reducing the amount of the fee. Instead, the Act required\nthe City to make new findings demonstrating a continuing need for beach parking\nimprovements caused by the new development in the noncoastal zone. The City failed to\ndo so.\n              Similarly, the City’s claim it had not yet identified the specific\nimprovements it intended to finance with the Beach Parking Impact Fee does not make\nthe City’s finding adequate. When the City established the Beach Parking Impact Fee in\n1989 the Act required the City to identify how it would use the fee. (§ 66001,\nsubd. (a)(2).) Because that use was financing “the acquisition and/or construction of\nparking facilities at or near the beach,” the Act also required the City to identify the\nfacilities it would acquire or construct. The City could have generally identified by type\nor category the public facilities it intended to acquire or construct, but specific\nconstruction or improvement plans were not required. (Home Builders, supra,\n185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 564-565; Garrick, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 335.) Starting in\n1997, the Act also required the City to identify the public improvement that the fee would\nfinance each time the City imposed the Beach Parking Impact Fee as a condition of\napproval for a specific development project. (§ 66006, subd. (f); Stats. 1996, ch. 569\n(S.B. 1693), § 2, p. 3182.) Accordingly, in 2009, the City could not claim it did not know\nwhat projects it intended to finance with the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees and\ncontinue to retain those fees.7\n\n         7    We express no opinion on whether the City could have satisfied the Act’s\nfive-year findings requirement by claiming beach parking conditions had changed and\ntherefore the City was studying whether it could satisfy the purpose of the assessment by\nfinancing different projects. The City’s findings would have to explain that situation, but\nthe 2009 Five-Year Report provides no such explanation.\n\n\n                                              16\n\f              The City also contends the 2009 Five-Year Report’s findings about the\nsource and amount of additional funding and the approximate date on which it would\nreceive that funding complied with the Act’s requirements. According to the City, the\nAct did not require it to specify the amount of additional funding it anticipated needing or\nwhen it would receive that funding because the City “had not yet identified or prepared\ncost estimates for the specific parking improvement projects it was planning to\nconstruct.” We disagree. The Act clearly required a finding that “identif[ied] all sources\nand amounts of funding anticipated to complete financing in incomplete improvements.”\n(§ 66001, subd. (d)(1)(C).) The Act provides no exceptions or limitations on this\nrequired finding. Moreover, as explained above, the Act required the City to identify the\npublic facilities it intended to finance with the Beach Parking Impact Fee when it\noriginally established the fee in 1989. (§ 66001, subd. (a)(2).) Starting in 1997, the Act\nalso required the City to identify the public improvement it intended to finance with the\nBeach Parking Impact Fee each time it imposed the fee as a condition of approval for a\nspecific development project. (§ 66006, subd. (f); Stats. 1996, ch. 569 (S.B. 1693), § 2,\np. 3182.) Accordingly, the Act does not allow the City to identify no public improvement\nprojects it intends to finance with the Beach Parking Impact Fee 20 years after\nestablishing the fee and still retain the unexpended balance.\n\n       2.     A Refund Is the Statutorily-Mandated Remedy\n              The City contends the trial court should have remanded the matter to the\nCity to make new findings correcting the “technical deficienc[ies]” in the City’s five-year\nfindings rather than requiring the City to forfeit the unexpended impact fees that the City\nproperly had collected. The Act’s plain language prohibits this remedy.\n              Section 66001, subdivision (d)(2), unmistakably declares, “If the findings\nare not made as required by this subdivision, the local agency shall refund the moneys in\nthe account or fund.” (Italics added.) A statute’s clear and unambiguous language\n\n\n                                            17\n\fcontrols, and therefore we need not resort to extrinsic sources or rules of statutory\ninterpretation to determine the statute’s meaning.

In any event, the Act’s legislative history repeatedly\nconfirms that in passing section 66001, subdivision (d), the Legislature intended that a\nlocal agency must refund unexpended development fees if the agency failed to make the\nrequired five-year findings. (See, e.g., Legis. Counsel’s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1600\n(1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1987, ch. 927, p. 301; Legis. Counsel’s Dig., Sen. Bill\nNo. 1693 (1995-1996 Reg.

Instead, the City claims a remand is ordinarily the remedy ordered when a local\nagency applies an incorrect legal standard (see SN Sands, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at\np. 194) or fails to make “required legislative findings” (see Manufactured Home\nCommunities, Inc. v.

What may or may not be the ordinary\nremedy, however, is irrelevant when the Legislature unambiguously establishes the\nstatutory remedy for a violation of its laws.\n              Moreover, the cases on which the City relies do not apply to the current\nfacts. SN Sands does not apply here because the City did not use an incorrect legal\nstandard in making its five-year findings. The City properly identified the findings the\nAct required it to make, but simply failed to make those specific findings.\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f              Manufactured Home, Respers, Mountain Defense, and Hadley do not apply\nbecause they involve administrative mandamus proceedings under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1094.5 (section 1094.5) rather than traditional mandamus proceedings\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (section 1085). (Manufactured Home,\nsupra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 710; Respers, supra, 171 Cal.App.3d at p. 870-871;\nMountain Defense, supra, 65 Cal.App.3d at pp. 731-732; Hadley, supra, 43 Cal.App.3d\nat pp. 127-130.) In administrative mandamus proceedings, a court reviews a public\nagency’s adjudicatory decision to determine whether the evidence supports the agency’s\nfindings and whether the agency’s findings support its ultimate decision. Section 1094.5\nrequires the agency to make findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence\nand the ultimate decision. When a public agency fails to make findings to support its\ndecision, remand is an appropriate remedy because a court cannot review the agency’s\ndecision without knowing how it analyzed the evidence to reach its decision. (See, e.g.,\nHadley, at pp. 127-128.)\n              As explained above, however, judicial review under section 1085 is much\nmore limited: a court does not review the agency’s analytical route, but rather defers to\nthe agency’s decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or totally lacking in evidentiary\nsupport. (Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 561.) Section 1085 does not\nrequire an agency to make findings to support its legislative and quasi-legislative\ndecisions unless another statute specifically requires findings. (Anaheim Redevelopment\nAgency v. Dusek (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2137679\"><a href=\"/opinion/2137679/anaheim-redevelopment-agency-v-dusek/\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 261.) Here, section 66001, subdivision (d),\nrequired the City to make findings to support its quasi-legislative decision to retain the\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees, and that statute also specified the remedy for the\nCity’s failure to do so. Case law allowing a remand in a different legal context does not\npermit us to disregard that statute’s clear mandate. (See Garrick, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at\np. 328 [“‘precedents drawn from administrative mandamus proceedings should probably\nstill be applied with caution to the review of findings in a quasi-legislative context.\n\n                                              19\n\fProcedural or evidentiary requirements drawn from analogy to judicial proceedings\nwould appear peculiarly inappropriate . . .’”].)\n              The City also argues the trial court should have remanded the matter for the\nCity to correct its findings because the law abhors forfeitures and therefore requires\nstatutes imposing them to be strictly construed. (See Enfantino v. Superior Court (1984)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1113; Hernandez v. Temple (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169069\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169069/hernandez-v-temple/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290.)\nAlthough it is true forfeitures are disfavored, it does not logically follow that forfeitures\nare unenforceable. To the contrary, courts must enforce unambiguous statutory\nforfeitures and may not avoid them by rewriting the statute under the guise of statutory\nconstruction. (People v. Indiana Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">823</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829-830.) Assuming section 66001, subdivision (d)’s refund provision constitutes a\nforfeiture, the City offers no strict or other construction of the provision that would allow\nthe City to avoid refunding the unexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees based on its\nfailure to make the required five-year findings.\n              Finally, the City contends section 66001, subdivision (d)(2), does not apply\nbecause the City made findings and we simply have concluded those findings were\ninsufficient. According to the City, section 66001, subdivision (d)(2), requires a refund\nonly when a local agency fails to make any findings. Not so. Section 66001,\nsubdivision (d)(2), requires a refund when “the findings are not made as required by this\nsubdivision.” (Italics added.) For example, the subdivision required the City to\nspecifically demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended development\nfee and the purpose for which the fee was charged. As explained above, the City’s\nfindings do not identify any relationship between the unexpended Beach Parking Impact\nFees and the purpose for which the fee was charged, let alone a reasonable relationship.\nThe City therefore did not make findings “as required by this subdivision,” and the\nstatute requires the City to refund the unexpended impact fees. If we accepted the City’s\ncontention, a local agency could avoid refunding unexpended development fees by\n\n                                              20\n\fmaking any findings no matter how inadequate, and the only repercussion would be\nanother opportunity to repeat the process. That is not what the statute’s clear language\nrequires.\n\nC.     Plaintiffs’ Appeal From the Trial Court’s Judgment Lacks Merit\n              Although the trial court entered judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor and ordered\nthe City to refund the entire unexpended balance of the Beach Parking Impact Fee,\nPlaintiffs also appealed from the judgment. They argue the trial court erroneously denied\nadditional relief they sought. We find these claims unpersuasive.\n\n       1.     The Statute of Limitations Barred Plaintiffs’ Claims Regarding the\n              2004 Five-Year Report\n              Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the four-year limitations\nperiod in Code of Civil Procedure section 343 barred Plaintiffs’ challenges to the City’s\n2004 Five-Year Report. Plaintiffs, however, do not contend the trial court applied the\nwrong limitations period or miscalculated when that period expired. Instead, Plaintiffs\ncontend the trial court erred in failing to apply the equitable doctrines of estoppel and\nunjust enrichment to prevent the City from asserting the statute of limitations as a\ndefense. Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden of establishing error.\n              A party may be equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations when\nhis or her conduct induced another not to file a lawsuit within the applicable limitations\nperiod. (Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252725\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252725/doheny-park-terrace-home-owners-assn-inc-v-truck-ins-exchange/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089.) Plaintiffs, however, point to no conduct by the City during\nthe applicable limitations period that induced them not to bring an action challenging the\n2004 Five-Year Report. The only conduct by the City that Plaintiffs identify is a letter\nfrom the City’s attorney that stated the City filed the 2004 Five-Year Report in 2003, but\nthat letter was sent in 2012 — several years after the limitations period already had\nexpired.\n\n\n                                             21\n\f               Plaintiffs similarly fail to explain how applying the statute of limitations\nunjustly enriched the City. The trial court ordered the City to refund the unexpended\nBeach Parking Impact Fees based on other claims, and therefore the trial court’s\napplication of the statute of limitations does not unjustly enrich the City.\n\n       2.     The City’s Deficient Five-Year Findings Do Not Require the City to Sell\n              the Vacant Lot It Purchased With Beach Parking Impact Fees\n               Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in denying their request to compel the\nCity to sell the vacant lot it purchased adjacent to its North Beach parking lot and refund\nthe sale proceeds to the affected property owners. According to Plaintiffs, the Act\nrequired the City to use the Beach Parking Impact Fee for the designated purpose of\nacquiring and constructing public beach parking, but the City’s purchase of a vacant lot\nfailed to further the purpose of the fee because the City did nothing with the lot for\napproximately 20 years. Plaintiffs, however, fail to cite any authority that would have\nallowed the trial court to order the City to sell the lot.\n               When a local agency fails to make the required five-year findings,\nsection 66001, subdivision (d)(2), requires the agency to “refund the moneys in the\naccount or fund as provided in subdivision (e).” Section 66001, subdivision (e), provides\nthat the local agency shall refund “the unexpended portion of the fee, and any interest\naccrued thereon” to “the then current record owner or owners of the lots or units, as\nidentified on the last equalized assessment roll.” (Italics added.)\n               Here, the vacant lot the City purchased is not an “unexpended portion” of\nthe Beach Parking Impact Fee. To the contrary, the City expended a portion of the\nimpact fee to purchase the lot and Plaintiffs concede no one challenged that purchase.\nNothing in the Act or any other authority Plaintiffs have cited authorized the trial court to\norder the City to undo what was at the time a valid use of the impact fees. The City has\nnot yet constructed any public beach parking on the vacant lot, but it also has not used the\nlot for any purpose inconsistent with public beach parking.\n\n                                               22\n\f              The only limitation the Act places on the use of a development fee is the\nrequirement that the local agency use the fee “solely and exclusively for the purpose or\npurposes . . . for which the fee was collected.” (§ 66008; see § 66006, subd. (a).)\nPlaintiffs failed to show the City violated this command or that a compelled sale of the\nvacant lot is the appropriate remedy for the City’s failure to construct beach parking on\nthe lot over the past 20 years. If the City seeks to use the vacant lot in the future for a\npurpose inconsistent with the Beach Parking Impact Fee’s purpose, Plaintiffs then may\nchallenge the City’s action.\n\n       3.     The Act Did Not Prohibit the City From Charging the Administrative\n              Overhead Costs Associated With the Beach Parking Impact Fee\n              Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in refusing to order the City to return\nadministrative overhead costs it charged the account holding the impact fees. In\nPlaintiffs’ view, the City must return these administrative costs before it refunds the\nunexpended Beach Parking Impact Fees because the Act required the City to use the\nimpact fees exclusively for acquiring and constructing public beach parking, and that\npurpose does not include paying administrative overhead costs. We do not find this\nargument persuasive.\n              The Act requires a local agency to expend development fees “solely and\nexclusively for the purpose or purposes . . . for which the fee was collected” and prohibits\nan agency from levying, collecting, or imposing a development fee “for general revenue\npurposes.” (§ 66008; see § 66006, subd. (a).) The parties cite nothing in the Act or its\nhistory that guides us in determining what it means to use a fee exclusively for a specific\npurpose, and we have uncovered no authority that sheds any light on the subject.\n              Nonetheless, we conclude using a portion of a development fee to facilitate\ncompliance with the Act’s requirements constitutes a use that furthers the purpose for\nwhich the fee was collected. For example, the Act requires that a local agency establish a\nseparate account for each development fee it collects and account for the fee to ensure it\n\n                                              23\n\fis not commingled with any of the agency’s other funds. The administrative costs to\ncomply with these requirements further the purpose for which the fee was collected\nbecause those costs ensure the fee is available for the designated purpose once sufficient\nfunds are collected. Indeed, without the administrative costs of accounting for the fee,\nthe local agency would not know how much it has collected.\n              Here, the City established a cost allocation plan and began charging many\nof the programs it runs for the administrative costs associated with the programs. For\nexample, the City established a formula for charging each program for the accounting\nservices required to maintain the program’s accounts and also for any other services the\nCity’s staff provided. The City worked with an independent consultant to create its cost\nallocation plan and it annually reviews the allocations for accuracy. The City’s financial\nservices officer testified the charges made against the Beach Parking Impact Fee account\nwere allocated to pay for staff time and other costs associated with maintaining the\naccount, accounting for the funds, and other administrative expenses directly related to\nthe Beach Parking Impact Fee.\n              Plaintiffs point to nothing in the administrative record that shows the City\nused any portion of the Beach Parking Impact Fee for general revenue purposes. Indeed,\nPlaintiffs do not challenge the reasonableness or the necessity for any of the\nadministrative costs the City charged. Plaintiffs simply argue no portion of a\ndevelopment fee may be used to pay administrative costs as a matter of law. We decline\nto impose such a broad prohibition without some clear basis in the Act, and Plaintiffs\nhave pointed to none.\n              Plaintiffs contend the only administrative costs expressly permitted under\nthe Act are the costs associated with conducting the public hearing required to establish\nthe fee. (See § 66018, subd. (b).) According to Plaintiffs, the Legislature authorizing a\nlocal agency to recover those specific administrative costs prevents an agency from using\na portion of a development fee to pay any other administrative costs. Not so.\n\n                                            24\n\f              Although Plaintiffs do not cite any legal authority or identify a principle of\nstatutory interpretation to support their construction of the Act, Plaintiffs implicitly rely\non the statutory interpretation maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, “which means\n‘“the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other\nthings not expressed.”’” (In re Sabrina H. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276157\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276157/in-re-sabrina-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1411.) This\nmaxim is “a ‘mere guide’ to be utilized when a statute is ambiguous”; it “‘is no magical\nincantation, nor does it refer to an immutable rule.’” (Ibid.; see In re Christopher T.\n(1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2282203\"><a href=\"/opinion/2282203/in-re-christopher-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1290.) It “is generally applied to a specific statute [that]\ncontains a listing of items to which the statute applies” and prevents courts from implying\nadditional exceptions to a general rule when a statute specifies other exceptions.\n(Sabrina H., at p. 1411; see Christopher T., at p. 1290.) The maxim, however, “does not\napply when no reasonable inference exists that items not mentioned were excluded by\ndeliberate choice.” (Silverbrand v. County of Los Angeles (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126;\nsee Barragan v. Superior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2271939\"><a href=\"/opinion/2271939/barragan-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1484, fn. 3.)\n              Here, Plaintiffs point to nothing in the Act or its history that shows the\nLegislature intended to prohibit a local agency from using a portion of a development fee\nto pay administrative costs directly related to the fee and the agency’s compliance with\nthe Act. Section 66008’s mandate that a local agency use a development fee exclusively\nfor the purpose for which the fee was collected and Section 66018’s authorization to use\na portion of a fee to recover the cost of conducting the public hearing required to\nestablish the development fee are found in separate parts of the Act. Section 66008 is\npart of a chapter in the Government Code that solely addresses a local agency’s\nestablishment, imposition, and use of development fees (§§ 66000-66008), and\nsection 66018 is part of a separate chapter that addresses procedures for a local agency to\nadopt a variety of different types of fees and charges (§§ 66016-66019). Moreover, in\nconcluding the City may recover administrative overheard related directly to the Beach\nParking Impact Fee, we are not creating an exception to section 66008’s limitation on the\n\n                                              25\n\fuse of a development fee; rather, we merely are interpreting what the Legislature meant\nwhen it stated a fee shall be expended “solely and exclusively for the purpose or purposes\n. . . for which the fee was collected.” Accordingly, the maxim of expressio unius est\nexclusio alterius has no application here and the trial court did not err in refusing to\nrequire the City to reimburse the Beach Parking Impact Fee account for the\nadministrative overhead costs the City incurred.\n\n       4.     Plaintiffs Failed to Establish the City Improperly Commingled Beach\n              Parking Impact Fees With Other City Revenues\n              Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in finding the City did not improperly\ncommingle the Beach Parking Impact Fee funds with other City funds. Although\nPlaintiffs concede this challenge “does not affect the refund,” they nonetheless contend\nthe trial court should have ordered the City to segregate the impact fees from other City\nfunds because the Act prohibits a local agency from commingling a development fee with\nother revenues. This contention lacks merit because substantial evidence supports the\ntrial court’s finding the City did not commingle the funds.\n              Section 66006, subdivision (a), provides, “the local agency receiving the\n[development] fee shall deposit it with the other fees for the improvement in a separate\ncapital facilities account or fund in a manner to avoid any commingling of the fees with\nother revenues and funds of the local agency.” To comply with this mandate, a local\nagency must deposit a development fee “into ‘a separate capital facilities account’ to\navoid commingling with the local agency’s other revenues and funds.” (Home Builders,\nsupra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 561.)\n              The City’s financial services officer testified the Beach Parking Impact Fee\nis collected from a developer as part of a lump sum payment to cover four separate\ndevelopment fees. Upon receipt, the City places the funds into a “Public Facilities\nConstruction Fee Fund” and separates the funds into four separate accounts for each of\nthe development fees. The funds in each account are tracked separately and not\n\n                                              26\n\fcommingled. According to the financial services officer, the “Public Facilities\nConstruction Fee Fund” consolidates the four accounts for financial reporting purposes\nonly, but the accounts are maintained separately. This testimony constitutes substantial\nevidence supporting the trial court’s ruling. (See, e.g., WorldMark, The Club v.\nWyndham Resort Development Corp. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.
